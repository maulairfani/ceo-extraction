Wood is a renewable raw material that can be used for various purposes from packaging to biochemicals. Wood also binds carbon as it grows. We ensure that we always grow more forest than we harvest.\n\nWe are committed to the UN's 1.5 \u00b0 C degree climate target and to science-based measures to mitigate climate change.

We focused on securing safety, performance and progress in growth projects with good success.\n\nIn 2020, the global pandemic caused an abrupt and severe economic shock that put all societies and businesses to the test. Despite high uncertainty, our focus was clear: secure the safety of our people, the performance of our operations and the successful implementation of our two strategic growth projects in Uruguay and in Germany, both of which proceeded on schedule and on budget.\n\nThe star performers of the year, UPM Raflatac and UPM Specialty Papers, benefited from favourable market demand driven by changes in consumer behaviour, as well as growth in e-commerce and retail. Both businesses also showed good margin performance from the beginning of the year, due to consistent commercial and e/fficiency measures taken to improve profitability.\n\nIn the exceptional circumstances our performance was satisfactory. Our sales decreased by 16% and comparable EBIT by 32%. However, we succeeded in keeping our EBIT margin above 11% and our operating cash flow was strong enough to more than cover our accelerating growth investments.\n\nAt the same time, the COVID-19 containment measures taken by governments significantly decreased demand for graphic papers. Furthermore, market prices for pulp stayed at cycle low levels for most part of the year.\n\nWe took several measures to decrease fixed costs. The closures of the Chapelle and Kaipola paper mills and the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 plywood mill and streamlining in several businesses and functions were timely and necessary for the competitiveness of the business.\n\nSustainability is at the core of everything we do. During the year, we committed to the UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C and to the science-based measures to mitigate climate change. We were recognised as an industry leader in several renowned sustainability listings. We also established a Green Finance Framework and issued our first Green Bond. Our syndicated revolving credit facility is also linked to biodiversity and climate targets.\n\nI would like to sincerely thank both UPMers and our partners for making an extra e/ffort to ensure both safety and successful business during the exceptional year.\n\n## Committed to providing more sustainable choices\n\nWe are well positioned to respond to global megatrends and growing demand for renewable products. We enable our customers and consumers to make more sustainable choices. Our purpose is to create a future beyond fossils.\n\nOur spearheads for growth are clear: high-value fibre, specialty packaging materials and molecular bioproducts. We innovate climate-positive products and turn them into growing businesses. We source from sustainably managed forests and reduce our\n\nOur strategy remains unchanged: We seek sustainable growth in businesses with strong long-term market fundamentals and high barriers to entry. Performance, innovation and responsibility continue to be the cornerstones we build on. We will also ensure that our employees have the competence and drive to make our strategy come true.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemissions. We also limit risks from climate mitigation policies and the physical impacts of the changing climate to our businesses and assets. All this is important for the longterm value of the company.\n\nOur objective is earnings growth. We will maintain our high standards when it comes to return requirements for growth investments. The year 2021 will be an intensive year of construction for the pulp mill in Uruguay and for the biochemicals refinery in Germany. We have also started the basic engineering phase of a next-generation biorefinery for high-quality renewable fuels. The planned biorefinery would scale up UPM's successful biofuels business to a new level.\n\nWe believe that customers, investors and other stakeholders value responsible operations that keep risks under control and add to our business opportunities.\n\n## Financial position continues to be strong\n\nCreating shareholder value is at the core of our strategy, and we believe that this also benefits other stakeholders and society in the long term. UPM's Board of Directors is proposing an unchanged dividend of EUR 1.30 per share for 2020. The proposal reflects UPM's strong financial position and confidence in future cash generation.\n\nThe long-term outlook for our businesses is strong. UPM is well positioned to grasp the opportunities that bioeconomy o/ffers for value creation and business growth.\n\nThe global economy is expected to start recovering in 2021 from the deep downturn experienced in 2020. Demand for most UPM products is influenced by overall economic activity and therefore depends on the shape and rate of economic recovery. We will do our utmost to ensure business continuity and performance as well as secure safety and successful implementation of our growth projects.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, it is essential to address the challenges posed by climate change and resource scarcity.\n\nAs a result of population growth and other demographic changes, global consumer demand is increasing significantly. In 2020, an estimated two billion Asians were categorised as part of the middle class, and that number is set to increase to 3.5 billion by 2030.\n\nWith higher living standards and ageing populations, people are consuming more and for longer. According to the UN, 70% of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, enjoying greater access to higher income and many services from healthcare to e-commerce. Currently, 70% of global energy use and up to 85% of economic activity takes place in cities and urban areas.\n\nUnderlying these trends is the persistent increase in global emissions. In many parts of the world, water quality and soil contamination have worsened significantly. Marine litter associated with plastic pollution remains one of the most di/fficult waste and resource management challenges. Sustainable packaging and better recycling practices are part of the solution.\n\nIn recent decades, we have seen the twin pressures of growing populations and growing economies both escalating demand for energy, food and material goods, as well as the resources to produce them.

The transition to a low-carbon economy is needed to combat the physical impacts of climate change.\n\nWe were among the first global forest industry companies to sign the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C.  Our commitment is aligned with the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep the average global temperature rise at a level that does not threaten nature or society.\n\nWe were able to make this commitment thanks to our scenario analysis on forests and emissions, carried out in 2019.\n\nWhile mitigating climate change and working towards carbon neutrality, we create long term value for UPM.\n\nOur 2030 responsibility targets on page 22 Our strategy on page 26 Value from responsibility on page 34\n\nWe are committed to long-term targets and science-based measures to mitigate global warming.

The way in which we use land plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. Trees and plants capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when they grow. At the same time, carbon dioxide is stored in the soil. Thriving forests are more resilient to changes in the climate and an efficient way to mitigate climate change. That's why we are committed to climate-positive forestry and enhancing biodiversity. We are also exploring new ways to use agricultural lands in a way that creates benefits for the climate.\n\nSustainable forestry on page 86\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WE ACT THROUGH EFFICIENCY AND EMISSIONS\n\nDecreasing the use of fossil fuels is the most important way to mitigate climate change. Our target is to reduce our CO 2 emissions from fuels and purchased electricity by 65% from the 2015 levels and to reduce the emission levels of our supply chain from the 2018 levels by 30% by 2030. We have received approval for our emission reduction target from the Science Based Targets initiative. Our energy portfolio consists mostly of energy sources that do not cause fossil CO 2 emissions.

We make good use of commercial strategies, tight cost control, materials and energy efficiency, effective capital allocation and efficient use of assets. We capture opportunities provided by our operating model, while capitalising on corporate synergies.\n\n## Value-enhancing growth projects\n\nConsumer megatrends drive the demand growth for most of our products. This is further supported by the increasing need for sustainable alternatives for fossil-based materials and energy. We invest in businesses with strong long-term fundamentals for profitability and growth, where we have a clear competitive advantage. This underpins attractive returns for invested capital both in the short and longer term.\n\n## Innovating for a future beyond fossils\n\nWe enable our customers and consumers make more sustainable choices. We protect our intellectual property. Our innovations create new attractive business opportunities with high added value and a unique competitive advantage in molecular bioproducts or specialty packaging materials, for example.\n\n## Value from responsibility\n\nSustainability is an important driver for growth and competitiveness for us. We aim to capture the opportunities presented by the increasingly responsible consumer choices and tightening regulation in mitigating climate change and answering the plastics challenge, for example. Responsible operations and value chain help to mitigate risks.\n\n## Improving business portfolio\n\nIncreasing our share of sustainability-driven growth businesses with higher margins improves our long-term profitability and boosts the value of our shares. UPM's growth businesses have three times higher EBIT margins on average than the mature graphic paper business.\n\n## Industry-leading balance sheet\n\nOur industry-leading balance sheet mitigates risks and enables us to implement our growth projects also during uncertain times, such as in 2020.\n\n## Attractive dividends\n\nWe aim to pay attractive dividends. A growth in earnings enables us to pay increasing dividends in the long term. Our dividend policy is based on cash flow, targeting a dividend of 30-40% of the company's annual operating cash flow per share.\n\n## 5/uniF6BAYEAR SHARE PERFORMANCE AND VALUATION MULTIPLES\n\n|                                    | 2020    | 2019   | 2018    | 2017    | 2016   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Share price at 31 Dec, EUR         | 30.47   | 30.91  | 22.15   | 25.91   | 23.34  |\n| Comparable EPS, EUR                | 1.37    | 2.07   | 2.24    | 1.88    | 1.65   |\n| Dividend per share, EUR            | 1.30* ) | 1.30   | 1.30    | 1. 15   | 0.95   |\n| Operating cash flow per share, EUR | 1.89    | 3.46   | 2.49    | 2.74    | 3.16   |\n| Effective dividend yield, %        | 4.3     | 4.2    | 5.9     | 4.4     | 4.1    |\n| P/E ratio                          | 29.0    | 15.5   | 7.9     | 14.2    | 14.1   |\n| P/BV ratio  1)                     | 1. 74   | 1.64   | 1. 21   | 1.60    | 1. 51  |\n| EV/EBITDA ratio  2)                | 11 . 3  | 8.7    | 6.3     | 8.6     | 8.7    |\n| Market capitalisation, EUR million | 16,250  | 16,485 | 11, 813 | 13, 818 | 12,452 |\n\n- *) 2020: Board's proposal\n- 1) P/BV ratio = Share price at 31 Dec./Equity per share\n- 2) EV/EBITDA ratio = (Market capitalisation + Net debt)/EBITDA",

For each focus area, we have determined the respective targets and key performance indicators. The focus areas, as well as the targets, are reviewed annually. The review is based on our annual materiality analysis, which identifies issues that either have a significant impact on our business performance or issues that influence the assessment and decisions made by our stakeholders.\n\n## Focus on climate targets\n\nWith our targets set in early 2020, we are putting a strong focus on our contribution to climate change mitigation. We have tightened our target for fossil CO 2 emissions from our own combustion processes and from purchased electricity.  We also added a new target for indirect fossil CO /two.sup emissions, focusing on sourced materials and logistics, and have set targets for ensuring climate-positive land use and a climate-positive product portfolio in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGoal 6:\n\nClean water and sanitation (Target: 6.3)\n\nGoal 7: Affordable and clean energy (Targets: 7.2 and 7.3)\n\nGoal 8:\n\nDecent work and economic growth\n\n(Targets: 8.2, 8.5 and 8.8)\n\nGoal 12\n\n:\n\nResponsible consumption and production (Targets: 12.2, 12.4 and 12.5)\n\nGoal 13:\n\nClimate action\n\n(Target: 13.1)\n\nGoal 15:\n\nLife on land\n\n(Targets: 15.2 and 15.5)\n\nOur contribution to achieving the SDGs Our responsibility targets contribute positively to achiving the SDGs.

Our transformative growth projects progressed on budget and on schedule in 2020, with strict health and safety measures.\n\n## High-value fibre - strategic growth project in Uruguay\n\nGlobal consumer megatrends and the need to find more sustainable alternatives for fossil-based materials support demand growth for market pulp. The requirements for competitive greenfield pulp operations are di/fficult to meet and provide a lasting competitive advantage.\n\nWe are currently constructing a worldclass pulp mill in Paso de los Toros in Uruguay and a highly e/fficient pulp terminal at the Montevideo port. The project and related plantation operations and logistics solutions have been carefully designed and prepared over the past decade to ensure that the pulp operation is competitive and sustainable, and in order to mitigate risks - both during the project and during the operation of the mill.\n\nThe mill will have an annual capacity of 2.1 million tonnes of eucalyptus market pulp. The USD 2.7 billion investment will raise our pulp production capacity by more than 50%. Given the expected highly competitive cash costs and the large scale of the mill, the investment is expected to significantly contribute to our future earnings. The mill is scheduled to start up in the second half of 2022.\n\n## Uruguay growth project on page 44\n\n## Molecular bioproducts - transformative new businesses beyond fossils\n\nSignificant new business opportunities lie in decarbonising tra/ffic with renewable fuels and providing sustainable alternatives for fossil-based chemicals in consumer products. Access to sustain-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nable feedstocks, proprietary technology concepts and high-quality, high-impact products are expected to provide a lasting competitive advantage.\n\nUPM Biochemicals is preparing for a commercial scale market entry. In January 2020, we decided to invest in a next generation biochemicals refinery in Leuna, Germany. The biorefinery will have an annual capacity of 220,000 tonnes of wood-\n\nUPM Biofuels has successfully entered the market with its renewable diesel and naphtha UPM BioVerno. The biorefinery has proven its proprietary technology, product quality and sustainability, and has achieved commercial success. We are now preparing opportunities to scale up the business. In January 2021, we proceeded into the basic engineering phase of a potential larger next generation biorefinery.\n\nThe key factors the spearheads have in common are significant growth potential and UPM's competitive advantage based on deep know how and high barrier to entry.\n\nUPM is investing also in UPM Plywood and UPM Energy, while maintaining consistently strong cash flow and earnings in UPM Communication Papers.\n\nbased biochemicals, e.g. monoethylene glycol, monopropylene glycol and renewable functional fillers. The EUR 550 million investment will open a new attractive market for us and is expected to meet our ROCE target of 14% once fully ramped up and optimised. The biorefinery is scheduled to start production by the end of 2022.\n\n## UPM Biofuels on page 46\n\n## UPM Biochemicals on page 58\n\n## Speciality packaging materials focused growth projects and product innovation\n\nGlobal consumer megatrends are driving demand for appealing and functional, but at the same time sustainable and safe, labelling and packaging solutions.\n\nWe continue to grow in the speciality paper and self-adhesive label materials segments. Our focus is on expanding their\n\ncurrent production units and customer reach, and on continuously developing their product portfolio. Our strong position and innovations in these technically demanding and fast-growing niche segments of the packaging value chain provide attractive growth opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, demand for our self-adhesive label materials and speciality papers was further strengthened by growth in e-commerce and changes in consumer behaviour during the pandemic. UPM Speciality Papers' capacity expansion at the UPM Changshu mill in China at the end of 2019 was well timed. The conversion of paper machine 2 at UPM Nordland, Germany, was ramping up in 2020 and its products launched among customers. The new capacity provides further growth opportunities for 2021.\n\nUPM Raflatac on page 50\n\nUPM Specialty Papers on page 52\n\n## VALUE/uniF6BACREATION OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COMING YEARS\n\n| SPECIALTY PACKAGING MATERIALS                                                                       | HIGH/uniF6BAVALUE FIBRE                                                                                                      | MOLECULAR BIOPRODUCTS                                                                                                                                                          |                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| UPM Raflatac UPM Specialty Papers                                                                   | UPM Pulp                                                                                                                     | UPM Biofuels UPM Biochemicals                                                                                                                                                  | UPM businesses                              |\n| Demand growth driven by global consumer  megatrends                                                 | Demand growth driven by global con- sumer megatrends                                                                         | Climate commitments and replacing fossil  materials open large growing markets                                                                                                 | Strong long-term  fundamentals              |\n| Sustainable products for global consumer  demand (e.g. labelling and packaging)                     | Fibre-based products provide sustainable  solutions for global consumer demand (e.g.  tissue, hygiene, packaging, specialty) | Unique solutions to decarbonise traffic and  provide consumers with bio-based prod- ucts                                                                                       | Solutions                                   |\n| +4%                                                                                                 | +3%                                                                                                                          | Strong growth potential                                                                                                                                                        | Market growth                               |\n| Technically demanding segments, where  UPM has a leading market position, expertise  and innovation | Competitive greenfield pulp operations  have high requirements (wood supply,  location, infrastructure, capital)             | Unique value chain position with  sustainable feedstocks, the right  technology and IPR                                                                                        | Competitive  advantage                      |\n| Focused growth investment in Poland  Product portfolio development                                  | A new world-scale pulp mill in Uruguay,  capacity of 2.1 million tonnes, investment  of USD 2.7 billion                      | Basic engineering of a biorefinery; potential  investment in Finland or in the Netherlands Entering to wood-based biochemicals  business by building a biorefinery in  Germany | Current projects  or prospects  under study |\n\n## SIGNIFICANCE\n\n- \u00b7 Significant growth potential, driven by global megatrends\n- \u00b7 New large growth markets for sustainable solutions to replace fossils\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Earnings growth\n- \u00b7 Attractive returns\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Clear focus areas for growth\n- \u00b7 Well-prepared transformative projects\n- \u00b7 Clear return targets\n- \u00b7 Talent attraction",

Wood fibres, biomolecules, residues and side streams are becoming increasingly important raw materials of the future.\n\nIn 2020, UPM spent EUR 189 (121) million on research and development, making up 18.8% (6.6%) of UPM's operating cash flow. In addition to direct R&D expenditure of EUR 41 (53) million, the figure includes negative operating cash flow and capital expenditure in developing businesses, transformative growth projects and digitalisation projects.\n\nInnovation and R&D programmes are essential in the development of new products and technologies. Research and development funding is primarily being used on studying new technologies and developing businesses and processes. A global network of research centres provides support for UPM's activities in R&D, both in new and existing businesses.\n\n## Accelerating the development and scale-up of new molecular businesses\n\nMolecular bioproducts form one of UPM's three strategic focus areas for growth. Our biorefinery investment in Leuna, Germany, will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to wood-based sustainable alternatives in textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging and pharma or cosmetics products.\n\nOur new state-of-the-art R&D Biofore Base in Lappeenranta, Finland, combines research, piloting and analytics, and unites our technologies, globally accumulated\n\nWe have also successfully entered the biofuels business and built a profitable and sustainable business platform.

Potential commercial applications using various technologies are evaluated with the aim to lower CO 2 emissions. We also became a member of the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance.\n\n## Sustainable product development\n\nOur R&D activities are guided by our 2030 responsibility targets and integrate contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into product development.\n\nWe are also examining new ways to utilise sustainable fibre-based materials that are being developed for textiles, nonwovens, hygiene products and flexible packaging, for example. New solutions are developed in collaboration with our businesses, technology partners and customers by using revised ecodesign approach as part of sustainable product development concept. We see the residues and side streams as valuable raw materials and thus real business opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, we renewed our sustainable product design concept. We carried out a pilot case in the development of sustainable lignin products. In 2021, the work will continue with sustainable packaging and other business areas. Special focus on sustainable product development will be put on circularity.\n\n## Solid patent portfolio\n\nThe significance of the patents, trademarks and intellectual property rights protecting our innovations is more pronounced in our new businesses, supporting the journey from innovation to business. We have nearly 3,000 patents and patent applications, and nearly 1,400 trademarks globally.\n\nA solid patent portfolio boosts our competitive edge. Licensing of innovations and technologies provides an excellent basis for value creation with customers and technology partners.\n\n## More value from digital opportunities\n\nWe aim to significantly increase the speed and quality of decision-making, culture of data utilisation and innovation by leveraging high-quality, compliant and modern common data services. Much of what we focus on relates to building the data foundation, including common platforms, digital customer experience, digital supply chain and intelligent operations.\n\nAfter having created a rich portfolio of digital projects and initiatives, we created a solid operating model in 2020. As part of the model, data governance management oversees the strategic focus areas, data principles and related initiatives. Also in 2020, we created the Data Management O/ffice (DMO) and started to work on UPM's Digi and Data strategy to achieve more impact and business value from the digital and data-driven opportunities.\n\n## Extensive partner network\n\nOur close-knit global partner network is comprised of customers, universities, research organisations, suppliers and\n\nThe partnership with the European Joint Undertaking on Bio-Based Industries (BBI) focuses on strengthening the competitiveness of bio-based products in Europe.

A diverse and inclusive working environment empowers people. Local commitment is crucial to this.\n\nstewardship, we aim to ensure that our solutions respond to global challenges and that our product communication is reliable and transparent.\n\nThanks to our commitment to responsible business, we were recognised as a Global Compact LEAD participant once again. We were one of the only 41 global companies to receive this recognition, the only forest industry representative, and the first company from Finland.\n\n## Ambitious work towards a future beyond fossils\n\nIn January 2020, we committed to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C in a promise to pursue science-based measures to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. The initiative is a response to the rising concerns about the severe consequences of failing to stop global warming. UPM was amongst the first global forest industry companies to make this commitment.\n\nDecreasing the use of fossil fuels is the most important way to mitigate climate change. We made a systematic global review of the opportunities for reducing emissions using existing technologies in 2019. We also analysed the financial impact of each carbon action. Based on the assessment, we made a commitment to reduce our CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels and purchased electricity by 65% from the 2015 level by 2030. In 2020, we achieved a 6% reduction compared to the previous year. We also plan to reduce the emission levels of the supply chain by 30% and started a comprehensive project on Scope 3 emissions (page 91).\n\nWe make a positive impact and contribute to mitigating climate change by tangible actions. We are committed to climate-positive forestry, which is critical for the company's business. Sustainably managed forests are more resilient to changes in the climate. We will ensure that we always grow more forest than we harvest and we will work to improve our forests' growth and ability to absorb more carbon. In 2020, the five-year annual average carbon sink of UPM's own and leased forests was approximately 6.1 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalents (1.1 million tonnes in Finland, 4.9 in Uruguay and 0.1 in the US).\n\nInnovative and sustainable products that o/ffer alternatives to fossil materials are in the core of our Biofore strategy.

At the end of 2020, we started a study on climate-related substitution and the carbon storage e/ffects of our products with two research institutes, the German IFEU and the Finnish Environment institute (SYKE).\n\nAs a tangible measure we organised a series of internal climate webinars during the autumn. The aim was to increase our personnel's understanding of climate-related topics and challenge them to join in the discussion with stakeholders.\n\n## Responsibility integrated into financing\n\nConnecting our sustainability performance to our financing demonstrates the importance of responsible business practices to our long-term value creation. In 2020, UPM became one of the first companies to link the pricing mechanism of a syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) of EUR 750 million to both biodiversity and climate targets.

Many of them arise from general economic activity and global megatrends.\n\n- Risks in the report of Board of Directors on page 129\n- Sensitivity to carbon pricing is presented on page 136\n- Main earnings sensitivities are presented on page 160\n- UPM's cost structure is presented on page 161\n- Main currency exposures are presented on page 190\n\n## CYCLICAL AND COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM's current product offering competes in markets where there are competing alternatives for customers and where the shifts in supply and demand continuously influence prices. Changes in production capacity, new product development and competitor and consumer behaviour may impact the price levels for our products and cause demand fluctuations. Rapid acceleration in digitalisation and e-commerce may expedite the decline in demand for graphic papers and simultaneously increase demand for sustainable packaging products.\n\nManagement: Industry-leading balance sheet. Continuous improvement in competitiveness, resource efficiency and customer offering. Responsible operations. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Growing need for renewable and recyclable solutions creates business opportunities and drives demand growth.\n\n## GEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe rising protectionism in Europe, global trade tensions between major economies, e.g. the US and China, as well as political uncertainties in several countries continue to cause uncertainty in trade policies and economic growth, and challenge competitiveness for companies with international value chains. The testing relationships between businesses, governments and society, and the changing pandemic containment measures may continue to stress the economic and political environment and cause local challenges to our operations or influence demand for our products.\n\nManagement: Monitoring through international trade associations. Compliance. Continuous improvement in competitiveness. Disciplined planning and selection of investments. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Diverse business portfolio, geographical presence and responsible business practices may present opportunities for supply chain optimisation or strategic opportunities (incl. M&A) in an economic downturn.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy can cause policy changes and shifts in market preferences, standards and technologies, which in turn may result in changes to cost structures and change the competitiveness of products, raw materials, industries and countries. The physical impacts of climate change include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions, which can increase droughts and forest fires and cause uncertainties in business operations. Damage caused by insects and tree diseases can become increasingly common.\n\nManagement: Long-term targets and science-based measures to mitigate global warming through sustainable forestry, emissions reductions and innovating novel products.\n\nOpportunity: Transition opportunities include those driven by resource efficiency and the development of new technologies, products and services that could bring new markets, customers, sources of funding and competitive advantage for us. Longer forest growing season in northern hemisphere.\n\n## CHANGES IN POLICIES, LEGISLATION AND STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe rising social inequality and strain on our natural ecosystem have intensified the expectations for companies to deliver economic, social and environmental benefits and complement the actions being taken by governments. Changes in regulation, taxation or subsidies could have an effect on our performance, competitiveness and the costs and availability of raw materials. Environmental regulations may continue to become more stringent. As policies, legislation or stakeholder expectations, or the application of them, change, additional costs in complying with more stringent requirements may be imposed on us.\n\nManagement: Responsible operations in the value chain enhance the ability to operate and influence long-term business success, including environmental management systems, sustainable forestry and compliance.\n\nOpportunity: Creating value for society, as a company and through our renewable and responsible solutions, is an integral part of our strategy. The bioeconomy offers new opportunities for value creation and business growth.\n\nEXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROJECTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe invest in selective strategic projects to enable profitable growth. Investment projects are often large and may take several years to complete. They may also involve strategic, technical and operational risks. Our large pulp mill project in Uruguay consists of several subprojects. The biochemical refinery project in Germany involves new technology and opens new markets for us. The OL3 power plant project may impact energy costs or the fair value of our energy shareholdings. The COVID-19 pandemic and the required additional health and safety measures have added a new challenge to large investment projects.\n\nManagement: Stringent and continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Environmental, health, safety and social impact assessments and protocols. Stakeholder engagement.\n\nOpportunity: Carefully selected and implemented growth projects improve our earnings and returns, and change the positioning of the company.\n\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND INCREASING CYBERCRIME ACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in critical information system services can cause disruptions to the continuity of operations. The information systems may be exposed to a cyber-intrusion that could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, production outages or damage to reputation.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our measures for cybersecurity protection.\n\nOpportunity: Sophisticated IT systems enable efficient operations and optimised performance, as well as new customer services and data security.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEMERGING RISKS\n\n## INPUT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE MAIN RAW MATERIALS AND SERVICES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe main production inputs required in the manufacturing of our products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these inputs have been volatile in recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Governmental protection, trade protection measures, climate change, local and global environmental policies, possibly impacted by COVID-19 related governmental actions or restrictions, could continue to cause further uncertainty around the prices and availability of these inputs.\n\nManagement: Continuously improving resource efficiency and supply chain optimisation. New technologies. Long-term supply contracts and relying on alternative suppliers. Selected ownership of forest land and long-term forest management contracts.\n\nOpportunity: Circular economy and continuous improvement in resource efficiency and resilience to withstand price fluctuations offer competitive advantage.\n\n## OPERATIONAL HAZARDS, HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION\n\nOur operations are exposed to risks arising from the environment, fires, natural events, site security and occupational health and safety. A major incident at a UPM site or at a critical part of the logistics chain could cause a shutdown or curtail production. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness or liability to employees, contractors or third parties.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our management, safety, security and loss prevention programmes as well as insurance protection.\n\nOpportunity: Industry-leading environmental performance provides competitive advantage. Health and safety performance strengthens engagement, efficiency and productivity.\n\nFinancial risks include foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, challenges in refinancing, counterparty or credit risks or changes in taxes. Changes to the monetary policies of major central banks may significantly impact interest rates and consequently various currencies that directly or indirectly affect UPM. Our foreign exchange rate risk primarily relates to the US dollar, British pound sterling and Japanese yen.\n\nManagement: Continuous hedging of net currency exposure. Hedging the balance sheet.  Continuous improvement in competitiveness. Disciplined planning and selection of investments. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Diverse business portfolio and geographical presence, focus on competitiveness and strong balance sheet may present strategic opportunities in a changing currency environment.\n\nDecisive carbon removal policies may require a rapid growth in carbon removal technology solutions, but could accelerate the tendency to optimise short-term actions and lead to restrictions on wood-use.\n\nManagement and opportunity : Sustainable forest management and expansion of forested areas.\n\nA widening digital gap and unbalanced economic development can worsen societal fractures and recovery from the pandemic.\n\nManagement and opportunity : Economic activities and creating incremental value in remote areas especially related to forests.",

UPM Timber also reached a significant milestone by achieving fossil-free production of sawn timber (read more on page 90).\n\nIn the UPM Timber business, we supply industrial customers in the furniture, joinery, planning, construction and packaging sectors. Today, the construction industry is estimated to account for nearly 40% of energy-related CO 2 emissions. Replacing non-renewable raw materials in construction with responsibly produced timber is an effective solution for emission reduction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncan be easily isolated, tested and monitored without exposing the whole site.

UPM's operations in China had first-hand knowledge of managing the situation, providing a model for well-functioning practices and their implementation. Strict measures and ongoing testing will continue to ensure health and safety of construction workers and progress of the project.\n\nDuring the pandemic, dialogue with local communities has remained lively. In 2020, UPM hosted over 150 meetings and briefings with various stakeholders and more than 20 open sessions online and on several social media channels. Training for construction workers and entrepreneurs has also started successfully online.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 For timber: To enhance profitability through efficient wood supply, integrated fullproduction and focused commercial strategy.

These indicators are 1) Developing the nature conservation area network; 2) Maintaining and enhancing endemic and threatened species populations in formal conservation areas; and 3) Controlling and decreasing invasion of exotic woody species populations in conservation areas.\n\nOur plantations in Uruguay are situated on grasslands that were formerly used for cattle grazing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe do not convert natural forests into plantations. All valuable biodiversity hotspots such as wetlands,\n\nnatural forests and unique areas for protecting specific birds and other species are protected.\n\nBiological surveys have been conducted in areas owned by UPM since the early 1990s to identify and classify species and native ecosystems to be protected. Currently, the network of formal conservation areas covers around 13,000 hectares. To achieve our long-term biodiversity targets, we plan to increase protected area under defined conservation categories and continue with our long-term monitoring programme. This conservation work is being carried out in cooperation with local  environmental organisations such as Vida Silvestre and Aves Uruguay.\n\nWe are currently building a new world-class pulp mill near Paso de los Toros in central Uruguay. The USD 2.7 billion investment in a 2.1 million-tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill is a significant step for UPM's future earnings and shareholder value. We are also investing approximately USD 280 million in building pulp terminal operations in the port of Montevideo, and USD 70 million in local infrastructure. The mill is scheduled to begin production in the second half of 2022.\n\n2020 was an intense year of construction for this pulp mill project. The project proceeded successfully despite of the exceptional conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (read more on page 42).\n\n## Project highlights in 2020\n\n- \u00b7  A total of 3,000 people working on 16 related construction sites\n- \u00b7  Mill site preparations, including earth and road works, entrances and gates, o/ffice buildings and 12.5 kilometres of fences around the site\n- \u00b7  Training programmes and awareness raising projects launched in cooperation with Uruguayan organisations, institutions and authorities to strengthen local communities and support residents benefiting from increased opportunities\n- \u00b7  Civil construction including the 127metre chimney and foundations for the production buildings, such as the fibre line, cooling towers, drying plant, recovery boiler, turbines and evaporation plant\n- \u00b7  In the port of Montevideo, dredging and filling of the area was completed and construction of a pulp storage facility, tank park and steel structures for pulp loading started\n- \u00b7  Temporary and permanent housing areas for the mill construction workers in the nearby communities\n- \u00b7  Construction of a state-of-the art eucalyptus tree nursery started in Sarand\u00ed del Y\u00ed\n- \u00b7  Works related to road infrastructure improvement in central and west Uruguay\n- \u00b7  Agreements made on mill technology with Andritz and chemical supply with Kemira, alongside rail logistic services and other supplier agreements\n\n## Perfect conditions for plantations\n\nEucalyptus availability for the mill is secured through UPM's own and leased plantations, as well as through wood sourcing agreements with private partners. We continued to increase plantation areas in Uruguay in 2020, covering 434,000 hectares of UPM's own and leased plantations. They will supply the current UPM Fray Bentos mill and the new mill.\n\nPlantations are established on former grazing lands. The Forestry Act sets strict rules for plantation design and structure. This includes location, tree types and identifying suitable forestry soils for plantation development as well as safe zones around roads, native forests and waterways.\n\nConditions for growing eucalyptus are optimal in Uruguay. Eucalyptus' fast growth rate and rotation time of 10 years make it the preferred plantation tree. Eucalyptus is also one of the most e/fficient plants in the world in terms of water and nutrients needed to produce a unit of biomass.\n\nUruguay's native forests are all protected, and they typically grow on riversides and other lowlands. The country is located within a temperate climate zone so there are no rain forests in Uruguay.\n\nWith a combination of competitive wood supply, scale, best available techniques and e/fficient logistics, the mill is expected to reach a highly competitive cash cost level, approximately USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp. Furthermore, the safety and sustainability performance of the value chain is expected to be on an industry-leading level.\n\nwww.upmpulp.com, www.upmtimber.com www.upmpasodelostoros.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\n## PURSUING COLLABORATION AND DIALOGUE WITH LOCAL ORGANISATIONS\n\nWe are cooperating extensively with local and national authorities, expert organisations and NGOs to look for ways to mitigate the impacts of the pulp mill construction in Uruguay.\n\nIn order to prevent any single location being overwhelmed by the arrival of 6,000 construction workers, UPM has built permanent and temporary housing across four locations. The local areas will later benefit from the 60 permanent houses as well as the infrastructure - such as electricity and sanitation - that has been put in place to build the temporary housing.\n\nWe are also working with local authorities to improve road safety due to increased traffic. A new bus transportation service has been created for the transfer of workers to and from the construction site. Road safety talks, training and events are being organised with NGOs.\n\nConcerns over sexual exploitation, which are typically associated with large construction projects worldwide, have been raised locally. In response to this, we are funding an NGO campaign that is aimed at providing information about the harm these types of illicit activities cause and providing education on how to identify and prevent child and adolescent exploitation.\n\nThe mill is designed to fully meet strict Uruguayan environmental regulations and international standards for modern mills. UPM will invest in the improvement of local wastewater collection and treatment as well as in the improvement of the new landfill site. UPM also participates in the Rio Negro initiative, providing funding and technical support to keep the local river clean. Environmental performance of the new pulp mill will be reviewed with transparent online monitoring.",

Global demand continues to be driven by climate change mitigation targets and stricter environmental standards.\n\nIn 2020, we were exploring the opportunities to expand biofuel business with new types of technology concepts and raw materials. Potential next generation multi-feedstock biorefinery would produce 500,000 t/a of renewable fuels including sustainable jet fuel. The products would significantly reduce carbon footprint in the road transport and aviation, as well as replace fossil raw materials with renewable alternatives in chemicals and bioplastics.\n\nmaterials that do not compete with food production have also been tested. We have also been developing a new climate-positive feedstock concept by cultivating brassica carinata as a sequential crop in Uruguay. The carinata crop produces non-edible oil that is suitable for use as feedstock for biofuels.\n\nWe took next steps of the potential biorefinery in January 2021 and started a detailed basic engineering phase and site option assessment primarily in two locations: Kotka, Finland and Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nTowards a future beyond fossils on page 16\n\n- www.upmbiofuels.com\n\nThe potential new biorefinery would utilise sustainable feedstocks based on wood and other climate-positive feedstocks.

Hydropower is valuable in securing balance for an increasingly volatile market, whereas nuclear power can provide a reliable baseload capacity for the system.\n\nWe have a unique position on the market, thanks to our considerable experience in industrial electricity consumption and producer of low-emission electricity.\n\nThe electricity generated is sold to Nord Pool, the Nordic power market. UPM Energy directly trades physical electricity and its derivatives. We also provide industrial electricity consumption and flexibility services to industrial consumers and other energy companies.\n\n## CASE\n\n## HYDROPOWER GENERATES FLEXIBLE POWER\n\nUPM has 8 hydropower plants and owns significant shares of other energy companies' plants. We are gradually renovating and modernising the Kuusankoski hydropower plant. The project will be completed by the end of 2022.\n\nTechnology has improved so that modern turbines and generator units generate significantly more power from the same amount of water. The average energy production volume is estimated to increase by more than 8% from the current annual volume of 180 GWh to around 195 GWh. This is roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity used by 800 electrically heated single-family houses in a year.\n\n## Focus on hydropower generation\n\nUPM Energy's hydropower generation levels in 2020 were good.  During the year, the hydrological balance in Finland was good, due to warm and rainy weather. The annual generation of nuclear power was at a normal level.\n\nIn July, UPM Energy sold its share in Kainuun Voima to Kajaanin Energiatuotanto, owned by the city of Kajaani in Finland. Due to the sale, UPM Energy's zero-carbon production capacity rose from 90% to 93% of the total capacity.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to take significant measures in order to prevent transmission of the disease and secure the continuity of our operations. The main aim of these measures was to secure that the hydropower plants were under 24-hour surveillance and control.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to improved efficiency, modern hydropower technologies are also better for the environment. Hydropower plants respond to the increasing need for renewable energy. Hydro-\n\n## Growth in CO 2 -emission-free electricity generation\n\nUPM Energy is investing in power generation that is free of CO 2 emissions. The largest ongoing project is the construction of Teollisuuden Voima's (TVO) Olkiluoto 3 EPR nuclear power plant unit. According to the updated schedule, regular electricity production at the plant will commence in February 2022. UPM's share of the capacity of the plant unit is approximately 500 MW through Pohjolan Voima.\n\nMarket-based solutions drive change in the energy market and new electricity transmission lines help form a closer connection between Nordic electricity markets\n\nUPM Energy is carrying out a renovation and modernisation of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant (on the left). The project will be completed in 2022.\n\npower is the only renewable energy source used to balance the variations in demand for electricity that is easy to adjust and store.\n\nHydropower offers a more sustainable option as a source of balancing power as companies abandon coal-fired condensing power plants. Hydropower plant production can be started, adjusted and stopped quickly and used to balance production and consumption. Hydropower is also a cost-effective way to produce electricity. The plants have a long service life with low operating costs.\n\n## OUR DIRECTION\n\n- \u00b7Profitable growth in zero-carbon electricity generation\n- \u00b7Solutions for industrial energy excellence\n- \u00b7Embracing the decarbonisation of society\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7Competitive, zero-carbon electricity generation asset portfolio\n- \u00b7Strong track record in physical and financial electricity markets\n- \u00b7World-class expertise in the optimisation of industrial energy consumption\n\n| KEY FIGURES                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Sales, EURm                      | 379    | 417    |\n| Comparable EBIT, EURm            | 171    | 185    |\n| Capital employed (average), EURm | 2,313  | 2,454  |\n| Comparable ROCE, %               | 7. 4   | 7.5    |\n| Personnel on 31 Dec.             | 70     | 68     |\n\nComparable EBIT decreased due to lower electricity sales prices.

Time to market is often around 10 to 20 years with very high risk of failure throughout all development stages. High throughput screening is a way to prove drug candidates automatically on cell models and decide, which drugs are moving to the more expensive clinical stages. UPM's GrowDex and GrowDase have been successfully used in HTS to develop new cancer treatments. The gel makes the results interpretation unequivocal thanks to the reproducibility of the gel composition.\n\nhigh-quality nanocellulose, extracted from birch.\n\nIn the clinical field , FibDex\u00ae wound dressing took the significant step of being introduced to market, when a medical device distributor Steripolar Oy started to sell the product to Finnish healthcare professionals and hospitals.\n\nIn the long term, we are aiming for personalised medicine, where treatments are developed from patient's own cells. Our gels can be used in manufacturing and in treatments. The key enabling factor is the fact that our gels are animal-free and therefore also do not introduce animal DNA to the patients. Meanwhile, we sell our products to two application areas: clinical and life science.\n\nBased on clinical investigation results, FibDex was granted the CE mark in 2019, allowing the marketing and sale of the wound dressing in the EU. Work towards registration with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is ongoing.\n\nIn life science , our main products are GrowDex\u00ae, a range of hydrogels for 3D\n\n## NEW BIOCOMPOSITES PRODUCTS LAUNCHED\n\nUPM Biocomposites is the frontrunner in circular bioeconomy. Over 50% of the raw materials originates from recycled and renewable sources.\n\nUPM Biocomposites o/ffers innovative and sustainable composite materials for various uses in outdoor construction and consumer products. The materials are based on UPM's own research and development.\n\nIn 2020, our focus was on developing internal e/fficiency and digitalisation, as well as data-based forecasting models. The launch of UPM ProFi Piazza was a commercial success. We also joined the EU Circular Plastics Alliance to boost the use of recycled plastics in consumer goods and, in our case, in UPM ProFi products.\n\nUPM Formi composite material, made from wood-based fibres and polymers, is suitable for di/fferent types of industrial and consumer products such as furniture and home appliances. The material has a 30-60% lower carbon footprint than fossil-based materials. It complies with the requirements set by the EU for reinforced plastics in relation to the circular economy.\n\nDevelopment of the UPM Formi 3D biocomposite continued in 2020. The focus was on developing technology around largescale industrial 3D printing.\n\nThe new UPM Formi EcoAce product range is based almost entirely on renewable resources.  It contains certified wood or cellulose fibres as well as bioplastics made of wood-based feedstock from UPM Biofuels' production. Production is ISCC PLUS certified, which guarantees that the product meets environmental and social standards along the supply chain.\n\nwww.upmprofi.com, www.upmformi.com\n\n## CASE\n\n## A NEW MATERIAL FOR REPLACING FOSSIL/uniF6BABASED PLASTICS\n\nConsumers can now make responsible choices in their everyday life with the launch of the MySoda sparkling water maker. MySoda is a good example of customer cooperation in the development of the new product. Designed by Arni Aromaa from Pentagon Design and manufactured by a Finnish company MySoda, the end result is a sustainable consumer product with an appealing unique design and lower carbon footprint. New MySoda sparkling water makers are being sold in several European countries.\n\nOne of our most recent innovations for replacing fossil-based raw materials is used in MySoda.

In addition to the existing GrowDex product family on the market, we launched GrowInk\u2122, new biocompatible ready-to-use hydrogels for 3D bioprinting of cells in 2020.\n\nWe work with global partners to develop new biomedical products and applications. In 2020, we joined a new cancer immunotherapy focused research and innovation project, Cancer IO. The project will have a significant impact on clinical cancer research, healthcare systems, business and, most importantly, on the lives of cancer patients. The collaboration integrates immuno-oncology (IO) activities with universities, university hospitals, cancer patient organisations and major pharmaceutical companies.\n\nInnovating for the future on page 32 www.upmbiomedicals.com\n\nUPM ProFi biocomposite utilises the cellulose fibres and plastic polymers generated as manufacturing surplus from self-adhesive label material production and from label customers' label waste. The label waste is collected from UPM Raflatac's 150 customers and partners from several European countries. Our target is to further increase the use of recycled materials in products.

The market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 6.5% to nearly USD 5 trillion in 2027. For consumers, easy-to-use, efficiency, flexibility and sustainability are becoming a priority. The plastic challenge and carbon footprint would be decreased if packaging materials were efficiently recycled and more renewable materials were used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Fortune Business Insights",

Active and open dialogue with our stakeholders provides valuable input for our development efforts.\n\nThe impact of UPM's operations extends from the local level to wider society. We aim to provide a fact-based, balanced view of the economic, environmental and social aspects of our business activities.\n\n## Continuous dialogue with stakeholders\n\nOur goal is to provide our stakeholders with a clear picture of what our future course is, how we implement our Biofore strategy and how we create long-term value for our stakeholders. We disclose relevant and accurate information in accordance with market regulations. In 2020, we arranged a Capital Markets Day, participated in industry conferences and met widely with international investors.

We decided to help the communities where we operate and acquired half a million masks to be given out to local operators. Each site could choose the recipient of the support.\n\nAltogether 35 sites in nine countries gave out face masks to 65 recipients. Masks were given to hospitals, health centres, schools and homes for the elderly. Masks were also delivered to daycare centres, services for the disabled and other social care operators.\n\ncial success, stability, good governance, future outlook and growth were key themes discussed.\n\nEvery year, we conduct a materiality analysis that highlights the most important responsibility issues for us and our stakeholders. The analysis is based on several surveys, customer enquiries and feedback from an open web-based tool.\n\nStakeholder mapping, active dialogue and the systematic gathering of feedback play an essential role in our stakeholder-relations work. We analyse the feedback carefully to understand the expectations of our stakeholders. Then, we take these expectations into consideration during our development work and decision-making. We received 350 enquiries or concerns from general public in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also gave 40,000 face masks Finnish universities to be used in classes. We wanted to support students and to enable them to continue with face-to-face learning in these exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Green recovery high on the policy agenda\n\nThrough public a/ffairs work, we aim to foster the necessary prerequisites for our operations, particularly in Finland, Uruguay, Germany and China. Active influencing at the EU-level is also important. We co-operate with a number of trade associations, the most important being the Finnish Forest Industries Federation (FFIF) and the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI). As we enter new businesses, we also need to find new ways and forums for cooperation. For example, UPM is a founding member of Leaders of Sustainable Biofuels (LSB) in the EU and also a new member in the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC).\n\nFor decision-makers and politicians, 2020 was challenging because of the\n\nPurchasing the masks was an apt decision for the Biofore Share and Care programme, as its overall aim is to support local communities and their vitality.\n\nA good example of voluntary work was the expertise support, which our Sourcing function offered pro bono to National Emergency Supply Agency in Finland to help them acquire face masks from China. We identified the mask suppliers, audited them, organised a tender and negotiated terms of delivery. The Agency themselves then signed the purchase agreements with the suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns. Despite the need to prioritise measures related to the global pandemic, there was significant progress in several policy fields with impacts for UPM. We were active in discussions on the Finnish operating environment and the focus areas of the government. We emphasised competitiveness, predictability, innovations and climate change solutions (read more on page 68).\n\nThe EU Commission launched a comprehensive Green Deal initiative, which includes a proposal for more ambitious climate and environment policies. The Green Deal includes a variety of new legislative proposals that will be rolled out over the next few years.\n\nClimate change mitigation and our commitment to the UN's 1.5-degree agenda garnered a lot of interest among our stakeholders (page 16). Discussions were carried out with environmental organisations, certification bodies, authorities and decision-makers. The climate impact of forests is linked to policies on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). We have highlighted the importance of sustainable forest management and manufacturing products from renewable raw materials that replace fossils as e/ffective ways to mitigate climate change.\n\nWe actively promote the cost-competitive and consistent implementation of climate change policies. The EU Emission Trading Scheme's third trading period\n\nended in 2020, and we have been engaged in the EU preparations for the new trading period starting in 2021. While the mechanism is still limited to covering only activities within the EU, so-called 'carbon leakage' measures must be put in place to ensure both e/fficiency in mitigating emissions and the competitiveness of industrial players in global competition.\n\nDecarbonising tra/ffic through renewable energy and biofuels policies continued. For us, it is very important to get recognition for advanced and residue-based biofuels with high GHG reduction.\n\n## World-class commitment to corporate responsibility\n\nIn November, UPM was listed as the forest and paper industry leader in the Dow Jones European and World Sustainability Indices for 2020-2021. In September, the UN recognised UPM as the only forest industry representative and also the only Finnish company among the 41 LEAD participants. UPM continued active participation in the UN Global Compact initiatives. UPM also chaired the Global Compact Finland Network, bringing together all Finnish companies and organisations committed to the Global Compact.\n\nWe continued our cooperation with different stakeholders on responsibility issues on a voluntary basis, addressing themes such as ecolabels, fish migration and nature conservation. We became an international stakeholder member of PEFC (the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification), reflecting our aim to promote sustainable forest management globally. As a member of both PEFC and FSC\u00ae (Forest Stewardship Council), we engaged in active dialogue on updates to forest management standards in both schemes. We also continued our cooperation with WWF Finland and Birdlife Finland. Responsibility issues were also raised in customer enquiries, with product safety, forest certification and the origin of wood as key themes. Globally, we continued active cooperation with local\n\n## SIGNIFICANCE\n\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder engagement provides predictability and a competitive advantage\n- \u00b7 Continuous dialogue improves understanding of key risks, challenges and opportunities in the operating environment\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 We aim to understand stakeholders' needs for information and expectations for UPM, and aim to consider them in strategic development and decision-making processes\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 We engage in active dialogue with our stakeholders to discuss our operations and targets\n- \u00b7 The UPM Code of Conduct sets the standards for responsible behaviour and collaboration\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder engagement is measured by several indicators\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder relations are co-ordinated globally at Group level, while businesses are responsible for continuous dialogue with customers and business partners, as well as the local communities",

Therefore, it is important to continuously engage in dialogue with our stakeholders and discuss about our plans and hear thoughts and concerns.\n\nIn 2020, we announced several measures to ensure our competitiveness. The rationale for the decisions and the concern for the development of the business environment were brought up in many discussion forums and through the media in Finland. Our aim is to draw attention to the external factors affecting companies' investments and the opportunities to develop a long-term industrial policy.\n\nWe have engaged in continuous dialogue with our stakeholders about topics such as competitiveness, taxation, regulations and labour market issues. Other important forums for discussion include local forest industry trade associations. Whether it be Finland, Uruguay, Germany or the UK, we want to be part of societal discussion as part of our corporate responsibility.\n\n## OUR MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS\n\nOur Biofore strategy forms the foundation of our/uni00A0stakeholder dialogue. The key focus areas and/uni00A0activities vary locally and according to stake holder needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npermit authorities. In 2020, we collaborated with di/fferent parties to integrate our responsibility targets into the company's long-term financing and published a new Green Finance Framework, rated with the highest-grade, CICERO Dark Green.\n\n## Emphasis on local communities and impacts\n\nOur mills in Europe, China and Uruguay can be among the biggest employers and taxpayers in the locations where they operate. In Uruguay, we have been building a second pulp mill since 2019. Stakeholder engagement around the project has been active (page 45). All in all, we aim for engagement and open dialogue with local communities. For example, our Kymi and Kaukas mills have their own forums for local dialogue. We co-operate with local schools and education networks, organising virtual events, for example. In addition, it is crucial for us to have active dialogue with local forest owners, neighbours of harvesting sites and other individuals involved in forest management. Our EMAS (EU Eco-Management and\n\nAudit Scheme) statements cover societal\n\nimpacts in addition to environmental performance, providing more detailed information on the local impacts of our pulp and paper mills. The EMAS statements also include information on co-operation with local stakeholders, such as sponsorship of local organisations or co-operation with educational institutions. These mill-specific statements complement UPM's corporate responsibility reporting. They are compiled annually and published on the UPM website.\n\n## Biofore Share and Care programme continues\n\nUPM's Biofore Share and Care programme demonstrates our dedication to responsibility through sponsorships, donations and employee voluntary work. We share our resources with causes that respect sustainable development and work in line with our purpose and values. In 2020, we directed support to our focus areas: reading and learning, responsible water initiatives, bio-innovations and community engagement. UPM does not financially support political parties or individual candidates.\n\nThe rules for sponsorships, donations and employee volunteering were also updated in 2020.\n\nEmployee volunteering emphasises local commitment and impact. UPM's employees can spend up to eight hours per year on local volunteering work during their working hours. In 2020, volunteering took also virtual forms. For example, UPMers participated in several reading\n\nand learning projects in different countries. In addition, UPM spent approximately EUR 1.3 million (1.2 million) on local sponsorships and other contributions aiming to support the vitality of UPM's production locations. The figure includes support for the Uruguayan UPM Foundation which continued with a contribution of USD 465,000 (USD 400,000). The foundation supports and encourages training,\n\nentrepreneurship, employment, healthy living and entertainment in local communities in the Uruguayan countryside. EUR/uni00A0499,500 (474,000) was donated to charities or other non-profit causes such as the Children and Youth Foundation, Finnish Forest Association, China Green Foundation, Baltic Sea Action Group and the education initiative Polku of the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4.\n\n## UPM'S MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 2020\n\nThe materiality analysis of UPM's responsibility issues covers topics that directly or indirectly influence the ability to create, maintain or acquire economic, environmental or social value for UPM, its stakeholders and society.\n\nAnalysis is carried out annually, based on a follow-up of the interests and concerns of various stakeholder groups, including communities, employees, NGOs, customers, suppliers, government and regulators, investors, researchers and media.\n\nAll customer questions and stakeholder concerns received during the year are taken into consideration. We also conduct specific stakeholder surveys\n\nregularly. A web-based tool enables stakeholders to answer anonymously. The surveys can also be targeted to specific stakeholder groups and topics. The most recent survey was carried out in 2019.\n\nResults of the survey are gathered and analysed by an independent third party and used to support UPM's wider evaluation. Most material economic, environmental and social responsibility topics identified in the analysis are presented below. UPM's responsibility focus areas and targets (pages 22-23) reflect these material aspects. We do not distinguish between topics within the section and consider them all equally material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHIGH",

Our culture of Aiming Higher encourages all UPMers to develop, as individuals and as a company. Our valuesTrust and be trusted, Achieve together and Renew with courageguide us along the way.\n\nBuilding a culture of Aiming Higher is essential to our success in today's rapidly changing world. While it sets our tone, our values remain the foundation of who we are. We are accountable and performance driven. In the future, we want to focus more on innovation, cooperation across boundaries and becoming more outward-looking and agile.\n\nOur aim is to increase employee motivation to drive performance. We also want to better di/fferentiate and reward high performance. Our Enabling Performance approach encompasses frequent and forward-looking manager-employee discussions, agile goal setting and regular feedback from relevant stakeholders. The results have been good and according to the annual UPM Employee\n\nEngagement Survey (EES), all these aspects have improved from the previous year.\n\n## Engaging employees\n\nWe are committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations. We o/ffer various forums to facilitate continuous dialogue between employees and business management, and there are new communication tools and channels that ease and enhance dialogue within and across teams.\n\nOur co-operative body, the UPM European Forum, focuses on issues related to our business environment and changes within the company.

The annual UPM Employee Engagement Survey (EES) invites all employees across the company to evaluate distinct aspects of their working environment every year. The high participation rate of 83% (84%) indicates that UPMers are keen to improve their workplace. The survey shows that employee engagement has improved from 55% in 2010 to 71% in 2020.\n\n## Encouraging learning\n\nIn a changing and increasingly complex business environment, enhancing employees' capabilities and wellbeing is important for both business success and sustained employability. Our long-term goal is to ensure high performance and continuous professional development. We are determined to be a responsible and attractive employer now and in the future.\n\nUPM applies the 70-20-10 learning and development framework: 70% of the learning takes place on the job, 20% comes from sharing with and learning from colleagues, and 10% comes from o/ff-the-job training. Digitalisation is enriching our ways and\n\nWe invest in the growth of our people and expect development from individuals.

As the global pandemic has changed our ways of working, we have introduced new e-learning content and programmes. These materials provide support to leaders in managing their teams remotely and encourage individuals to strengthen their self-leadership skills and resilience. Launched in 2017, our learning platform enables employees to share digital learning content flexibly. Additional e-learning content is o/ffered to develop commercial and financial skills, compliance, safety and leadership, for example.\n\n## Developing employee experience and enabling renewal\n\nOur apprenticeship programmes are ways to ensure the required level of expertise for future employees. The programmes are typically targeted at shop-floor positions in production or maintenance. We carry out the programmes with regional vocational schools. In Finland and Germany, approximately 100 people join the programmes annually. Most of the graduate apprentices have continued to work at UPM.\n\nDeveloping UPM employee experience is an integral aspect in developing UPM as a workplace. We use a design-thinking approach and enable employees to contribute to projects.  We created a smooth and engaging onboarding experience for people joining UPM and fixed targets for UPM career experience in 2020.\n\nBeing the employer of choice has become crucial when recruiting new employees and especially younger professionals. We have organised several successful graduate programmes in recent years. We have extended our employer brand to new areas with growth initiatives.\n\nFollowing our systematic employer branding work, our position among students and professionals was recognised by external parties in Finland and China.\n\n## Leading by example\n\nAchieving our ambitious targets requires the committed input of skilled people and teams, empowered by inspiring leaders.\n\nWe continuously invest in developing leadership capabilities and management teams.

Dealing with complexity, improving coaching capabilities and promoting inspiring leadership have been the key areas of development in recent years. This year, additions to these areas include strengthening resilience and self-leadership.\n\nIn 2020, leadership development focused on front-line and middle managers, as they lead most of our employees. We continued to foster a growth mindset and improve the skills needed to enable performance, such as conversation and feedback skills. By the end of 2020, approximately one third of UPM managers had completed the programme on achieving quality conversation skills and improved feedback.\n\n## CASE\n\n## A SURVEY FOUND OUT THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF TRUCK DRIVERS\n\nWe asked truck drivers about their working conditions at the UPM Schongau paper mill in Germany. The voluntary survey was available in nine languages and was presented to all truck drivers arriving at the site over the course of a single day.\n\nThe aim of the survey was to paint a concrete picture of the drivers' routine work process.

In addition to building a culture of Aiming Higher, we are committed to developing local conditions that ensure an inclusive and diverse working environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nquarters of respondents said they maintain a working week of under 49 hours.\n\nTo further develop inclusive leadership and culture, we started a dialogue with management teams in 2019, and this work continued in 2020. Nearly 1,200 people participated in the dialogue by the end of 2020.\n\nWe regularly review our diversity status. Our management teams regularly conduct self-assessments that include diversity and inclusion. We welcome the talent of people with di/fferent competencies, backgrounds and experiences, as well as genders, ages and nationalities. This contributes to a richness of views, thereby improving decision-making and business success. Inclusive behaviours are integrated into UPM leadership development programmes and emphasised in UPM Code of Conduct training.\n\n## Rewarding and recognising high performance\n\nUPM rewards and recognises high performance. Our approach to total rewarding and recognition consists of both tangible and intangible components. Tangible remuneration and recognition consists of base salary, benefits and incentives, which are determined by UPM's global rules, local legislation, general agreements, local market practices, the level of the position and individual performance. Gender, age, ethnic origin and nationality play no role in determining salaries and wages.\n\nIntangible remuneration and recognition consists of, for instance, a safe and healthy working environment, interesting\n\nWorking hours aren't really a concern for drivers, as the regulations regarding working hours are followed and monitored scrupulously. The most pressing concerns turned out to be road safety, long waiting times in loading and delivery and the crowdedness of lay-bys or motorway parking areas.\n\nIt is important that the workers in our logistics chain are content and do their work in good and safe conditions. With the survey, we can hear about it from the workers themselves. Similar surveys will be conducted when the COVID-19 situation improves.\n\nand meaningful work and good leadership and career opportunities. UPM has designed its reward policy to increase employee commitment to and motivation for high performance.\n\nThe annual incentives paid in 2020 for the 2019 STI plan were EUR 51 million and the estimated amount of annual incentives for the 2020 STI plan is EUR 56 million. We recognise significant individual or team success with a separate Achievement Award system. It is designed to support UPM's high-performance culture and recognise individuals and teams for outstanding contribution, significant achievements and exceptional performance.\n\nEach employee belongs to a unified annual Short-Term Incentive (STI) scheme. The STI scheme covers group and business-level targets, personal and team performance targets and individual performance evaluation, to di/fferentiate and reward high performance.\n\nIn addition to the Short-Term Incentive scheme, UPM provides two long-term incentive plans: Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees. Launched annually, the plans cover approximately 400 employees.\n\n## Restructuring to ensure cost competitiveness\n\nThe uncertainty in UPM's market environment continued in 2020. The weakened economic outlook led to restructuring.\n\n## CASE\n\n## PROMOTING LIVING WAGE THROUGH COLLABORATION\n\nSalaries and wages are considered as one of the most important aspects of decent work, and the concept of a living wage underpins several SDGs. Today, living wage as a concept is not yet universally defined and the approach for its calculation varies.\n\nHowever, the concept is based on the general notion that work should provide an employee with a decent standard of living, according to local standards.

Implemented in cooperation with the local authorities and partners, the programme includes active measures that promote employment and retraining. We implemented several voluntary measures in addition to our statutory obligations, including training, a business start-up allowance or support for temporary housing.\n\n| UPM PERSONNEL IN FIGURES            | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Turnover, %                         | 10.4   | 9.2    | 8.9    |\n| Turnover, % (voluntary)             | 3.5    | 4.0    | 4.1    |\n| Average age of personnel            | 44.6   | 44.3   | 44.0   |\n| People development                  |        |        |        |\n| Average training hours/employee     | 7      | 12     | 12     |\n| OHS figures, UPM workforce          |        |        |        |\n| Lost-time accident frequency        | 2.8    | 2.9    | 2.7    |\n| Total recordable injury frequency   | 5.3    | 7.1    | 6.9    |\n| Absenteeism, %  1)                  | 3.9    | 4.0    | 3.9    |\n| Number of occupational diseases  1) | 1      | 6      | 6      |\n| OHS figures, contractors            |        |        |        |\n| Lost-time accident frequency        | 4.7    | 4.2    | 3.3    |\n| Total recordable injury frequency   | 7.7    | 6.2    | 5.8    |\n\n1) Reflects own employees\n\naccounted for a living wage are food, water, housing, education, health care, transportation, clothing and other essential needs, such as provision for unexpected events.\n\nWe are part of the UN Global Compact working group for promoting living wage within companies.

Our commitment to fair compensation is also stated in our Code of Conduct and further specified in our respective policies and rules on compensation and benefits.\n\nIn 2019, we initiated an internal global process to review the salaries and wages of all employees against local living wage benchmarks in all 46 countries in which we operate. The analysis shows that all our employees' salaries and wages are considered to be above the local threshold. This work and analysis will continue to ensure that we have identified the best available benchmarks and to develop the assessment further.",

Our safety results improved significantly from the previous year thanks to our e/fforts towards continuous improvement and long-term safety work.\n\nIn 2020, UPM's lost-time accident frequency (LTAF: the number of lost-time work accidents per one million hours of\n\nwork) was 2.8 (2.9). The total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) was 5.3 (7.1). The TRIF includes LTA cases, as well as cases of modified duties and accidents requiring medical treatment. The frequency of accidents involving UPM's contractors was 4.7 (LTAF) and 7.7 (TRIF) in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, a total of\n\n## 47,000\n\nsafety-related near-miss and safety observation reports\n\n## 31,000\n\nsafety walks and discussions\n\nOur commitment to safety is strong and we aim to have zero accidents. We\n\nrecognise exemplary safety performance with company-wide safety awards. UPM Kaukas pulp mill in Finland received the UPM Safety Award for continuous improvement in 2020.\n\nWe worked with the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety certification and implemented it using UPM-wide change management process. The improved safety audits were conducted remotely as a result of the pandemic.\n\nOur safety work is based on long-term planning, e/ffective safety communications and leadership. Safety is integrated in all our new and ongoing projects, and proactive safety is well-integrated in project plans and site practices. For us, good quality means thorough investigation and e/ffective risk management, and this has played an important role in making our operations safe. We have utilised cross-learning to improve safety in our units: Sharing safety observations and best practice on safety have allowed us to learn from each other and improve safety in our units.\n\nIn 2020, we continued to o/ffer various e-learning content to our employees. Training topics include safety induction, lifesaving standards, auditing and tra/ffic safety, and more. Visitors and contractors need to take safety training when visiting any UPM unit for the first time. A new e-learning course in 2020 covered also the new coronavirus and how to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n## CASE\n\n## FROM THE IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS TO PRACTICAL MEASURES\n\nFast response and enabling safety culture have helped us continue operations during the coronavirus pandemic. Our experience in risk management, continuous safety work and experience in sharing best practices effectively turned into practical measures.\n\nOur key principle has been to ensure our employees stay healthy. In addition, we have made every effort to ensure safe working environment and the continuity of our business.\n\n## Persistent prevention during the pandemic\n\nDuring these exceptional times we have had a strong focus on combatting coronavirus. Our actions to ensure business continuity are based on long-term, continuous risk assessments. We have addressed both local and global co-ordination, and our company-wide coronavirus response team has developed global guidelines to be implemented in our businesses and sites.\n\n## Total recordable injury frequency (TRIF)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTRIF below 2 for UPM workforce and contractors (continuous)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.2\n\nachieved for 'Total injuries per one million hours worked'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur global safety network was implementing measures at all our sites in line with instructions\n\nRapid actions and preventive measures have helped us to guarantee a safe working environment for our employees.\n\nWe have supported our employees' wellbeing with a variety of health and safety measures globally, including support and tools for remote working.

Each unit applied the guidelines to best meet their needs. Practical safety measures have included the use of protective equipment, increased cleaning and various special arrangements to avoid the close contact of people. In production, we have divided people into teams, so that the same employees work the same shifts and are transported to sites together.",

Our Code of Conduct and our values help us make the right choices and guide our work in a changing business environment. This lays the foundations for long-term success.\n\nWe strive to ensure compliance with our values and commitments by implementing a company-wide compliance programme through our compliance system.\n\nThe compliance system is embedded in our governance model and is designed to bolster company performance and a culture of integrity at all levels. We follow how this culture is developing with the help of the Integrity Index, which is an average calculated on the basis of favourable responses to integrity-related questions in our annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES). These questions are:\n\n- 1.  I understand the UPM Code of Conduct and ethical standards.\n- 3. UPM operates in an ethical manner and in accordance with the UPM Code of Conduct.\n- 2. If I had to report unethical behaviour or misconduct, I am confident that it would be handled e/ffectively by UPM.\n\nOur integrity index figure in 2020 was 87% (86%).\n\nOur compliance system places emphasis primarily on preventive actions, which are drawn from the annual risk management cycle and risk assessments conducted for all businesses and operations. Our compliance system and actions within this system are demonstrated in the illustration below.\n\n## UPM COMPLIANCE SYSTEM\n\n## Company performance\n\nCorporate reputation, financial performance, operational excellence\n\nRisk assessment Policies and procedures Preventive controls\n\nInvestigation and resolution\n\nRemediation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Culture of integrity\n\nCommunication Training Proactive advice\n\nAuditing, monitoring and surveys Notification/ reporting channels\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nWith the support of our compliance team, each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing compliance risks related to its own operations. The results of annual risk assessments and discussions are used to guide compliance activities and mitigation actions. Risk assessments and mitigation actions are updated throughout the year so as to respond to changes in the risk environment. The progress of mitigation actions is reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and businesses on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Policies and procedures\n\nUpdating our Code of Conduct and certain other focal corporate policies, such as Supplier and Third-Party Code, Anti-Corruption Rules and Confidentiality Rules in 2019, meant that 2020 was a year of renewed training and communication.\n\n## Training and communication\n\nTo complement the Code of Conduct e-learning launched in 2019, in 2020 we launched renewed Anti-Corruption, Confidentiality and Competition law e-learning and made some updates to our Insider policy e-learning. We also introduced a completely new Supplier and Third-Party Code e-learning for our employees.\n\n## Code of Conduct training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n100% coverage of participation in UPM Code of Conduct training (continuous)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n99%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof active employees completed the UPM Code/uni00A0of Conduct training since/uni00A0September 2019\n\n## SIGNIFICANCE\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance is an integral part of responsibility, which is one of our strategic focus areas\n- \u00b7 Compliance helps us to create sustainable business in the long term\n- \u00b7 Compliance is an important asset in our decision making, management and operations\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Compliant operations and behaviour\n- \u00b7 Engaging work environment where employees feel safe to voice their concerns\n- \u00b7 Responsible value creation\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 We are all responsible for building a culture of integrity, with everything we do and every choice we make\n- \u00b7 We do not compromise our standards of integrity under any circumstances\n- \u00b7 Accountability for compliance extends down from the Board of Directors and senior management to all employees",

This platform allows us to manage our training e/ffectively through automated reminders and escalation processes, and we can also easily produce training reports. During the year, the completion of mandatory compliance e-learnings was set as a prerequisite for short-term incentive payments. This new criterion will be applied for the first time in incentive payments for 2020 in spring 2021. Available compliance e-learning with the completion rates at year end are listed in the table on the next page.\n\nThe e-learning modules are complemented via face-to-face compliance training with specific target groups, who are determined based on risk assessments. The compliance training sessions are supported by active communication. Given that our employees' awareness of what is expected from them is a prerequisite for compliance, we continue to allocate further resources to this.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nOur group company risk matrix, which is based on country risk and complexity and the extent of our operations in each country, forms the basis for monitoring activities aimed at ensuring compliance at all levels of the organisation. Our compliance team has a three-year monitoring plan for its compliance reviews that is based on this matrix. The reviews to be performed each year are agreed with the businesses during the annual risk assessment process and co-ordinated with the Internal Audit department. The compliance review findings and recommendations are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and businesses. These recommendations are then carried out in collaboration with said businesses.\n\nAnother example of our compliance team's monitoring activity is the counterparty screening procedures demonstrated in the illustration on the right. The purpose of the activity is to manage compliance risks relating to our numerous business partners in di/fferent countries and continents. We\n\nIn 2020, the compliance team conducted compliance reviews in 20 local units in South America, Asia and Europe. Due to COVID-19 most reviews were conducted remotely.\n\nwant to know who we are trading with and to source even more responsibly.

We want to promote a culture of raising concerns openly among colleagues and supervisors or reaching out to HR or other assurance functions. The reporting channel offers another way of voicing concerns. Also, if an employee suspects a breach has occurred, it is important not to assume that someone else has already reported it and promptly report any misconduct.\n\nOur Report Misconduct channel was renewed in 2020. A new service is available globally on our website for both employees and all stakeholders. Operated by an independent external service\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprovider, the service is accessible in over 40 languages, 24/7.\n\nAll reports coming in through the channel are made available to the Head of Internal Audit\n\n## OUR MAIN PRINCIPLES UNDER THE/uni00A0 UPM CODE OF CONDUCT\n\n- We are committed to integrity\n- We respect people and human rights\n- We take care of our environmental impact and product safety\n- We have zero-tolerance for corruption and bribery\n- We avoid conflicts of interest\n- We comply with competition law\n- We protect our assets and information\n- We know with whom we trade\n- We engage with our stakeholders and society\n- We voice our concerns\n\nand the Chief Compliance Officer at UPM. They will then, in most cases, assign responsibility for the next steps to the most appropriate person. The new service establishes efficient procedures for managing the reported cases inside UPM in a way that meets the requirements of the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive.\n\nIn previous years, the number of misconduct reports received has been at the level of around 30 cases annually. The number should likely be higher in a company of our size and is expected to rise with the introduction of the new channel. We welcome all input also from customers and partners on any suspicions of misconduct, as stakeholders play a crucial role in maintaining the UPM standards of integrity.",

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\n\nSuppliers are an essential part of our value chain. Our continuous work with suppliers ensures the efficiency, transparency and responsibility of our supply chain.\n\nWe buy products, materials and services from over 21,000 B2B suppliers globally. Our sourcing network includes suppliers from start-up companies to international corporations. We also buy wood from some 16,000 private forest owners.\n\nThe main sourcing categories are fibre, chemicals, other raw materials, indirect purchases, logistics and energy. When selecting suppliers, our most important criteria include reliable long-term deliveries, product and service quality, financial stability of suppliers, social and environmental responsibility, and product safety.\n\n## Continuous development under exceptional circumstances\n\nThe aim of the cooperation between us and our suppliers is to ensure e/fficiency, compliance and systematic performance. A common goal is to guarantee that suppliers can provide responsibly produced, cost-competitive and innovative materials and services globally - in all market situations.\n\nOur solution to standardise and simplify sourcing processes was adopted in 2020. The new digital platform will improve process e/fficiency in demand planning, tendering, contracting and purchase transactions. To enhance transparency and suppliers' integration into our business processes, we plan to develop the platform further in the coming years.\n\nDue to COVID-19, we strongly focused on guaranteeing business continuity and the progress of our transformative growth projects in Uruguay and Germany in 2020. Thanks to the extensive safety precautions, both the raw materials and customer deliveries were secured and the growth projects were well on track with the planned start-up timeline.\n\n## Standards of integrity\n\nWe are committed to responsible sourcing practices in our Code of Conduct. All the minimum requirements for suppliers are defined in the UPM Supplier and ThirdParty Code. In 2020, we launched the updated Supplier and Third-Party Code along with extensive internal e-learning.\n\nAll contractors working at our production sites must comply with UPM's safety requirements. Various additional requirements, updated in 2020, are applied to\n\nwood, chemicals, pulp, packaging materials and logistics.\n\nAll our wood, pulp and recovered paper suppliers are continuously evaluated in regard to environmental issues, social responsibility and their involvement in the local community. These raw materials are either FSC\u00ae (N003385) and PEFC (PEFC/02-44-41) certified or comply with the FSC Controlled Wood standard or Due Diligence requirements for PEFC.\n\n## A prominent user of wood and recovered paper\n\nWe are both a major forest owner and a purchaser of wood. We source all wood assortments to ensure optimal utilisation\n\n## SIGNIFICANCE\n\n- \u00b7 An effective supply chain guarantees our competitiveness and the availability of commodities required for production in all market situations\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 We are a trustworthy and future-oriented partner\n- \u00b7 We ensure the efficiency, transparency and responsibility of the supply chain\n- \u00b7 We create business opportunities in the value chain in collaboration with our partners\n- \u00b7 We engage in long-term co-operation with selected suppliers to optimise costs, quality, responsibility and innovation\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Focus on long-term, co-operative relationships and promoting methods for responsible sourcing\n- \u00b7 We set clear requirements and expectations for our suppliers\n- \u00b7 Monitoring our suppliers' performance continuously and developing processes together with our key suppliers\n- \u00b7 Responsible practices in the supply chain\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\nWe require suppliers to promote the same requirements in their own supply chains. In 2020, 84% (84%) of UPM's total spend was with suppliers who are committed to the UPM Supplier and Third-Party Code.\n\nof this valuable raw material. In 2020, we purchased 24.9 (27.5) million cubic metres of wood worldwide.\n\nWe are also one of the world's leading users of recovered paper for the production of graphic paper. In 2020, we used approximately 1.8 (2.3) million tonnes of recovered paper. Recycled fibre accounted 26% (28%) of all fibre raw materials used in UPM's paper production. The decrease is mainly due to  the closure of one newsprint mill.\n\n## The origin of wood is monitored\n\nAll the wood we use is legally logged and comes from sustainably managed forests. We don't use wood harvested from tropical rainforests or accept wood from plantations that have been established by converting natural forests. We don't accept wood from regions that do not respect the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nIn addition to third-party certification, we also verify that the wood supplied to our mills is compliant with the EU Timber Regulation, the US Lacey Act and other regional requirements.\n\n## Continuous improvement with raw material suppliers\n\nWe buy approximately 1.6 million tonnes of pulp from external suppliers. We set further requirements to pulp suppliers for environmental performance, social responsibility, forestry, wood sourcing and reporting.\n\nCollecting and analysing environmental- and social-responsibility-related data for our pulp and chemical suppliers is an integral part of our supplier risk and performance management. We create development plans together with the suppliers based on these analyses. We also monitor the performance of our other raw material suppliers through various surveys.\n\n## Know your supplier\n\nWe identify our supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts. With the counterparty risk management tool, we can better evaluate counterparty-related risks through automated screening and support businesses in ethical and prudent decision-making. E/ffective third-party management plays an essential role in securing business continuity and compliance. In 2020, our\n\nfocus was on assessing new suppliers critical to our growth projects.\n\nIf any non-conformities are discovered, the supplier is required to take corrective measures. We monitor the implementation of these measures and provide support for improving the suppliers' operations if needed. However, some contracts may have to be discontinued due to insu/fficient measures or the seriousness of UPM's findings.\n\nThe responsibility-related risks are determined by the country of origin, sourced material or service and complexity of supply chain. Based on the risk identification, we evaluate selected suppliers' activities in more detail through EcoVadis and other assessments, supplier audits and joint development plans.\n\nIn relation to CO 2 emissions caused by supply chains, our focus is on reducing emissions from logistics and selected raw materials such as chemical pulp, pigments, chemicals and paper (read more on page 91).\n\nIn addition, we started a project to assess the working conditions of the service providers in the wood procurement value chain. The project will be carried out in 2021.\n\n## Global cooperation in sustainability\n\nIn 2020, we continued our cooperation with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative that promotes and improves practices within the supply chains of its members. The cooperation improves transparency and the e/fficiency of our assessments and audits.\n\nResponsible sourcing is also an important theme in the UN Global Compact. We are an active member of the Action Platform, promoting decent work in global supply chains.\n\nWith TfS membership, we have access to a wider pool of EcoVadis assessments and TfS audit reports. In 2020, we conducted some 290 environmental and social risk assessments with EcoVadis. With the exception of wood sourcing and forestry, the number of on-site audits was halved due to COVID-19 restrictions, additionally some virtual audits were piloted. Last year, our own trained auditors and external auditors carried out 117 audits, based on identified risks, including human rights, social and environmental topics. In 2021, we plan to increase the number of suppliers who have been audited and assessed by EcoVadis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UPM'S FIVE LARGEST SUPPLIERS 2020\n\n| 1.

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS PRODUCT LIFECYCLE\n\nAs the population grows and consumption increases, fossil materials and other non-renewable natural resources are to be increasingly replaced by renewable or recycled raw materials.\n\nProduct stewardship covers the entire value chain, from raw material sourcing to end products and their recycling or disposal. Bio-based and recyclable products, as well as innovations based on these, are an essential part of the bioeconomy. Open and transparent product communication, supported by ecolabels, certificates and product declarations, increases consumer awareness.\n\n## Mitigating climate change and creating value for society\n\nOur products help to mitigate climate change by replacing fossil-based products with bio-based renewable alternatives. The products store carbon for the entire duration of their lifecycle, especially when recycled multiple times.\n\nWe actively develop solutions based on the circular economy model. Our target is also to provide solutions that improve our customers' business processes and performance - creating mutual benefit and societal value. Our innovative and sustainable wood-based biomedical products, as well as our pharmaceutical and healthcare labelling solutions, are examples of where we create direct societal value. Many of our products are made from our side streams and residues or from materials recovered after product use, thus supporting circular economy (read more on page 94).\n\n## Continuous dialogue and collaboration with customers\n\nUPM's businesses o/ffer a variety of products and services.

A comprehensive understanding of each market, knowledge of the end uses of products and an appreciation of the needs of our customers all underpin our approach to customers.\n\nWe have a continuous dialogue with our customers and also engage in various development projects with them. Many of these projects are linked to product development and supply-chain e/fficiency.\n\nOur businesses conduct regular customer-satisfaction surveys. Based on these results, overall satisfaction with UPM as a supplier is 86% (86%). They also help us to define our areas of improvement. Product safety, forest certification, origin of wood and environmental topics such as ecolabels and carbon footprints are some of the most important factors for our customers. Furthermore, actions to mitigate climate change have become increasingly important topics.\n\n## Ecodesign integrated into our product development\n\nWe are committed to contributing to the recyclability of our products. We also aim to minimise the environmental impact of the whole product lifecycle, including the use of materials and manufacturing processes across the entire value chain. In 2020, we renewed our sustainable product design concept. One step was the updating of our ecodesign questionnaire to cover the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We carried out a pilot case in the development of sustainable lignin products. In 2021, the work will continue with sustainable packaging and other business areas. Special focus in sustainable product development will be put on circularity.\n\nLife cycle assessments (LCAs) are an important part of the ecodesign toolbox. We use LCAs to provide reliable, documented information on the environmental impacts of our materials and production processes. The results are also used for UPM Raflatac's Label Life service, UPM Plywood's Environmental Product Declarations and to calculate the carbon footprint of pulp and paper products, biofuels and naphtha.\n\n## Product safety requirements renewed\n\nThe ISO 9001 quality and ISO 22000 food safety management systems provide a framework for continuously improving our performance. All our production sites are ISO 9001 certified. All our pulp mills, UPM Raflatac sites and UPM Specialty Papers production lines in Europe and UPM Changshu PM3 have a certified ISO 22000 food safety management system. In 2020, UPM Changshu paper machine 3 received FSSC 22000 certification and passed the audit for the Chinese food safety standard QS. This allows us to o/ffer a number of products that are designed and produced to meet food packaging requirements.\n\nIn 2020, we developed the way in which we communicate our product safety requirements to our pulp, paper, chemical and raw material suppliers as well as to our customers. As a result of collaborating with a number of paper and chemical companies to increase transparency in the supply chain and to accelerate the exchange of information, a new 'Pulp & Paper Harmonized Questionnaire' was introduced. The questionnaire enables us to pre-assess the chemicals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nused in the products and materials and, thus, to ensure the compliance of our products with legal requirements and additional commitments, such as ecolabel criteria. To improve our customer communication, we have created Product Safety Profiles and updated Non-Use Warranty documents.\n\n## Ecolabels and product declarations increase transparency\n\nWe o/ffer product declarations and environmental data for most of our products. They tell our customers about the environmental performance of our products and help them make sustainable choices. The product profiles provide information on the raw materials used, emissions and other environmentally relevant data. Product safety profiles show how products comply with relevant product and chemical regulations. Wood-origin statements provide information on the species and country of origin of the wood.\n\nMost of our products are certified with widely recognised ecolabels. The EU Ecolabel can be used for all UPM graphic papers in Europe. We also give our pulp and paper customers the opportunity to use wellknown local ecolabels, such as the German Blue Angel or the Nordic Ecolabel. Our biofuel production has certification from RSB (Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials) and ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification). Also, UPM Formi production in Finland and four of UPM Raflatac's production sites have ISCC PLUS certification (read more on page 50).

However, in addition to health, it is crucial that our businesses continue their operations to also help societies overcome crises like the global COVID-19 pandemic, both economically and socially. Despite the exceptional circumstances this year, our businesses were able to continue their operations successfully, resulting in a satisfactory financial performance, with the related tax revenue, in various countries.\n\nUPM's e/ffective tax rate in 2020 was 22.9% (17.9%) and its cash tax rate was 19.8% (13.5%). The corresponding corporate income tax reported in 2020 was EUR 169 million (EUR 234 million), and corporate income tax paid in 2020 was EUR 146 million (EUR 176 million). In addition to taxes on income, our various production inputs and outputs are also subject to taxation, which is either paid by us (e.g. energy tax or property tax, such as taxes on real estate) or collected by us (e.g. VAT, payroll tax and social security contributions).\n\n## Corporate income taxes vary by countries\n\nThe table on the right displays the corporate income tax and property tax paid in our main countries of operation. Based on our corporate and operational structure, UPM mainly reports and pays its corporate income tax in countries where production and innovating activity takes place.\n\nIn Finland, we have significant production operations across our six business areas, as well as research and development operations. As a result, UPM is one of the major taxpayers in Finland. Despite the challenging year, UPM's corporate income\n\ntax in Finland in 2020 is estimated to be EUR 86 million (EUR 134 million), with subsidiaries reporting and paying approximately EUR 78 million (EUR 93 million). The remaining figure of approximately EUR 8 million (EUR 41 million) will be reported and paid by UPM-Kymmene Corporation.\n\nIn China, as fine paper production, UPM qualifies as a high-tech enterprise with a reduced corporate income tax rate of 15%. UPM also pays withholding tax on dividends in China. In countries where our\n\nIn Uruguay, the government has granted several free-trade zone permits for domestic and foreign investments. The Uruguay government has granted our pulp mill a permit to operate in a free-trade zone, where taxes mainly consist of property tax and annual tax-like charges paid to the Uruguay government for the development of the zone. The new pulp mill under construction in Uruguay will also be located in a similar free-trade zone.\n\ncompanies are using tax losses from previous years to o/ffset the tax liability of the year in question, such as Germany, limited corporate income tax is paid.\n\n## CORPORATE INCOME TAXES PAID AND PROPERTY TAXES BY COUNTRY\n\n| EURm           |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Finland        |     91 |    150 |\n| Germany        |     14 |     17 |\n| Uruguay        |     13 |     15 |\n| China          |     28 |      7 |\n| United States  |      8 |      0 |\n| United Kingdom |      4 |      6 |\n| Austria        |      6 |      1 |\n| Russia         |      4 |      3 |\n| Poland         |      1 |      1 |\n| Estonia        |      2 |      2 |\n| France         |      3 |      5 |\n| Other          |      4 |      4 |\n| Group total    |    178 |    211 |\n\n## DIRECT ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED BY UPM IN 2020 (EUR MILLION)\n\n| Direct economic value created     |       | Economic value distributed                       |        |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|                                   |       | Operating costs                                  | -6,183 |\n| Sales                             | 8,580 | Employee wages and benefits                      | -1,188 |\n| Income from sale of assets        | 45    | Payments to providers of loans                   | - 51   |\n| Income from financial investments | 6     | Dividend distribution                            | -693   |\n| Other income                      | 91    | Corporate income taxes paid   and property taxes | - 178  |\n| Total                             | 8,722 |                                                  | -8,293 |\n\n## Economic value retained 429\n\nUPM's economic impact is significant in the surrounding communities. The company's operations contribute to local, regional and national economies by generating economic benefits for different stakeholder groups. The related direct monetary flows indicate the extent of added value globally.\n\nIn accordance with UPM's Tax Policy, the locations of our companies are driven by commercial rationale and business reasoning. We do not transfer any value created and do not have any investments in production or service operations in jurisdictions defined by the Council of the European Union as non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes or in any similar secrecy jurisdictions.  A list of UPM subsidiaries and joint operations and their country of incorporation can be found on page 198-200.\n\nFurthermore, our sites contribute to local employment, income tax and purchasing power and are engaging in projects with communities. Information can be found in pulp and paper mills' EMAS-verified reports on environmental and societal responsibility.\n\n## Energy taxation at various levels of the value chain\n\nEnergy taxation is relevant to us in various countries and for various levels of the supply chain. Energy taxation is subject to detailed regulation at both individual country and EU levels.\n\nMost of the energy used in the production processes is subject to energy tax, although there are various tax rates and exemptions depending on the type of use. We also pay a significant amount of energy tax on fuels for logistics costs, especially for road transportation.\n\nElectricity produced by us is subject to electricity taxation, regardless of which sources are used. Also our renewable UPM BioVerno diesel and naphtha, which are produced from a residue of pulp production, are subject to energy taxation. However, the energy tax rates for transport fuels from renewable and sustainable sources, like UPM BioVerno, are lower than those from fossil fuels.\n\nWithin the EU, energy taxation laws allow member states to compensate for the taxes paid on, or apply lower tax rates to, energy-intensive industrial production, for example. Many of the main countries in which we have production facilities, such as Finland and Germany, o/ffer such tax relief because the level of energy taxation has increased significantly in recent years.\n\nIn Finland, electricity is taxed at a lower rate when used in industrial production\n\nSee examples of UPM Kymi mill's social impacts and responsibility at upmimpacts.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(e.g. in 2020 at 6.9 EUR/MWh). Energy-intensive industries have received a retroactive refund of paid energy tax. This is based on a separate application, if the amount exceeds a threshold, which is dependent on the company's added value. For UPM, this retroactive refund paid in 2020 (for energy taxes paid in 2019) amounted to approximately 74% of paid energy taxes.\n\nIt is possible to apply for a retroactive energy tax refund in Austria, while in the UK relief is granted upfront in the form of lower tax rates for energy-intensive industrial users fulfilling specific requirements. In Germany, UPM benefits from certain subsidy schemes such as EEG (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz) compensation for energyintensive industries.\n\nAn energy taxation reform, introduced by the Finnish government came into force on 1 January 2021. The overall impact is expected to be minor for us due to the fact that the majority of our energy consumption is already from renewable sources, although the impact varies with each business area.\n\n## Our tax governance and tax compliance\n\nThe Board of Directors' Audit Committee is responsible for the supervision of tax risk management, as part of our risk management processes. UPM's internal control and risk management operations review tax risks regularly and update the control framework together with the tax function. A more thorough review of the tax practices\n\nof customers and suppliers is a part of our counterparty risk management processes.\n\nWe aim to co-operate transparently and proactively with tax authorities, and value dialogue with other important stakeholders concerning taxation. In Finland, UPM co-operates with the Finnish Large Taxpayers' O/ffice.\n\nUPM Tax Policy is supported by internal instructions, benchmark analyses of best practice and related internal controls. Tax matters are managed by our tax function, which is complemented by third-party tax services to comply with local tax reporting and filing, as well as other requirements.\n\n## SIGNIFICANCE\n\n- \u00b7 We are strongly committed to continuously improving our economic and social performance\n- \u00b7 Our businesses play a leading role in contributing to societal development through the tax revenue they generate\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Based on the standards of the UPM Code of Conduct, the UPM Tax Policy describes the main principles and guidelines of our taxation\n- \u00b7 Taxes are paid in accordance with local tax laws and regulations that apply to the country in question\n- \u00b7 We pay corporate income taxes in the countries where added value is created and profit is generated",

        "page_content": "## SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY\n\nOur business is based on the sustainable use of forests: We grow and harvest forests to create renewable and sustainable materials and products.\n\nFinland and Uruguay are the most important countries for our wood sourcing. At the end of 2020, we owned a total of about 870,000 hectares of forest land in Finland, Uruguay and the USA. Most of this land is in Finland, totalling roughly 515,000 hectares, followed by Uruguay (280,000 hectares) and the United States (76,000 hectares). We also lease about 152,000 hectares in Uruguay and manage around 1.2 million hectares of private forest globally. We follow the same strict sustainability standards everywhere we operate.\n\nWe own three modern nurseries, one in Finland and two in Uruguay. The nurseries provide high-quality seedlings and are an important platform for research. In Finland, we started to produce small amounts of alder and oak. Increasing the share of deciduous trees in our Finnish forests has positive impacts on biodiversity, climate and forest health (read more on the right).\n\nApproximately 180,000 hectares (20%) of the land we own is protected. Protected areas include valuable habitats, natural forests and other valuable areas.\n\nIn 2020, we started to construct our third nursery in Central Uruguay. The new nursery, scheduled to start-up in 2022, will ensure the annual planting capacity required to supply the new UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill is met.\n\n## Forests and climate\n\nWe are committed to climate-positive forestry and improving biodiversity. Forests and forest biodiversity are both beneficial for the climate. We want to ensure that our forests continue to act as carbon sinks, stay\n\nresilient and diverse in changing conditions, and continue to thrive and grow for generations to come.\n\nMaintaining our forests as carbon sinks means that they grow more than we harvest. We manage our forests to maintain their health and ability to grow and absorb more carbon. In 2020, the five year annual average carbon sink of UPM's own and leased forests was approximately 6.1 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalents (1.1 million tonnes in Finland, 4.9 in Uruguay and 0.1 in the US). Together with the scientific community we further develop the measurements and monitoring of forest carbon. Harmonising the methodologies for di/fferent countries for both soil and tree carbon is the key area of development.\n\n## Improving biodiversity\n\nWe continuously work to have a positive impact on biodiversity in the company forests in Finland. We implement biodiversity actions as part of everyday forestry operations, through forest protection and collaborative stakeholder projects. In 2020, we published our biodiversity indicators for monitoring our progress towards the target. The indicators are developed together with researchers and currently are:\n\n- \u00b7  Tree species\n- \u00b7  Forest structure\n- \u00b7  Forest age\n- \u00b7  Protected areas\n- \u00b7  Habitat restoration\n- \u00b7  Valuable habitats\n- \u00b7  Species and habitat projects\n- \u00b7  Indicator development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UPM FORESTS AND PLANTATIONS\n\n|                                                                   | 2008   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Forest and plantation  land, own and leased  (1,000 ha)           | 1, 012 | 1,025  |\n| Forest growth  (million m 3 )                                     | 4.3    | 7. 2   |\n| Wood harvested from  UPM forests and planta- tions (million m 3 ) | 2.2    | 4.4    |\n| Value of forests and  plantations, including  land (EURm)         | 1,270  | 2,854  |\n\nIn 2020, improvement was measured in all quantitive biodiversity indicators. To gain more and more robust data on biodiversity, further indicators and monitoring processes are developed. For example, the regular monitoring of deadwood is being developed to be able to include it to our list of indicators.\n\nIn 2020, we developed a biodiversity framework for our plantations and other company-owned land in Uruguay. (Read more on page 44.)\n\n## Third-party-verified supply chain\n\nWe always know the origin of our wood. Our wood does not originate from illegal logging or from areas where human rights or forests with high conservation values are threatened. Our wood sourcing does not cause land-use change. We don't use genetically modified trees. Our compliance with these requirements is confirmed by independent third-party verification.\n\nWe actively participate in developing forest certification on a national and global level. We have active dialogue with the FSC\u00ae and PEFC organisations and we participate in national and international working groups for certification development.\n\nAll UPM-owned forests are certified or in the process of certification if acquired recently.  We also promote forest certification to private forest owners and our other customers. We have established the FSC\u00ae group certification scheme. In 2020, our FSC group covered approximately 460,000 hectares in Finland and over 13,000 hectares in Uruguay.\n\nCDP recognised UPM as one of only ten Triple A List companies globally for its significant actions to mitigate climate risk and prevent deforestation.\n\n## Collaboration with stakeholders\n\nFor decades, we have worked together with researchers, academic institutions, environmental organisations and other stakeholders to develop our sustainable forestry practices. In 2020, we continued our long-time partnerships with the Osprey Foundation in Finland and with Aves Uruguay and Vida Silvestre in Uruguay. In Russia, we ran a joint project with WWF Russia and published joint guidelines on sustainable forest management for wood suppliers.\n\nIn Finland, we continued transplanting threatened wood-inhabiting fungi in cooperation with the Natural Resources Institute Finland and the University of Helsinki. Together with the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment and other stakeholders, we implemented species and habitat projects, such as restoring the habitat of the endangered northern crested newt, implementing artificial burnings and removing invasive alien species from burning environments. We also started a project to restore spring habitats. In collaboration with the Osprey Foundation and North Carelian Ornithological Society, we continued building a network of artificial nests for birds of prey.\n\nWe continued to participate in forest- and environment-related stakeholder forums. In Finland, we took part in a biodiversity roundtable process led by the Ministries of Environment and Agriculture and Forestry. We also continued to actively collaborate with FSC International to promote sustainable forest management globally. We joined PEFC International as an international stakeholder member to further strengthen our work to develop sustainable forestry.\n\n## Responsible sourcing on page 80 Responsible product lifecycle on page 82\n\n## CASE\n\n## DECIDUOUS TREES IMPROVE CLIMATE RESISTANCE\n\nUPM will double the number of deciduous trees in its forests in Finland. Deciduous trees improve forest growth and yield and increase the diversity of forest species.

Biomassbased fuels account for 72% (70%) of our fuel usage.\n\nThe majority of our energy consumption originates from the paper and pulp mills' production where electricity and heat are needed in mechanical pulping, pumping and drying. We generate steam and electricity through combined heat and power (CHP) plants at all of our pulp mills, and at almost all of our paper mills. At some mills, all or part of this energy is produced by external or co-owned power plants.\n\nAs the use of weather-dependent energy sources increases around the world, the need for balancing power within energy systems will also grow. Hydropower is the most e/ffective and sustainable method of producing balancing power and we have significant hydropower assets in Finland.\n\n## Continuous improvement in energy efficiency\n\nWe are constantly looking for ways to improve our energy e/fficiency across our operations with audits, innovations and investments. However, in 2020 we did not reach our annual target of increasing energy e/fficiency by 1%.\n\nAs a result of the energy-saving investments we carried out in 2020, we reduced our energy costs by EUR 0.3 (1.2) million, avoided emitting 2,400 (12,800) tonnes of CO 2 and achieved a 13,000 (41,000) MWh\n\nreduction in energy consumption. The annual savings were EUR 0.8 (1.4) million, 8,600 (15,600) tonnes of CO 2 and 44,000 (49,000) MWh of energy.\n\n## Reducing emissions to air in production\n\nWe tightened our 2030 targets for reducing our emissions of fossil CO 2 and acidifying flue gases (NOx and SO 2 ) in January 2020. We are taking steps towards these targets through consistent improvement programmes and investments.\n\nAt UPM Nordland paper mill in Germany, we are building a natural gas-based combined heat and power (CHP) plant.

Our timber production has been fossil-free since the start of 2020. This continued improvement regarding responsible operations is helping us to reach our target for emission reduction.\n\nAll the logs are sawn up, and the by-products of this process (i.e. chips and sawdust) are utilised in pulp production.

In 2020, we started a comprehensive project on Scope 3 emissions.\n\nTowards a future beyond fossils on page 16 Responsible sourcing on page 80 Report of the Board of Directors on page 118\n\n## ELECTRICITY GENERATION THROUGH OWN POWER PLANTS AND SHAREHOLDINGS\n\n| TWh           |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Mill CHP      |    5.2 |    5.7 |\n| Hydropower    |    3.5 |    2.8 |\n| Nuclear power |    4.9 |    4.9 |\n| Thermal power |    0.1 |    0.2 |\n| Total         |   13.7 |   13.6 |\n\n## Sources of UPM's fossil CO /uniF63A emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\n## WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS MORE RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAINS\n\nUPM has set a target of reducing its supply chain emissions by 30% by 2030. We need exhaustive information on how suppliers are performing to meet this target. There is currently, however, no comparable way to report emissions from sourced products and raw materials, and the emissions that come from their transportation.\n\nSupply chain emissions are largely calculated using secondary data from different databases and the general coefficients drawn up from this data. We can only reduce our emissions if we know the level at which they really are and can choose the best partners based on this information.\n\nDue to the complexity of global supply chains, collaboration between various parties is necessary. The chemical industry's Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative is a great example of efforts to develop the sustainability practices of supply chains and share comprehensive information about suppliers.\n\nIn maritime transport, for example, there are big operators that can provide data about their actual emissions online. However, even the suppliers that are not yet able to report their emissions in a precise way have been very committed to the development work.\n\nWe have already had discussions with suppliers that belong to certain supply chain categories about their readiness to report their emissions. The key areas, in addition to chemicals, are logistics, pulp and pigments at a minimum. For example, common practices would greatly facilitate the emissions calculations for supply chain materials such as chemicals, as well as fillers and binders used in paper production.",

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE WATER USE\n\nWater has a crucial role in our business, from sustainable forestry to production. It is also an important source of renewable energy.\n\nAs a signatory of the UN Global Compact's CEO Water Mandate, we follow recognised principles in water stewardship. We aim to use water in a way that is environmentally sustainable, socially equitable and economically beneficial.\n\nCDP recognised UPM as one of the only ten Triple A List companies globally for its significant actions to enhance water stewardship.\n\n## Continuous improvement in water management\n\nThe water we need for our pulp and paper production processes is circulated and reused as much as possible. Only a small proportion eventually leaves the process as e/ffluent and needs to be replaced with fresh water. Approximately 95% of the water we use in our paper mill processes is internally recirculated, and thus only 5% is replaced by fresh water. Using less water also means using less electricity, fewer chemicals and less thermal energy.\n\nWe continued testing several potential sources of recycled nutrients and mapping opportunities for cooperation across all UPM sites. For example, UPM Kymi started to use biogas plant reject water with the target of replacing 50% of the urea used as the nutrient. In Germany, UPM H\u00fcrth started to replace 100% urea with chemical industry side stream ammonium sulphate. Testing will continue at several mills in 2021.\n\nAll e/ffluents from our pulp and paper mills are cleaned in both mechanical and biological e/ffluent treatment processes. We operate a global water specialist network to share best practices and get the best possible treatment results.\n\nAll pulp and paper mills have prepared a roadmap in order to reach their targets for reducing water use and e/ffluent load by 2030. The exceptional year 2020 caused challenges at several mills, but there is also positive development in sight. For example, at UPM Pietarsaari an improved pulp line and better washing e/fficiency resulted in a 9% reduction in specific wastewater volumes per tonne of pulp.\n\nOptimisation of UPM Changshu's operations continued and process wastewater volumes decreased further by 14% per tonne of paper. The mill received the Water E/fficiency Front Runner award in October for the second time. Additionally, several mills started to use advanced process controls or predictive analytic models to further optimise the operation of the treatment plant. Exploring new ways of working, new technologies and new partnerships with potential chemical and machinery suppliers continued in 2020 and some of these technologies were piloted in 2019-2020. The work will continue in 2021.\n\n## Collaboration with stakeholders\n\nOur responsible water use highlights the importance of water resources and good water management all over the world. For example, UPM Raflatac is collaborating with WWF Poland in the Rivers for Life project. In Finland, UPM is actively co-operating with the Baltic Sea Action Group to find new sources of recycled nutrients. This collaboration promotes our 2030 responsibility target to use only recycled nutrients in our wastewater treatment plants.\n\n## Process waste water volumes\n\n3\n\nm\n\n/t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30% reduction of wastewater volume  by 2030 from 2008 level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10%\n\nreduction achieved for the UPM average product\n\n40% reduction in effluent load (COD) from 2008 level by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n33%\n\nreduction achieved for the/uni00A0UPM average product\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Water-intensive operations in areas with sufficient water resources\n- \u00b7 Efficient water use with appropriate recycling techniques\n- \u00b7 Treatment of used water according to the Best Available Techniques\n- \u00b7 Returning water to its original watershed when possible\n- \u00b7 Cooperation with local stakeholders to minimise negative impacts and ensure the availability of water for everyone\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\n## Minimising the impact of hydropower facilities\n\nUPM has been a hydropower producer for over a century, and UPM Energy is the second-largest electricity producer in Finland. While hydropower is a coste/ffective, renewable and CO 2 -free way to generate electricity, it can also have an adverse impact on watercourses and their surroundings. In order to minimise these\n\nimpacts, we work closely with authorities and other stakeholders.\n\nIn 2020, our migratory fish programme continued in Finland. The Saimaa landlocked-salmon breeding and nursery area in Pielisjoki was inaugurated and the old mill and mill damn at the Sapsokoski rapids were dismantled. We are participating in a research programme and evaluating new restoration locations.",

        "page_content": "## CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND RESOURCE EFFICIENCY\n\nWe are using materials in an efficient manner and many of our products are made from side streams, residues or waste. In response to climate change, we actively develop new solutions in order to accelerate the transition to a circular economy and aim to continuously reduce our environmental impact.\n\nWe see the circular economy as the cornerstone of a sustainable future. Lifelong product stewardship covers the entire value chain from the procurement of raw materials to end products and their afterlife. Open and transparent product communication complements our activities. Environmental targets for 2030 ensure resource e/fficiency in production and contribute to the UN SDGs. Our goal is to minimise waste and maximise recycling and create added value through smart solutions. We are actively looking for partners to co-create circular innovations linked to side stream utilisation, product development and supply chain e/fficiency.\n\n## Our targets on circular economy\n\nBy 2030, we will not deposit any process waste at landfill sites, and no process waste will be incinerated without recovering the energy. On average in 2020, 89% (89%) of our process waste was recycled or recovered, of which 19% is energy recovery. 64% of our production sites have already achieved 100% waste utilisation. However, the total amount of waste to landfills increased by 3% compared to 2019 because of lacking utilisation possibilities at certain locations.\n\nWe share best practices, research results and ideas throughout the company, and have several internal working groups focusing on the usage of waste and by-products. Green liquor dregs originating from pulp produc-\n\ntion are one of our most challenging residues to utilise, and we are putting a lot of emphasis on developing ways to use the material.\n\nIn 2020, 92% of the ash was utilised in various applications, such as in soil stabilisation and the cement industry, or internally to replace caustic soda or as raw material for paper filler production.\n\nMost organic production residues, such as bark, wood residues and fibre-containing solids from deinking and e/ffluent treatment, are used to generate energy for mill sites. The fibrous residues that are not incinerated are utilised in brick manufacturing, earthwork or as soil improvement materials. Overall, ash originating from biomass-based energy generation makes up the largest share of our solid waste.\n\nOur other circular economy target is the use of 100% nutrients from recycled sources in our e/ffluent treatment plants by 2030. In 2020, 28% was achieved. (Read more on page 92.)\n\n## Making use of side streams and recovered materials\n\nMany of our products are made from side streams. We actively develop new solutions to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, in response to climate change and resource scarcity. For example, UPM BioVerno renewable diesel and naphtha are produced from crude tall oil, a residue\n\n## Process waste to landfills\n\n1,000 t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNo process waste/uni00A0to landfills or to incineration without energy recovery by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n89%\n\nrecycling or recovery achieved for our total process waste\n\nfrom chemical pulp production. Lignin, a by-product of pulp production, is used in WISA BioBond gluing technology, replacing fossil-based phenol used in plywood manufacturing.\n\nWe are also active in enhancing circularity over the product lifecycle. UPM Raflatac collects label waste from nearly 180 part-\n\nners globally and recycles it in its Rafcycle\u00ae service. The service takes the self-adhesive label waste and gives them new life as paper liner, magazine paper or composite material. UPM Specialty Papers has developed UPM LinerLoop\u2122, a unique concept where collected release liners are desiliconised and used to produce new high-performance release liner base papers. We also have a long history of using recovered paper to produce new graphic paper. In 2020, we used approximately 1.8 (2.3) million tonnes of recovered paper. Recycled fibre accounted 26 (28) % of all fibre materials used in UPM's paper production.\n\n## Active operator in circular economy networks\n\nFor example, we are a member of INGEDE (International Association of the Deinking Industry), and a shareholder of CLIC Innovation Ltd., a Finnish open innovation cluster with an aim for breakthrough solutions in bioeconomy, circular economy and cleantech.\n\nIn 2020, UPM Specialty Papers and UPM Raflatac joined CELAB-Europe, to further\n\nUPM Raflatac is an active member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the global thought leader of the transition towards a circular economy. In 2020, UPM also tested its circularity with the Circulytics tool developed by the Ellen McArthur Foundation and received B+ as an overall score.\n\n## CASE\n\n## CONFRONTING THE REEL PACKAGING PLASTIC CHALLENGE\n\nUPM has been initiating projects alongside its value chain partners, such as packaging company Walki Group, to develop innovative solutions to reduce plastics in packaging. The latest collaborative project set the goal of reducing the amount of fossil-based polyethylene (PE) in paper in reel wrapping laminate without compromising the moisture protection for the reels.\n\nWe started the project in few paper mills by testing material that replaced standard fossil-based PE with polymers based on crude tall oil-a residue of pulp production from UPM. Testing took three months to get results and feedback from the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npromote the development of a circular business model in the self-adhesive label industry. We also continued to participate in the Finnish UUMA3 programme to enhance the use of recovered materials in earth construction and took part in several other research projects related to the use of our side streams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhole supply chain. Based on the tests, there are not any major technical differences in the quality of the materials.\n\nThe amount of polyethylene in the reels decreased by a quarter from 20 g/m 2 to 15 g/m 2\n\n.\n\n## SIGNIFICANCE\n\n- \u00b7 Global megatrends such as population growth lead to resource scarcity and competition for natural resources\n- \u00b7 Resource efficiency and circular economy ease the pressure on resources and the environment and bring competitive advantages\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Promote the efficient use of all material streams and the implementation of circular economy - reduce, reuse and recycle\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Circular economy thinking\n- \u00b7 Recycle and reuse production waste and utilise by-products\n- \u00b7 Cross-industry collaboration\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n- Towards a future beyond fossils on page 16\n- From forests to sustainable products on page 18\n- Sustainable forestry on page 86\n- Responsible product lifecycle on page 82\n- Reducing energy use and emissions to air on page 88\n- Responsible water use on page 92\n- Report of the Board of Directors on page 118\n\nThe tests determined whether that amount was sufficient to protect the paper from moisture. The tests revealed that the amount of polyethylene could not be further reduced without risk. The measures are calculated to reduce the amount of polyethylene by about 400 tonnes per year, which corresponds to about 15-20 truckloads.\n\nThe project aims to optimise material usage and reduce CO 2 emissions. At the same time, we must ensure that the paper reels are not damaged during transport, because that is a far bigger waste of material and damage to the environment.\n\nOur long-term target is to find alternatives with which we can fully eliminate conventional plastic from our packaging.",

Our decision making, management and operations are guided by our values and by the UPM Code of Conduct. Our governance structure supports good management, responsible business operations and compliance at all levels, with clear responsibilities and reporting lines.\n\nUPM-Kymmene Corporation (UPM or the Company) complies with all recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code (CG Code) for listed companies, which is issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association. In accordance with the CG Code, we have published our Corporate Governance Statement (CG Statement) for the financial year 2020. It is available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/governance.

Notice of UPM's AGM was published in January. Following the outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took extensive measures to be able to hold the AGM as planned so that the essential resolutions, such as payment of dividends, could be decided upon. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the shareholders were requested not to attend the meeting in person but\n\nto appoint a proxy in order to minimise physical presence at the meeting. In addition, other precautionary measures, such as dividing the participants into several meeting rooms with video access to the main meeting room, were taken. A total of 2,524 (2019: 3,561) shareholders attended the meeting, mainly by proxy. Shareholders were present or represented at the meeting, representing 52.0% of the Company's reg-\n\nistered shares and votes. We are delighted to thank our shareholders, who made it possible to arrange the AGM on the planned date while a restriction issued by the Finnish government limited the number of persons able to be at the meeting's venue. The shareholders adhered to the Company's appeal to follow the AGM via live webcast instead of attending the meeting in person. UPM further supported shareholders with\n\n## Governance framework\n\nThe illustration below summarises the basic regulatory framework for our/uni00A0governance.\n\nArticles of Association\n\nBoard and committee charters\n\nUPM Code of Conduct\n\nFinnish Corporate Governance Code\n\nLaws, regulations, guidelines and standards\n\nUPM\n\nCorporate policies, rules, guidelines and instructions\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nomination and Governance Committee conducted its annual review of the structure, size, composition, diversity and succession needs of the Board as a whole, including whether the Board reflects an appropriate balance of sound judgement and a diverse range of business expertise, skills, experience, independence, availability of service to the Company and other desired qualities. As a result of a careful selection process, the Nomination and Governance Committee decided to propose Emma FitzGerald and Martin \u00e0 Porta be elected to the Board at the AGM 2020.\n\nAs proposed by the Nomination and Governance Committee, ten directors were elected to UPM's Board of Directors at the AGM for a one-year term. The shareholders were asked to vote on a single slate for the Board of Directors as this is, unlike in many other countries, a market practice in Finland. The Nomination and Governance Committee also believes that this practice helps to ensure that the Board works e/ffectively as a whole and comprises su/fficiently diverse members with varied experience and versatile areas of expertise that mutually complement each other. The composition of the Board is presented in the table above. The term of the current Board of Directors will end upon closing of the AGM 2021.\n\nThe new director Emma FitzGerald (born 1967) is a UK citizen and holds a doctorate in surface chemistry and solid-state physics (D.Phil.) from Oxford University and a master's degree in business administration (MBA) from the Manchester Business School.

Prior to that, she was involved in the UK utility industry responsible for gas, water and waste networks for the UK National Grid and Severn Trent PLC. Before that, she had an over 20-year career with Shell around the world managing, among others, downstream retail, lubricant and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) businesses.\n\nThe other new director, Martin \u00e0 Porta (born 1970), is a Swiss citizen and holds a master's degree in engineering (M.Sc.) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. He is now acting as a Senior Advisor in the private equity market. From November 2015 until February 2019, \u00e0 Porta served as the President and CEO of P\u00f6yry Plc, an international consulting and engineering company providing services in power\n\nMs FitzGerald has served on Boards in both executive and non-executive director positions for Severn Trent plc, Cookson Group plc, Alent plc and DCC plc.  She has also served in the audit, remuneration and nomination committees for these corporations, except Severn Trent plc, where she was an executive director. She sits currently on the Advisory Board of Oxford Sciences Innovation.\n\ngeneration, transmission and distribution, forest industry, biorefining and chemicals, mining and metals and infrastructure, as well as water and the environment. P\u00f6yry was acquired by \u00c5F AB in 2018. Following the completion of the transaction, \u00e0 Porta was responsible for \u00c5F P\u00f6yry's Management Consulting Division until October 2019. Before P\u00f6yry, \u00e0 Porta had a long career in di/fferent leadership positions in Switzerland, China, Hong Kong and Qatar with Siemens, which he joined in 2001, with his most recent position as the CEO responsible for Siemens Building Technologies Division Europe from 2012-2015.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nThe Board diversity aspects are defined in the Diversity Policy of the Board and include relevant professional experience and education, gender, age, nationality and length of tenure. This policy is available at www.upm.com/governance. Information on the professional backgrounds of the Board of Directors and their other significant commitments is available on pages 110-111 of this report. Information on the other aspects of Board diversity is available in the pie charts on the previous page. More information on UPM Board diversity,\n\nrelated objectives and results obtained is available in our CG Statement 2020.\n\n## Director independence\n\nThe Board of Directors evaluates the independence of its members both annually and on a continuous basis, with the assistance of the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee. Director independence is assessed based on the independence criteria of the Finnish CG Code. The majority of members of the Board of Directors must be independent of the Company, and at least two of these independent members must be independent of any significant shareholders.\n\nIndependence evaluation of director candidates is one of the key factors in the preparation of the Nomination and Governance Committee's annual proposal for the composition of the Board. The Committee assesses the independence of members of the Board of Directors on a continuous basis and reviews a report on any changes in professional engagements and other commitments in every meeting to ensure that members are compliant with the independence criteria. The Committee also assesses how such changes may a/ffect the Board members' availability for Board-related work, and reports to the Board on the\n\n## COMMITTEE MEMBERS 2020\n\n| AUDIT COMMITTEE           |\n|---------------------------|\n| Piia-Noora Kauppi (Chair) |\n| Emma FitzGerald           |\n| Marjan Oudeman            |\n| KimWahl                   |\n\n| REMUMERATION COMMITTEE        |\n|-------------------------------|\n| Veli-Matti Reinikkala (Chair) |\n| Henrik Ehrnrooth              |\n| Martin \u00e0 Porta                |\n\n| NOMINATION AND GOVERNANCE   |\n|-----------------------------|\n| COMMITTEE                   |\n| Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos (Chair)      |\n| Berndt Brunow               |\n\noutcome of such assessments. In particular, the Committee assesses Board members' positions in other publicly listed companies to ensure that the members adhere to the best practices related to overboarding. The Board of Director changes that took place in 2020 had an e/ffect on the director independence assessment, as Mr Pesonen, the President and CEO of UPM, had not been independent of the Company. Thereafter, according to the Nomination and Governance Committee's assessment, all directors are independent of both the Company and the significant shareholders as from the AGM 2020. The commitment of Board members and their availability for Board-related work is evidenced by the members' high attendance at Board and Committee meetings (see the table on page 103).\n\nAccording to the evaluation carried out by the Board with the help of the Nomination and Governance Committee, all directors are independent of the Company's significant shareholders, as the Company has no controlling shareholder and none of the Company's shareholders have announced a holding of 10% or more of the Company's shares or votes attached thereto. In addition, all directors are independent of the Company, including Berndt Brunow, Veli-Matti Reinikkala and Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos, who have been non-executive directors of the Com-\n\nany for more than ten consecutive years. Based on the Board's overall evaluation of the independence of these Board members, their long-standing service does not compromise their independence and no other factors or circumstances have been identified that could a/ffect their independence.\n\n## Board-related work in 2020\n\nThe Board held 12 meetings in 2020 and its work was not disrupted, even under the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board convened according to its original meeting schedule, however most of the meetings were held remotely. There is no minimum meeting attendance requirement for Board members. Instead, Board members are expected to attend all meetings unless there is a valid reason for not attending. The average attendance of the Board members at the Board meetings was 95.6% (2019: 96.4%) and at the Committee meetings 90.9% (2019: 97.8%). The personal attendance rates of each Board member are presented in the table on page 103. In connection with its meetings, the Board also held non-executive sessions and non-executive sessions with the auditor.\n\n## Strategic focus points in 2020\n\nIn line with its main duties and responsibilities, the Board reviewed and approved strategic plans during its strategy session in May. The main focus points of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be performance, growth, innovation, responsibility and portfolio development (read more on pages 24-37). An essential part of the Board's annual strategy-related work is to oversee the assessment and management of risks related to the Company's strategy and operations. These risks and opportunities and their impact on operations and strategy are described on pages 62-63.\n\nIn 2020, the Board continued to focus on the major strategic investment in Uruguay, the platform development project. The Board has been closely reviewing the status and the feasibility of this project since 2016 and has conducted several status reviews, including risk assessments, in its meetings since then. The investment will raise UPM's pulp production capacity by more than 50% and significantly contribute to future earn-\n\nings. Read more on this strategic investment on pages 44-45 and on the corporate website at upm.uy/en/growth.\n\nIn January the Board made another strategic investment decision regarding a biorefinery in Leuna, Germany. UPM will invest EUR 550 million in an industrial scale biorefinery to convert solid wood into next generation biochemicals. The biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals that enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses. Both major investment projects proceeded according to the plan throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with high health and safety standards ensuring safe working conditions. The Board has regularly been reviewing the status of the projects. Read more on this strategic investment on pages 58-59 and on the corporate website at www.upmbiochemicals. com/biorefinery.\n\n## Board performance evaluation\n\nThe Board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance and working methods, including an evaluation of the performance and working methods of its committees. In addition, the committees each evaluate their performance and working methods on an annual basis. Identified areas for improvement are considered when planning the Board-related work, and the Nomination and Governance Committee takes the results into consideration when preparing its proposal for the composition of the Board to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn 2020, the evaluation was conducted as a self-assessment and its results were reviewed and discussed at the Board meeting in December. The Board members evaluated the performance of the Board and of the committees in relation to their duties and responsibilities, Board and committee composition and structure, Board culture, e/ffectiveness of Board and Committee meetings, the individual performance of Board members and the performance of the Chair of the Board. The overall results of the 2020 self-assessment survey were highly favourable and indicated that the Board, Chair of the Board and the Board Committees are functioning e/ffectively and Board members are committed to the Board work.",

        "page_content": "## Board committees\n\nThe Board has three committees that assist it in preparing matters to be decided by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 The Remuneration Committee and\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee\n- \u00b7 The Nomination and Governance Committee\n\nThe Committees also assist the Board in its oversight and monitoring responsibilities. The Board remains responsible for the performance of any duties assigned to the Committees.\n\nThe written committee charters approved by the Board of Directors set forth the purpose, composition, operations and duties of each committee, as well as the prerequisites of committee membership. Each committee is responsible for performing the duties assigned to it in its charter.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee assisted the Board in reviewing the composition, qualification criteria and duties of the Board committees, and made a proposal to the Board for the appointment of committee members and Chairs. The members appointed to the Board committees in the Board's constitutive meeting on 31 March 2020 are shown in the table on the previous page. Neither the President and CEO nor other Company executives may be members of any Board committees.\n\nThe committees hold their meetings prior to Board meetings in order to prepare matters to be decided by the Board. In the Board meeting following the committee meeting, the Chairs of the committees report to the Board on the matters discussed and the actions taken by the committees. Furthermore, minutes and committee meeting materials are available to all directors.\n\n## Committee-related work in 2020\n\nThe importance and extent of the work of the Committees has increased in recent years and will further increase following the continuous changes in the regulatory framework and the Company's business environment. This is also reflected in the committee charters and in the topics and matters the committees were involved with in addition to their regular duties throughout the year.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting processes and internal control, internal audit and risk management and for monitoring the Company's audit and compliance procedures. In 2020, the Committee held five meetings. In addition to the Committee's assigned matters and reports, it also reviewed reports on non-financial matters, cyber security, UPM's COVID-19 related response plans and climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD). Furthermore, the Committee also reviewed the preparation of UPM's Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme.\n\nThe Audit Committee has prepared the Board's proposal for the election and remuneration of the auditor to be submitted at the AGM 2021. In this context, the Committee evaluated the qualifications and independence of the auditor, as well as the audit-related and non-audit-related services provided by the auditor. The evaluation included an assessment of the e/ffectiveness of the audit process, the quality of the audit, the performance of the lead auditor and the audit team and the cooperation with the auditor's international audit network. As a result of this evaluation, the Committee recommended to the Board the re-election of PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy as the Company's auditor, and the Board concurred with this proposal and has made a corresponding proposal to the AGM 2021. Following the stipulations of the Auditor Regulation, the last year that PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy can act as the Company's auditor is 2023.\n\nThe lead audit partner attended all Committee meetings and reported to the Committee on the interim procedures and findings, as well as quarterly audit and non-audit fees and services. The Committees' standard procedures also include quarterly sessions with the internal auditor, with the lead audit partner, with management and among Committee members.\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, Authorised Public Accountant Mikko Nieminen would continue as the lead audit partner.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the Company's remuneration principles and practices and for\n\nplanning the remuneration and succession of the President and CEO, as well as other senior executives. In 2020, the Committee held three meetings. In addition to the Committee's regular duties, it focused on the Remuneration Policy presented to the Annual General Meeting 2020, as well as the preparation of the Remuneration Report to be presented to shareholders at the AGM 2021 for the first time.\n\n## Nomination and Governance Committee\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee is responsible for the composition, diversity and remuneration of the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance. In addition to the Committee's assigned matters and reports, in 2020 it also focused on the new requirements for remuneration reporting as set out in the new CG Code, as well as considering the arrangements for the AGM in the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee conducted its annual review of the structure, size, composition, diversity and succession needs of the Board as a whole, including whether the Board reflects an appropriate balance of sound judgement and a diverse range of business expertise, skills, experience, independence, availability of service to the Company and other desired qualities. As a result of careful search and selection e/fforts, the Nomination and Governance Committee has proposed that Jari Gustafsson be elected as a new member of the Board at the AGM 2021. Of the incumbent directors Ari Puheloinen and Veli-Matti Reinikkala will not be available for re-election. The Nomination and Governance Committee's proposal on the composition of the Board in 2021 and the Board's assessment of the independence of potential Board members is available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/ agm2021.\n\n## Executive management\n\nJussi Pesonen has been the President and Chief Executive O/fficer of UPM-Kymmene Corporation since January 2004. According to his service agreement, Jussi Pesonen would have been entitled to retire in November 2020 at the age of 60.

The reporting has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.\n\nOur GRI index document shows where the disclosures of material topics and general disclosures are addressed in the Annual Report, on UPM's webpage or in the GRI index document itself. It also includes information on omissions, additional explanations and disclosures on the management approach. The document is available on the UPM webpage upm.com/responsibility.\n\nUPM is also committed to the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness as defined in the AA 1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (2008).\n\nThe English version of the corporate responsibility information for 2020 has been assured by an independent third party, PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy (see the Independent Assurance Report below) and identified in the GRI content index. Congruence between the English and Finnish version has been checked.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independent Practitioner's Assurance Report\n\nTo the Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation\n\nFurthermore, the assurance engagement has covered UPM-Kymmene Corporation's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles with moderate (limited) level of assurance.\n\nWe have been engaged by the Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation (hereinafter also 'the Company') to perform a limited assurance engagement on selected corporate responsibility information for the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2020, disclosed in UPM-Kymmene Corporation's Annual Report 2020 and on its website in section 'Responsibility' (hereinafter 'the CR Reporting'). The assured information is indicated in the Company's GRI Content Index 2020 on the Company's website.\n\n## Management's responsibility\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is responsible for preparing the CR Reporting in accordance with the Reporting criteria as set out in the Company's reporting instructions and the GRI Standards Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. The Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is also responsible for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of CR Reporting that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is also responsible for the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness as set out in AccountAbility's AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard 2008.\n\n## Practitioner's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the CR Reporting and on the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information'. That Standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the CR Reporting is free from material misstatement.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other disclosures in the CR Reporting, and about the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. The procedures\n\nIn addition, we have conducted our work in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance Standard 2008. For conducting a Type 2 assurance engagement as agreed with the Company, the AA1000AS (2008) requires planning and performing of the assurance engagement to obtain moderate (limited) assurance on whether any matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation does not adhere, in all material respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and that the CR Reporting is not reliable, in all material respects, based on the Reporting criteria.\n\nselected depend on the practitioner's judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the CR Reporting and an assessment of the risks of the Company's material nonadherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.\n\n- \u00b7  Interviewing senior management of the Company.\n\nOur work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7  Interviewing employees from various organisational levels of the Company with regards to materiality, stakeholder expectations, meeting of those expectations, as well as stakeholder engagement.\n- \u00b7  Assessing the Company's defined material corporate responsibility topics as well as assessing the CR Reporting based on these topics.\n- \u00b7  Assessing stakeholder inclusivity and responsiveness based on the Company's documentation and internal communication.\n- \u00b7  Visiting the Company's Head O/ffice as well as two sites in Finland and Germany. Visits were conducted virtually.\n- \u00b7  Assessing how group employees apply the reporting instructions and procedures of the Company.\n- \u00b7  Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting the information presented in the CR Reporting at the group level as well as at the site level.\n- \u00b7  Testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7  Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation's CR Reporting for the reporting period ended 31 December 2020 is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria,\n\nor that the CR Reporting is not reliable, in all material respects, based on the Reporting criteria.\n\nWhen reading our assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of sustainability information should be taken into consideration.\n\nFurthermore, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation does not adhere, in all material respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.\n\nOur assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to UPM-Kymmene Corporation for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached.\n\n## Observations and recommendations\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, we provide the following observations and recommendations in relation to UPM-Kymmene Corporation's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. These observations and recommendations do not a/ffect the conclusions presented earlier.\n\nRegarding Materiality: UPM-Kymmene Corporation has a systematic process in place to evaluate and determine the materiality of corporate responsibility topics. Materiality analysis is updated periodically. We recommend that the Company continues to further develop proactive dialogue with its stakeholders to determine and evaluate material topics.\n\nRegarding Inclusivity: UPM-Kymmene Corporation has processes in place for stakeholder inclusivity both at the group and at the business level.  Due to changes in market conditions, additional stakeholder expectations have been considered. We recommend that the Company continues continuous monitoring of changes across stakeholder expectations through established procedures to ensure inclusivity of stakeholders.\n\n## Regarding Responsiveness:\n\nUPM-Kymmene Corporation has processes in place for responding to stakeholder needs. Due to changes in market conditions, responsiveness towards stakeholder expectations required adjustments. We recommend that the Company maintains its systematic approach to respond to stakeholder's expectations.\n\n## Practitioner's independence, qualifications and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur multi-disciplinary team of corporate responsibility and assurance specialists possesses the requisite skills and experience within financial and non-financial assurance, corporate responsibility strategy and management, social and environmental issues, as well as the relevant industry knowledge, to undertake this assurance engagement.\n\n## Helsinki 18 February 2021 PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nMikko Nieminen Partner Authorised Public Accountant\n\nJussi Nokkala Director Sustainability & Climate Change",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Board of Directors\n\n## UPM introduction and business model\n\nUPM leads the forest-based bioindustry into a sustainable and innovation-driven future across six business areas: UPM Biorefining, UPM Energy, UPM Raflatac, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Communication Papers and UPM Plywood. These business areas are competitive, with strong market positions.\n\nUPM provides sustainable and safe solutions to the growing global consumer demand. Products are made from renewable materials and are recyclable.\n\nUPM group creates value to its stakeholders by operating separate businesses with a focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 Competitive and sustainable wood sourcing, forestry and plantation operations\n- \u00b7 Value adding, efficient and responsible global functions\n- \u00b7 Continuous improvement (Smart) programmes\n- \u00b7 Technology and intellectual property rights\n- \u00b7 A global platform to build on\n- \u00b7 Disciplined and effective capital allocation\n- \u00b7 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, UPM Code of Conduct and corporate policies\n\n## Market environment in 2020\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures led to significant uncertainty, a sharp decline in global output and a severe global recession. Global real GDP growth is projected at -4.0% in 2020. The effects of the pandemic varied across industry sectors and caused significant fluctuations in consumer spending. Recovery in China in the second half of the year was robust but at the same time many countries were forced to slow reopening processes, while some even had to reinstate lockdowns.\n\nThe pandemic highlighted the urgent need for health and economic policy action. The global trade tensions between major economic regions such as the US and China continued with lower focus in 2020 and Brexit plans remained uncertain throughout the year. The UK-EU Free Trade Agreement was announced just before the UK's year-long transition out of the EU ended at the end of 2020.\n\nIn Europe, economic growth is projected at around -6.7% in 2020. The containment measures to prevent the spread of the virus severely impacted the economy and brought about a reduction in consumption. Meanwhile, massive economic policy measures protected businesses somewhat and softened the rise in unemployment.\n\nEconomic growth in the US is projected at around -3.6% in 2020. The US failed to keep the spread of COVID-19 under control and the rate of unemployment was weaker than anticipated. However, the financial markets remained resilient and US stocks repeatedly hit record highs as historically large US stimulus packages raised optimism surrounding economic recovery.\n\nIn China, economic growth slowed to 2.1%. China managed to suppress the COVID-19 pandemic well. Key industries benefited from strong export. Still, the rebound was unbalanced as private consumption remained weaker and fiscal deficit continued to climb.\n\nEven as the world focused on the pandemic in 2020, seizing the sustainability opportunity continued. As governments took urgent actions\n\n## Clear roles and responsibilities\n\n| Group                  | Businesses                                 |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Portfolio strategy     | Business area                              |\n| Capital allocation     | strategies                                 |\n| Business targets       | Commercial excellence                      |\n| Code of Conduct        | Operational excellence Cost efficiency     |\n| Responsibility targets | measures Focused growth project Innovation |\n\n## Outcomes\n\nTop performance Competitive advantage Value creation Stakeholder and societal value License to operate\n\nEach business area is responsible for executing its own strategy and achieving targets. Group direction and support from global functions enable the businesses to capture benefits from UPM's brand, scale and integration, while navigating the complex operating environment. Capital allocation decisions take place at the group level.\n\nCorporate responsibility is an integral part of all of our operations and a source of competitive advantage. UPM is committed to continuous improvement in financial, social and environmental performance. UPM promotes responsible practices throughout the value chain and is active in finding sustainable solutions, in co-operation with its customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nand laid the foundations for financial, economic and social recovery, they increasingly integrated climate action into their development plans and pledged support for climate-related investments.\n\nInflation in advanced economies remained low and below prepandemic levels in 2020. However, despite the global economic recession, commodity prices increased in response to supply disruptions and the anticipation of a recovery in 2021. Oil markets were hit by the pandemic and the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war. UPM's input costs were lower in comparison with the previous year, especially in fibre.\n\nThe US dollar weakened against the euro and other key currencies during 2020. Overall, the impact from changing currencies to UPM's businesses was moderate throughout 2020.\n\nMarket demand for UPM's products was both negatively and positively influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the related containment measures and the economic recession. Demand for graphic papers was the most severely affected. In Europe, demand for graphic papers was 18% lower than in the previous year. Prices decreased for all paper grades throughout the year.\n\nGlobal demand growth for chemical pulp continued good in 2020 and market pulp shipments improved from the weak comparison year 2019. Growth was mainly driven by China. Pulp prices decreased significantly from the previous year and were low relative to marginal producers' cash cost levels. However, pulp prices started to improve towards end of the year.\n\nDemand for advanced renewable diesel and naphtha continued to evolve positively, driven by climate change mitigation targets, stricter environmental standards and sustainability.\n\nFinland's electricity consumption was volatile in 2020. Hydropower generation levels were good and above normal at the end of the year. The annual generation of nuclear power was somewhat lower than in the previous year. Electricity sales prices in Finland were lower.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n2\n\nThe growth of global demand for self-adhesive label materials was strong in the first half of the year, especially in consumer goods and ecommerce-driven labelling due to COVID-19-related lockdowns and changes in consumer behaviour. In the second half of the year the demand normalised somewhat due to destocking in the customer value chain. However, demand resumed growth partly driven by the second wave of the pandemic towards end of the year.\n\nThe growth in demand for label, release and packaging papers was strong and driven by consumable goods and e-commerce. Demand for office paper in the Asia-Pacific region decreased in the first half of the year but improved in the second half. Market prices in China were lower than in the previous year but improved towards the end of the year.\n\nMarket demand for plywood in Europe slowed down in 2020. Demand for spruce plywood was good and birch plywood-related industrial applications were modest. Uncertainties in the global economy and intense competition impacted market prices.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures around the world continue to represent significant uncertainty in 2021.\n\n## Global economy\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures resulted in a sharp decline in the global economy in 2020. In the first phase of the recession, the pandemic containment measures and lockdowns around the world severely limited or temporarily stopped significant parts of the economy. It is uncertain how potent the following recovery will be and how long it will take for the world economy to reach the pre-pandemic level of activity. Despite the start of vaccinations, additional waves of the epidemic in different parts of the world remain possible.\n\n## Safety and business continuity\n\nUPM has implemented extensive precautions to protect the health and safety of its employees and to ensure business continuity and progress of its strategic projects during the pandemic. Despite these efforts, the operation of one or more units or the supply chain and logistics could be temporarily disrupted during the pandemic and the related lockdown measures. In these circumstances some units would need to limit operations or be temporarily shut down.\n\nSo far UPM has been able to protect its employees and business continuity well.\n\n## Demand for UPM products\n\nMany of UPM products serve essential everyday needs and may therefore see relatively resilient demand during the crisis. These products include pulp, specialty papers and self-adhesive label materials. Even in these businesses, demand is influenced by general economic activity, however.\n\nDemand for graphic papers, plywood and timber is more prone to be impacted by the lockdowns and the recession. The lockdowns limit a wide range of consumer-driven services and retail, as well as work at the office. This has had a negative impact on printed advertising and graphic paper demand during the pandemic.\n\nThe lockdowns and the level of economic activity may also affect demand for electricity.\n\nIn Q2 2020, graphic paper demand in Europe decreased by 32% from the previous year, as particularly advertising-driven paper\n\nconsumption and office paper demand were impacted by the lockdowns across Europe. In Q3 2020, there was some recovery in demand, but graphic paper demand remained 18% lower than in the previous year. In Q4 2020, a second wave of COVID-19 was under way in Europe, with gradual introduction of new lockdowns in various countries. Graphic paper demand was 14% lower than in the previous year.\n\nPulp demand held up relatively well, supported by good demand for tissue and hygiene products as well as for some packaging and specialty paper products. Pulp consumption in graphic paper production decreased.\n\nDemand grew for self-adhesive label materials and specialty papers during the lockdowns, as consumers shifted some of their spending from away-from-home categories to packaged daily consumer goods. E -commerce continued to grow, supporting some labelling and specialty paper applications. In Q2, demand for self-adhesive labels in Europe grew by 10% from the previous year. In Q3 2020, demand for selfadhesive labels in Europe was 3% lower than in the previous year, driven by destocking in the customer value chain. In Q4 2020, demand for self-adhesive labels resumed 7% growth year-on-year, partly impacted by the re-established lockdowns.\n\n## Adjusting to different scenarios\n\nThe potential impacts to UPM are likely to differ by business and by the phase of the pandemic, lockdown measures, changes in consumer behaviour, the recession and recovery. UPM is using shift arrangements, temporary layoffs, or reduced working hours as required to adjust its operations in different scenarios. During Q3 2020, the company also announced plans to permanently reduce graphic paper production capacity and other plans to improve cost efficiency in different businesses and functions.\n\n## Projects and maintenance shutdowns\n\nThe pandemic and the required health and safety measures add challenge to large investment projects and maintenance shutdowns. UPM's transformative pulp project in Uruguay and biochemicals project in Germany are proceeding with strict health and safety controls. Despite these efforts, some changes to the detailed timeline of the projects are possible during the pandemic and the related containment measures. Currently the projects proceed in line with the planned startup timeline.\n\nIn April TVO announced that fuel loading into the OL3 reactor would not happen as planned in June 2020, TVO announced an updated schedule in August 2020.\n\nUPM rescheduled two pulp mill maintenance shutdowns from Q2 2020 to Q4 2020 due to the pandemic. The two shutdowns were successfully completed in Q4 with strict health and safety controls.\n\n## Financing\n\nUPM's financial position is strong. UPM's net debt was EUR 56 million at the end of Q4 2020. Cash funds and unused committed credit facilities totalled EUR 3.2 billion at the end of Q4 2020. This includes the sustainability-linked five-year EUR 750 million revolving credit facility signed during Q1 2020, the EUR 550 million of bilateral committed credit facilities signed during Q2 2020 and EUR 158 million equivalent rolling overdraft facility. During Q4 2020, UPM successfully issued a EUR 750 million Green Bond under its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme. The facilities and UPM's outstanding debt have no financial covenants.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n3",

Sales decreased for UPM Communication Papers, UPM Biorefining, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Plywood and UPM Energy, and increased slightly for UPM Raflatac.\n\nComparable EBIT decreased by 32% to EUR 948 million, which was 11.1% of sales (1,404 million, 13.7%).\n\nSales prices decreased for all UPM's business areas, mostly in UPM Biorefining and UPM Communication Papers. At the group level, the negative impact of lower sales prices was clearly larger than the positive impact of decreased variable costs.\n\nFixed costs decreased by EUR 140 million, partly due to temporary measures to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production and delivery volumes were lower, especially for UPM Communication Papers, as the COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures reduced demand for graphic papers. The industry-wide strike in Finland impacted both delivery volumes and fixed costs in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nDepreciation, excluding items affecting comparability, totalled EUR 471 million (477 million) including depreciation of leased assets totalling EUR 73 million (72 million). The change in the fair value of forest assets net of wood harvested was EUR -25 million (26 million).\n\nOperating profit totalled EUR 761 million (1,344 million). Items affecting comparability in operating profit totalled EUR -187 million in the period (-60 million), including EUR 90 million in restructuring\n\ncharges related to the closure of the UPM Kaipola paper mill, EUR 85 million in restructuring charges related to closure of the UPM Chapelle paper mill, EUR 23 million in restructuring charges related to the closure of the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 plywood mill, EUR 6 million in charges related to the restructuring of the functions of UPM Communication Papers, EUR 9 million in charges related to restructuring of the functions of UPM Raflatac, earnings of EUR 12 million on the sale of the group's share in Kainuun Voima Oy and earnings of EUR 11 million on the sale of other non-current assets.\n\nNet interest and other finance income and costs were EUR -26 million (-38 million). Exchange rate and fair value gains and losses were EUR 2 million (0 million). Income taxes totalled EUR 169 million (234 million).\n\nProfit for 2020 was EUR 568 million (1,073 million), and comparable profit was EUR 737 million (1,119 million).\n\n## Financing and cash flow\n\nIn 2020 cash flow from operating activities before capital expenditure and financing totalled EUR 1,005 million (1,847 million). Working capital increased by EUR 93 million (decreased by 276 million).\n\nNet debt was EUR 56 million at the end of Q4 2020 (-453 million). The gearing ratio as of 31 December 2020 was 1% (-4%). The net debt to EBITDA ratio, based on the last 12 month's EBITDA, was 0.04 at the end of the period (-0.24).\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n4\n\nOn 31 December 2020 UPM's cash funds and unused committed credit facilities totalled EUR 3.2 billion. This includes the sustainabilitylinked five-year EUR 750 million revolving credit facility signed in Q1 2020, the EUR 550 million of bilateral committed credit facilities signed in Q2 2020 and the EUR 158 million equivalent rolling overdraft facility.\n\nOn 13 November 2020 UPM issued a EUR 750 million Green Bond under its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme.\n\nA dividend of EUR 1,30 per share (totalling EUR 693 million) was paid on 16 April 2020 for the 2019 financial year.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nIn 2020, capital expenditure totalled EUR 903 million, which was 10.5% of sales (378 million, 3.7% of sales). Capital expenditure does not include additions to leased assets.\n\nIn 2021, UPM's total capital expenditure, excluding investments in shares, is expected to be about EUR 2,000 million, which includes estimated capital expenditure of approximately EUR 1,800 million in transformative projects. Transformative projects consist of the new pulp mill, port operations, local investments outside the mill fence in Uruguay and the biochemicals biorefinery in Germany.\n\nIn April 2018, UPM announced that it would rebuild paper machine 2 at its Nordland mill in D\u00f6rpen, Germany, and convert it from fine paper to glassine paper production. The machine was equipped with new finishing equipment and started producing glassine paper in Q1 2020. The capacity after the rebuild is 110,000 tonnes per year. The total investment in Nordland was EUR 124 million.\n\nIn January 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in the refurbishment of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in Finland. The average annual production of the Kuusankoski plant is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh. The investment will be completed by the end of 2022.\n\nIn July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest USD 2.7 billion in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros in central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest approximately USD 280 million in port operations in Montevideo and USD 70 million in local investments outside the mill fence, including a new residential area in Paso de los Toros. The mill is scheduled to start up in the second half of 2022.\n\nIn October 2019, UPM announced that it would invest EUR 95 million in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant at the UPM Nordland paper mill in Germany. The plant is planned to go on grid in Q3 2022. The annual cost savings of more than EUR 10 million will begin in 2023. The investment is estimated to decrease UPM's CO2footprint by 300,000 tonnes.\n\nIn January 2020, UPM announced that it would invest EUR 550 million in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany. The facility is scheduled to start up by the end of 2022.\n\n## Personnel\n\nIn 2020, UPM had an average of 18,557 employees (19,185). At the beginning of the year the number of employees was 18,742 and at the end of 2020 it was 18,014.\n\nFurther information about personnel is available in \u00bb Our People section in UPM Annual report 2020.\n\n## Uruguay pulp mill investment\n\nOn 23 July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest USD 2.7 billion in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros in central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest approximately USD 280 million in port operations in Montevideo and USD 70 million in local investments outside the mill fence, including a new residential area in Paso de los Toros. The mill is scheduled to start up in the second half of 2022.\n\nThe investment will grow UPM's current pulp capacity by more than 50%, resulting in a step change in the scale of UPM's pulp business as well as in UPM's future earnings.\n\nWith a combination of competitive wood supply, scale, best available techniques and efficient logistics, the mill is expected to reach a highly competitive cash cost level of approximately USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp. This figure includes the variable and fixed costs of plantation operations, wood sourcing, mill operations and logistics delivered to the main markets. Furthermore, the safety and sustainability performance of the value chain from plantations to customer delivery is expected to be on an industry-leading level.\n\n## Competitive wood supply\n\nEucalyptus availability for the mill is secured through UPM's own and leased plantations, as well as through wood sourcing agreements with private partners. The plantations that UPM owns and leases in Uruguay cover 434,000 hectares. They will supply the current UPM Fray Bentos mill and the new mill near Paso de los Toros.\n\n## State of the art mill design\n\nThe pulp mill has been designed as an efficient single-line operation. The machines, materials, level of automation and standards enable a high operating rate and maintainability, as well as high energy output. This ensures excellent safety, high environmental performance and low operating costs during the long lifecycle of the mill.\n\nThe mill is designed to fully meet the strict Uruguayan environmental regulations, as well as international standards and recommendations for modern mills, including the use of the latest and best available technology (BAT). The mill's environmental performance will be verified through comprehensive and transparent monitoring.\n\nThe mill's initial annual production capacity is 2.1 million tonnes, and the environmental permits enable further capacity potential. When in operation, the mill generates more than 110 MW surplus of renewable electricity.\n\n## Efficient logistics set-up\n\nAn efficient logistics chain will be secured by the agreed road improvements, extensive railway modernization and port terminal construction.\n\nThe Public-Private-Partnership agreement between the government and the construction company for the construction of the central railway was signed in May 2019. Works on the central railway are proceeding with earth moving and levelling, but the overall rail project is currently behind the original schedule by several months. UPM has a contingency plan in place to ensure logistics with truck transportation in case of a delay.\n\nUPM is proceeding with the construction of a deep-sea pulp terminal at Montevideo port with an investment of approximately USD 280 million. Direct rail access from the mill to a modern deep-sea port terminal creates an efficient supply chain to world markets. The Montevideo deep-sea port also enables synergies in ocean logistics with UPM's existing Uruguay operations.",

        "page_content": "UPM has entered into a port terminal concession agreement in 2019 and signed an agreement on rail logistics services in October 2020. Both agreements are considered in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. The total amount of such lease payments is expected to be USD 200 million.\n\n## Significant impact on the Uruguayan economy\n\nBased on independent socioeconomic impact studies, the mill is estimated to increase Uruguay's gross national product by about 2% and the annual value of Uruguay's exports by approximately 12% after completion.\n\nIn the most intensive construction phase, more than 6,000 people will be working on the site. When completed, approximately 10,000 permanent jobs are estimated to be created in the Uruguayan economy of which approximately 4,000 would involve direct employment by UPM and its subcontractors. About 600 companies are estimated to be working in the value chain.\n\nThe mill will be located in one of Uruguay's many free trade zones and will pay a fixed annual tax of USD 7 million. The mill's value chain is expected to contribute USD 170 million in annual taxes and social security payments and to contribute USD 200 million annually in wages and salaries.\n\n## Project schedule and capital outflow\n\nThe mill is expected to start up in the second half of 2022. The project is proceeding according to the planned schedule. Approximately 3,000 people are currently working on the project at the various construction sites. Due to the COVID-19 health emergency, special protocols are in place and UPM is swabbing all workers at the pulp mill site in Paso de los Toros returning to work after the holiday period in January 2021.\n\nAt the pulp mill site in Paso de los Toros, civil works are progressing in all main process areas, including wood handling, recovery island, fibre line, drying and bale unloading according to the plans. Moreover, the mechanical erection phase started in January 2021 as planned.\n\nThe temporary and permanent housing construction are also proceeding as planned, with about 90% of the works completed, and housing areas are already in use by the construction workers.\n\nAt the pulp terminal in Montevideo, main pier and tank area construction are proceeding and the pulp warehouse and unloading area erection is ongoing.\n\nThe main part of the total capital expenditure of USD 3 billion will take place in 2020-2022. UPM will hold 91% ownership of the project and a local long-term partner which has also been involved in UPM Fray Bentos, owns 9%. UPM's investment will mainly be financed from operating cash flow complemented by regular group financing activities.\n\n## Biochemicals refinery investment\n\nOn 30 January UPM announced that it would invest EUR 550 million in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals refinery in Leuna, Germany. The biorefinery is scheduled to start up by the end of 2022.\n\nThe biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, which will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses. The investment opens totally new markets for UPM, with large growth potential for the future.\n\nAn industrial scale biorefinery will convert solid wood into next generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and ligninbased renewable functional fillers.

This also includes risks that can be avoided through careful planning and evaluation of future projects and business environments.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of UPM's management system as risk taking is a normal part of business operations. While executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and manufacturing units are exposed to a number of risk and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing of risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management function.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee, chaired by the CFO, is responsible for recommending risk tolerances and profile to the President and CEO and the Strategy Team. The Strategy Team is responsible for aligning risk management priorities, business and risk management strategies and policies.\n\nThe Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit Committee, monitors and assesses the effectiveness of the company's risk management systems and oversees the assessment and management of risks related to the company's strategy and operations. The Audit Committee oversees that risk management activities are aligned with the Risk Management Policy, and that risk assessments are used to guide internal audit activities.\n\nUPM seeks to transfer insurable risks through insurance arrangements for any risks that exceed the defined tolerance.\n\nUPM strives to ensure compliance with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. To enhance compliance and mitigate risks, UPM performs risk assessments, training and monitoring at regular intervals.\n\nUPM has developed and implemented a comprehensive internal control system that covers business and financial reporting processes. Internal control is aimed at ensuring that the company's operations are efficient and reliable, and in compliance with statutory requirements, and that the company's financial reporting is accurate and reliable, and reflects operational results. Internal control pertaining to financial reporting is described in the Corporate Governance Statement available in the corporate website.\n\nThe main risk factors that can materially affect the company's business, financial results and non-financial performance are set out below. They have been classified as strategic risks, operational risks, and financial risks. Risks may also arise from legal proceedings incidental to UPM's operations.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Uncertainties in the economic and political operating environment\n\nThe main short-term uncertainties in UPM's earnings relate to sales prices and delivery volumes of its products, as well as to changes in the main input cost items and currency exchange rates, most of which are affected by uncertainty in the global, regional or local economic and political conditions. Political developments are causing uncertainties to the global economy. Such uncertainties also affect UPM's customers influencing the demand for UPM's products.\n\nExamples of such developments are the trade tensions between the United States, the EU and China, the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK after its exit from the EU as well as increased\n\ngeopolitical tensions. UPM is also exposed to the impacts of certain governmental protection and trade protection measures that safeguard domestic industries and other changes affecting international trade. Restrictions on import and export and other national interests may affect the availability of necessary raw materials, and changes in the international trade agreements. COVID -19 related containment measures and the economic downturn or global power struggles continue to cause high uncertainty to global trade, geopolitics or trajectories of economies.\n\nUPM is especially exposed to the economic and political conditions in countries in which UPM has significant production operations and ongoing investment projects, such as Finland, Uruguay and Germany. UPM also has significant production operations in a number of developing markets, such as China and Russia, where the lack of transparency and predictability of the political, economic and legal systems may lead to an increasing uncertainty and risk level when investing in or operating in them.\n\n## Cyclical and highly competitive markets\n\nIn all markets UPM operates in, the price level is determined by a combination of demand and supply and an imbalance between them could cause the prices of UPM's products to fluctuate significantly. Imbalances in demand and supply may be caused by factors such as decreases or increases in the end-use demand, changes in customer preferences or a new production capacity entering the market or an old production capacity being closed, all of which may affect both the volume and price level of UPM's products.\n\nCompetitor behaviour may also influence the market price development. UPM may, from time to time, experience price pressures from competitors in its main business areas and geographic market areas as well as particularly large fluctuations in operating margins due to this competitive environment.\n\nThe majority of UPM's revenue comes from sales of graphic and specialty papers, pulp and label materials, and UPM principally competes with several large multinational paper and forest product companies as well as with numerous regional or more specialised competitors.\n\n## Changes in consumer behaviour\n\nDemand for UPM's products may be affected by the introduction of substitute or alternative products. The demand for graphic papers in the mature markets is forecast to continue to decline. This will likely increase the pressure on UPM's graphic paper deliveries and sales prices as well as the scarcity of recycled fibre. The COVID -19 pandemic may further amplify the speed of changes adopted by consumers in consuming and communicating information. Changes in demand could also cause overcapacity in some of UPM's products, affecting the sales prices and deliveries of such products.\n\nDepending on the product area, the shifts in consumer demand may either have a positive or an adverse effect on the consumption of UPM's products. For example, UPM expects that there will continue to be a growing need for renewable and recyclable solutions, which creates various opportunities for UPM and drive demand growth for most of UPM's products. At the same time digitalisation and e-commerce have changed consumer behaviour and resulted in decline in demand for graphic papers for various end uses.\n\n## Changes in legislation\n\nUPM is exposed to a wide range of laws and regulations globally. The performance of UPM's businesses, for example the paper, energy, and biofuels businesses, are to a high degree dependent on the regulatory framework for these areas. Changes in regulation, direct and indirect\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n13",

Environmental laws and regulations have become more stringent and may continue to develop to be even more stringent due to various global, regional and national level regulatory initiatives. As these environmental laws and regulations are amended or as their application or enforcement is changed, additional costs in complying with new and more stringent regulations may be imposed on UPM.\n\nUPM's operations require UPM to obtain multiple environmental permits and other licences from relevant authorities and comply with their terms and conditions. These permits and licences may be subject to modification, renewal or, subject to certain conditions, revocation by the issuing authorities. UPM monitors regulatory changes in order to better adapt to the effects of such changes.\n\n## Shareholdings in Pohjolan Voima Oyj\n\nUPM is a shareholder of Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), which is the majority shareholder of Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). TVO is in the process of constructing a third nuclear power plant unit, OL3 EPR, at the Olkiluoto site (OL3). When completed, OL3 will supply electricity to its shareholders on a cost-price principle (so called 'Mankala-principle') that is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala principle, electricity and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective Articles of Association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned. OL3 is expected to increase UPM's electricity generation capacity significantly. UPM's indirect share of OL3 is approximately 31%.\n\nAccording to TVO OL3 was procured as a fixed price turnkey project from a consortium formed by Areva GmbH, Areva NP SAS and Siemens AG (Supplier). Under the plant contract, the consortium companies have joint and several liability for the contractual obligations.\n\nOriginally commercial electricity production at OL3 was scheduled to start in April 2009. However, completion of the project has been delayed. Supplier has updated the schedule for the commissioning of OL3 several times.\n\nIn March 2018 TVO announced that it had signed a comprehensive settlement agreement with Supplier and the Areva Group parent company, Areva SA, a company wholly owned by the French state. The settlement agreement concerns the completion of the OL3 project and related disputes and entered into force in late March 2018. According to TVO, pursuant to the settlement agreement, TVO and Supplier jointly withdrew the pending arbitration proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) rules with respect to costs and losses incurred in relation to delays in the construction of the OL3 project.\n\nIn July 2018, TVO announced that in June 2018 the ICC tribunal had confirmed the arbitration settlement by a consent award, and the arbitration proceedings had been terminated. The parties also withdrew the pending appeals in the General Court of the European Union.\n\nAccording to TVO, the settlement agreement stipulates as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 To provide and maintain adequate and competent technical and human resources for the completion of the OL3 project, Areva will source the necessary additional resources from Framatome S.A.S., whose majority owner is EDF.\n\n- \u00b7 The supplier consortium companies undertake that the funds dedicated to the completion of the OL3 project will be adequate and will cover all applicable guarantee periods, including setting up a trust mechanism funded by Areva companies to secure the financing of the costs of completion of the OL3 project.\n- \u00b7 The turnkey principle of the OL3 plant contract and the joint and several liability of the supplier consortium companies remain in full force.\n- \u00b7 The agreement also noted Supplier's schedule at the time the agreement was signed, according to which regular electricity production in the unit would have commenced in May 2019.\n- \u00b7 The ICC arbitration concerning the costs and losses caused by the delay of the OL3 project is settled by financial compensation of EUR 450 million to be paid to TVO in two instalments by Supplier.\n- \u00b7 The parties withdraw all on-going legal actions related to OL3, including the ICC Arbitration and appeals in the General Court of the European Union.\n- \u00b7 In the event that the Supplier consortium companies fail to complete the OL3 project by the end of 2019, the Supplier consortium companies will pay a penalty to TVO for such delay, the amount of which will depend on the actual time of completion of the OL3 project and may not exceed EUR 400 million.\n\nIn April 2020, TVO announced that it had submitted a permission application to the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) for nuclear fuel loading of the OL3 nuclear power plant unit.\n\nIn August 2020, TVO announced having received an updated rebaseline schedule on the commissioning of OL3 from Supplier. According to the schedule fuel will be loaded into the reactor in March 2021, OL3 will be connected to the grid in October 2021, and regular electricity production will start in February 2022. Realisation of the OL3 EPR nuclear power plant project and preparing the plant unit for production will be continued. Commissioning tests and maintenance work are needed before fuel loading.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic may have significantly added uncertainty to the progress of the project. According to TVO significant arrangements have been made at the OL3 site preventing the coronavirus infections. Despite of coronavirus restrictions, work has been able to continue under special arrangements.\n\nAs announced by TVO, the new management of Areva, the supplier party, is preparing a financial solution to complete the OL3 project until the end of the guarantee period. TVO is also negotiating with Supplier on the terms of completing the OL3 project.\n\nFurther, as announced by TVO, TVO has recognised receivables amounted to the accumulated compensation by the end of Q3 2020 agreed in the comprehensive settlement agreement from supplier. The compensation decreases the historical costs of property, plant and equipment in TVO's balance sheet.\n\nOn 16 December 2020 TVO announced that the shareholders of TVO have signed an additional shareholder loan commitment, comprising a total of EUR 400 million new subordinated shareholder loan agreements. According to TVO with the new shareholder loan commitment, TVO prepares to maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer and equity ratio in order to complete the OL3.\n\nAs announced by TVO, on 17 December 2020, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) affirmed its long-term corporate credit rating 'BB' on TVO and removed it from CreditWatch Negative, where it had been placed on 4 September 2020, with the outlook being negative. According to S&P, the EUR 400 million shareholder loan recently granted to TVO reduces near-term risk and signals that TVO's owners still support the OL3 project, despite the delays it has suffered.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n14\n\nFurther delays to the OL3 project could have an adverse impact on PVO's business and financial position, the fair value of UPM's energy shareholdings in PVO and/or the cost of energy sourced from OL3 when completed. It is possible that the cost of energy sourced from OL3 at the time when it starts regular electricity production may be higher than the market price of electricity at that time.\n\n## Climate change\n\nUPM is exposed to a variety of risks related to climate change. Strategic risks related to climate change include risks concerning competition, markets, customers, products and regulation. For example, unpredictable regulation and subsidies may distort raw material and final product markets and changing costs of greenhouse gas emissions may influence UPM's financial performance. UPM believes that forest, wood-based products and low-carbon energy hold significant value creation potential with respect to renewable and recyclable products.\n\nOther risks related to climate change particularly concern UPM's supply chain as well as the availability and price of major inputs, such as wood and electricity. Climate change may cause exceptional weather events, such as severe storms, floods and draughts, which could, for example, result in unpredictable hydropower availability and wood harvesting conditions. Exceptionally mild winter conditions with a reduced period of frozen soil in the Nordics could affect the harvesting and transport of wood, consequently undermining the stability of raw material supply and potentially increasing the cost of wood. These could also increase the risk of production limitations.\n\n## Loss of major customers and industry consolidation\n\nUPM has several major customers, and the largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 2% of UPM's sales in 2020, and the ten largest customers represented approximately 14% of such sales. Although UPM is not dependent on any specific customer or group of customers, the loss of its major customers, if not replaced on similar terms, could have a material effect on UPM's business. Also, as the size of UPM's customers could increase in connection with industry consolidation, such customers could exert increased bargaining power on all of their suppliers, including UPM. UPM is also exposed to risks related to any deterioration of a major customer group's financial condition.\n\n## Product development, innovation and intellectual property rights\n\nResearch and product development are an important part of UPM's strategy, particularly with regard to new businesses, such as woodbased biofuels, biochemicals and biomedicals. The return on investment of new or enhanced existing products and solutions may not meet targets or improve UPM's competitiveness.\n\nUPM has a broad patent portfolio that provides value creation potential in the future; however, it also exposes UPM to risks related to the protection and management of intellectual property, including patents and trademarks.\n\n## Corporate acquisitions and divestments\n\nUPM's strategy is to grow businesses with strong long-term fundamentals and sustainable competitive advantage. This may result in acquisitions of new businesses or divestments of existing businesses or parts thereof. Carrying out corporate mergers, acquisitions and divestments involves risks relating to the successful implementation of a divestment and the ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses, systems, culture and personnel successfully. In addition, the cost of an acquisition may prove high and/or the anticipated economies of scale or synergies may not materialise. Hidden liabilities of an acquired company (e.g.,\n\ncompetition law liabilities) may also constitute a significant risk in relation to potential acquisitions.\n\nUPM may divest operations or assets to focus on strategic areas. Any future divestments may be affected by many factors that are beyond UPM's control, such as the availability of financing to potential buyers, interest rates and acquirers' capacity, and divestments may also expose UPM to indemnity claims. Furthermore, divestments may involve additional costs due to historical and unaccounted liabilities. The profitability of corporate acquisitions and divestments may differ from UPM's expectations.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Fluctuations in the prices of major inputs as well as changes in their availability\n\nThe main inputs required in the manufacturing of UPM's products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these major production inputs have been volatile in the recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, which may have an effect on the general profitability of the industries in which UPM operates. Climate change may contribute to the increase of the price volatility of UPM's major production inputs. Also, any changes in the current forestry practices and level of harvesting due to negative public opinion towards harvesting could have an effect on the raw material supply and may increase the cost of wood.\n\nGovernmental protection and trade protection measures could also have an effect on the price and availability of raw materials as countries may, for example, enact export ban policies to protect forests or to bolster their domestic timber industry, which could have a material effect on the cost and availability of wood as a raw material for UPM. It is also uncertain how the EU energy policies may affect the availability and costs of fibre and energy. Significant increases in the prices of UPM's major inputs could increase UPM's operating expenses.\n\n## Supplier and subcontractor network and raw materials procurement\n\nUPM's business operations depend on a large number of suppliers and contractors. The majority of UPM's need of wood is covered by suppliers, and other production inputs, such as chemicals, fillers and recovered paper, are fully obtained from suppliers. Disruptions in the supply of key inputs or transportation services could have a significant effect on manufacturing operations. This could, for example, result in interruption or downscaling of production, change in the product mix or increased costs resulting from price increases for critical inputs as well as shifts in the availability and price of wood. Supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which UPM would be able to source its production inputs and could materially affect the prices paid by UPM for these inputs.\n\nThe UPM Supplier and Third Party Code defines the minimum level of performance that UPM requires from its suppliers and third-party intermediaries. UPM carries out supplier risk assessments on, for example, operational, financial, quality and responsibility perspectives. Based on the risk assessment, selected suppliers' activities are evaluated in more detail through annual surveys, supplier audits and joint development plans. If any non-conformities are discovered, the supplier is required to take corrective measures, which UPM follows up on. Some contracts may also be discontinued due to the seriousness of the finding or insufficient corrective measures.\n\n## Management and execution of large investment projects\n\nInvestment projects in UPM's businesses are often large and take one or more years to complete. Participation in large projects involves risks,\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n15",

        "page_content": "such as cost overruns or delays, as well as non-achievement of the economic targets set for the investment. Currently, UPM's largest ongoing investment project is the construction of a new world-class pulp mill in Uruguay, which includes other related investments as well (port, Free Trade Zone infra and housing). Particular to this project is its size, complexity with a number of interconnected sub-projects as well as the level of cooperation with permit and other authorities. Additionally, the second largest ongoing project is the construction of a biochemicals refinery in Germany. This project involves the development of new business concepts and technologies.\n\nUPM is responsible for many projects in several of its countries of operation at any given time. All projects involve technical and operational risks, and projects require continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Managing several projects requires that UPM has sufficient resources and efficient processes. The COVID -19 pandemic and the required additional health and safety measures have also added a new challenge to large investment projects. UPM's transformative pulp project in Uruguay and biochemicals project in Germany are proceeding with strict health and safety controls, but despite these efforts, some changes to the detailed timeline of the projects may occur due to containment measures.\n\n## Unavailability of information systems as well as cybersecurity breaches\n\nUPM's production and business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in critical information system services, loss of critical, financial or personal data due to reasons beyond UPM's control, such as power cuts, software or telecommunication errors or other major disasters, such as fires or natural disasters, as well as user errors by UPM's own personnel or suppliers, can potentially cause major damage to UPM's businesses and disruptions to the continuity of operations.\n\nUPM's information systems may be exposed to various cybersecurity risks. Malicious cyber intrusion could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, production outages and damage to UPM's reputation.\n\n## Litigation and compliance\n\nUPM operates globally in a large number of jurisdictions and complex regulatory frameworks. UPM may from time to time be involved in litigation and other similar proceedings or it could become subject to various claims and actions based on various grounds.\n\nOn a global scale, enforcement activities and jurisdictional reach regarding competition issues and anti-corruption have increased. Also, the recent development of Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) related lawsuits in Germany for alleged non-payment of EEG based surcharges may have an adverse impact on UPM, albeit UPM is not currently a party to any such lawsuits. The UPM Code of Conduct sets the standards of responsible behaviour and it covers topics relating to legal compliance and disclosure, anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nUPM's environmental performance and social responsibility play a significant role in UPM's ability to operate and influence the long-term success of its businesses. UPM has significant manufacturing operations or sourcing in several developing countries, some of which are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval. Breaches of applicable laws and\n\nregulations or corporate policies by UPM employees may lead to legal processes, sanctions and fines as well as reputational damages effecting UPM's operations.\n\n## Labour disruptions\n\nUPM is subject to risk of labour disputes, which could disrupt its business operations or the business operations of its stakeholders. Uncertainty may increase in the Finnish labour market amid the announcement of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation in fall 2020 to transfer collective bargaining to companies. Any labour disputes in UPM's business operations or related sectors could have an effect on UPM's business operations. For example, labour disputes in the transport sector or among other stakeholders important to UPM, may disrupt UPM's operations. Additionally, public dissatisfaction with UPM's labour-related decisions may, in extreme cases, lead to unanticipated boycotts or disruptions at its facilities or construction sites.\n\n## A natural disaster, fire, accident or other calamity at UPM's production facilities\n\nUPM operates a significant number of production facilities globally that are exposed to risks related to environment, fires, natural events, site security and occupational health and safety risks. If UPM's production facilities were to experience a major accident or were forced to shut down or curtail production due to such unforeseen events, such as a leak or spill due to malfunction or human error, this could cause major interruptions in UPM's operations and result in significant costs in order to clean up and repair any potential damages to the production plant and the surrounding areas. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness (such as a COVID -19 infection) or liability to UPM's employees, contractors or third parties. These risks are managed through established management procedures, health and safety precautions and loss prevention programmes. UPM's insurance programme provides coverage for insurable hazard risks, subject to insurance terms and conditions.\n\n## Forests and plantations\n\nUPM's plantations and forests may be affected by the impacts of climate change, which include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, storms, floods and drought. Climate change is expected to have the biggest physical effect on UPM's forest lands in Finland, where temperatures are expected to rise more significantly and rapidly compared with other countries where UPM owns forest. Although forest growth will likely accelerate, particularly in Finland, due to the longer growing season, extreme weather conditions will intensify, presenting new risks. The increase of droughts and fires are estimated to pose the most significant risks for UPM's business. Also, damages caused by insects and tree diseases are becoming increasingly common, which could have an effect on the value of UPM's forest assets. Should these risks materialise, they could harm UPM's forest and plantations resulting in production interruption and additional costs.\n\n## Strategic partners\n\nUPM collaborates with many partners. For example, product development in the biofuels, bioenergy or biochemicals increases the importance of partnerships in the search for new products and businesses or higher efficiency. Partnerships may, however, create risks to the profitability, for example, through changes occurring within the partner entity or changes in how the partnership operates. UPM is also subject to the risk that its strategic partners do not comply with UPM's Code of Conduct with anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n16\n\nPartnership arrangements may also be too rigid to enable timely changes required, for example, in connection with changes in the market conditions or the economy. UPM's partners may have different targets with respect to the business of the partnerships. As UPM may not have sole control over strategic direction and operational output of these entities, its partners may have the right to make certain decisions on key business matters with which UPM does not agree. In some cases, strategic partners may choose not to continue partnerships that they have with UPM.\n\n## Intellectual property rights of third parties\n\nMolecular bioproducts form one of UPM's three strategic focus areas for growth. Initiatives within this strategic focus area are technologyintensive and require increasing investments in such technologies either through internal development or through third party licences or technological partnerships. In addition to UPM's own IPR portfolio, UPM licences certain technologies developed by third parties. Evaluating the rights related to the third party technologies UPM uses or intends to use is increasingly challenging. Licensing third party technology exposes UPM to such risks as the increase of overall licensing costs, loss of negotiation power, the validity of such licensing arrangements and potential infringement claims, which could restrict UPM's ability to use certain technologies, prevent the delivery of UPM's products and/or result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Risk related to IPR claims and disputes relating to technological partnerships have been assessed to increase.\n\n## Building capabilities to growth areas\n\nThe success of UPM's business largely depends on the ability to build the necessary new capabilities required for future growth. UPM is continuously developing its leadership culture, evaluating its recruitment, compensation policies and career development opportunities and taking measures to attract and retain diversely skilled personnel for current and future growth areas.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks are described in consolidated financial statements 2020.\n\n| TYPE OF RISK                                      | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENT NOTE               |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                                       | 4.6 Working capital                                  |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk Interest rate risk | 5.1 Capital management 6.1 Financial risk management |\n| Foreign exchange risk                             | 6.1 Financial risk management                        |\n| Electricity price risk                            | 6.1 Financial risk management                        |\n| Counterparty risk                                 | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting                 |\n\n## Non-financial information\n\nGlobal megatrends represent many long-term opportunities and challenges for UPM towards 2030 and beyond. They are also driving demand for sustainable solutions and responsible business practices.\n\nTo steer its responsibility activities, UPM has established a set of responsibility focus areas with targets and key performance indicators. They are reviewed every year based on a materiality analysis (page 71). The focus areas cover economic, social and environmental responsibility. Economic responsibility at UPM covers economic performance, good governance and compliance, as well as responsible sourcing. Social responsibility focuses on respecting human rights, occupational health and safety and UPM's role as a responsible employer. Environmental responsibility includes sustainable products, the climate and use of forests, as well as water use and waste reduction. Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change is becoming more important all the time, and it is relevant for UPM throughout the whole value chain: land use, sourcing, production and products. Climaterelated targets have been established for all of these areas.\n\nUPM's Biofore strategy guides the company in achieving its responsibility targets for 2030 and in contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development published by the UN.\n\nIn March 2020, UPM became one of the first companies to link the pricing mechanism of a syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) of EUR 750 million to both biodiversity and climate targets. In November 2020, UPM issued its first green bond of EUR 750 million under the EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme. In connection with the programme, a UPM Green Finance Framework was prepared which was rated with the highest-grade by CICERO (Center for International Climate Research).\n\n## Based on international frameworks and commitments\n\nUPM respects international human rights agreements and agreements concerning labour rights, including the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nSince 2003, UPM is a signatory of the UN Global Compact initiative, whose ten universal principles are derived from international agreements in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. And since 2016, UPM has the LEAD participant status for its commitment to the UN Global Compact. In 2020, UPM was one of only 41 global companies to receive this recognition, and the only representative of the forest industry and Finland.\n\nRegarding climate change UPM committed to the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative in 2017 and received validation of its tightened CO2 targets in 2020. To further strengthen its climate approach, UPM committed to the UN's Business Ambition for the 1.5\u00b0C pledge.\n\nUPM follows the Finnish Corporate Governance Code issued by the Securities Market Association and complies with all of its recommendations.\n\n## UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies\n\nUPM's decision making, management and operations are guided by UPM values and the UPM Code of Conduct. Legal compliance and responsible practices are the foundation of all of UPM's businesses and create long-term value for both UPM and its stakeholders. The UPM Code of Conduct emphasises UPM's commitment to business integrity and responsible business operations, manifesting the company's guiding principles.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n17",

        "page_content": "The UPM Code of Conduct is complemented by more detailed policies approved by the Board of Directors and rules or statements approved by the Group Executive Team, business areas or global functions. These policies, rules and statements cover such topics as treasury, taxes, disclosures, insider matters, anti-corruption, competition law, confidentiality, contract management, human resources, the environment, forestry, information security and data protection, and safety. In 2020, the UPM Responsibility Statement, defining responsibility-related principles and commitments relevant to all UPM operations, was issued\n\nUPM requires its suppliers, third party intermediaries and joint venture partners to apply the same principles as in the UPM Code of Conduct and to fulfil criteria concerning social and environmental responsibility. These requirements are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code, latest updates effective as of beginning of 2020.\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct was last updated during 2019, followed by extensive communication and training efforts to enhance our employees' awareness and understanding of its contents.\n\n## Roles of the group management and functions in leading nonfinancial matters\n\nThe Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, is responsible for monitoring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees procedures for treatment of complaints and concerns received by the company, anonymous or otherwise. As part of the committee's compliance review, the committee is provided with a quarterly report by the company's Chief Compliance Officer, and a report of submissions under the company's Report Misconduct channel by the Head of Internal Audit.\n\nIn line with its main duties and responsibilities, the Board reviewed and approved updated strategic plans during its strategy session in May 2020. The main focus areas of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be performance, growth, innovation, responsibility and portfolio development. This strategy is enhanced by the brand promise: Beyond Fossils (read more on pages 26-27). An essential part of the Board's annual strategy work is to review and assess strategic and operational risks and opportunities (see UPM Governance Statement 2020). These risks and opportunities and their impact on operations and strategy are described on pages 36-37.\n\nThe Group Executive Team, headed by the President and CEO, is in charge of the management of corporate responsibility, determining courses of action and guiding development work. In practice, corporate responsibility efforts take place in businesses and functions, and in the Group's Responsibility team, which co-ordinates the projects carried out by businesses and functions.\n\nUPM Legal Function and its Compliance team manage legal compliance programmes and arrange related training at regular intervals for specific target groups, which have been defined based on risk assessments. UPM Sourcing organisations follow clearly defined selection and follow-up processes when evaluating suppliers. Reliable long-term deliveries, product and service quality, financial sustainability of suppliers, social and environmental responsibility and product safety are the key factors when selecting and evaluating suppliers.\n\nWhile executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and production units are exposed to a number of financial and nonfinancial risks and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management Function.\n\n## Management of non-financial matters\n\nUPM's responsibility thinking starts with anticipating, mitigating and managing risks, and extends to creating a competitive advantage and long-term value.\n\nUPM continually strives to reduce its risk exposure and improve its performance by using tools such as certified management systems. Since 2018, all our production sites have a certified ISO 14001 environmental management system. Almost all our production sites and wood-sourcing operations implemented integrated management systems for environmental protection, quality management and occupational health and safety in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 standards. All European pulp and paper mills, as well as the UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill in Uruguay and the UPM Changshu paper mill in China, also adhere to the EU's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). Many of the sites also have energy management systems certified under ISO 50001 or the Finnish ETJ+ system, and food safety management systems certified under ISO 22000, if relevant.\n\nShould stakeholders have any concerns or suspect misconduct, they are encouraged to contact UPM or to use the UPM Report Misconduct channel which was renewed in 2020. The new service is available on the corporate website for both the company's employees and external stakeholders. Operated by an independent external service provider, the service is accessible in over 40 languages, 24/7. In 2020, 23 (31) cases were reported either through the UPM Report Misconduct channel or directly to internal audit. One case related to discrimination. Five cases led to disciplinary action including warnings and terminations of employment.\n\n## Reporting framework used\n\nUPM uses the GRI Standards reporting guidelines published by the Global Reporting Initiative to measure and report on corporate responsibility at group level. UPM's corporate responsibility reporting has been compiled in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.\n\n## Committed to anti-corruption\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct underlines the company's zero tolerance attitude towards corruption and bribery in any form. UPM AntiCorruption Rules explain prohibited conduct and expected ethical behaviour in further detail.\n\nUPM performs anti-corruption risk assessment on a regular basis. The annual risk-assessment process includes a top-down risk discussion with the management of each business area. All UPM group entities are also assessed on the basis of country risk and complexity of operations. UPM operates globally and has significant manufacturing operations in several emerging market countries. Such operations require a number of permits and other licenses from the relevant authorities. Some of the countries where UPM operates are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval.\n\nDue diligence of suppliers and third parties with whom UPM does business is an essential part of UPM's anti-corruption compliance programme. UPM requires that due diligence is performed before entering into or renewing any contract with a third party that meets specified criteria. UPM requires anti-bribery contract terms to be included in agreements with such third parties outlining the third party's commitment to compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and UPM's right to audit the third party to verify compliance with these terms. The company also has corresponding due diligence procedures for joint ventures, including mergers and acquisitions.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n18\n\nIn 2020, UPM updated its anti-corruption e-learning platform. The anti-corruption training covers all white-collar employees. In 2020, the company also launched an e-learning platform to support the implementation of the updated Supplier and Third Party Code. The company organized tailored anti-corruption training workshops for selected target groups across the company and performed risk-based compliance reviews in selected jurisdictions and operations.\n\n## Respect for human rights\n\nUPM is committed to respecting human rights. UPM has assessed all its operations and activity and has identified the potential human rights issues and impacts. When considering both the severity and likelihood of these potential issues and impacts, UPM considers the salient human rights issues in the company's sphere of influence to be environmental pollution, occupational health and safety (OHS), working conditions, protection of children, and forced labour.\n\nIn 2020, UPM reviewed quarterly its human rights risks as part of UPM compliance process and took into use a continuous process for assessing salient human rights issues on a business area level. Grievance mechanisms were strengthened by renewing UPM's Report Misconduct channel.\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nUPM requires its suppliers, third-party intermediaries and joint venture partners to apply the same principles as in the UPM Code of Conduct including commitment to anti-corruption, environmental and social responsibility, safe products, human rights and occupational health and safety practices.\n\nTransparent supplier requirements are the basis for responsible sourcing. These supplier requirements are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code (available on the corporate website). A number of additional requirements are in place for the sourcing of wood, chemicals, pulp and packaging materials, as well as for safety and logistics. All contractors working on site go through UPM's safety requirements and a web-based safety induction training.\n\nUPM identifies its supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts. These responsibility-related risks are determined by the country of origin, sourced material or service, and complexity of supply chain. Based on the risk identification, selected suppliers' activities are evaluated in more detail through EcoVadis and other assessments, supplier audits and joint development plans.\n\nIn 2020, UPM focused on training its sourcing employees on renewed supplier requirements and promoting decent work in supply chain. UPM also assessed working conditions in its logistics chain by interviewing truck drivers in Central-Europe.\n\nUPM continued its cooperation with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative that promotes and improves sustainability practices within the supply chains and its participation to UN Global Compact Action Platform on Decent Work in Global Supply Chains. In 2020, UPM conducted some 290 EcoVadis assessments and 117 supplier audits.\n\n## Social and employee-related matters\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in social and employee-related matters are: learning and development, responsible leadership, diversity and inclusion as well as working conditions.\n\nUPM is committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations. UPM aims to empower and engage employees at all levels through responsible leadership. UPM encourages its employees to pursue professional growth, expects development and supports them in learning skills and developing them further.\n\nUPM respects the privacy of employees and promotes equal opportunities and objectivity in employment and career development. All UPM employees are treated as individuals regardless of gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, etc.\n\nUPM promotes employees' health and wellbeing. Safety is an essential part of UPM's activities and business management system. Equal safety requirements are applied to all employees, visitors and contractors working at UPM's premises.\n\nIn its People Strategy, UPM focused on leadership and creating safe, inclusive & diverse working environment, as well as aiming higher in performance and ensuring growth of our people. In 2020, UPM continued the enabling performance approach by strengthening feedback culture, agile goal setting and frequent manager-employee discussions. Development programs to support skills of asking and giving feedback, high quality conversations and coaching have been continued. To further develop inclusive leadership and culture, UPM continued the dialogue on diversity and inclusion with management teams.\n\nThe proactive safety of employees and contractors has remained an important focus area in 2020. Safety and wellbeing of our employees during global pandemic has been the key priority.\n\n## Product stewardship\n\nMajority of UPM's products are made from renewable raw materials and are recyclable. Product stewardship covers the entire lifecycle of all UPM products from the development phase to the end-use and beyond.\n\nEcodesign and product safety measures ensure that impacts on products and the environment are considered and minimised. In 2020, UPM renewed its sustainable product design concept. One step was the updating of the ecodesign questionnaire to cover the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nUPM provides product declarations to provide customers with easy access to information concerning the responsibility of products' environmental and product safety aspects or the wood origin. In 2020, the collaboration with paper and chemical companies resulted in a new harmonized and transparent way to gather and assess chemical information.\n\nMost of UPM products are certified with widely recognised ecolabels, such as the EU ecolabel and national ecolabels for graphic paper or ISCC and RSB certification for biofuels, biocomposites and labels.\n\nAll of UPM pulp mills, the European sites of UPM Raflatac and UPM Specialty Papers' production lines have implemented ISO 22000 food management systems and the respective products are designed and produced to meet food packaging requirements.\n\n## Environment\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in environmental matters are forests and biodiversity, water use, waste and climate. UPM uses raw materials, water, energy and other resources in a responsible manner and continuously improves its energy, resource and cost efficiency.\n\nUPM is committed to sustainable forestry, and the company uses third-party-verified FSC\u2122 and PEFC chain of custody certification to ensure that the wood it procures is legally sourced from sustainably managed forests. All UPM owned forests are certified, or in the process of certification if acquired recently.\n\nIn 2020, UPM continued to implement its work aimed at positive impact on biodiversity in company forests in Finland. This biodiversity programme is implemented through biodiversity guidelines for operational forestry work, forest protection and cooperation with stakeholders. Biodiversity indicators and monitoring methods have been developed further in 2020.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n19",

        "page_content": "All of UPM's largest production plants are located in areas where there is sufficient water available. The water used by UPM plants comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater resources. UPM uses water responsibly in terms of the company's water consumption and effluent quality. If the price of raw water were to increase by EUR 0.01 per cubic metre, it would mean additional water costs of approximately EUR 4 million annually. In 2020, wastewater volume increased by 2% per tonne of paper and decreased by 4% per tonne of pulp.\n\nCircular economy thinking is at the core of our operations. We have developed innovative ways to reduce and recover waste and to use side streams. For example, tall oil is used for UPM BioVerno renewable diesel and naphtha and ash is utilized in soil stabilisaton, cement industry or as raw material for paper filler production. Regulatory changes can have an impact on the options for waste or residue use, thus causing higher costs for alternative solutions. In 2020, 89 (89)% of UPM's process waste was recovered or recycled.\n\nIn 2020, UPM's environmental investments totalled EUR 6 million (17 million). The largest investments were the modernization of UPM Chudovo plywood mill's wastewater treatment plant and a system to collect rainwater from the wood yards and direct it to the wastewater treatment plant at UPM Kaukas. UPM's environmental costs, which were mainly attributable to effluent treatment and waste management, totalled EUR 110 million (123 million), including depreciation.\n\nThe company-wide Clean Run programme, launched in 2012, aims to improve UPM's environmental performance by bringing environmental issues to the forefront of everyday work. All sites systematically follow up any deviations, proactively report observations and near misses, carry out walks and discussions, and compile detailed risk assessments. Despite the global pandemic, approximately 1,700 (1,900) environmental walks were organised and 2,700 (2,900) preventive environmental observations and near misses were reported in 2020.\n\nThere has been a significant decrease in the number of environmental non-conformances since UPM's internal Clean Run programme was launched in 2012. No major environmental incidents occurred at UPM production plants in 2020. However, a total of 17 (19) temporary deviations from permit limits or limits set by UPM occurred over the course of the year. The deviations were minor contraventions of air emission and water-related limits (7 and 10, respectively). All deviations were immediately reported to the authorities and, where relevant, to local stakeholders. Appropriate measures were taken to normalise the situation and prevent similar occurrences.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe management of climate change related issues is integrated to management of other non-financial issues and is reported to the Board depending on the context and matter. For example: 1) risks are reported to the Board by CFO, 2) related compliance and regulatory issues are briefed quarterly to Audit Committee (Board) by Compliance Officer, 3) annual progress on 2030 responsibility targets is reported by EVP Stakeholder Relations or 4) if there are specific climate-related topics, then responsible topic owner briefs the Board. Additionally, major climate-related issues such as scenario analyses, commitments and UPM's overall approach of acting through forests, emission reductions in production and supply chain and through climate-positive products are reported directly to UPM management bodies led by CEO.\n\nUPM's position and resilience in different climate scenarios (IPCC RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, IEA B2DS, IEA NPS and IEA CPS) have been evaluated for the businesses and functions from both physical and transitional angles, involving expertise from scientific community. Generally, in low- and medium-emission scenarios the transition impacts play a bigger role and UPM is well positioned as its business portfolio allows for flexibility regarding recognised risks and opportunities. In the high-emission scenario physical impacts dominate with severe consequences not only to UPM but the ecosystems and societies over the globe.\n\nUPM's main target related to climate change is reducing fossil CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 65% from 2015 level by 2030. This target was validated by Science-Based Target initiative to be aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway according to Paris agreement. In 2020, fossil CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) summed up to 5.4 million tonnes, which is a decrease of 6% compared to 2019.\n\nFurther targets related to climate change are reducing fossil CO2 emissions from supply chain (Scope 3) by 30% from 2018 level by 2030, climate-positive land use and developing climate-positive product portfolio. Concerning land use, forestry and product portfolio, UPM has engaged with scientific partners in order to gain credible data and approaches.\n\nUPM favours the use of renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources. Biomass-based fuels make up 72% (70%) of fuels used by UPM worldwide. If UPM needed to buy certificates to cover its whole direct fossil CO2 emissions, and if the price of CO2 certificates were to rise by EUR 5 per tonne, it would mean additional costs of approximately EUR 14 million annually.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n20\n\n## UPM climate related disclosures according to TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) is integrated to this report

More information about performance related non-financial topics is available in the general section of the Annual Report and on the UPM website upm.com .\n\n## Research and development\n\n## Innovating for the future\n\nInnovation and R&D programmes are essential in the development of new products and technologies. Research and development funding is primarily being used on studying new technologies and developing businesses and processes. A global network of research centres provides support for UPM's activities in R&D, both in new and existing businesses.\n\nIn 2020, UPM spent EUR 189 (121) million on research and development, making up 18.8% (6.6%) of UPM's operating cash flow. In addition to direct R&D expenditure of EUR 41 (53) million, the figure includes negative operating cash flow and capital expenditure in\n\ndeveloping businesses, transformative business prospects and digitalisation projects.\n\n## Accelerating the development and scale-up of new molecular businesses\n\nMolecular bioproducts form one of UPM's three strategic focus areas for growth. The biorefinery investment in Leuna, Germany, will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to wood-based sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses such as textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging and pharma or cosmetics products.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n22\n\nWe have also successfully entered the biofuels business and built a profitable and sustainable business platform. Development is currently ongoing, with the aim of expanding the biofuels business with new types of technology concepts and biomass-based raw materials.\n\nOur new state-of-the-art R&D Biofore Base in Lappeenranta, Finland, combines research, piloting and analytics, and unites our technologies, globally accumulated experience and expertise in the new and existing businesses. Strategic research further accelerates the commercialisation of bio-based solutions into viable industrial processes in a cost-efficient way. In 2020, special focus was placed on new value chains in our growth businesses: biochemicals, biofuels and specialty packaging.\n\n## Innovating climate-positive products\n\nOur products offer solutions to mitigating climate change as they systematically replace fossil raw materials with bio-based renewable alternatives. Carbon bound from the atmosphere remains in our products over their lifetime, even if they're recycled several times.\n\nWe are committed to a climate-positive product portfolio. Many of our products are already proven to be climate positive. In 2020, we initiated a study on climate-related substitution and the carbon storage effects of our products with two research institutes, the German IFEU (Institut f\u00fcr Energie- und Umweltforschung) and the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). In the future, we aim to scientifically verify the climate impacts of all our products.\n\nOne example of our research related to climate change mitigation is renewable hydrogen. Potential commercial applications using various technologies are evaluated with the aim to lower CO2 emissions. We also became a member of the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance.\n\n## Focus on sustainability and circular economy solutions\n\nOur R&D activities are guided by our aim to meet our 2030 responsibility targets and integrate contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into product development. In 2020, we renewed our sustainable product design concept. One step was the updating of our ecodesign questionnaire to cover SDGs. We carried out a pilot case in the development of sustainable lignin products. In 2021, the work will continue with sustainable packaging and other business areas. Special focus on sustainable product development will be put on circularity.\n\nWe are also examining new ways to utilise sustainable fibre-based materials that are being developed for growing end-uses, such as textiles, nonwovens, hygiene products and flexible packaging. New solutions are developed in collaboration with our businesses, technology partners and customers by using revised ecodesign approach as part of sustainable product development concept. We see the residues and side streams as valuable raw materials and thus real business opportunities.\n\n## Solid patent portfolio creates value\n\nThe significance of the patents, trademarks and intellectual property rights protecting our innovations is even more pronounced in our new businesses, supporting the journey from innovation to business. We have 2,713 patents and patent applications, and 1,360 trademarks globally.\n\nA solid patent portfolio boosts our competitive edge. Licensing of innovations and technologies provides an excellent basis for value creation with customers and technology partners.\n\n## More value from digital opportunities\n\nWe aim to significantly increase the speed and quality of decisionmaking, culture of data utilisation and innovation by leveraging highquality, compliant and modern common data services. Much of what we focus on relates to building the data foundation, including common\n\nplatforms, digital customer experience, digital supply chain and intelligent operations.\n\nAfter having created a rich portfolio of digital projects and initiatives, we created a solid operating model that facilitates datadriven decision making in 2020. As part of the model, data governance management forms an important decision-making body for overseeing the strategic focus areas, data principles and related initiatives. Also in 2020, we created the Data Management Office (DMO) and started to work on UPM's Digi and Data strategy to achieve more impact and business value from the digital and data-driven opportunities.\n\n## Extensive partner network\n\nOur close-knit global partner network is comprised of customers, universities, research organisations, suppliers and start-up companies. Collaboration speeds up the development and launch of new solutions, particularly for new businesses.\n\nThe partnership with the European Joint Undertaking on Bio-Based Industries (BBI) focuses on bio-based products and strengthening their competitiveness in Europe. As a shareholder in the Finnish company CLIC Innovation Ltd, we aim for breakthrough solutions in the bioeconomy, circular economy and cleantech, as well as in smart energy systems. We are also a member of FinnCERES Ecosystem to collaborate on research into lignocellulose-based materials.\n\nIn 2020, UPM Specialty Papers collaborated with 4evergreen Alliance, a initiative by CEPI (the Confederation of European Paper Industries) to further accelerate the fibre-based packaging in the circular economy. UPM Raflatac joined a new global industry-wide consortium CELAB (Creating the Circular Economy for Labelling) to boost liner recycling in the labelling industry. UPM Biofuels joined the BIKE project promoting sustainable biomass value chains for biofuels in Europe.\n\n## The new era of biochemicals\n\nIn January, UPM made the decision to invest EUR 550 million in a biochemical refinery in Leuna, Germany. The investment will open completely new markets for us, with large growth potential for the future.\n\nThe new-to-the-world biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, which will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses such as textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging and variety of rubber applications.\n\nThe total annual capacity of the biorefinery will be 220,000 tonnes. The main products will be bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and ligninbased renewable functional fillers. The biorefinery will also produce biomonopropylene glycol (BioMPG) and industrial sugars.\n\nIn 2020, detailed engineering, procurement and permitting processes of the project were proceeding at full speed. The construction activities for the biorefinery began in October with the official groundbreaking ceremony. The biorefinery is scheduled to start production by the end of 2022.\n\nUPM's biochemicals respond to customers' increasing needs for renewable alternatives. Strong demand-led growth is expected globally as biochemicals are intended mainly to replace chemicals made from fossil raw materials.\n\nThe products can be used to replace oil, gas or coal-based materials. Customers don't need to make changes in their existing value chains as UPM's biochemicals perform consistently in existing production processes and recycling infrastructure. Moreover, they will significantly reduce the CO2 footprint of the end-use products.\n\nThe renewable biochemicals have a huge number of potential industrial and consumer applications.

InfraLeuna GmbH, a company at the heart of European chemical industry, offers very competitive conditions for constructing the biorefinery with its existing permitting processes, logistics arrangements and infrastructure for various services and utilities. The safety and sustainability of the value chain are based on our high standards. Raw materials and key services for the biorefinery will be sourced from a region that enables local value creation and enhances sustainability. Once the biorefinery is fully running and has been optimised, it is expected to achieve the ROCE target of 14%.\n\nIn 2020, we joined the Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI), which promotes the goal of making chemicals more sustainable, more climatefriendly and part of the circular economy in the future. Our investment was awarded as 'The Bio Act of the Year 2020' by the World BioEconomy Forum. This recognition substantiates the fact that bioproducts boosting the circular economy are truly seen as fundamental in the fight against climate change.\n\n## First clinical product to hospitals\n\nUPM Biomedicals develops and supplies innovative and sustainable wood-based biomedical products for a variety of uses. The main ingredient of our products is high-quality nanocellulose, extracted from birch.\n\nIn the long term, we are aiming for personalised medicine, where treatments are developed from patient's own cells. These cells can be used in  manufacturing and in treatments. The key enabling factor is the fact that our gels are animal-free and therefore also do not introduce animal DNA to the patients. Meanwhile, we sell our products to two application areas: clinical and life science.\n\nIn the clinical field, FibDex\u00ae wound dressing took the significant step of being introduced to market, when a medical device distributor Steripolar Oy started to sell the product to Finnish healthcare professionals and hospitals.\n\nBased on clinical investigation results, FibDex was granted the CE mark in 2019, allowing the marketing and sale of the wound dressing in the EU. Work towards registration with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is ongoing.\n\nIn life science, our main products are GrowDex\u00ae, a range of hydrogels for 3D cell culturing and GrowDase\u00ae, an enzyme to release the cells from the gel. The main application is in pharma. The nanocellulose ensures excellent compatibility even with the most demanding cells, such as stem cells and patient-derived cells. In addition to the existing GrowDex product family on the market, we launched GrowInk\u2122, new biocompatible ready-to-use hydrogels for 3D bioprinting of cells in 2020.\n\nWe work with global partners to develop new biomedical products and applications. In 2020, we joined in a new cancer immunotherapy focused research and innovation project, Cancer IO. The project will have a significant impact on clinical cancer research, healthcare systems, business and, most importantly, on the lives of cancer patients. The collaboration integrates immuno-oncology (IO) activities with universities, university hospitals, cancer patient organisations and major pharmaceutical companies.\n\n## Circular economy is the basis of growth for biocomposites\n\nUPM Biocomposites offers innovative and sustainable composite materials for various uses in outdoor construction and consumer products. Over 50% of the raw material originates from renewable sources. The materials are based on UPM's own research and development.\n\nUPM ProFi biocomposite utilises the cellulose fibres and plastic polymers generated as manufacturing surplus from self-adhesive label material production and from label customers' label waste. The label waste is collected from UPM Raflatac's 150 customers and partners from several European countries. Our target is to further increase the use of recycled materials in products. For example, UPM ProFi Piazza decking contains 75% recycled materials, which also includes postconsumer recycled plastics.\n\nIn 2020, our focus was on developing internal efficiency and digitalisation, as well as data-based forecasting models. The launch of UPM ProFi Piazza was a commercial success. We also joined the EU Circular Plastics Alliance to boost the use of recycled plastics in consumer goods and, in our case, in UPM ProFi products.\n\nUPM Formi composite material, made from wood-based fibres and polymers, is suitable for different types of industrial and consumer products such as furniture and home appliances. The material has a 30-60% lower carbon footprint than fossil-based materials. It complies with the requirements set by the EU for reinforced plastics in relation to the circular economy.\n\nThe new UPM Formi EcoAce product range is based almost entirely on renewable resources. It contains certified wood or cellulose fibres as well as bioplastics made of wood-based feedstock from UPM Biofuels' production. Production is ISCC Plus certified, which guarantees that the product meets environmental and social standards along the supply chain. In collaboration with customers, we launched two new UPM Formi EcoAce products, Akvila's reusable cutlery and the MySoda sparkling water maker in 2020.\n\nDevelopment of the UPM Formi 3D biocomposite continued in 2020. The focus was on developing technology around large-scale industrial 3D printing.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n24\n\n## R&D's role in different businesses\n\n| BUSINESS AREA UPM Biorefining   | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UPM Pulp                        | In 2020, special effort was invested in supporting UPM's growth strategy and finding the right solutions for our state-of-the-art pulp mill scheduled  to start in Uruguay in 2022. Joint development work was carried out by our technical customer service, development and research experts in  Finland, Germany, Uruguay and China in order to understand how to best meet our customers' needs. Good results were achieved within  several end-use areas and regions resulting in improved production efficiency both on our side and on the customers' side. To improve product  quality and reduce production cost, development work was carried out to improve the level of digitalisation. New digital upper level control  solutions were put into use in wood handling, cooking, bleaching and chemical recovery operations at our pulp mills in Finland and Uruguay.  Quality to Trust development work on harmonising quality control and streamlining our processes was successfully implemented, improving and  solidifying the ability to deliver the right pulp for the right end use. |\n| UPM Biofuels                    | Collaboration for the development of new applications for renewable plastics based on UPM BioVerno naphtha is continued. The targeted  development of UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery has further improved operational efficiency and increased nominal capacity to 130,000 tonnes  per annum. Piloting, research and process development continue to take place at the UPM Biorefinery Development Centre (BrDC). An improved  hydrotreatment catalyst was evaluated and selected for our UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery to improve diesel product cold flow properties and  production efficiency, hence enabling better fulfilment of customer needs.  UPM is also studying and testing the use of several new feedstocks that fulfil sustainability criteria, such as wood residues and feedstocks from  carbon farming for our possible growth plans either in Kotka, Finland or Western Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| UPM Raflatac                    | competencies and business operations related to the optimisation of industrial energy consumption and demand-side flexibility.

Research centres located at four sites (Finland, Poland, China, USA) support the product range expansion of paper, film and special products for  global self-adhesive labelling business operations. Cost efficiency and product customisation requirements for various end-use segments were  taken into account during the customer and market-orientated development phase. Global R&D focus continues to be in technology platform  development for coatings and polymer development. Product safety and sustainable label material alternatives, i.e. Forest Film and RAFNXT+,  had their role increased along with new requirements for solutions supporting plastic recycling. Continuous quality improvement continued to                                 |\n| UPM Specialty  Papers           | remain an essential part of product and process development. R&D and product development initiatives aim to enable high performance and efficiency in the value chain and to develop fibre-based  alternatives for non-renewable materials. These initiatives also support growth targets by driving the innovation of products for new applications.  In 2020, new papers grades were added to our kraft paper portfolio. We also introduced a packaging paper with no added optical  brighteners. Moving forward, we continue to focus on co-creating sustainable packaging papers for increasingly demanding end-uses, together  with the packaging value network; we currently have several co-creation initiatives ongoing. UPM Specialty Papers continues to develop release  liner base papers to further improve efficiency and minimise the environmental impact of the value chain, through e.g. downgauging and  developing our offering of grades with recycled content.                                                                                                                    |\n| UPM                             | R&D centres in Lappeenranta, Finland and Augsburg, Germany, focused on investigating new fibre concepts for various paper grades.

Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting of UPM-Kymmene Corporation to be held on 30 March 2021 that a dividend of EUR 1.30 per share be paid based on the balance sheet to be adopted for the financial year ending 31 December 2020 and that the remaining portion of the distributable funds be retained in the Company's unrestricted shareholders' equity.\n\nThe dividend will be paid to a shareholder who is registered in the Company's shareholders' register held by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the dividend record date of 1 April 2021. The Board of Directors proposes that the dividend be paid on 12 April 2021.\n\nOn the date of the dividend proposal, 28 January 2021, the Company's registered number of shares is 533,735,699. The aforementioned number of shares includes 411,653 treasury shares which are not entitled to dividend. As a result, the proposed dividend would total EUR 693.3 million.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, the distributable funds of the parent company were EUR 3,523,705,577.69 including EUR 248,543,044.65 profit for the period. No material changes have taken place in respect of the Company's financial position after the balance sheet date. In the opinion of the Board Of Directors, the proposed distribution of profits does not risk the solvency of the Company.\n\nSignatures of the annual accounts and the report of the Board of Directors for the year 2020\n\nHelsinki, 28 January 2021\n\n| Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos Chair   | Berndt Brunow         | Henrik Ehrnrooth   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Piia-Noora Kauppi      | Marjan Oudeman        | Martin \u00e0 Porta     |\n| Ari Puheloinen         | Veli-Matti Reinikkala | Emma FitzGerald    |\n\nKim Wahl\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020",

Risk management related to financial activities is carried out by UPM's central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management, under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Financial risks are described in the relevant notes as described below.\n\n| FINANCIAL RISK                 | NOTE                                 |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                    | 4.6 Working capital                  |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk | 5.1 Capital management               |\n| Interest rate risk             | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Foreign exchange risk          | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Electricity price risk         | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Financial counterparty risk    | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting |\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 on the financial statements\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on UPM financial statements has so far been relatively limited. The group uses estimates and makes significant judgements when valuating certain assets and liabilities, including energy shareholdings, forest assets, retirement benefit obligations and provisions. The group has assessed the impact of COVID-19 to balance sheet items by considering indicators of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, recoverability of deferred tax assets, valuation of inventories, and collectability of trade receivables. The expectations of future cash flows, discount rates and other significant valuation inputs were revised to reflect changed economic environment. Based on these assessments, no significant adjustments to the carrying amounts of said assets were made due to COVID-19. However, the increased uncertainty in the economic environment can lead to significant adjustments to the carrying amount of assets.\n\nThe group expects that it will continue to operate and meet its\n\nliabilities as they fall due. UPM has a strong financial position. Net debt in the balance sheet amounted to EUR 56 million on 31 December 2020, after paying the dividend of EUR 693 million in Q2 2020. Cash funds and unused committed credit facilities amounted to EUR 3.2 billion. This includes the sustainability-linked five-year EUR 750 million revolving credit facility signed during Q1 2020, the EUR 550 million of bilateral committed credit facilities signed during Q2 2020 and EUR 158 million equivalent rolling overdraft facility. During Q4 2020, UPM successfully issued a EUR 750 million Green Bond under its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme. The facilities and UPM's outstanding debt have no financial covenants.\n\n## 1.3  Consolidation principles\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nUPM's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company, UPM-Kymmene Corporation, and subsidiaries controlled by UPM. All group entities apply consistently UPM's accounting policies. All intercompany transactions, receivables, liabilities and unrealised profits, as well as intragroup profit distributions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is a contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nUPM's share in joint operations is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the group's own assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses in the arrangement together with UPM's proportionate share in the joint assets, liabilities and joint income and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions between UPM and its joint operations is eliminated.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the group has significant influence but no control. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions without the power to control or jointly control those policies. Joint ventures are joint arrangements where the group has joint control with other parties and the parties have rights to the arrangement's net assets.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. Associates and joint ventures follow the group accounting policies for consolidation purpose.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent company and noncontrolling interests is presented on the face of the income statement. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent company.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with equity owners of the group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between consideration paid and the acquired share of the carrying value of the subsidiary's net assets is recorded in equity. Gains or losses of disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity, net of transaction costs.\n\n## 1.4  Foreign currency translation\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nUPM records foreign exchange differences relating to ordinary business operations within the appropriate line items above operating profit and those relating to financial items are presented separately as a net amount in finance costs.\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from euro are translated into euros at quarterly average exchange rates. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. All resulting translation differences are recognised as a separate component in other\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n37",

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of net investment in foreign operations and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income.

The group has a portfolio of five businesses that operate on growing markets and one business that faces declining demand. All of UPM businesses are competitive and have strong market positions. Financial target setting, follow up and allocation of resources in the group's performance management process is mainly based on the business area comparable EBIT and comparable ROCE.\n\nUPM presents comparable performance measures to reflect the underlying business performance and to enhance comparability from period to period. However, the comparable performance measures used by management should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with IFRS.

The revenue comprises also sales of energy, biofuels, sawn timber and plywood products and a very limited amount of services not related to sale of goods.\n\nUPM sells a proportion of its products to several major customers. The largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 2% (3%) of UPM's sales and the ten largest customers represented approximately 14% (15%) of such sales.\n\nThe group disaggregates its external sales by business area, because this depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Sales by UPM business areas are reported consistently with the internal reporting provided to UPM's President and CEO who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the business areas. The goods and services included in sales revenue of each business area are presented in below tables.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 2.1 Business areas for information on UPM products.\n\n## External sales by major products\n\n| BUSINESS AREA                    | BUSINESS                                                         | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| EUR million                      |                                                                  |        |        |\n| UPM Biorefining                  | UPM Pulp, UPM Biofuels, UPM Timber                               | 1,720  | 2,096  |\n| UPM Energy                       | UPM Energy                                                       | 252    | 180    |\n| UPM Raflatac                     | UPM Raflatac                                                     | 1,560  | 1,555  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers             | UPM Specialty Papers                                             | 1,148  | 1,203  |\n| UPM Communication Papers         | UPM Communication Papers                                         | 3,296  | 4,516  |\n| UPM Plywood                      | UPM Plywood                                                      | 385    | 427    |\n| Other operations                 | UPM Forest, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals, UPM Biocomposites | 221    | 258    |\n| Eliminations and reconciliations | Eliminations and reconciliations                                 | -1     | 4      |\n| Total                            | Total                                                            | 8,580  | 10,238 |\n\n| BUSINESS                 | PRODUCT RANGE                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UPM Pulp                 | Softwood, birch and eucalyptus pulp                                                                       |\n| UPM Biofuels             | Wood-based renewable diesel for transport and renewable naphtha for transport and petrochemicals          |\n| UPM Timber               | Standard and special sawn timber                                                                          |\n| UPM Energy               | Electricity and related services                                                                          |\n| UPM Raflatac             | Self-adhesive paper and film label stock                                                                  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | Labelling materials, release base papers, flexible packaging materials, office papers, graphic papers     |\n| UPM Communication Papers | Graphic papers for various end uses                                                                       |\n| UPM Plywood              | Plywood and veneer products                                                                               |\n| UPM Forest               | Wood and wood-based biomass (logs, pulpwood, chips, forest residues etc.), full forestry service offering |\n| UPM Biochemicals         | Lignin products for industrial use                                                                        |\n| UPM Biomedicals          | Wood-based products for biomedical applications                                                           |\n| UPM Biocomposites        | UPM ProFi decking products and UPM Formi granules                                                         |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n43\n\n## Sales by business area\n\n| EURm                     | 2020   | 2019   | CHANGE   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| UPM Biorefining          | 2,183  | 2,712  | -20  %   |\n| UPM Energy               | 379    | 417    | -9  %    |\n| UPM Raflatac             | 1,560  | 1,555  | 0    %   |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | 1,324  | 1,412  | -6  %    |\n| UPM Communication Papers | 3,333  | 4,552  | -27  %   |\n| UPM Plywood              | 405    | 450    | -10  %   |\n| Other operations         | 225    | 264    | -15  %   |\n| Eliminations             | -828   | -1,125 | -        |\n| Total                    | 8,580  | 10,238 | -16  %   |",

A change in the volume delivered has less than half of the effect of the same percentage change in sale prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Sales of goods\n\nUPM's performance obligation in the contracts with customers consists of providing the goods specified in the contracts. Revenue from UPM's product sales is recognised when performance obligation is satisfied, which takes place at point in time when control of the good has been transferred to the customer. In UPM's customer contracts the transfer of control and thus timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on delivery terms. Group terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2020, the official rules for interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. Major part of the sales contracts is on delivery terms basis, whereby delivery is not a promised service to the customer, as the control of a good does not transfer to the customer before shipment. Revenue and the corresponding receivable are recorded at the point in time when the product is delivered to the destination point for terms designated Delivered Duty Paid ('DDP') or Delivered at Place ('DAP'). For sales transactions designated free of carriage (FCA), revenue is recorded at the time of shipment. For sales transactions designated as Carriage paid to (CPT) or Carriage and Insurance Paid to (CIP), the portion of revenue relating to goods is recorded at the time of loading and the portion of revenue relating to delivery services over time when the service has been performed.\n\nUPM sells energy to NordPool electricity market. Revenue is recognised when electricity is transmissed over time.\n\n## Sales of services\n\nUPM provides forest expertise and contracting services to woodland and forestry owners and freight services (free space on group's vessels sold as freight services). Revenues from services are recorded over time when the service has been performed. Sales of services is very limited and thus the group does not report it separately.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nThe group recognises revenue as an amount equal to the price specified in the customer contract net of any sales taxes, cash flow hedging results of sales in foreign currency, hedges of energy sales and variable consideration, when applicable. Variable consideration is defined as any variability that may occur between the sales price and the amount UPM expects to receive. The variable consideration includes mainly cash discounts and volume rebates that encourage the customer to take specific volumes in a given timescale. In addition, the group gives the customers the right for purchase price refund in case the products do not meet the quality as specified in the agreement. The amount of variable\n\nconsideration is recognised as a refund liability when some of the amount received is expected to be refunded to the customer. Customer rebates payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period and expected quality claims are estimated using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A refund liability is included in trade and other payables.\n\nReceivables are recognised when the goods are delivered, and the consideration is unconditional except for the passage of time. For most of UPM's customer contracts the period between the transfer of goods or services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than 12 months. For these contracts the group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components.\n\nAdvance payments received from customers are recognised as contract liability. UPM does not have any contract assets arising from contracts with customers.\n\n- \u00bb Refer Note 4.6 Working capital for information on contract liabilities and refund liabilities.\n\n## 2.3  Operating expenses and other operating income\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses excluding forest assets fair value change, wood harvested and share of results of associates and joint ventures are presented below.\n\n| EURm                                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Costs and expenses                        |        |        |\n| Raw materials, consumables and goods      | 4,551  | 5,515  |\n| Employee costs  1)                        | 1,188  | 1,214  |\n| Other operating costs and expenses  2)    | 852    | 918    |\n| Delivery costs and other external charges | 781    | 884    |\n| Total                                     | 7,371  | 8,531  |\n\n- 1) \u00bb Refer Note 3 Employee rewards, for further information.\n\n## 2) Distribution of other operating costs and expense\n\n| EURm                                         |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rents and lease expenses                     |     15 |     16 |\n| Emission expenses  1)                        |     10 |      8 |\n| Losses on sale of non-current assets         |      0 |      3 |\n| Credit losses                                |      9 |     12 |\n| Maintenance and other operating expenses  2) |    818 |    879 |\n| Total                                        |    852 |    918 |\n\n- 1) Emission expenses include gains on sales of emission rights EUR 13 (14) million.\n- 2) Other operating expenses include, among others, energy as well as expenses related to services and group's administration.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n44\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cost structure 2019 EUR 8,531 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Auditor's fees\n\n| EURm                   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit fee              |    3.8 |    3.1 |\n| Audit related services |    0.1 |    0.2 |\n| Tax services           |    0.4 |    0.5 |\n| Other services         |    0.2 |    0.2 |\n| Total                  |    4.5 |    4   |\n\nIn 2020, auditor's fees include EUR 0.1 (0.1) million related to audit services, EUR 0.0 (0.2) million related tax services and EUR 0.2 (0.2) million related to other services paid to PwC Oy.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nThe research and development costs included in operating expenses were EUR 41 million (53 million) in 2020.

Capitalised development costs are amortised on a systematic basis over their expected useful lives, usually not exceeding five years.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the group will comply with the attached conditions. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset and accordingly directly reduce the annual depreciation of the underlying asset. Other government grants are recognised in the income statement in the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.",

        "page_content": "## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income mainly includes gains on the disposal of noncurrent assets and rental income. Further, other operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses in respect of UPM's normal business activities. Gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying hedge accounting are also recognised in other operating income.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nThe group participates in the European Emissions Trading Scheme aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Emission rights received from governments free of charge to emit a fixed tonnage of carbon dioxide in a fixed period of time give rise to an intangible asset for the emission rights, a government grant and a liability for the obligation to deliver emission rights equal to the emissions that have been made during the compliance period.\n\nEmission rights are initially recognised as intangible assets based on market value at the date of initial recognition. Emission rights are not amortised. If the market price of emissions rights at the balance sheet date is less than the recognised costs, any surplus emission rights that are not required to cover actual and estimated emissions during the financial year, are impaired to the market price.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet at the same time as emission rights and are recognised in other operating income in the income statement, systematically, over the compliance period to which the corresponding emission rights relate.\n\nThe liability to deliver emission rights is recognised based on actual emissions. The emissions realised are expensed under other operating costs and expenses in the income statement and presented as a provision in the balance sheet. The liability is settled using emission rights on hand, measured at the carrying amount of those emission rights. Emission rights and associated provisions are derecognised when disposed. Any profit or loss represents the costs of purchasing additional rights to cover excess emissions, the sale of unused rights in the case realised emission are under emission rights received free of charge or the impairment of unused emission rights.\n\n## 2.4  Earnings per share and dividend\n\nAccording to UPM dividend policy, the company aims to pay an attractive dividend amounting to 30-40% of the group annual operating cash flow per share.\n\nThe dividend paid in 2020 were EUR 693 million (EUR 1.30 per share) which is 38% of the operating cash flow per share and in 2019 EUR 693 million (EUR 1.30 per share). The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 693 million, EUR 1.30 per share, will be paid in respect of 2020. The proposed dividend represents 69% of UPM's operating cash flow per share for the year 2020.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n| EURm                                                       | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit attributable to owners of the parent  company, EURm | 560     | 1,061   |\n| Weighted average no. of shares (1,000)                     | 533,324 | 533,324 |\n| Basic earnings per share, EUR                              | 1.05    | 1.99    |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                            | 1.05    | 1.99    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is the amount of profit for the period attributable to each ordinary share.

The amount of the incentive is linked to the executive's position and achievement of annually set targets. The maximum incentives amount to a total of 100% of the annual base salary to the Business Area Executives and to a total of 70% of annual base salary to the other members of the Group Executive Team. For the President and CEO, the maximum annual incentive amounts to 150% of the annual base salary.\n\nThe expenses recognised in income statement in respect of sharebased payments for the Group Executive Team were EUR 3.4 million (3.4 million).\n\nAccording to the service agreement, the President and CEO would have been entitled to retire in November 2020 at the age of 60 but at the request of the company's Board of Directors, the President and CEO has decided to continue in his position.\n\nThe President and CEO has a voluntary pension benefit in addition to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The President and CEO's\n\n## 3.3  Share-based payments\n\nUPM offers rewards and recognition with an emphasis on high performance. All UPM's employees belong to a unified annual Short Term Incentive (STI) scheme. In addition, UPM has two long-term incentive schemes: the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees.\n\nvoluntary pension benefit was arranged through a defined benefit plan until the end of November 2020. The last contribution to the defined benefit plan was made in 2020. Under the defined benefit plan, the target pension was 60% of the average indexed earnings from the last ten full calendar years of employment calculated according to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The income of the President and CEO's defined benefit pension plan in 2020 was EUR 1.6 million (1.0 million expense in 2019). The plan assets amounted to EUR 17.3 million (14.9 million) and the obligation amounted to EUR 14.9 million (15.0 million).\n\nAs of December 2020 the voluntary pension benefit is arranged through a defined contribution plan. First contribution to the defined contribution plan will take place in 2021.\n\nThe retirement age of other members of the Group Executive Team is 63. Other Group Executive Team members are under defined contribution plans.\n\nShould the company or the President and CEO give notice of termination of the service agreement, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the 12-month notice period. For GET members, the period for severance pay is 12 months, in addition to the six months' salary for the notice period, unless notice is given for reasons that are solely attributable to the executive. Should a GET member give notice of termination to the company, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the notice period.\n\nIf there is a change of control in the company, the President and CEO may terminate his service agreement within three months and each GET member within one month from closing the takeover and shall receive compensation equivalent to 24 months' base salary.\n\n## Performance Share Plan\n\nThe Performance Share Plan (PSP) is targeted at the President and CEO and other Group Executive Team (GET) members as well as other selected members of the management. Under the ongoing plans UPM shares are awarded based on total shareholder return during a threeyear earning period. The earned shares are delivered after the earning period has ended.

Prior to share delivery, the share rewards earned are adjusted with dividends and other capital distributions, if any, paid to all shareholders during the restriction period.\n\n| DEFERRED BONUS PLANS                                            | DBP 2017                    | DBP 2018                    | DBP 2019                    | DBP 2020                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| No. of participants (at grant)                                  | 360                         | 370                         | 390                         | 393                         |\n| No. of participants (at 31 December 2020)                       | 304                         | 316                         | 355                         | 384                         |\n| Max no. of shares to be delivered (at grant)                    | 525,000                     | 450,000                     | 460,000                     | 429,558                     |\n| Estimated no. of shares to be delivered at 31 December 2020  1) | 291,340                     | 300,478                     | 183,315                     | 139,600                     |\n| Share delivery (year)                                           | 2020                        | 2021                        | 2022                        | 2023                        |\n| Earning criteria                                                | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA |\n\nThe indicated actuals and estimates of the share rewards under the Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan represent the gross amount of the rewards of which the applicable taxes will be deducted before the shares are delivered to the participants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group's long-term share incentive plans are recognised as equitysettled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions depending on the settlement. The group classifies the transactions with net settlement features for tax obligations as equity-settled in its entirety. Shares are valued using the market rate on the grant date. The settlement is a combination of shares and cash. The group may obtain the necessary shares by using its treasury shares or may purchase shares from the market. PSP and DBP share deliveries are executed by using already existing shares and the plans, therefore, have no dilutive effect.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n49",

Retirement benefits are employee benefits that are payable usually after the termination of employment, such as pensions and post-employment medical care.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\nThe pension plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or to trustee-administered funds or foundations and classified as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.\n\nDefined benefit assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet are presented below:\n\n| EURm                                                       | FINLAND   | UK GERMANY   |     | OTHER  COUN- TRIES   | TOTAL FINLAND   |      | UK GERMANY   |     | OTHER  COUN- TRIES   | TOTAL 1,108   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----|----------------------|-----------------|------|--------------|-----|----------------------|---------------|\n| Present value of funded obligations                        | 581       | 539          | 43  | 16                   | 1,180           | 542  | 509          | 39  | 19                   |               |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                  | -606      | -515         | -3  | -16                  | -1,140          | -579 | -491         | -3  | -20                  | -1,092        |\n| Deficit (+)/surplus (-)                                    | -25       | 24           | 40  | -                    | 39              | -37  | 17           | 37  | -1                   | 16            |\n| Present value of unfunded  obligations                     | -         | -            | 606 | 74                   | 679             | -    | -            | 596 | 79                   | 675           |\n| Net defined benefit liability (+)/ asset (-)               | -25       | 24           | 646 | 74                   | 719             | -37  | 17           | 633 | 78                   | 691           |\n| Net retirement benefit asset in the  balance sheet         | -26       | -            | -   | -                    | -26             | -38  | -            | -   | -                    | -38           |\n| Net retirement benefit liability in the  balance sheet  1) | 1         | 24           | 646 | 74                   | 745             | 2    | 17           | 633 | 78                   | 729           |\n\n- 1) Net retirement benefit liability in the balance sheet includes other long-term employee benefits of EUR 25 million (30 million) in 2020.\n\nAbout 95% of the group's defined benefit arrangements exist in Finland, in the UK and in Germany. The group has defined benefit obligations also in Austria, Holland, France, Canada and in the US. Approximately a quarter of UPM's employees are active members of defined benefit arrangement plans.\n\n## Finland\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). TyEL provides the employee with insurance protection for old age, disability and death. The benefits can be insured with an insurance company or the employer can establish a fund or a foundation to manage the statutory benefits.\n\nApproximately 81% (82%) of group's Finnish employees are insured with an insurance company and these arrangements qualify as defined contribution plans. Approximately 19% (18%) of employees are insured with TyEL foundation (UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6). The TyEL foundation is administered by the representatives of both the employer and the employees. The foundation has named an authorised representative to take care of its regular operations. The plan is\n\nsupervised by Financial Supervisory Authority. The foundation is classified as a defined benefit plan for the benefits that must be funded nationally and is the most significant defined benefit pension plan in Finland for UPM.\n\n## UK\n\nIn the UK, the group operates a legacy defined benefit scheme providing benefits that are linked to the salary level near retirement age or an earlier date of leaving service. The scheme is closed both for new members and future accrual for old members. Part of the scheme is a defined contribution plan and is open to all current employees. The UK pension scheme operates under a single trust which is independent from the group.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn Germany employees within defined benefit arrangements are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on their service and final salary. All significant defined benefit plans are closed for new employees.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n50\n\n## Present value of obligation and fair value of plan assets\n\n|                                                                                       | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2020   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2020   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2020   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2019   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2019   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                                                                  | PRESENT  VALUE OF  OBLIGATION                      | FAIR VALUE  OF PLAN  ASSETS                        | NET DEFINED  BENEFIT  LIABILITY/  (ASSET)          | PRESENT VALUE OF  OBLIGATION                       | FAIR VALUE  OF PLAN  ASSETS                        | NET DEFINED  BENEFIT  LIABILITY/  (ASSET)          |\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                                                          | 1,784                                              | -1,092                                             | 691                                                | 1,569                                              | -956                                               | 612                                                |\n| Current service cost                                                                  | 14                                                 | -

The asset values of these arrangements constitute 98% of total asset values in defined benefit plans within group.\n\n## Interest risk\n\nDiscount rates used in calculations are based on high-quality corporate bond yield curves in currency in which the benefits are paid. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan liabilities. The maturities of yields are reflecting the durations of the underlying obligations. The weighted average duration of group's defined benefit obligation is 17 years (18 years) at the end of 2020.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nIn the Finnish plan, the inflation risk is not significant as changes in the inflation assumption are mainly covered by the TyEL pooling system. In the UK, the pensions in payment are tied to Retail Price Index whilst being tied to Consumer Price Index during deferment. An increase of 0.5% in indexes will increase the liabilities by some EUR 43 million. In Germany the pensions have to be adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.\n\n## Salary risk\n\nThe present value of the net retirement benefit assets and liabilities is calculated by reference to the expected future salaries of plan participants. An increase in the salary of the plan participants would increase the plan liabilities. In Finland, the salary risk is minor as well as in the UK, where the changes in salary levels have no impact on the funding position as all defined benefit arrangements in the UK are closed to future accrual. In Germany, an increase of 0.5% in expected future salaries would increase the obligation by EUR 13 million.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nAdjustments in mortality assumption have an impact on group's defined benefit obligation. An increase in life expectancy by one year will increase the obligation in Finland by EUR 25 million, in the UK by EUR 26 million and in Germany by EUR 34 million.",

The analysis assume that all other assumptions remain unchanged. The projected unit credit method has been applied when calculating the obligation as well as these sensitivities.\n\n## Plan assets by categories 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Plan assets by categories 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n52\n\nused may differ materially from actual results due to, among others, changing market and economic conditions, or changes in service period of plan participants. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may affect the future amounts of the defined benefit obligation and future expense.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans\n\nPlan benefits depend on salary and length of service. The defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the term of the related pension liability. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement as employee costs so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees. Changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs and gains or losses on settlement are recognised immediately in income when they occur.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, contributions are paid to pension insurance companies. Once the contributions have been paid, there are no further payment obligations. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.\n\n## Other post-employment obligations\n\nSome group companies provide post-employment medical and other benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to healthcare benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Valuations of these obligations are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.

The facility is scheduled to start up by the end of 2022.\n\nIn January 2019 UPM announced that it would invest in the refurbishment of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in Finland. The average annual production of the Kuusankoski plant is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh. The investment will be completed by the end of 2022.\n\nIn July 2019 UPM announced that it would invest USD 2.7 billion in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros in central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest approximately USD 280 million in port operations in Montevideo and USD 70 million in local investments outside the mill fence, including a new residential area in Paso de los Toros. The mill is scheduled to start up in the second half of 2022.\n\nIn October 2019 UPM announced that it would invest EUR 95 million in a Combined-Heat-Power (CHP) plant at the UPM Nordland paper mill in Germany. The plant is planned to go on grid in Q3 2022. The annual cost savings of more than EUR 10 million will start as of 2023.\n\nThe investment is estimated to decrease UPM's CO2-footprint by 300,000 tonnes.\n\nIn April 2018 UPM announced that it would rebuild Paper Machine 2 at its Nordland mill in D\u00f6rpen, Germany, and convert it from fine paper to glassine paper production. The machine was equipped with new finishing equipment and started producing glassine paper in Q1 2020. The capacity after the rebuild is 110,000 tonnes per year. The total investment in Nordland is EUR 124 million.\n\n## Capitalised borrowing costs\n\nIn 2020, the borrowing costs capitalised as part of non-current assets amounted to EUR 4 million (4 million). Amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs was EUR 3 million (3 million) and the average interest rate used 1.31% (7.19%), which represents the average costs to finance the projects. In 2020, capitalised borrowing costs were mainly related to the construction of the new pulp mill in Uruguay.\n\n## Government grants\n\nIn 2020, government grants recognised as deduction of non-current assets totalled to EUR 5 million (1 million).\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n54\n\n## Major capital commitments at 31 December\n\n| EURm                                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| New biorefinery / Germany                                     | 471    | -      |\n| CHP power plant / Germany                                     | 67     | 95     |\n| New pulp mill / Uruguay                                       | 2,139  | 2,684  |\n| Renovation and modernisation / Kuusankoski  hydro power plant | 16     | 19     |\n| Paper machine conversion / Nordland paper mill                | -      | 15     |\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nIn June 2020, UPM announced the plan that it has started a consultation process for the potential closure of the UPM Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 plywood mill in Finland. With the plan to permanently close the mill, UPM recognised impairment charges of EUR 8 million in the Plywood business area.\n\nIn August 2020, UPM announced the plans for the permanent closure of the UPM Kaipola paper mill in Finland. The mill was permanently closed in early January 2021. With the permanent closure of the mill, UPM recognised impairment charges of EUR 53 million in the Communication Papers business area.\n\nIn June 2019, UPM announced the decision to permanently close paper machine 10 at UPM Plattling, Germany. With the closure of the paper machine, UPM recognised impairment charges of EUR 1 million in Communication Business area.\n\nIn September 2019, UPM announced that it plans to permanently close SC paper machine 2 in Rauma, Finland. EUR 12 million impairment charges were recognised in Communication Papers business area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost. Costs of assets of acquired in business combinations are determined at fair value at the acquisition date. Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment charges, if any. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet represents the cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed.\n\nMajor renovations are capitalised and depreciated over the useful lives of the related asset. Ordinary expenses for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively.\n\n| ASSESSED USEFUL LIVES             | NUMBER OF YEARS   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Land, not subject to depreciation | -                 |\n| Buildings                         | 20-50             |\n| Power plants                      | 20-30             |\n| Heavy machinery                   | 15-20             |\n| Light machinery                   | 10-15             |\n| Equipment                         | 5                 |\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nCarrying values of individual items included in property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each closing date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. The carrying value is written down immediately to the asset's recoverable amount if the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).\n\nNon-financial assets, other than goodwill, that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount will not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe estimations of useful lives, residual value as well as depreciation and amortisation methods require significant management judgement and are reviewed annually. Management makes estimates on the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. While management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect valuations.\n\nThe long useful lives of assets, changes in estimated future sales prices of products, changes in product costs and changes in the discount rates used could lead to significant impairment charges.\n\nEstimates are also made in an acquisition when determining the fair values and remaining useful lives of acquired intangible and tangible assets.",

The value of forest assets, i.e. standing trees, amounted to EUR 2,077 million (2,097 million) at the end of 2020. UPM's own and leased forest land areas are summarised in below table.\n\n|                              | PRO-    | PRO-            | PRO-     |\n|------------------------------|---------|-----------------|----------|\n|                              | FOREST  | DUCTIVE  FOREST | FORESTED |\n| 1,000 ha                     | LAND    | LAND            | LAND     |\n| Finland                      | 515     | 425             | 418      |\n| Uruguay Uruguay, leased land | 281 153 | 170 123         | 162 114  |\n| United States                | 76      | 56              | 56       |\n| Total                        | 1,025   | 774             | 750      |\n\nAt the end of 2020, carrying value of own forest land amounted to EUR 594 million (EUR 591 million) and leased forest land EUR 183 million (EUR 176 million).\n\n## Forest assets\n\n| EURm                           | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January   | 2,097  | 1,945  |\n| Additions                      | 53     | 119    |\n| Disposals                      | -      | -1     |\n| Wood harvested                 | -129   | -101   |\n| Net change in fair value       | 100    | 125    |\n| Translation differences        | -45    | 10     |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December | 2,077  | 2,097  |\n\nChange in fair value, change due to harvesting and gains or losses on sale of forest assets are recognised in the income statement as a net amount amounting to EUR -25 million (26 million) in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group divides all its forest assets for accounting purposes into growing forests, which are recognised as forest assets at fair value less costs to sell, and land. Own land is stated at cost whereas leased land is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nAny changes in the fair value of the growing forests are recognised in the operating profit in the income statement. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows as there is a lack of a liquid market. The fair value of forest assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation\n\nThe valuation process of forest assets is complex and requires management estimates and judgement on assumptions that have a significant impact on the valuation of the group's forest assets.\n\nMain factors used in the fair valuation of forest assets are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates. Stumpage price forecasts are based on the current prices adjusted by the management's estimates for the full remaining productive lives of the trees, up to 100 years for forests in Finland and in the US and up to 10 years for plantations in Uruguay. The cash flows are adjusted by selling costs and costs related to future risks. Felling revenues and maintenance costs are estimated on the basis of actual costs and prices, taking into account the group's projection of future price and costs development. In addition, calculations take into account future forest growth and environmental restrictions.\n\nThe pre-tax discount rate used to determine the fair value of the Finnish forests in 2020 was 7.0% (7.0%) and for Uruguayan plantations 9.9% (9.9%). A decrease (increase) of one percentage point in discount rate would increase (decrease) the fair value of forest assets by approximately EUR 260 million (260 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3 Energy shareholdings\n\nUPM is both a significant purchaser and producer of energy. The majority of electrical and thermal energy is consumed at the group's pulp and paper production. The production is mainly carried out by energy companies in which UPM has energy shareholdings. Energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments. UPM does not have control or joint control of or significant influence in the said energy companies.\n\nThe value of energy shareholdings amounted to EUR 1,936 million (2,145 million) at the end of 2020. These energy companies supply energy or both energy and heat to their shareholders on a cost-price principle (Mankala-principle) which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle energy and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned.\n\nIn 2020, UPM issued a shareholder loan of EUR 47 million without a maturity date to PVO. Embedded into the loan terms is a right to issue new shares in the PVO B2 series against the remaining, unpaid nominal of the loan starting from 2021. The loan is valued at fair value and is taken into account as a part of the total fair valuation of the PVO B2 series valuation. In addition, UPM issued a similar loan commitment of EUR 123 million to PVO, where also a right to issue new PVO B2 shares is embedded starting from 2023.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n56\n\n|                                | Number of shares   | Group holding %   | Carrying value, EURm   |       |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|\n|                                |                    |                   | 2020                   | 2019  |\n| Pohjolan Voima Oyj, A series   | 8,176,191          | 61.24             | 362                    | 360   |\n| Pohjolan Voima Oyj, B series   | 4,140,132          | 58.11             | 990                    | 1,191 |\n| Pohjolan Voima Oyj, B2 series  | 2,869,819          | 51.22             | 191                    | 188   |\n| Kemijoki Oy                    | 179,189            | 7.33              | 273                    | 290   |\n| L\u00e4nsi-Suomen Voima Oy          | 10,220             | 51.10             | 114                    | 111   |\n| Other                          | -                  | -                 | 6                      | 7     |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December |                    |                   | 1,936                  | 2,145 |\n\nPVO's share capital is divided into different series of shares. The B and B2 series relate to PVO's shareholdings in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). UPM has no direct shareholdings in TVO. TVO operates two nuclear power plants (Olkiluoto 1 and Olkiluoto 2) and is constructing one new nuclear power plant in Olkiluoto (Olkiluoto 3), Finland. The operation of a nuclear power plant is governed by international, European Union and local nuclear regulatory regimes. Pursuant to the Finnish Nuclear Liability Act, the operator of a nuclear facility has a strict third-party liability in relation to nuclear accidents. Shareholders of power companies that own and operate nuclear power plants are not subject to the liability under the Nuclear Liability Act. In Finland, the future costs of conditioning, storage and final disposal of spent fuel, management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste as well as nuclear power plant decommissioning are provided for by a state established fund (the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund). The contributions to the Fund are intended to be sufficient to cover estimated future costs. These contributions have been taken into consideration in the fair value of the related energy shareholdings.\n\n## Energy shareholdings\n\n| EURm                                                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                                    | 2,145  | 2,159  |\n| Disposals                                                       | -2     | -1     |\n| Changes in fair value recognised in other  comprehensive income | -207   | -13    |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                                  | 1,936  | 2,145  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group has made an irrevocable election to designate its energy shareholdings as equity instruments where changes in fair value are recognised through OCI. The shareholdings are not held for trading as the group has an intention to hold the investments for the long term. Purchases of energy shareholdings are initially and subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable, with only dividend income recognised through profit and loss. Initial fair value is acquisition cost including transaction costs. Upon disposal of the investment, the accumulated fair value changes in equity are not recycled to the income statement but instead, are reclassified from the fair value reserve to retained earnings.\n\nThe fair value of energy shareholdings is a level 3 measure in the fair value measurement hierarchy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation and sensitivity\n\nValuation of energy shareholdings requires management's assumptions and estimates of a number of factors that may differ from the actual outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset. Fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis and the main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends and discount rates.\n\nThe electricity price estimate is based on a simulation of the Finnish area electricity price. A change of 5% in the electricity price used in the model would change the total value of the assets by EUR 340 million. The discount rate of 5.47% used in the valuation model is determined using the weighted average cost of capital method. A change of 0.5% percentage points in the discount rate would change the estimated fair value of the assets by approximately EUR 300 million.\n\nOther uncertainties and risk factors in the value of the assets relate to start-up schedule of the fixed price turn-key Olkiluoto 3 EPR nuclear power plant project. UPM's indirect share of the capacity of Olkiluoto 3 EPR is approximately 31%, through its PVO B2 shares. Changes in regulatory environment or taxation could also have an impact on the value of the energy generating assets.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020",

The values of water rights were tested based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydro power plant.\n\nGoodwill impairment tests were carried out for pulp operations in Finland and Uruguay, belonging to UPM Biorefining business area, UPM Raflatac business area and UPM Plywood business area.\n\nThe 2020 impairment tests did not result in a recognition of any impairment.\n\nThe basis for valuation and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing are summarised in below table:\n\n| CASH GENERATING UNIT    | BASIS OF  VALUATION   | PERIOD OF FORECAST        | PRE-TAX DISCOUNT RATE   | KEY ASSUMPTIONS                  |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Pulp operations Finland | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 7.84 % (2019: 7.72 %)   | Pulp price, wood costs           |\n| Pulp operations Uruguay | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 7.84 % (2019: 8.10 %)   | Pulp price, wood costs           |\n| UPM Raflatac            | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 7.60 % (2019: 6.78 %)   | Product prices, cost development |\n| UPM Plywood             | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 13.04 % (2019: 10.14 %) | Product prices, cost development |\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nThe sensitivity analyses of goodwill impairment tests indicate that no reasonable change in key assumptions would result in recognition of impairment loss against goodwill. In pulp operations the recoverable amount is most sensitive to pulp sales prices and the cost of wood raw material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe group's assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life assets requires significant judgement.\n\nWhile management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and operational conditions. Actual cash flows could therefore vary from estimated discounted future cash flows and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## Future cash flows\n\nThe review of recoverable amount for goodwill and indefinite life assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using management projections of future cash flows. The most important assessments and assumptions needed in calculations are forecasts for future growth rates for the business in question, product prices, cost development and the discount rates applied. The group is using ten-year forecasts in calculations as the nature of the group's business is long-term, due to its capital intensity, and is exposed to cyclical changes. In estimates of product prices and cost development, forecasts prepared by management for the next three years and estimates made for the following seven years are taken into consideration. In addition, consideration is given to the investment decisions made by the group as well as the profitability programmes that the group has implemented and the views of knowledgeable industry experts on the long-term development of demand and prices. In the projection of cash flows UPM uses EBITDA adjusted with cash flows not captured within EBITDA, including working capital movements and capital expenditures.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate is estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the calculation date adjusted for risks specific to the business in question. The adjusted after-tax discount rate is translated to a pre-tax rate for each cash generating unit (CGU) based on the specific tax rate applicable to where the CGU operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises in connection with business combinations where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment and is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies from the business combination.\n\n## Intangible rights\n\nIntangible rights include water rights of hydropower plants, patents, licences, intellectual property and similar rights. Water rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as the company has a contractual right to exploit water resources in the energy production of power plants.\n\nThe values of water rights are tested annually for impairment based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydropower plant. Other intangible rights are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred in acquiring software that will contribute to future period financial benefit are capitalised to software and systems. Other intangible assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes the group identifies its cash-generating units (CGUs), which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a business area. The carrying amount for the CGU includes goodwill, non-current assets and working capital. If the balance sheet carrying amount of the CGU unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.",

The carrying amount of the asset is then reduced to the recoverable amount which is the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.\n\n## 4.5  Provisions\n\n| EURm                                | RE- STRUCTURING   | TERMINATION   | ENVIRON- MENTAL   | EMISSIONS   | OTHER   | TOTAL   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| 2020                                |                   |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 30                | 36            | 20                | 18          | 41      | 144     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 43                | 96            | 7                 | 23          | 3       | 173     |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -11               | -33           | -1                | -19         | -9      | -73     |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -6                | -7            | -                 | -1          | -7      | -21     |\n| Reclassifications                   | -4                | -             | 4                 | -           | -       | -       |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 52                | 91            | 29                | 21          | 28      | 222     |\n| Non-current                         |                   |               |                   |             |         | 100     |\n| Current                             |                   |               |                   |             |         | 122     |\n| Total                               |                   |               |                   |             |         | 222     |\n| 2019                                |                   |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 22                | 24            | 20                | 14          | 46      | 126     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 11                | 33            | -                 | 22          | 6       | 72      |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -3                | -19           | -1                | -18         | -7      | -47     |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -                 | -2            | -                 | -           | -4      | -7      |\n| Reclassifications                   | -                 | -             | -                 | -           | -       | -       |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 30                | 36            | 20                | 18          | 41      | 144     |\n| Non-current                         |                   |               |                   |             |         | 81      |\n| Current                             |                   |               |                   |             |         | 62      |\n| Total                               |                   |               |                   |             |         | 144     |\n\nUPM has undergone several restructuring in recent years including mill closures and profit improvement programs. Restructuring provisions recognised include various restructuring activities including dismantling costs. Termination provisions include severance payments, unemployment compensations or other arrangements for employees leaving the company. In Finland termination provisions include also unemployment arrangements and disability pensions. Unemployment provisions in Finland are recognised 2-3 years before the granting and settlement of the compensation.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 and 2019, restructuring and termination provisions relate mainly to capacity closures and optimisation of operations in UPM Communication Papers business area. UPM Chapelle paper mill was closed in 2020. UPM Kaipola paper mill was closed in the beginning of 2021. The total termination and restructuring provisions related to these actions amounted to EUR 106 million in 2020. Additionally, termination provision made during the year relate to restructuring of business functions of UPM Communication Papers and UPM Raflatac amounting to EUR 14 million. In UPM Plywood business Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 plywood mill was closed and EUR 12 million restructuring and termination provision recognised .\n\nIn 2019, UPM closed paper machine 10 at UPM Plattling in Germany and SC paper machine 2 in Rauma. The total termination and restructuring provisions related to these actions amounted to EUR 33 million in 2019.\n\nThe group recognises provisions for normal environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred in a future period upon a\n\nremoval of non-current assets and restoring industrial landfills where a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nOther provisions are mainly attributable to onerous contracts and will be incurred over a period longer than one year.\n\nProvisions for emissions include liability to cover the obligation to return emission rights. The group possesses emission rights amounting to EUR 95 million (80 million) as intangible assets.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 2.3 Operating expenses and other operating income, for further information on emission rights.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n60\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nA provision is recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\n## Restructuring and termination provisions\n\nA restructuring provisions is recognised when a detailed plan for the implementation of the measures is complete and when the plan has been communicated to those who are affected. Employee termination provisions are recognised when the group has communicated the plan to the employees.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed. The recognition of environmental provisions is based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations. Such provisions are recognised when the group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located. The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised and subsequently depreciated as part of the asset. Provisions do not include any third-party recoveries.\n\n## Emission provisions\n\nEmission obligations are recognised in provisions based on realised emissions. The provision is measured at the carrying amounts of the corresponding emission rights held, which are recognised as intangible assets. In case of deficit in emission rights, the shortage is valued at the market value at the balance sheet date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nThe estimates used in determining the provisions are based on the expenses incurred for similar activities in the current reporting period taking into account the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account of any such changes. The discount rate applied is reviewed annually.\n\nThe group aims to operate in compliance with regulations related to the treatment of waste water, air emissions and landfill sites. However, expected events during production processes and waste treatment could cause material losses and additional costs in the group's operations.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nManagement judgement is required in measurement and recognition of provisions related to pending litigation. Provisions are recorded when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event, an unfavourable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to inherent uncertain nature of\n\nlitigation, the actual losses may differ significantly from the originally estimated provision.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 9.2 Litigation for details of legal contingencies.\n\n## 4.6  Working capital\n\nThe group defines operating working capital as inventories, trade receivables, trade payables and advances received which are presented separately below. The performance obligations related to advances received are typically fulfilled within 12 months of receipt of the advance.\n\nUPM is focusing on working capital efficiency and targeting a sustainable and permanent reduction in operating working capital.\n\n## Operating working capital\n\n| EURm              | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Inventories       | 1,285  | 1,367  |\n| Trade receivables | 1,098  | 1,222  |\n| Trade payables    | -1,128 | -1,130 |\n| Advances received | -8     | -8     |\n| Total             | 1,247  | 1,451  |\n\n## Inventories\n\n| EURm                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Raw materials and consumables | 647    | 682    |\n| Work in progress              | 6      | 9      |\n| Finished products and goods   | 616    | 658    |\n| Advance payments              | 16     | 18     |\n| Total                         | 1,285  | 1,367  |\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\n| EURm                                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Trade receivables                       |        |        |\n| Trade receivables                       | 1,129  | 1,253  |\n| Loss allowance provision                | -31    | -31    |\n| Total trade receivables                 | 1,098  | 1,222  |\n| Prepayments and accrued income          |        |        |\n| Personnel expenses                      | 9      | 2      |\n| Interest income                         | -      | -      |\n| Energy and other excise taxes           | 48     | 52     |\n| Other items                             | 130    | 106    |\n| Total prepayments and accrued income    | 186    | 159    |\n| Other receivables                       |        |        |\n| VAT and other indirect taxes receivable | 135    | 144    |\n| Other receivables                       | 115    | 51     |\n| Total other receivables                 | 250    | 195    |\n| Total                                   | 1,534  | 1,576  |",

The group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Outstanding trade receivables, days of sales outstanding (DSO) and overdue trade receivables are followed on monthly basis. Potential concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables are limited due to the large number and the geographic dispersion of customers. Customer credit limits are established and monitored, and ongoing evaluations of their financial condition is performed. The group has trade credit insurances to protect accounts receivables from significant credit losses. In certain market areas, including Asia and Northern Africa, measures to reduce credit risks include letters of credit, prepayments and bank guarantees. Maximum exposure to credit risk, without taking into account any credit enhancements, is the carrying amount of trade and other receivables.\n\nUPM does not have significant concentration of customer credit risk. The ten largest customers accounted for approximately 15% (15%) of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2020 - i.e., approximately EUR 170 million (179 million).\n\nIn 2020, trade receivables amounting to EUR 10 million (8 million) were subject to permanent write-off and the loss was recognised under other costs and expenses. In accordance with the group's accounting policy, trade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the method most appropriate to the particular nature of inventory, the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, a valuation allowance is established for inventory obsolescence.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables arising from selling goods and services in the normal course of business are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowance provision. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of 14-60 days, which is consistent with market practice.\n\nThe group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. The group has recognised two types of provisions for trade receivables - a general provision for lifetime expected credit losses and a provision for specified individual trade receivables, both of which are charged to the income statement. The group uses a provision matrix for estimating lifetime expected credit losses where trade receivables are segregated by businesses. The provision matrix is based on historical observed default rates, adjusted by forward looking information. It takes into account trade credit insurances, payment profile of customers and the factor that as debts get older they are more likely not to be paid. Additionally, the group recognises a provision individually for outstanding trade receivables where specific debtor information is available. In these cases there must be objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.\n\nTrade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The customer entering into bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or finalising such proceedings, or entering into debt-restructuring are considered indicators that the trade receivables are no longer expected to be recovered. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. The carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the receivables.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade payables arise from purchase of inventories, fixed assets and goods and services in the ordinary course of business from UPM's suppliers. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n62\n\nthey are due to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business or within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the payables.\n\nThe group is recognising refund liability for expected volume and other discounts arising from contracts with customers. Customer rebates include mainly volume discounts and are recognised as equal to an\n\namount which is most likely to be paid to the customer. The carrying amount of expected customer rebates is updated at each reporting date, using the latest forecast data available.\n\nCustomer claims relating to quality complaints are accounted for as revenue related refund liability. Expected customer claims are estimated based on historical data and the amount of refund liability is updated at each reporting date.\n\nAdvances received are recognised as contract liability until the performance obligation is fulfilled.\n\n## 5.  Capital structure\n\nUPM has a strong cash flow and industry-leading balance sheet that mitigates risks and enables value-enhancing strategic actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.1  Capital management\n\nUPM's objective for managing capital comprising of net debt and total equity is to ensure maintenance of flexible capital structure to enable the ability to operate in capital markets and maintain optimal returns to shareholders. The group manages its financing activities, debt portfolio and financial resources via various policies that are designed to ensure optimum financing arrangements minimising simultaneously financial expenses and refinancing risk and optimising liquidity. Borrowing activities are centralised to the parent to the extent possible and cash resources are distributed within the group by the central treasury department.\n\nUPM targets a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 2 times or less.\n\n## UPM's capital\n\n| EURm                                                 | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of the parent  company | 9,351  | 10,062 |\n| Non-controlling interest                             | 162    | 113    |\n| Total equity                                         | 9,513  | 10,175 |\n| Non-current debt                                     | 1,952  | 1,195  |\n| Current debt                                         | 90     | 104    |\n| Total debt                                           | 2,042  | 1,299  |\n| Total capitalisation                                 | 11,555 | 11,474 |\n| Total debt                                           | 2,042  | 1,299  |\n| Less: Interest-bearing financial assets              | 1,986  | 1,752  |\n| Net debt                                             | 56     | -453   |\n| Gearing ratio, %  1)                                 | 1      | -4     |\n| Net debt to EBITDA  1)                               | 0.04   | -0.24  |\n\n1)\n\n- Refer \u00bb Other financial information on Alternative performance measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing risk\n\nUnder all circumstances, UPM seeks to maintain adequate liquidity, which depends on a number of factors, such as the availability of cash flows from operations and access to additional debt and equity financing. UPM aims to ensure sufficient liquidity by means of efficient cash management and restricting financial investments to investment types that can readily be converted into cash and by keeping a sufficient amount of unused committed credit lines or cash as a reserve. UPM aims to minimise refinancing risks by ensuring a balanced loan portfolio maturing schedule and sufficiently long maturities. The average loan maturity at 31 December 2020 was 7.6 years (7.5 years).\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing\n\n| EURm                               | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at bank                       | 1,390  | 977    |\n| Cash equivalents                   | 330    | 559    |\n| Committed credit lines             | 1,458  | 7      |\n| of which used                      | -      | -4     |\n| Loan commitments                   | -123   | -47    |\n| Used uncommitted credit lines      | -2     | -2     |\n| Long-term loan repayment cash flow | -80    | -99    |\n| Liquidity                          | 2,973  | 1,391  |\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at banks and with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included in used uncommitted credit lines and presented within current debt in the balance sheet. In 2020, no impairment and no expected credit losses were recognised in profit or loss for loan receivables or cash and cash equivalents.",

In 2020, the group increased net debt by EUR 509 million. Net debt totalled EUR 56 million (-453 million) at the end of 2020.\n\nIn October 2020 UPM established a EUR 3 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme and launched a Green Finance Framework. The independent second opinion concerning the framework was provided by CICERO Shades of Green. UPM's framework was rated with the highest-grade, CICERO Dark Green.\n\nIn November 2020 UPM successfully issued its first Green Bond under the EMTN programme with a nominal value of EUR 750 million. The bond matures in November 2028 and pays a fixed coupon of 0.125%. There are no financial covenants connected to the bond. The net proceeds from the bond will be used for financing and/or refinancing Eligible Projects and Assets under UPM's Green Finance Framework. Then bond is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin.\n\n## Net debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net debt\n\n| EURm                                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bonds                               | 1,153  | 431    |\n| Loans from financial institutions   | 121    | 35     |\n| Lease liabilities                   | 469    | 504    |\n| Other loans                         | 210    | 225    |\n| Non-current debt                    | 1,952  | 1,195  |\n| Repayments of non-current debt      | 5      | 17     |\n| Repayments of lease liabilities     | 75     | 83     |\n| Derivatives                         | 8      | 3      |\n| Other liabilities                   | 2      | 2      |\n| Current debt                        | 90     | 104    |\n| Total debt                          | 2,042  | 1,299  |\n| Loan receivables                    | 4      | 7      |\n| Derivatives                         | 157    | 154    |\n| Other receivables                   | 20     | 19     |\n| Non-current interest-bearing assets | 181    | 180    |\n| Loan receivables                    | 8      | 8      |\n| Derivatives                         | 12     | 8      |\n| Other receivables                   | 66     | 20     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 1,720  | 1,536  |\n| Current interest-bearing assets     | 1,805  | 1,571  |\n| Total interest-bearing assets       | 1,986  | 1,752  |\n| Net debt                            | 56     | -453   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Debt\n\nDebt comprising of bonds, bank and pension loans, lease liabilities and other loans is recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the estimated life of the borrowing. UPM classifies debt as non-current unless due for settlement within a year. Most of the debt is hedged in a fair value hedge relationship as described in \u00bb Note 6.1 Financial risk management.\n\n## Accounting policies",

Approximately 33 % (30%) of leased assets recognised on the balance sheet consists of land areas in Uruguay, which the group uses for eucalyptus plantations. Approximately 34% (32%) of the leased assets on the balance sheet consist of five power plants. UPM uses the energy generated by these plants for its own production. In addition, the group has leased one waste water treatment plant as well as several warehouses, terminals, offices, railcars and vessels. UPM also leases some production machinery and equipment like forklifts and vehicles that are insignificant to the total leased assets portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, the total cash outflow for leased assets was EUR 86 (82) million. The expenses related to short-term leases recognised in the income statement in 2020 amounted to EUR 7 (9) million. The group had no significant variable lease payments in 2020.\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at year-end 31 December 2020 totals approximately EUR 412 million, which are mostly related to long-term charter agreements, railway service agreement in Uruguay and service agreements related to wood handling, waste water treatment and other utilities in Leuna, Germany. Such lease commitments in 2019 amounted to approximately EUR 100 million.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n67",

This assessment involves the exercise of judgment about whether it depends on a specified asset, whether UPM obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether UPM has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe group recognises a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases. UPM applies this to all asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less. A lease that contains a purchase option is not a short-term lease. UPM recognises lease payments of short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe lease term is determined as the non- cancellable period of the lease taking into consideration the options to extend and terminate if it is reasonably certain that the group will exercise the extension option or will not exercise the termination option. If the contract is for an indefinite period of time and the group and the lessor both have a right to terminate the contract within a short notice period (12 months or less) without a significant economic penalties and termination cash payments, the contract is considered to be a short-term.\n\nThe lease liability is recognised at the commencement date and measured at the present value of the lease payments to be paid during the lease term. The group uses, as a basis, discount rate implicit in the lease and if that rate cannot be readily determined, UPM uses incremental borrowing rate which comprises of currency and lease termbased reference rate and specific credit spread as well as other specific terms and conditions of a lease. Lease payments can include fixed payments, variable payments that depend on an index or rate and extension option payments or purchase options if it is reasonably certain that the group will exercise them. The lease liability is subsequently\n\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and remeasured (with corresponding adjustment to the related leased asset) when there is a change in future lease payments due to renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or reassessment of options.\n\nLeased asset comprises the initial lease liability, initial direct costs and the obligations to refurbish the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessors. The leased asset is subsequently valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Remeasurement takes place in case lease liability is remeasured and change in cash flows is based on contract terms that have been included in the original contract. The leased asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. The leased asset is subject to testing for impairment if there is an indicator for impairment, as for own assets.\n\nThe group has elected to separate non-lease components such as service components and other variable components and account them for as expenses, if they can be separated from the leased asset. However, the group does not separate non-lease components from the lease contracts of company cars.\n\nThe group does not apply portfolio approach of leases with similar characteristics.\n\nLeased assets are presented in the balance sheet as a separate financial statement line item. Lease liabilities are presented as part of non-current debt and current debt line items in the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are part of net debt calculation of the group. Short-term lease payments are reported as rents and lease expenses. Variable lease payments are recognised within the operating costs and expenses based on the nature of the payment. The interest expense on the lease liability is recognised as a component of finance costs in income statement. In cash flow statement, payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are recognised as financing cash flow while payments for interest portion of lease liability, short-term leases, and variable amounts not included in the measurement of the lease liability, are classified within operating cash flow.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n68\n\n## The group as a lessor\n\nAt inception of a lease contract, the group makes an assessment whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. If the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to\n\n## 5.3  Financial assets and liabilities by category\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, loans and other financial receivables, investments in securities, trade receivables, trade payables, loans, bank overdrafts and derivatives.\n\nClassification of financial assets into different measurement categories depends on the contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model for managing the financial asset. The measurement\n\nownership of the asset, it is considered to be a finance lease; if not, the lease is considered to be an operating lease. The group has only a minor amount of operating lease contracts, whereby the lease payments are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\ncategory of each financial asset is determined at inception. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right in all circumstances to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities by category at the end of 2020\n\n| EURm                                    | FAIR VALUE  THROUGH PROFIT  AND LOSS   | EQUITY  INSTRUMENTS AT  FAIR VALUE  THROUGH OCI   | DERIVATIVES  UNDER HEDGE  ACCOUNTING   | FINANCIAL  ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AT  AMORTISED COST   | TOTAL   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Energy shareholdings                    | -

The fair value of non-current loans amounted to EUR 1,978 million (1,186 million) at the end of 2020. For quoted bonds, the fair values are based on the quoted market value as of 31 December.\n\nAt the end of 2020, all bonds were quoted. For other non-current borrowings fair values are estimated using the expected contractual future payments discounted at market interest rates and are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n- \u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information on net debt and bonds.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n70\n\n## Fair value measurement hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                               | 2020    | 2020    | 2020    |       |         | 2019    |         |       |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-------|\n|                                    | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total |\n| Financial assets                   |         |         |         |       |         |         |         |       |\n| Derivatives, non-qualifying hedges | -       | 32      | -       | 32    | -       | 17      | -       | 17    |\n| Derivatives under hedge accounting | 2       | 252     | -       | 254   | 23      | 166     | -       | 189   |\n| Energy shareholdings               | -       | -       | 1,936   | 1,936 | -       | -       | 2,145   | 2,145 |\n| Total                              | 2       | 284     | 1,936   | 2,222 | 23      | 183     | 2,145   | 2,351 |\n| Financial liabilities              |         |         |         |       |         |         |         |       |\n| Derivatives, non-qualifying hedges | -       | 27      | -       | 27    | -       | 7       | -       | 7     |\n| Derivatives under hedge accounting | 2       | 27      | -       | 29    | 7       | 22      | -       | 28    |\n| Total                              | 2       | 54      | -       | 56    | 7       | 29      | -       | 36    |\n\nThere have been no transfers between levels in 2020 and 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nThis category includes derivatives that don't qualify hedge accounting. They are measured at fair value and any gains or losses from subsequent measurement are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThis category includes mainly UPM's energy shareholdings. These assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThis category comprises loan receivables with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, as well as trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. They are included in non-current assets unless they mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Cash and cash equivalents are always classified as current assets. Loan receivables that have a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Loan receivables without fixed maturity date are measured at amortised cost. As soon as a loan receivables or cash and cash equivalents are originated or purchased, a loss allowance for 12-month expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. If credit risk increases significantly, full lifetime expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. In the comparison period, loan receivables were impaired if the carrying amount exceeded the estimated recoverable amount. The credit loss model applied to trade receivables is described in \u00bb Note 4.6 Working capital.\n\n## Derivatives under hedge accounting\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. Gains and losses on remeasurement of derivatives used for hedging purposes are recognised in accordance with the accounting principles described in \u00bb Note 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nThis category includes debt, trade payables and other financial liabilities. \u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information.\n\nThe different levels of fair value hierarchy used in fair value estimation are defined as follows:\n\n## Fair values under level 1\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Derivatives include futures and commodity forwards traded in exchange.\n\n## Fair values under level 2\n\nObservable inputs are used as basis for fair value calculations either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Derivatives, level 2 include OTC derivatives like forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest and currency swaps and commodity swaps.\n\nSpecific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments at level 2 include the following methods:\n\nInterest forward rate agreements (FRA) are fair valued based on quoted market rates on the balance sheet date. Forward foreign exchange contracts are fair valued based on the contract forward rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency options are fair valued based on quoted market rates and market volatility rates on the balance sheet date by using the Black&Scholes option valuation model. Interest and currency swap instruments are fair valued as present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Commodity swaps are fair valued based on quoted forward prices on the balance sheet date.\n\nAn embedded derivative that is by nature a foreign currency forward contract is valuated at market forward exchange rates and is included in level 2. Embedded derivatives are monitored by the group and the fair value changes are reported in other operating income in the income statement.\n\n## Fair values under level 3\n\nFinancial assets or liabilities of which fair values are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) are classified under level 3. This category include UPM's energy shareholdings and forest assets. Fair valuations are performed at least quarterly by respective business areas or functions. Fair valuations are reviewed by the group finance management and overseen by the Audit Committee. \u00bb Refer Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings and \u00bb Note 4.2 Forest assets.",

Amounts are recycled only within equity upon the disposal of the asset.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThis reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred and the cost of hedging when recognised in OCI. Amounts are recognised in profit or loss when the associated hedged transactions affect profit or loss or as part of the acquisition cost of property, plant and equipment. There were no reclassifications from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss during the period resulting from inefficiency.\n\n## Share-based payments reserve\n\nThe share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value at the grant date of the share incentive plans, Performance Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan, over their vesting period.\n\n## Reserve for invested non-restricted equity\n\nReserve for invested non-restricted equity includes, under the Companies' Act, the exercise value of shareholders' investments in the company unless otherwise decided by the company.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nThis reserve includes the foreign currency differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and the effective result of transactions that hedge the group's net investments in foreign operations. There were no reclassifications from the translation reserve to profit or loss during the period resulting from inefficiency of net investment hedges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTransaction costs directly relating to the issue of new shares or share options are recognised, net of tax, in equity as a reduction in the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the parent company's shares (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the parent company until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the parent company.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2020                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | -4                            | 78                                         | -6                 | -14   | 55      |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | 10                            | -61                                        | 9                  | 8     | -34     |\n| Amounts reclassified to acquisition cost of a fixed assets    | -4                            | 0                                          | 0                  | 0     | -5      |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | 55                            | -43                                        | -5                 | 5     | 11      |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | 57                            | -26                                        | -2                 | -1    | 28      |\n\n5\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2019                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | -19                           | 154                                        | -5                 | -26   | 104     |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | 38                            | -46                                        | 13                 | -1    |         |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | -24                           | -30                                        | -14                | 14    | -54     |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | -4                            | 78                                         | -6                 | -14   | 55      |",

Risk management\n\n## 6.1  Financial risk management\n\nThe objective of financial risk management is to protect the group from unfavourable changes in financial markets and thus help to secure profitability. The objectives and limits for financing activities are defined in the Group Treasury Policy approved by the Board of Directors. In financial risk management various financial instruments are used within the limits specified in the Group Treasury Policy. Only such instruments which market value and risk profile can be continuously and reliably monitored are used for this purpose.\n\nFinancing services are provided to the group entities and financial risk management carried out by the central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAs a consequence of the global nature of its business, UPM is exposed to risks associated with changes in exchange rates, primarily with respect to USD, GBP and JPY. Foreign exchange risk arises from contracted and expected commercial future payment flows (transaction exposure), changes in value of recognised assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and changes in the value of assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries (translation exposure). The objective of foreign exchange risk management is to limit the uncertainty created by changes in foreign exchange rates on the future value of cash flows earnings and in the group's balance sheet. Changing exchange rates can also have indirect effects, such as change in relative competitiveness between currency regions.\n\n## Transaction exposure\n\nThe group hedges transaction exposure related to highly probable future commercial foreign currency cash flows on a rolling basis over the next 12-month period based on forecasts by the respective business areas. Transaction risk arises from the changes in currency rates of highly probable transactions, which are expected to take place in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The group's policy is to hedge an average of 50% of its estimated net risk currency cash flow. Some highly probable cash flows have been hedged for longer than 12 months ahead while deviating from the risk neutral hedging level at the same time. At 31 December 2020, 49% (51%) of the forecast 12-month currency flow was hedged.\n\nThe group enters into external forward contracts, which are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk of specific future foreign currency flows. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied when possible. If hedge accounting is not possible, fair value changes of the hedging instrument are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nAt the end of 2020, UPM's estimated net risk currency flow for the next 12 months was EUR 1,327 million (1,673 million).\n\nThe weighted hedging rate by currency against EUR were USD 1.15, GBP 0.9 and JPY 121,8.\n\nIn addition to commercial foreign currency flow, the group has hedged risk currency flow related to investments. Cash flow or fair value hedge accounting is applied. At the end of 2020 the nominal value of these hedges was EUR 470 million (EUR 4 million).\n\n## 12 months net risk currency flow and hedges 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12 months net risk currency flow and hedges 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Translation exposure\n\nThe group has several currency denominated assets and liabilities on its balance sheet such as foreign currency bonds, loans and deposits, group internal loans and cash in other currencies than functional currencies. UPM aims to fully hedge this balance sheet translation exposure, however, UPM might have unhedged balance sheet exposures within the limits set in group Treasury Policy.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the unhedged balance sheet exposures in net of interest-bearing assets and liabilities amounted to EUR 11 million (14 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nThe group has also accounts receivable and payable balances denominated in foreign currencies and UPM aims to fully hedge the net exposure in main currencies. The nominal values of the hedging instruments in net of accounts payable and receivable hedging were EUR 540 million (433 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nUPM's net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to foreign currency translation differences. The exchange rate differences arising from translation of foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of equity in the translation reserve relate mainly to USD, CNY and GBP. Currency exposure arising from the net investment in foreign subsidiaries is generally not hedged. However, at 31 December 2020, part of the foreign exchange risk associated with the net investments was hedged, major ones in China and Uruguay, and net investment hedge accounting has been applied. The average\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n74\n\nweighted hedging rate of these hedges against EUR were China CNY 8.17 and Uruguay USD 1.09.\n\nDerivatives used for hedging translation risks are external forward contracts, cross currency swaps and currency options.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk sensitivity\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect to profit before tax due to recognised balance sheet items in foreign currency and the effect to equity arising mainly from foreign currency forwards used to hedge foreign currency flows.\n\n|                        | Profit before tax   | Profit before tax   | Equity   | Equity   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|\n| EURm                   | 2020                | 2019                | 2020     | 2019     |\n| EUR strengthens by 10% |                     |                     |          |          |\n| USD                    | 1                   | -                   | 91       | 61       |\n| UYU                    | -                   | -                   | -15      | -7       |\n| JPY                    | -1                  | -1                  | 9        | 11       |\n| GBP                    | -                   | -                   | 8        | 10       |\n| EUR weakens by 10%     |                     |                     |          |          |\n| USD                    | -1                  | -                   | -91      | -61      |\n| UYU                    | -                   | -                   | 15       | 7        |\n| JPY                    | 1                   | 1                   | -9       | -11      |\n| GBP                    | -                   | -                   | -8       | -10      |\n\nThe following assumptions were made when calculating the sensitivity to changes in the foreign exchange risk:\n\n- \u00b7 Major part of non-derivative financial instruments (such as cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, debt and trade payables) are either directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives i.e. the balance sheet position is close to zero. Exchange rate fluctuations have therefore minor or no effects on profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 The position includes foreign currency forward contracts that hedge commercial flows or investments and are part of the effective cash flow hedge having an effect on equity.\n- \u00b7 The position includes also foreign currency forward contracts that are not part of the effective cash flow hedge having an effect on profit.\n- \u00b7 The position excludes foreign currency denominated future cash flows and effects of translation exposure and related hedges\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe interest-bearing liabilities and assets expose the group to interest rate risk, namely repricing and fair value interest rate risk caused by interest rate movements. According to the Group Treasury Policy the interest rate exposure is defined as the difference in interest rate sensitivity between assets and liabilities compared to a benchmark portfolio with a 6-month duration. The total interest rate exposure is a net debt portfolio which includes all interest bearing assets and liabilities and derivatives that are used to hedge the aforementioned balance sheet items. The policy sets risk limits and allowed deviation from target net debt duration level. The group uses interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate futures and crosscurrency swaps, to change net debt duration.\n\nThe table below shows the nominal value of interest rate position exposed to interest rate risk in each significant currency. The position includes all cash balances, interest bearing assets and liabilities and currency derivatives used to hedge these items. The positive/negative\n\nposition indicates a net liability/asset position by currency and that the group is exposed to repricing and/or fair value interest risk by interest rate movements in that currency. Table excludes leasing transactions.\n\n## Nominal values of the group's net debt by currency including derivatives\n\n| EURbn   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| EUR     |   -0.3 |   -1   |\n| USD     |    0.2 |    0.3 |\n| GBP     |   -0.1 |   -0.1 |\n| Others  |   -0.3 |   -0.1 |\n| Total   |   -0.5 |   -1   |\n\nMost of the interest rate derivatives hedging interest on long-term debt meet the requirement of fair value hedge accounting.\n\n## Interest rate risk sensitivity\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect to profit before tax mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate debt and the effect to equity as a result of a decrease/increase in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of floating rate debt.\n\n-\n\n|                                                    |   Profit before tax |   Profit before tax | Equity   | Equity   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|\n| EURm                                               |                2020 |                2019 | 2020     | 2019     |\n| Interest rate of net debt 100  basis points higher |                 -12 |                  -6 | -        |          |\n| Interest rate of net debt 100  basis points lower  |                  12 |                   6 | -        | -        |\n\nThe following assumptions were made when calculating the sensitivity to changes in interest rates:\n\n- \u00b7 The variation of interest rate is assumed to be 100 basis points parallel shift in applicable interest rate curves.\n- \u00b7 In the case of fair value hedges designated for hedging interest rate risk, the changes in the fair values of the hedged items and the hedging instruments attributable to the interest rate movements balance out almost completely in the income statement in the same period. However, the possible ineffectiveness has an effect on the profit of the year.\n- \u00b7 Cash balances are excluded.\n- \u00b7 Leasing transaction are excluded.\n- \u00b7 Fixed rate debt that is measured at amortised cost and is not designated to fair value hedge relationship is not subject to interest rate risk sensitivity.\n- \u00b7 In case of variable to fixed interest rate swaps which are included in cash flow hedge accounting, fair value changes of hedging swaps are booked to equity.\n- \u00b7 Floating rate debt that are measured at amortised cost and not designated as hedged items are included in interest rate sensitivity analysis.\n- \u00b7 Changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives (interest rate futures, swaps and cross currency swaps) that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting affect the financial income or expenses (net gains or losses from remeasurement of the financial assets and liabilities to fair value) and are therefore included in the income-related sensitivity analysis.",

Electricity prices rely on the balance of supply and demand and as the share of intermittent renewable energy sources grows in the energy system, the volatility in the electricity market increases. The group's sensitivity to electricity market price is dependent on the electricity production and consumption levels and the hedging levels. The inherent price risks arise from the daily sales and purchases of electricity from the power market with spot prices, and the hedging objective is to reduce the earnings volatility that arises from electricity prices.\n\nUPM considers system (SYS) and electricity price area differential (EPAD) products perfect hedges for corresponding electricity price risk components in Finland. The components of electricity price risk in the Nordic power market are hedged by entering into System and EPAD electricity derivative contracts, mostly Nasdaq Commodities forwards, futures and options. System and EPAD prices are considered as separately identifiable and reliably measurable risk components in electricity sales and purchase contracts as well as in the hedging instruments, as a quoted price is available. Fair value changes of designated system and EPAD derivatives are offsetting electricity sales and purchase price changes. The share of SYS component covers approximately 80-90% and the share of EPAD component covers 10-20% of the changes in electricity sales and purchase prices.\n\nThe electricity price risk in the Central European power market is hedged by entering into European electricity exchange futures. Products used for hedging hedge the entire price risk for the underlying price area.\n\nThe time frame hedged has historically been approximately rolling 5 years. Hedging level has been typically higher for the nearest years and lower for the latter years. Hedging level for a certain year has historically varied between 0-80%. UPM constantly updates its electricity sales and consumption forecasts. The targeted hedging level is calculated based on the most recent available information about the sales and consumption of electricity.\n\nThe group applies cash flow hedge accounting for the hedging relationships when it hedges its electricity price risk. In addition to hedging, the group is also trading electricity forwards and futures. As well as hedging, proprietary trading risks are monitored on a daily basis. Value-At-Risk levels are set to limit the maximum risk at any given time. Cumulative maximum loss is limited by stop-loss limits.\n\n## Electricity derivatives price sensitivity\n\nSensitivity analysis for financial electricity derivatives is based on position at the end of financial year. Sensitivities change over time as the overall hedging and trading positions change. Underlying physical positions are not included in the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is calculated separately for the hedge accounted and nonhedge accounted volumes. In the analysis it is assumed that forward quotation in Nasdaq Commodities and EEX would change EUR 5/ MWh throughout the period UPM has derivatives. EUR 5/ MWh price sensitivity is estimated from historical market price movements in Nasdaq and EEX markets.\n\n| EURm                                             | EFFECT   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| +/- EUR 5/MWh in electricity  forward quotations |          |        |        |\n| Effect on profit before tax                      | +/-      | 0.7    | 3.8    |\n| Effect on equity                                 | +/-      | 64.9   | 11.2   |\n\n## 6.2  Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe group uses financial derivatives to manage currency, interest rate and commodity price risks.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 6.1 Financial risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value gain or loss is recognised through the income statement or other comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and on the nature of the item being hedged. Certain derivatives are designated at inception either hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge), hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge), or hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries with other than the EUR as their functional currency (net investment hedge). Derivative fair values on the balance sheet are classified as non-current when the remaining maturity is more than 12 months and as current when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months.\n\nFor hedge accounting purposes, UPM documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception date. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions. The group also documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\nCertain derivatives, while considered to be economical hedges for UPM's financial risk management purposes, do not qualify for hedge accounting. Such derivatives are recognised at fair value through the income statement in other operating income or under financial items.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. Cost of hedging, meaning forward points of derivative forward contracts accounted as cash flow hedges, is recognised as a part of the hedging reserve. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement and classified as income or expense in the same period as that in which the hedged item affects the income statement (for example, when the forecast external sale to the group that is hedged takes place).\n\nWhen the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a fixed asset, gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the committed or forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. However, if a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recognised to the income statement.\n\nIn currency cash flow hedging, the hedging instrument is made in the same currency as the hedged item and hence the fair value change of the hedging instrument are expected to effectively offset the fair value\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n76\n\nchanges generated by the hedged items. Thereby the hedge ratio between the instrument and the cash flow is 1:1. Ineffectiveness may arise in the highly unlikely case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur. Ineffectiveness can also occur in a situation where the hedging instrument with an appropriate maturity is not available in the market for the whole duration of the hedged item. Then the terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item don't fully match, which causes minor ineffectiveness. There are no other significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\nIneffectiveness in electricity price hedges may arise in the highly unlikely case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur. Ineffectiveness may also arise in case EPAD prices remained negative for a longer period of time, but considering historical price development UPM considers this scenario to be highly unlikely.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe fair value changes of forward exchange contracts used in hedging net investments that reflect the change in spot exchange rates are recognised in other comprehensive income within translation reserve. Any gain or loss relating to the interest portion of forward exchange contracts is recognised immediately in the income statement under financial items. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\n\nThe hedging instrument is always made in the same currency as the hedged investment, hence the hedge ratio in net investment hedging is 1:1. For hedging of net investments, ineffectiveness may only arise in the highly unlikely situation where the hedged item is disposed or sold during the duration of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe group applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and that are prospectively highly effective are recorded in the income statement under financial items, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. The carrying amounts of hedged items and the fair values of hedging instruments are included in interest-bearing assets or liabilities.\n\nDerivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges mature at the same time as hedged items. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the expected period to maturity.\n\nIneffectiveness in fair value hedge of fixed interest risk may arise in case of early redemption of such debt, which is hedged under fair value hedge accounting. The group has not recognised other significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\nThe group applies fair value hedge accounting also for hedging firm commitment of a purchase in foreign currency. The currency changes of the hedging instrument are recorded through profit and loss in financial items, until they are recognised as a part of the acquisition cost of a fixed asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial counterparty risk\n\nThe financial instruments the group has agreed with banks and financial institutions contain an element of risk of the counterparties being unable to meet their obligations. According to the Group Treasury Policy derivative instruments and investments of cash funds may be made only with counterparties meeting certain creditworthiness criteria. The group minimises counterparty risk also by using a number of major banks and financial institutions. Creditworthiness of counterparties is constantly monitored by Treasury and Risk Management.\n\n## Effect of IBOR reform and significant assumptions\n\nThe Group's risk exposure that is directly affected by the IBOR reform is fair value hedge accounting of long-term fixed-rate debt for changes in fair value attributable to USD LIBOR which is the current benchmark interest rate. Group currently has only few contracts which reference USD LIBOR and extend beyond 2021. Group oversees the IBOR transition and follows changes to ISDA and other market guidelines on effects of these changes to UPM's contracts. In fair value hedging relationships, fair value for both the hedged item and hedging instrument is calculated with identical rate. Therefore no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020",

Income tax\n\n## 7.1  Tax on profit for the year\n\n## Income tax\n\nIn 2020, tax on profit for the year amounted to EUR 169 million (234 million). The effective tax rate was 22.9% (17.9%). In 2020 and 2019, the effective tax rate was affected by the income not subject to tax from subsidiaries operating in tax free zone. In addition, effective tax rate was affected by German tax rate that is higher than in Finland and the loss of France subsidiary for which no deferred tax assets were recognised due to uncertainty of their utilisation.\n\nIn 2020, accrued and paid withholding taxes relating to dividend payments of subsidiaries amounted to EUR 9 million (EUR 2 million). In 2020, tax losses with no tax benefit mainly relate to the losses resulting from the closure of UPM Chapelle paper mill in France. In 2019, change in recoverability of deferred tax assets included EUR 15 million tax income related to reassessment of deferred tax assets in Germany.\n\n## Income tax\n\n| EURm                     |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax expense      |    141 |    181 |\n| Change in deferred taxes |     28 |     53 |\n| Total                    |    169 |    234 |\n\n## Tax rate reconciliation\n\n| EURm                                              | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before tax                                 | 737    | 1,307  |\n| Computed tax at Finnish statutory rate of 20%     | 147    | 261    |\n| Difference between Finnish and foreign rates      | 1      | 16     |\n| Tax-exempt income                                 | -29    | -34    |\n| Non-deductible expenses                           | 6      | 9      |\n| Withholding taxes                                 | 9      | 2      |\n| Tax loss with no tax benefit                      | 29     | 3      |\n| Results of associates                             | -1     | -      |\n| Change in tax legislation                         | 4      | 1      |\n| Change in recoverability of deferred tax assets   | 3      | -12    |\n| Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses | -3     | -10    |\n| Other items                                       | 2      | -1     |\n| Total income taxes                                | 169    | 234    |\n| Effective tax rate, %                             | 22.9 % | 17.9 % |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group's income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is calculated on the taxable result for the period based on the tax rules prevailing in the countries where the group operates and includes tax adjustments for previous periods and withholding taxes deducted at source on intra-group transactions. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity or as part of other comprehensive income. In these instances, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the group's tax expense and income tax liabilities involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Tax balances reflect a current understanding and interpretation of existing tax laws. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and adjusts income tax liabilities where appropriate.\n\n## 7.2  Deferred tax\n\n| EURm                                                 | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                  |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | 77     | 77     | 76     |\n| Inventories                                          | 38     | 45     | 62     |\n| Retirement benefit liabilities and provisions        | 156    | 148    | 121    |\n| Other temporary differences                          | 163    | 103    | 24     |\n| Tax losses and tax credits carried forward           | 157    | 180    | 198    |\n| Offset against liabilities                           | -170   | -157   | -83    |\n| Total                                                | 421    | 395    | 397    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                             |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | -245   | -249   | -181   |\n| Forest assets                                        | -352   | -364   | -329   |\n| Retirement benefit assets                            | -5     | -7     | -7     |\n| Other temporary differences                          | -132   | -86    | -101   |\n| Offset against assets                                | 170    | 157    | 83     |\n| Total                                                | -564   | -549   | -535   |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)                | -143   | -153   | -138   |\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.",

At 31 December 2020, net operating loss carry-forwards for which the group has recognised a deferred tax asset amounted to EUR 536 million (616 million), of which EUR 475 million (502 million) was attributable to German subsidiaries. In Germany net operating loss carry-forwards do not expire. In other countries net operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates and in varying amounts. Based on profit forecasts, it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available against which the tax losses can be utilised.\n\nThe assumptions regarding future realisation of tax benefits, and therefore the recognition of deferred tax assets, may change due to future operating performance of the group, as well as other factors, some of which are outside of the control of the group.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe net operating loss carry-forwards for which no deferred tax is recognised due to uncertainty of their utilisation amounted to EUR 864 million (819 million) in 2020. These net operating loss carry-forwards are mainly attributable to certain German and French subsidiaries and do not expire. In addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax assets on loss carry-forwards relating to closed Miramichi paper mill due to only minor operations in Canada. These loss carry-forwards expire at different times by the end of 2029.\n\nThe group has not recognised deferred tax liability in respect of undistributed earnings of non-Finnish subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax liability for the undistributed earnings of Finnish subsidiaries and associates as such earnings can be distributed without any tax consequences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDeferred tax is calculated based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the taxable values of assets and liabilities and for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that it is probable that these can be utilised against future taxable profits.\n\nDeferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised net where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n82\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.\n\n## Group structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8.1 Business acquisitions and disposals\n\nIn 2020, UPM sold its 50% share in the joint operation Kainuun Voima. UPM also made a minor sale of its 6.1% ownership BSW Timber Ltd, which was accounted for as a fair value through OCI investment. In 2019, UPM made a minor sale of its joint venture, EURO WASTE a.s.\n\nIn 2020, UPM purchased an additional 1.89% share in the joint operation Alholmens Kraft, increasing UPM's ownership from 27.88% to 29.77 %.

In September 2019, the new shareholders' agreements of Tile Forestal S.A., CUECAR S.A., Tebetur S.A. and Blanvira S.A. were signed reducing UPM's continuing interest in these companies to 91%. The proceeds of EUR 3 million were received from non-controlling interest in cash being the proportionate share of the carrying amount of the net assets of these subsidiaries. In addition, the terms and conditions of UPM S.A. shareholders' agreement were amended resulting in recognition of 9% non-controlling interest amounting to EUR 63 million and derecognition of financial liability amounting to EUR 56 million. The difference amounting to EUR 7 million was recognised in equity as transactions with non-controlling interest. Prior to the amendment of the agreement the group accounted the portion belonging to non-controlling interests at the present value of the redemption amount within financial liability due to put option over non-controlling interests.\n\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests are consolidated line by line into the UPM consolidated financial statements. The proportion of the profit for the period, as well as the accumulated share of total equity belonging to non-controlling interests are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nUPM consolidates acquired entities at the acquisition date which is when it gains control using the acquisition method. Consideration transferred is determined as the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued including the fair value of a contingent consideration. Acquisition related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The group measures any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill.\n\n## 8.2  Principal subsidiaries and joint operations\n\n| SUBSIDIARIES                        | COUNTRY OF  INCORPORATION   |   HOLDING %    2020 |   HOLDING %    2019 |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Blandin Paper Company               | US                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n| Blanvira S.A.                       | UY                          |                  91 |                  91 |\n| Cuecar S.A.                         | UY                          |                  91 |                  91 |\n| Forestal Oriental S.A.              | UY                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n| Gebr\u00fcder Lang GmbH Papierfabrik     | DE                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n| LLC UPM Ukraine                     | UA                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n| Nordland Papier GmbH                | DE                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n| NorService GmbH                     | DE                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n| nortrans Speditionsgesellschaft mbH | DE                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n| OOO UPM-Kymmene                     | RU                          |                 100 |                 100 |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n83",

Property under mortgages given as collateral for own commitments include property, plant and equipment, industrial estates and forest land.\n\n| EURm                                                                       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| On own behalf                                                              |        |        |\n| Mortgages                                                                  | -      | 1      |\n| On behalf of others                                                        |        |        |\n| Guarantees                                                                 | 2      | 2      |\n| Other own commitments                                                      |        |        |\n| Leasing commitments for the next 12 months in  accordance with IFRS 16  1) | 6      | 6      |\n| Leasing commitments for subsequent periods 1)                              | -      | -      |\n| Other commitments                                                          | 214    | 104    |\n| Total                                                                      | 223    | 113    |\n\nIncrease in other commitments is mainly due to a shareholder loan commitment to PVO, which amounts to EUR 123 million . Refer Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings for additional information.\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at the end of 2020 totals approximately EUR 412 million, which are mostly related to long-term charter agreements, railway service agreement in Uruguay and service agreements related to wood handling, waste water treatment and other utilities in Leuna, Germany. Such lease commitments at the end of 2019 amounted to EUR 100 million.\n\n## 9.2  Litigation\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThe group is defendant or plaintiff in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations. These lawsuits primarily involve claims arising from commercial law issues.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe group's management is not aware of any significant litigation in the end of 2020.\n\n## 9.3  Events after the balance sheet date\n\nOn 19 January, UPM announced that it would invest EUR 13 million in UPM Raflatac's new production line in Nowa Wie \u015b , Poland. The investment will increase UPM Raflatac's Direct Thermal (DT) Linerless annual production capacity by 100 million m2. The new production line is expected to be operational at the end of 2021.\n\nOn 28 January, UPM announced that it moves forward with biofuels growth plans and starts the basic engineering phase of a next generation biorefinery.\n\n## 10. Other notes\n\n## 10.1 Forthcoming new standards, amendments and accounting policy changes\n\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2020 reporting periods. These standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions and have not been early adopted. The impact of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform-Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16) is presented below.\n\n## Phase 2 amendments IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16 for IBOR reform\n\nThe IBOR reform phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 relate to matters that might affect financial reporting when an existing interest rate benchmark is replaced. The amendments explain how to account for changes on the basis for determining contractual cash flows as a result of IBOR reform, provide additional temporary exceptions from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to avoid discontinuation of hedge relationships solely due to IBOR reform. The amendments also include additional IFRS 7 disclosures related to the reform. The IBOR reform phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.\n\nThe group's risk exposure that is directly affected by the IBOR reform is fair value hedge accounting of long-term fixed-rate debt for changes in fair value attributable to USD LIBOR which is the current benchmark interest rate. Group currently has only few contracts which reference USD LIBOR and extend beyond 2021. Group Treasury oversees the group's IBOR transition and follows changes to ISDA and other market guidelines on effects of these changes to UPM's contracts. In fair value hedging relationships, fair value for both the hedged item and hedging instrument is calculated with identical rate. Therefore no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n86\n\n## Parent company accounts\n\n## (Finnish Accounting Standards, FAS)\n\n## Income statement\n\n| EURm                                                         | NOTE   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sales                                                        | 1      | 1,816  | 2,318  |\n| Change in inventories of finished goods and work in progress |        | -6     | -2     |\n| Production for own use                                       |        | 5      | 5      |\n| Other operating income                                       | 2      | 44     | 18     |\n| Materials and services                                       |        |        |        |\n| Raw materials and consumables purchased                      |        | -1,342 | -1,460 |\n| Change in inventories                                        |        | -6     | -45    |\n| External charges                                             |        | -6     | -5     |\n|                                                              |        | -1,353 | -1,510 |\n| Personnel expenses                                           |        |        |        |\n| Salaries and fees                                            |        | -196   | -212   |\n| Indirect employee costs                                      |        |        |        |\n| Pension costs                                                |        | -31    | -31    |\n| Other indirect employee costs                                |        | -7     | -7     |\n|                                                              | 3      | -234   | -250   |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges            |        |        |        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                |        | -115   | -111   |\n| Impairment charges on non-current assets                     |        | -1     | 0      |\n|                                                              | 4      | -116   | -111   |\n| Other operating expenses                                     | 5      | -183   | -192   |\n| Operating profit                                             |        | -27    | 277    |\n| Financial income and expenses                                |        |        |        |\n| Income from non-current assets                               |        |        |        |\n| Dividend income from group companies                         |        | 348    | 534    |\n| Interest income from group companies                         |        | 5      | 6      |\n| Other interest and financial income                          |        |        |        |\n| Other interest income from group companies                   |        | 43     | 40     |\n| Other interest income from other companies                   |        | 1      | 1      |\n| Other financial income from other companies                  |        | 23     | 0      |\n| Impairment charges on investments                            |        | 1      | -      |\n| Interest and other financial expenses                        |        |        |        |\n| Interest expenses to group companies                         |        | -8     | -13    |\n| Interest expenses to other companies                         |        | -21    | -16    |\n| Other financial expenses to group companies                  |        | -20    | -3     |\n| Other financial expenses to other companies                  |        | -69    | -32    |\n|                                                              |        | 302    | 516    |\n| Profit before closing entries and tax                        |        | 275    | 793    |\n| Closing entries                                              |        |        |        |\n| Depreciation difference                                      |        | 1      | 6      |\n| Group contributions granted                                  |        | -19    | -      |\n|                                                              |        | -18    | 6      |\n| Income taxes                                                 | 6      | -8     | -43    |\n| Profit for the period                                        |        | 249    | 756    |",

The main differences in accounting policies of the group and the parent company relate to the measurement of financial derivatives and forest assets and recognition of defined benefit obligations, share-based payments, lease agreements and deferred income taxes.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in millions of euros and rounded and therefore the sum of individual figures might deviate from the presented total figure.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nReceivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date and other commitments are translated into euro currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Exchange rate differences arising from the valuation of trade receivables are recognised in sales and exchange rate differences on trade payables in purchases. Exchange differences arising from the measurement of other receivables and liabilities are recognised in financial items.\n\n## Tangible and intangible assets\n\nTangible and intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortisation according to plan and impairments. Emission rights are recognised using net approach. Depreciation and amortization according to plan is recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\nLand and water areas, no depreciation\n\n| Intangible assets             | 5 - 10 years   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                     | 20 - 50 years  |\n| Light machinery and equipment | 5 - 10 years   |\n| Heavy machinery               | 15 - 20 years  |\n| Power plants                  | 20 - 30 years  |\n| Other tangible assets         | 5 - 20 years   |\n\nForest assets are recognised as tangible assets within land and water areas at historical cost and revaluation. No systematic depreciation or changes in value due to felling is recognised.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are stated at cost less impairments.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at cost or the lower of replacement cost and probable selling price. Costs are measured using FIFO-method. In addition to variable costs, the cost of inventories includes a portion of the fixed costs of acquisition and manufacturing.\n\n## Revaluations\n\nThe balance sheet value of land includes revaluations. No new revaluations are made and the balance sheet value of land is considered to be below their fair value.\n\n## Leases\n\nLease payments of lease contracts are recognised in other operating expenses over the lease term. Lease payments due in future years under lease contracts are presented as off-balance sheet items.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions include foreseeable future expenses and losses to which the company is committed, the realization of which is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated, e.g. pension and environmental liabilities and termination and restructuring costs. Changes in provisions are recognised in income statement within particular cost items.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales include sales revenue from actual operations less indirect taxes, discounts, claims and exchange rate differences on net cash flow hedges and trade receivables.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Pensions\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). The mandatory pensions are arranged mainly through pension insurance companies. Contributions to pension insurance companies are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. Pension obligations of own pension funds are fully funded.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nShare based compensation is recognized as an expense in the income statement over the earnings period and the related liability is booked to the balance sheet.\n\n## Closing entries\n\nParent company closing entries consists of the change in the depreciation difference and group contributions granted to group companies. The accumulated depreciation difference in the parent company has not been divided into equity and deferred tax liability.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes presented in the income statement consist of accrued taxes for the financial year and tax adjustments for prior years. The parent company has not recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, but presents the information in the notes.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nIncome and expenses of derivative contracts relating to net cash flow hedges are recognised in sales. Income and expenses related to commodity derivatives are recognised in purchases. Income and expenses of fair value hedges are recognised in financial items. Net cash flow hedging derivatives and commodity derivatives are recognised in the income statement when the cash flow occurs. Hedge accounting is not applied. The fair value losses of financial derivatives are recognised through the income statement and presented as a provision in the balance sheet.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2020\n\n91",

The financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies\n- \u00b7 the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 2.3 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Our Audit Approach\n\n## Overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Overall group materiality: \u20ac 60 million, which represents approximately 5 % of the average of the profit before tax for the last three years.\n- \u00b7 The group audit scope encompassed all significant group companies, as well as a number of smaller group companies in Europe, Asia, North America and South America covering the vast majority of revenue, assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of forest assets\n- \u00b7 Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.",

An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 60 million (previous year \u20ac 60 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | Approximately 5% of the average of the profit before tax for the last three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Rationale for the materiality  benchmark applied | We chose profit before taxes as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which the performance of the Group is commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted  benchmark. We chose approximately 5%, which is within the range of acceptable quantitative  materiality thresholds in auditing standards. |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the UPM-Kymmene Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.\n\nWe determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or by auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets and liabilities of the group. Selected specified procedures as well as analytical procedures were performed to cover the remaining group companies.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matter in the audit of the group\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of forest assets\n\nRefer to note 4.2. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe group owns and leases total of 1 025 thousand hectares of forests and plantations in Finland, the United States and Uruguay valued at \u20ac 2 077 million at 31 December 2020. Forest assets are measured at fair value less cost to sell. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows as there is a lack of a liquid market. Young saplings and land are valued at cost. Main factors used in the valuation are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nIn testing the valuation of forest assets, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodologies adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n- -Assessed the discount rates applied in the valuation;\n- -Assessed the other key valuation assumptions; and,\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as stumpage price, trend price forecast, tree growth assumptions, consumer price index and inflation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nRefer to note 4.3. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe energy shareholdings amounted to \u20ac 1 936 million at 31 December 2020. The energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments in energy companies and are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable. The fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis. The main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends, discount rates and the start-up schedule of the nuclear power plant unit Olkiluoto 3.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nIn testing the valuation of the energy shareholdings, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodology adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n- -Assessed the future electricity prices and price trends;\n- -Assessed the discount rate applied in the valuation;\n- -Validated the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant unit start-up schedule against the most recent available information;\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as production costs and volumes, UPM's ownership percentages, inflation, tax rate and net debt.\n\nWe have no key audit matters to report with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nThere are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our",

However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Reporting Requirements\n\n## Appointment\n\nWe have been acting as auditors appointed by the annual general meeting since 30 April 1996. Our appointment represents a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 25 years. The Company arranged the latest audit tendering process in 2013. Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Mikko Nieminen has acted as the responsible auditor since 4 April 2019, representing a total uninterrupted period of two years.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. We have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the date of this auditor's report and the Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to the report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. In our opinion\n\n- \u00b7 the information in the report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the information in the financial statements\n- \u00b7 the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Other Statements\n\nWe support the proposal that the financial statements are adopted. The proposal by the Board of Directors regarding the distribution of profits is in compliance with the Limited Liability Companies Act. We support that the Members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of the parent company should be discharged from liability for the financial period audited by us.\n\nHelsinki 15 February 2021\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nAuthorised Public Accountants\n\nMikko Nieminen Authorised Public Accountant (KHT)\n\n## Other financial information\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nUPM presents certain performance measures of historical performance, financial position and cash flows, which in accordance with the 'Alternative Performance Measures' guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) are not accounting measures defined or specified in IFRS and are therefore considered as alternative performance measures.

transactions with significant income statement impact are considered as  items affecting comparability, if they arise from asset impairments, restructuring measures, asset sales, fair value  changes

In addition, the changes in fair value of unrealised cash flow and commodity hedges are classified as  items affecting comparability. Numerical threshold for items to be considered as significant in UPM's business areas  UPM Biorefining, UPM Specialty Papers and UPM Communication Papers is determined as one cent (EUR 0.01) after  tax per share or more. In other business areas, the impact is considered to be significant if the item exceeds EUR 1  million before tax. |\n| Free cash flow                                         | Cash generated from
