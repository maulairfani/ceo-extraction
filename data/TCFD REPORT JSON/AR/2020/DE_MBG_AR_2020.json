        "page_content": "## Dear shareholders,\n\nWe have an extraordinary year behind us. the global pandemic had a considerable impact on society, politics and the world economy, and thus also on Daimler. We responded at an early stage at all our sites and took a number of effective countermeasures. our top priority was, and still is, to protect people's health. At the same time, we secured our liquidity, continued to push forward with future projects, and set the course for our long-term development. our financial results significantly exceeded expectations in 2020, due in particular to a strong fourth quarter. overall, we successfully steered Daimler through difficult waters. i would like to thank my colleagues for this/uni00A0- for their tireless commitment, their great flexibility, and their strong cohesion.\n\nin 2020, a total of 2.8 million customers chose to buy a vehicle from Daimler. our revenue amounted to 154.3 billion euros. eBit increased by 53 percent to 6.6 billion euros. our net liquidity in the industrial business was 17.9 billion euros at the end of the year. the bottom line was a net profit of 4 billion euros. At the Annual shareholders' meeting, the Board of management and the supervisory Board will propose the payment of a dividend of one euro and 35 cents per share.\n\nhow did the individual divisions contribute to these results?\n\nMercedes-Benz AG sold 2.5 million cars and vans in 2020. in view of the challenging environment, we are satisfied with that. mercedes-Benz maintained its position as the world's leading premium manufacturer. our sustainable business strategy is increasingly reflected by our unit sales. We tripled the sales of our cars with alternative drive systems in 2020 and thus achieved the ambitious Co 2 limits in europe. China continues to be our biggest market. With a twelve percent increase, we posted record unit sales there in 2020. the most important new product of the past year was the new s-Class. Demand for our flagship is at a high level. the new model drives off the assembly line in Factory 56. What has long been regarded as the production of the future is already a reality in this new factory, which combines flexibility, efficiency, digitization and sustainability. it is a flagship of the newly defined strategy of mercedes-Benz. our aspiration: We will build the world's most desirable cars.\n\nsales of our electric vans also developed positively. in europe, we are the market leader in the segments of mid-size and large electric vans, each with a market share of more than one third.\n\neconomic uncertainties are particularly noticeable in the commercial-vehicle markets. Compared with record year 2019, unit sales at Daimler Truck AG were down by more than a quarter in 2020. however, demand in our important us market picked up again. We were able to extend our market leadership in almost all of our core markets. At the same time, we set some important strategic markers: We will produce mercedesBenz trucks in China in a few years' time, enabling us to make even better use of that market's great potential. We are working/uni00A0with volvo in a joint venture to bring hydrogen technology to production maturity even faster. And we have realigned our strategy for autonomous driving.\n\nthe development of automotive markets also had an impact on the business of Daimler Mobility AG . Contract volume decreased, but we continue to finance or lease half of the vehicles we sell.\n\nAcross all our divisions, we made significant progress with efficiency in 2020. We will continue along this path with the same discipline. the pandemic has once again made it clear that efficiency is a prerequisite for the ability to act effectively.\n\nlooking ahead, we are pursuing two main strategic priorities: digitization and electrification. We are cooperating with strong partners in both fields. in this way, we are not only accelerating technological developments, we are also sharing the costs.\n\nin terms of digitization , the latest generation of our mBuX infotainment system was launched in 2020. it will be followed this year by the next milestone, the mBuX hyperscreen, a display that extends across almost the entire width of the cockpit. this allows us to combine design, technology and interaction in the vehicle in a way that is currently unique. thanks to artificial intelligence, the system gets to know the customer better and better and delivers a personalized infotainment offering adapted to each situation.\n\nAt the same time, we are developing one of the most intelligent computer architectures for automated driving functions ever seen in a vehicle. We will roll it out across our car fleet from 2024 onwards. Customers will then always be able to access the latest so/ftware, the latest driver assistance systems or the latest generation of digital services long a/fter they have bought their car. the idea is that the purchase of a car is no longer the high point between the customer and us, but rather a starting point.",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\nWe took the next step in electrification at the beginning of the year with the new eQA, the first all-electric mercedes-eQ model in the compact segment. We will continue in the spring with the eQs: our electric flagship in the s-Class segment has a range of around 700 kilometers (Wltp) on a single battery charge. the eQs will also change the way we think about cars. it is the first all-electric mercedes-Benz that we have developed as an electric car right from the start. this opens up new possibilities, in vehicle design, for example. Next year, our portfolio will include eight all-electric mercedes-eQ models. production at our own car plants will then be completely Co 2 -neutral.\n\nWith the vans, we have developed a new platform for the next generation of the esprinter. this gives us maximum flexibility, to implement numerous body variants, for example. Because whether combustion engine or electric drive, the individual needs of our customers are at the heart of everything we do.\n\nWe are also systematically expanding our range of Co 2 -neutral options for trucks. We are pursuing a twin-track strategy here. series production of the battery-electric eActros starts this year. in parallel, we are developing fuel-cell trucks for long distances and heavier loads. We have provided a glimpse of the future with our gen h2 concept truck. this is a heavy-duty truck with a range of up to 1,000 kilometers, equivalent to that of a diesel truck. We are leveraging synergies and systematically implementing our electrification strategy also at the Freightliner and Fuso brands.\n\nAll of these examples show that market environment and customer requirements as well as approaches to technologies and partnerships differ between cars and trucks. the ongoing transformation is increasingly intensifying these differences. to shape change successfully, we need speed, agility and full focus on innovation more than ever. this is why we intend to propose to you, at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in the fall, that a significant majority interest in Daimler truck be transferred to the Daimler shareholders by way of a spin-off. in this case, it is planned that the transaction and the stockexchange listing of Daimler truck will be completed by the end of 2021.\n\nin this way, we want to give our trucks and buses division full entrepreneurial freedom/uni00A0- and thus the opportunity to leverage economies of scale even more effectively, to further increase profitability, and to make even faster progress on the road to zero-emission goods transport. At the same time, we want to further sharpen the profile of mercedes-Benz: as one of the leading suppliers of luxury cars and premium vans, with a strong brand, and with a clear strategic course towards technology leadership, especially for electric mobility and vehicle so/ftware. With independence comes maximum customer focus and even greater entrepreneurial responsibility. these are the best possible ingredients for creating added value for you, the shareholders, and for unleashing the full potential of the companies.\n\nFor the two companies, the future of mobility will be decarbonization and digitization. We set the strategic course for this long ago. the results can be experienced on the road today and will become even more visible this year. At the same time, we are confident that, given stable conditions, we will be able to continue the positive trend from last year in our business development. Because we are convinced that our future will be sustainably fascinating, sustainably climate-neutral, and, last but not least, sustainably profitable. We are shaping this change with courage, passion and responsibility. i look forward to you continuing to accompany us on this path.\n\nsincerely yours,\n\nola K\u00e4llenius\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, it was necessary to keep an eye on risks from political conflicts concerning the free movement of goods. Daimler had to revise and, in some cases, redefine the main points of its strategy. in close consultation with the supervisory Board, the Board of management took timely measures to safeguard liquidity, reduce costs and restructure the group, without losing its focus on the technological fields of the future. We therefore have many good reasons to be confident that our Company will emerge strengthened for the future years as a result of the measures initiated.\n\n## Supervisory and advisory activities of the Supervisory Board\n\nthe supervisory Board of Daimler Ag fully performed its tasks as defined by the law, the Company's Articles of incorporation and its own rules of procedure once again in the year 2020.\n\nthe supervisory Board continually advised and supervised the Board of management in the management of the Company and provided support with strategically important issues relating to the group's further development.\n\nthe supervisory Board examined whether the annual company and consolidated financial statements, the combined management report including the non-financial declaration (2020), and the other financial reporting, as well as the non-financial report (2019) for Daimler Ag and the Daimler group, were in conformance with the applicable requirements.\n\nin addition, it approved numerous business matters for which its consent was required following careful reviews and consultations. As well as the finance and investment planning, this also included cooperation plans, major equity measures at companies of the group, and the conclusion of contracts with particular importance for the group. the Board of management informed the supervisory Board about a large number of further measures and business matters, and discussed them with it intensively and in detail, such as the impact on the group of the covid-19 pandemic and the countermeasures taken.\n\nthe Board of management regularly informed the supervisory Board about all significant economic developments of the group and the divisions. it continually provided information to it on all fundamental questions of corporate planning, including finance, investment, sales and personnel planning, current developments at the companies of the group, the development of revenue, the situation of the Company and the divisions, and the economic and political environment, as well as on the current status and assessment of significant legal proceedings. Furthermore, the Board of management reported to the supervisory Board continually on profitability and the group's\n\nliquidity situation, the development of sales and procurement markets, the overall economic situation, and developments in the capital markets and the area of financial services. Additional topics included the further development of the product portfolio, securing the group's long-term competitiveness, and the ongoing implementation of measures for safeguarding sustainable and future-oriented mobility. the supervisory Board also dealt in detail with political developments and conflicts in the main sales markets, the shareholder structure, the development of the share price and the related background, and the expected impact of strategic projects on the share price.\n\n## Working culture and areas of Supervisory Board activity\n\nin the year 2020, the supervisory Board convened for nine meetings, some of which took place by telephone or as video conferences due to the pandemic. participation in the meetings by the members of the supervisory Board was at a very high level once again, as shown in the detailed overview at the end of this report. the work of the supervisory Board featured open and intensive exchanges of information and opinions. the members of the supervisory Board regularly prepared for upcoming resolutions with the aid of documentation provided in advance by the Board of management. Furthermore, the members representing the employees and the members representing the shareholders regularly prepared the supervisory Board meetings in separate discussions, which were also attended by members of the Board of management. the supervisory Board was also intensively supported by its committees. in the meetings of the supervisory Board, its members discussed in detail with the Board of management the measures and business matters to be decided upon. executive sessions were regularly arranged for the meetings so that topics could be discussed also in the absence of the Board of management.\n\noutside the regular meetings, the supervisory Board was informed about special matters. in addition, the members of the supervisory Board and of the Board of management came together for bilateral exchanges of opinions. the Board of management informed the supervisory Board also with written reports about the most important indicators of business",

During the reporting period, the Company held information events on the expansion of the technical compliance management system and, together with the external auditors, on risk-oriented auditing. Furthermore, in a special onboarding program, new members of the supervisory Board have the opportunity to meet the members of the Board of management and senior executives with specialist responsibility for a bilateral exchange of opinions and information on fundamental and current topics of the various Board of management areas, allowing them to gain an overview of the topics relevant to the Daimler group and of its governance structure.\n\nin its meeting on February 10, 2020, which was attended by the external auditors, the supervisory Board discussed, took note of and approved the preliminary key figures of the annual company and consolidated financial statements for 2019 and the dividend proposal to be made at the 2020 Annual shareholders' meeting. the supervisory Board determined that no objections were to be raised to their publication. the preliminary key figures for the year 2019 and the proposal on the appropriation of profit were announced at the Annual press Conference on February 11, 2020.\n\nin the supervisory Board meeting held on February 19, 2020, the supervisory Board decided to appoint hubertus troska as a member of the Board of management of Daimler Ag for a period of a further five years as of January 1, 2021, with responsibility for greater China.\n\nsubsequently, it dealt with the annual company financial statements, the annual consolidated financial statements and the combined management report for Daimler Ag and the Daimler group for the year 2019, each of which had been issued with an unqualified audit opinion by the external auditors, as well as with the reports of the Audit Committee and the supervisory Board, the declaration on corporate governance combined with the corporate governance report, the remuneration report, the nonfinancial report, which was issued with the independent auditor's limited assurance in accordance with isAe 3000, and the proposal on the appropriation of profit. in preparation, the members of the supervisory Board had been provided with comprehensive documentation.\n\nthe Audit Committee and the supervisory Board dealt with those documents in detail and discussed them intensively in the presence of the independent auditors. the independent auditors reported on the results of their audit and on the key audit matters and the respective audit procedure, including the conclusions drawn, as well as on the voluntary review of the non-financial report within the framework of a limited assurance engagement, and were available to answer questions and to provide further information. Following the final results of the review by the Audit Committee and its own review, the supervisory Board declared its agreement with the results of the audit carried out by the external auditors. it determined that\n\nno objections were to be raised, approved the financial statements and the combined management report as presented by the Board of management, and thus adopted the financial statements of Daimler Ag for the year 2019. on this basis, the supervisory Board consented to the proposal made by the Board of management on the appropriation of distributable profit. in addition, the supervisory Board approved the nonfinancial report, the report of the supervisory Board, the corporate government statement combined with the corporate governance report, and the remuneration report.\n\nin its meeting on February 19, 2020, the supervisory Board also decided on its proposed resolutions for the agenda of the 2020 Annual shareholders' meeting, which at that time was still planned to be held on April 1, 2020, including the proposals for election as described in this report. the supervisory Board also dealt with matters pertaining to the remuneration of the members of the Board of management and, in connection with the item of the agenda on corporate governance, approved the memberships of other boards and further external secondary activities of the members of the Board of management that were presented in the meeting. in addition, the supervisory Board decided to have a voluntary review of the contents of the 2020 non-financial report conducted by Kpmg Ag Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft, Berlin, in the form of a limited assurance. Another matter dealt with in the meeting was the court proceedings in connection with diesel exhaust emissions. Following careful and intensive discussion of the relevant aspects and consideration of the relevant reasons, while taking into account the best interests of the Company and a corresponding positive recommendation on a resolution by the supervisory Board's Committee for legal Affairs, the supervisory Board approved the Board of management's decision on the settlement of a securities class action relating to diesel exhaust emissions in the united states. in preparation for its decision, the supervisory Board had obtained an expert opinion from an independent law firm. Both the supervisory Board and the executive Board are of the opinion that the settlement was in the interests of the Company. once again, the question of possible claims for compensation against former or present members of the Board of management in connection with antitrust issues, in particular with regard to the european Commission's concluded antitrust proceedings against truck manufacturers, and the ongoing investigations relating to the antitrust proceedings of the european Commission concerning possible restrictions of competition with exhaust-gas cleaning technologies was dealt with. on the basis of the reviews carried out so far and repeatedly updated by an independent law firm, a further review by an independent legal academic, as well as detailed discussions in the supervisory Board taking into account the welfare of the Company, as well as in the context of further deliberations on these issues in the meetings on July 23 and December 3, 2020 (in accordance with corresponding recommendations of the supervisory Board Committee for legal Affairs), the supervisory Board maintained its previous resolution, based on the information available, that no such claims were to be made at the present time. in this context, it dealt with possible risks arising from the statute of limitations and arranged for appropriate precautions to be taken.

Finally, based on preparations by the presidential Committee, it dealt with the further development of the system of Board of management remuneration. Details of the system of Board of management remuneration and the adjustments to the annual bonus are explained in the E Remuneration Report.\n\n## Fundamental change in the corporate structure\n\nAt an extraordinary meeting on February 3, 2021, the supervisory Board granted its approval, a/fter detailed prior discussion, to evaluate a spin-off of the truck & Bus business and to begin preparations for a separate stock-exchange listing of Daimler truck. As a result of the spin-off, which requires the approval of the Annual shareholders' meeting, a substantial majority shareholding in Daimler truck is to be transferred to Daimler shareholders.\n\n## Corporate governance and declaration of compliance\n\nDuring the year 2020, the supervisory Board was continually occupied with standards of good corporate governance.\n\nin its meeting in December 2020, the supervisory Board approved the 2020 declaration of compliance with the german Corporate governance Code pursuant to section 161 of the german stock Corporation Act (Aktg). With the exceptions explained there, all recommendations of the Code have been and continue to be complied with.\n\nin accordance with good corporate governance, the members of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag are obliged to disclose conflicts of interest - especially those that might arise due to an advisory or board function for a customer, supplier or creditor of Daimler, or for other third parties - to the entire supervisory Board.\n\nin order to avoid the appearance of potential conflicts of interest arising from specific situations, some members of the supervisory Board did not participate in discussions of certain items of the agendas in the year 2020. this was the case with sari Baldauf in connection with the patent disputes between Daimler and Nokia. Furthermore, as a highly precautionary measure to avoid potential conflicts of interest, Dr. Bernd pischetsrieder and Dr. J\u00fcrgen hambrecht refrained from participating in several meetings when legal proceedings in connection with diesel exhaust emissions were being dealt with. the supervisory Board conducted an externally moderated self-assessment in 2020. it covered all key aspects of the work of the supervisory Board including its committees by means of an online questionnaire and supplementary interviews. the results of the review, which the supervisory Board dealt with in depth at its meeting on February 17, 2021, confirm the professional, very good cooperation within the supervisory Board and with the Board of management characterized by a high degree of trust. No fundamental need for change was shown.\n\nindependently of the supervisory Board's self-assessment, the Audit Committee again carried out a self-assessment of its activities in 2020 on the basis of a comprehensive groupspecific questionnaire. the results of this self-assessment, which were again very positive, were presented and discussed in the meeting of the Audit Committee on February 17, 2021. No need for change was identified.\n\n## Law for the equal participation of women and men in management  positions\n\nFor supervisory boards of listed companies subject to parity codetermination, like that of Daimler Ag, the german stock Corporation Act prescribes a binding gender ratio of at least 30% women. the ratio is to apply to the entire supervisory board. if the side of the supervisory board representing the shareholders or the side representing the employees objects to the chairman of the supervisory board before the election about the application of the ratio to the entire supervisory board, the minimum ratio is to apply separately to the shareholders' side and to the employees' side for that election.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the shareholders' side of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag is composed of 30% women (the members sari Baldauf, petraea heynike and marie Wieck) and 70% men. on the employees' side, the proportions as of that date are 30% women (the members elke t\u00f6njes-Werner, sibylle Wankel and Dr. sabine Zimmer) and 70% men. the supervisory Board as a whole therefore also fulfills the statutory quota.\n\nin its meeting on December 3, 2020, the supervisory Board discussed the specific proposals for the candidates to be elected at the 2021 Annual shareholders' meeting and decided, upon the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, to propose at the 2021 Annual shareholders' meeting that elizabeth Centoni, Ben van Beurden and Dr. martin Bruderm\u00fcller be elected to the supervisory Board for the first time. if the proposed candidates are elected, the statutory quota for women will remain fulfilled both on the shareholder side and for the supervisory Board as a whole, provided there are no other changes.",

Among other things, and taking into consideration all circumstances of each individual case, the proposal is oriented towards the Daimler group's interests and aims to fulfill the overall qualification profile for the entire supervisory Board, including expertise profile and diversity concept. in addition, the Committee dealt with the succession, due in 2021, to the position of Chairman of the supervisory Board.\n\nthere was no occasion to convene the Mediation Committee during the reporting period.\n\n## Changes in the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management\n\nin the supervisory Board meeting on February 19, 2020, hubertus troska was appointed to the Board of management of Daimler Ag, responsible for greater China, for a further period of five years with effect as of January 1, 2021.\n\nFollowing the proposal of the supervisory Board, the Annual shareholders' meeting on July 8, 2020 elected timotheus h\u00f6ttges as a member of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders for the period until the end of the Annual shareholders' meeting that decides on ratification of board members' actions for financial year 2024.\n\nin the supervisory Board meeting on December 3, 2020, on the basis of a recommendation by the Nomination Committee, the members representing the shareholders resolved to propose to the 2021 Annual shareholders' meeting that elizabeth Centoni, Ben van Beurden and Dr. martin Bruderm\u00fcller be elected to the supervisory Board.

During the year under review, we continued to inform institutional investors, sustainability-focused investors, analysts, rating agencies and private investors by means of a wide range of investor relations activities and comprehensive reporting on the group's business development and prospects. the Board of management and the supervisory Board will propose to the Annual shareholders' meeting that a dividend of \u20ac1.35 (2019: \u20ac0.90) per share be paid for 2020.\n\n## A.02\n\n| Development of Daimler's share price and of major indices   | Development of Daimler's share price and of major indices   | Development of Daimler's share price and of major indices   | Development of Daimler's share price and of major indices   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | End of 2020                                                 | end of 2019                                                 | 20/19                                                       |\n|                                                             |                                                             |                                                             | % change                                                    |\n| Daimler share price (in euros)                              | 57.79                                                       | 49.37                                                       | +17                                                         |\n| highest 1                                                   | 58.77                                                       | 59.31                                                       |                                                             |\n| lowest 1                                                    | 21.84                                                       | 40.53                                                       | -46                                                         |\n| DAX 30                                                      | 13,719                                                      | 13,249                                                      |                                                             |\n| euro stoXX 50                                               | 3,553                                                       | 3,745                                                       |                                                             |\n| stoXX europe Auto index                                     | 528                                                         | 509                                                         |                                                             |\n\n- 1  Closing prices\n\n## A.03\n\n## Share price index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Daimler share price rises 17% over the year\n\nin view of the ongoing transformation of the automotive industry, investors maintained a reserved position with regard to automotive stocks up until mid-February. A/fter that, developments were impacted by growing concerns relating to the coronavirus, with the mood on stock markets deteriorating dramatically as a result. Just a few days a/fter we announced that due to the expanding scope of the covid-19 pandemic we would be suspending most of our production operations and the activities in selected administrative departments in europe for an initial period of two weeks, the Daimler share price dropped to its lowest point of the year in a very weak stockmarket environment, falling to \u20ac21.84 on march 19.\n\nstock prices then began rising significantly, mainly as a response to the implementation of various monetary and fiscal policy measures. the Daimler share price also recorded a significant increase during this period. this positive development was also due to the Daimler management team's rapid response to the crisis in the form of immediate measures taken to safeguard liquidity, optimize costs, adjust production operations and ensure a stronger focus on cash flow. investors were also encouraged by positive developments on the Chinese automotive market. this momentum was reinforced by various other strategic initiatives in addition to the announcement that Daimler truck Ag and the volvo group would be establishing a joint venture for series production of fuel cells, in part to support the european green Deal.\n\nFollowing a brief consolidation phase around the middle of the year, automotive stocks, which had come under strong pressure throughout the previous course of the year, were able to rally and post significant gains once again. the Daimler share benefited here initially from the release of our financial figures for the second quarter of 2020, which turned out to be more favorable than most analysts had expected. the announcement of measures for optimizing fixed costs also played a role in the positive development of the share price. in addition, agreements in principle regarding the settlement of government and civil legal actions in the united states in connection with diesel emissions, as well as the positive sales figures recorded by mercedes-Benz Cars and the presentation of the new s-Class, led to increased investment in our company.",

Core elements of these plans include accelerating the development of electric drive systems and vehicle so/ftware for the electrification of the entire product portfolio and our intention to make all of our business operations completely Co 2 -neutral, as set out in the Ambition 2039 strategy. We also have further plans for reducing costs and pursuing more ambitious financial targets, which are intended to accompany a lowering of our break-even point. solid business development at the group in the third quarter, including free cash flow that was significantly higher than market expectations, had a positive effect on the development of our share price. hopes regarding the rapid availability of a covid-19 vaccine, as well as the continued recovery of the Chinese economy and rising automotive sales in that country, generated renewed momentum for automotive stocks toward the end of the year. on December 16, the Daimler share price reached \u20ac58.77, which was the highest price for the year.\n\nthe Daimler share then closed at \u20ac57.79 on December 30.

        "page_content": "## objectives and strategy\n\nFor more than 130 years we have been moving people and goods/uni00A0all over the world/uni00A0- safely, efficiently and with innovative technologies. our industry is currently in the midst of its biggest transformation in history. sustainability (especially climate protection) as well as digitalization, shi/fts in global trade, and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic are changing our business and our company. As the inventor of the automobile, it is in our DNA to repeatedly take the lead in automotive engineering with new technologies. in addition, we will strive to set standards for sustainable mobility and transport in the future.\n\n## the role of Daimler Ag\n\nthe transformation of our industry is requiring us to take quick, agile and customer-focused action. our implementation of 'project Future' turned our previous divisions into three legally separate units (mercedes-Benz Ag, Daimler truck Ag and Daimler mobility Ag) under the roof of Daimler Ag, which is listed on the stock exchange. in this way, we have strengthened our entrepreneurial freedom, intensified our market and customer orientation, and made it easier for the new divisions to enter into partnerships. in this new role, Daimler Ag serves as an operational and strategic management holding that performs the governance and steering functions and thus creates the framework for the new divisions. some organizations will be retained at this central level, especially the higher-level units in the functions Finance and Controlling, human Resources, and integrity and legal. in this way, Daimler Ag ensures a uniform and centrally managed corporate finance system, sets the scope for the long-term return and growth targets, and determines how funds will be allocated. the aim is to boost the company's value on a sustained basis.\n\n## sustainability as an integral part of our corporate strategy\n\nsustainability means harmonizing economic, ecological and social objectives. Daimler is committed to the united Nations' sustainable Development goals and to the paris Agreement on climate change. For our company, sustainability means permanently creating value for all stakeholders: customers, employees, investors, business partners and society as a whole. For us, sustainability is not an isolated area where we take action, but an integral part of our corporate strategy. in line with this approach, we work to achieve Co 2 -neutral mobility by 2039, reduce our resource consumption despite growth, implement measures that increase safety on the road, continue to utilize data responsibly, and assume responsibility for upholding human rights along the entire value chain.\n\nAchieving success in our areas of action requires a clear commitment to a culture of integrity, as well as future-oriented cooperation with our workforce and our partners in industry, government and society at large. A central sustainability management system enables the effective planning of ambitious goals and their implementation.\n\nour 'Ambition 2039' strategy for Mercedes-Benz Cars clearly demonstrates our commitment to climate protection. our goal here is to become Co 2 -neutral by 2039. more specifically, this means we plan to achieve Co 2 -neutral production at our own car plants from 2022, have plug-in hybrids and all-electric drive systems account for more than 50% of our portfolio by 2030, and offer a Co 2 -neutral new car fleet to our customers within less than three product life cycles. An example of this is the new Factory 56 at the sindelfingen plant. this facility, whose first series-production model is the new s-Class, consumes less energy than previous vehicle assembly operations for comparable model series and has a Co 2 -neutral footprint. Among other things, this is made possible by the facility's energy concept, which includes a photovoltaic system, a direct-current network, and energy storage devices made of reused vehicle batteries. A holistic view of the Co 2 -reduction issue also needs to take the recycling of raw materials into account. A/fter all, we also want to drive forward the implementation of our climate neutrality objective at our suppliers and partners.",

For commercially used vans, the goal is to offer only new vehicles that are Co 2 -neutral in driving operation ('tank-to-wheel') in the triad markets of europe, Japan and North America by 2039. production operations at the mercedes-Benz vans plants are scheduled to become Co 2 -neutral by 2022.\n\non its path to achieving Co 2 -neutral transportation, Daimler Trucks & Buses aims to offer only new vehicles that are Co 2 -neutral in driving operation ('tank-to-wheel') in the triad markets of europe, Japan and North America by 2039. We intend to offer series-produced trucks and buses with battery-electric drive systems in the main sales regions europe, the united states and Japan by 2022. in the second half of the 2020s, Daimler trucks & Buses intends to supplement its portfolio of series-produced vehicles by adding fuel cell-powered electric trucks. in cooperation with the volvo group we will drive forward the series-ready development, production and marketing of fuel-cell systems for use in heavy-duty commercial vehicles and other fields of application. plans also call for all Daimler trucks & Buses plants in europe to be Co\u2082-neutral by 2022.\n\nDaimler Mobility's sustainability efforts are focusing on avoiding and reducing Co 2 emissions as well as on collecting knowledge and promoting employee involvement. the aim is to become climate-neutral by the end of 2022 - not only in administrative departments but at all locations. New leasing and financing offers will explicitly serve to promote the sale of electric vehicles at the divisions.\n\nthe issue of the first green bond has further accelerated our development of Co 2 -neutral technologies and services. the proceeds from this bond are used exclusively to fund green projects. in this way, our financing activities are also helping to transform us into a carbon-free company and make our industry Co 2 -neutral.\n\n## integrity as a guiding principle\n\nWe are firmly convinced that we can only be successful over the long term if we fulfill not only our economic and environmental responsibilities but also our responsibility to society. in times of change and upheaval especially, we need to have values that provide us with orientation. For us, this involves more than just obeying laws, as we also seek to align our activities with shared principles and values. For Daimler, integrity means doing the right thing by acting on our values. New technologies and business models offer tremendous opportunities, but at the same time they pose questions - for example, with regard to ethical and legal topics. our inner values and attitudes are put to the test when such issues arise. By means of our technical Compliance management system, or tCms for short, we want to ensure that our products conform with regulations and legal requirements. our Data Compliance management system enables us to support new topics from the beginning, provide the maximum possible clarity and avoid mistakes. the responsible use of data has top priority in these efforts.\n\nAll of the divisions have formulated strategies or intensified existing ones on the basis of their earnings and growth targets, our commitment to sustainability, and Co 2 -neutral mobility and integrity as guiding principles.",

We will continue to concentrate on this segment in the future and we think that it provides us with the greatest growth opportunities. our goal is to build the world's most desirable cars.\n\nthe mercedes-Benz strategy encompasses six pillars. the core aim is to increase structural profitability and enable us to outpace our competitors in the transformation to electric mobility and comprehensive digitalization. sustainability is a key guiding principle of the mercedes-Benz strategy and an integral part of it. our highly qualified and motivated team forms the basis for our new strategy's success.\n\n## Think and act like a luxury brand\n\nluxury has always been part of mercedes-Benz' DNA. however, the brand will focus even more strongly on luxury in the future. it will be an integral part of all products, customer interactions and digital technologies. mercedes-Benz will concentrate its product portfolio, brand communication and sales network even more strongly on luxury so as to create a thoroughly luxurious experience - luxury that is to be holistic, intuitive and sustainable.\n\nthe new s-Class exemplifies our already outstanding range of products in the luxury segment. to name just a few examples,\n\nit is made more intuitive and smarter by mBuX and a new augmented reality head-up display, safer thanks to 16 airbags and optional e-ACtive BoDy CoNtRol, and more comfortable and agile in its suspension and steering system. the new s-Class will also set a new milestone on our road to automated driving. Beginning in the second half of 2021, we expect s-Class cars that are equipped with the new DRive pilot to drive with conditional automation (sAe level 3) in germany under certain preconditions and at speeds of up to the permitted 60 km/h. this will give drivers more time, comfort and safety.\n\n## Focus on profitable growth\n\nWe want to grow wherever we can achieve the best results. to do so, we will initiate measures that will realign our market strategy. the focus on an optimal balance between sales volume, price and sales channel mix will help to ensure higher contribution margins for our current and future product portfolios. At the same time, development resources and funding will flow into the most profitable market segments in order to achieve higher structural profitability.\n\n## Expand customer base by growing sub-brands\n\nAccording to interbrand, mercedes-Benz is the world's most valuable luxury automobile brand. this brand will always take center stage in our array of car brands. in addition, mercedesBenz includes several extraordinary sub-brands: mercedesAmg, mercedes-maybach and mercedes-eQ as well as the g-Class. We will further strengthen these brands so that we can address customer groups in an even more targeted manner and thereby contribute substantially to our growth and earnings. mercedes-Amg is ready for the next stage, when it will begin to electrify its portfolio in 2021.\n\nthe sub-brand mercedes-Amg's link with Formula 1 will be intensified further next year in order to reinforce its identity as a high-performance brand. mercedes-maybach is focusing on global growth opportunities, intending to double its sales volume and also to offer electric models.\n\n## Mercedes-Benz  Cars  strategy\n\n## We want to build the world's most desirable cars\n\n| Think                  | Focus  on          | Expand  by growing    sub-brands   | Embrace  customers   and grow   recurrent   revenues   | Lead  in electric   drive and  car so/ftware   | Lower  cost base  and improve    industrial   footprint   |\n|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| and act like  a luxury | profitable  growth | customer base                      |                                                        |                                                |                                                           |\n| brand                  |                    |                                    |                                                        |                                                |                                                           |\n\nsustainability as a guiding principle\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Demand for the legendary g-Class currently exceeds the available production capacity. We also want this model series to grow and be electrified. the mercedes-eQ sub-brand is using new high-tech products to address new customer groups.\n\n## Embrace customers and grow recurrent  revenues\n\nmercedes-Benz wants to intensify and reinforce its long-term customer relationships. stronger customer loyalty enables us to generate recurring revenue by means of services and spare parts, for example, as well as with increasing numbers of over-the-air updates (otAs) and digital service subscriptions. We expect this to open up considerable revenue potential because the mercedes-Benz car fleet shall encompass a total of 20 million interconnected vehicles by 2025.\n\n## Lead in electric drive and car software\n\nmercedes-Benz wants to become the leader for electric mobility and vehicle so/ftware. to this end, we have defined ambitious product development targets and decided to accelerate the market launch of new technologies. this means that whenever we develop a new vehicle architecture, we will first design the automobile as an all-electric vehicle. We will then plan modifications such as plug-in hybrid drive systems. Within the framework of this electric First strategy, we will begin in 2021 to introduce four new electric models. these will be based on the electric vehicle Architecture (evA), which is designed exclusively for battery-electric drive systems. the eQs luxury sedan will be the first model on this independent new platform and be launched on the market in 2021. it will be followed by the eQe, the eQs suv and the eQe suv. in addition, mercedesAmg, mercedes-maybach and the g-Class will also be electrified. other models will round out the electric vehicle portfolio beginning in 2025. Both the new s-Class and the C-Class will get a plug-in hybrid drive that is expected to have purely electric ranges of around 100 kilometers (Wltp) as early as 2021. Compact-class customers can look forward to two all-electric compact suvs in 2021 - the eQA (combined electricity consumption: 15.7 kWh/100 km; combined Co 2 emissions: 0 g/km) 1 and the eQB. As a result, we will already offer our customers more than 25 plug-in hybrids and purely battery-electric models in 2021. this portfolio will be successively expanded over various segments by the addition of further attractive electrified models. in this way we plan to offer more than 40 plug-in hybrid and purely battery-electric models by 2030.\n\nmercedes-Benz will shi/ft even more resources into product development and the accumulation of electric drive system expertise as well as investing in new technologies and concepts for improving range and efficiency. the next generation of electric motors is being developed independently by the brand and will include advanced inverter and high-voltage technologies. the company is making big leaps in battery technology by means of its own research and development work as well as in strategic partnerships with partners such as CAtl, Farasis and sila Nano. our goal is to own the entire battery technology chain and rely on partnerships where we think it is beneficial.\n\nWhile plug-in hybrids and purely battery-electric vehicles are expected to account for more than 50% of global sales in 2030, we plan to reduce our investments in combustion engines, cut the number of variants by 70% between now and 2030 and cease offering manual transmissions in our car portfolio in the medium term. the elimination of manual transmissions is to take place in the context of a successive adaptation as we move to new vehicle generations in the course of specific models.\n\nin the vehicle so/ftware segment, mercedes-Benz is relying on a proprietary operating system. it is being developed by us and is scheduled for market launch in 2024. it will enable us to respond flexibly and quickly to new customer requirements. We see this as an important precondition for increasing customer utility across a vehicle's entire life cycle and for developing new digital business models. this so/ftware is being developed for all scalable platforms in order to make development more cost-efficient.\n\n## Lower cost base and improve industrial  footprint\n\nmercedes-Benz intends to further improve its profitability and cash flow and at the same time safeguard its investments in the future as well as the accelerated transition to electric drive systems. to do that, we want to lower the break-even point, further reduce the cost base, and continue to improve the industrial footprint between now and 2025.\n\nBy 2025, capacity adjustments and lower personnel expenses are expected to reduce fixed costs by a total of more than 20% overall compared to the values for 2019. By 2025, we also plan to reduce capital expenditures and investments in research and development by more than 20% compared to 2019. plans call for the variable costs relative to 2019 to be reduced by 1% per year until 2025.\n\nAs a result of its realignment, the mercedes-Benz strategy aims to improve profitability by creating a more advantageous product mix, improving pricing, enhancing the product portfolio and boosting the amount of recurring revenue. By 2025, mercedes-Benz Ag intends to achieve a return on sales of at least between a mid-level and a high single-digit percentage. however, the company's long-term goal is to achieve a doubledigit return on sales in a competitive market environment.\n\nour actions are based on our values and principles as well as on our view of how and with what attitude we want to operate as a company. We provide orientation even in times of change with our leadership 20X program, which defines our leadership and partnership principles, and with integrity as our main corporate value.\n\n- 1  electricity consumption and range have been calculated on the basis of Commission Regulation (eC) No. 692/2008. electricity consumption and range depend on the vehicle configuration. the actual range also depends on the individual driving style, road and traffic conditions, outside temperature, use of air conditioning/heating etc., and may vary.",

        "page_content": "## Daimler trucks & Buses strategy 2030\n\nour goals and strategy are determined by the company's purpose, which defines our obligation to our customers and to society at large. We're working for 'everyone that's moving the world.' together with our customers, we contribute to prosperity and growth.\n\nin view of the fact that our environment is currently undergoing a profound change, we have decided to further enhance the strategy of Daimler trucks & Buses.\n\n## Add value for customers\n\nCustomers have top priority. people will only choose our products and services if we create added value for our customers and if our products and new technologies enable them to make money, improve their processes or boost their productivity. in this respect, it's crucial that we know exactly what our customers' needs are and that we develop products that are tailored to these requirements. the new model series of Western star offers a current example of how this works in practice. the new truck for the vocational segment - i.e. commercial vehicles for construction and special applications - enables us to not only boost our customers' productivity but also to lower their operating costs.\n\n## Lead globally\n\nFor us, global leadership is not an end in itself. We need to have a global presence in order to exploit economies of scale and to enable more cost-efficient development. our high development expenditures on new technologies in areas such as electric drive systems, autonomous driving and digitalization can only be kept as low as possible per vehicle if we develop our innovations on the basis of universal platforms and utilize them in as many markets and vehicles as possible. By maintaining a global presence we make these new technologies available to customers faster and in a more tried and tested manner. Finally, our global setup enables us to more easily offset regional market cycles.\n\n## Grow services\n\nin order to increase our profitability on a lasting basis, we intend to exploit the potential of our service business in a more targeted manner. to this end, we are expanding our existing range of a/ftersales products and creating new services. one example of this is the introduction of 3D printing for spare parts at Daimler Buses.\n\nto supplement this traditional portfolio of services, we will establish other services based on so/ftware and digitalization. the aim here is to generate real added value for our customers, to enable them to operate our trucks and buses more efficiently, and to cut their total transport costs. We are already achieving this today with digital services such as Fleetboard, mercedes-Benz uptime, Detroit Connect and truckConnect at Daimler trucks, as well as with digital services on the omniplus oN platform at Daimler Buses. our new Connectivity services group is now working on developing promising services for trucks and buses along our customers' value chains.\n\n## Differentiate by technologies\n\nWe want to set ourselves apart with technologies that generate real added value for our customers and society at large. As a result, we began early on to focus on ways to reduce the diesel consumption of our commercial vehicles. We have repeatedly developed innovations for this purpose in order to differentiate us from the competition.\n\nlooking ahead, we can state that we are committed to the paris Agreement on climate change and wish to play a major role in shaping the development of Co\u2082-neutral transportation. to make this possible, we are focusing on two technologies: batteries and hydrogen-powered fuel cells. our group has more than 25 years of experience with fuel cells. thanks to this experience, we want to offer our customers a truck for flexible and demanding applications that can compare with dieselpowered ones as regards traction, range and performance. exactly which solution a customer will use will depend on the case in question. to this end, we are planning to achieve the following product milestones: By 2022, we want our vehicle\n\n<!-- image -->",

Due to its greater range, this bus can easily serve most of the usual urban routes. in addition, the solid-state batteries have a long service life and do not contain cobalt or manganese.\n\nWe also have a clear vision with regard to traffic safety: accident-free driving. We will achieve this by means of our safety assistance systems, which help drivers perform their tasks and can thereby protect all road users. We want to see important systems such as the fully integrated mercedes-Benz sideguard Assist s1R for retrofitting heavy-duty trucks in as many vehicles on the road as possible. in 2020, we therefore began to offer this system as a retrofit solution for many of the common models of the Actros, Arocs and econic of model year 2017 and later. moreover, we are continuously enhancing existing systems. Active sideguard Assist no longer just warns the driver of cyclists and pedestrians standing or moving alongside the front-passenger side of the vehicle, but also initiates automatic braking at turning speeds of up to 20 km/h in order to bring the vehicle to a standstill if the driver fails to respond to the acoustic alert. mercedes-Benz trucks is the world's first truck manufacturer to offer such a system. We are also a pioneer at our bus brands mercedes-Benz and setra, making us the first manufacturer to offer such systems as the turning assistant sideguard Assist (including pedestrian detection) and preventive Brake Assist.\n\nWe are also developing completely new business models for Daimler trucks when it comes to autonomous driving. in doing so, we are pursuing our dual strategy by working together with two strong partners in order to offer customers the best possible integrated fully automated sAe level 4 solutions. to this end, torc Robotics became part of the Autonomous technology group at Daimler trucks in september 2019. With torc, we are focusing on the development of our own sAe level 4 solution for operations between two logistics centers (hub-to-hub operations). As part of the partnership with Waymo we are developing a variant of the Freightliner Cascadia truck model that is especially designed for the level 4 operation of Waymo technology. this variant will first hit the road in the united states. North America provides ideal conditions for the testing and subsequent use of highly automated trucks (sAe level 4).\n\n## Focus on core business\n\nWe know what provides our customers with added value. We are correspondingly prioritizing the topics into which our engineering abilities and financial resources are flowing. Besides customer utility, whether an existing or new product or service makes a positive long-term contribution to our earnings is another decision criterion.\n\n## Lean organization\n\nWe need a powerful organization that enables us to implement our strategy as effectively as possible. For this reason, we promote personal responsibility, initiative, agile thinking and efficient action. moreover, we are continuously optimizing our processes and structures, for example by increasingly exploiting the possibilities of digitalization. the improvement of our cost structures is another one of our continuous tasks.\n\n## People and culture\n\nWe can only achieve our goals if we work together successfully. the basis for this is formed by our shared values, such as trust and integrity, as well as shared principles such as the way we operate. We listen carefully to our customers and want to understand them, because this is the only way we can develop technologies that really solve problems. We also know that we will reach our goal faster if we pull together. We don't just pay lip service to the concept of team work, as it is a part of our daily life. We learn from one another and work together to develop new technologies for multiple brands and sectors.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nWe're proud of the things that we've achieved as a company over the past several years and decades. looking forward, the transformation of our sector, our products and our company requires a substantial input in terms of resources. For this reason we are expressly open to strategically beneficial partnerships. By working together with a suitable partner, we can achieve more in less time, especially when it comes to new technologies. We want to continue forging ahead with the electrification of commercial vehicles by means of the strategic partnership with the American company proterra inc. Another good example of this is the fuel-cell partnership that we have agreed upon with the volvo group. its goal is to fully develop, produce and market fuel-cell systems. the focus is on use in heavy-duty trucks; the systems will also be offered for other applications. Daimler truck Ag plans to consolidate all of its current fuel-cell activities, which are combined in Daimler truck Fuel Cell gmbh & Co. Kg, in the new joint venture.\n\nWe have recently increased our strength in the area of highly automated driving (sAe level 4) by means of a partnership with Waymo in the united states in addition to the purchase of a majority holding in torc Robotics.\n\nthe cooperation with luminar technologies, inc., a leading supplier of lidar hardware and so/ftware technology, is a further milestone.\n\nin order to strengthen its market position in China, Daimler trucks plans to produce heavy-duty semitrailer trucks in China in the future and tailor them to the requirements of Chinese customers. these trucks will be produced with the Chinese partner Beiqi Foton motor Co., ltd. in the context of the joint venture Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive (BFDA).\n\nAt Daimler Buses we are working together with companies such as ivu traffic technologies Ag to offer digital services in the area of electric mobility.\n\nWe want our strategy to successfully shape the transformation of our sector and strengthen the competitiveness of our company.",

During the year under review, the cost of capital rate of the group remained unchanged at 8% a/fter taxes. For the automotive divisions, the cost of capital rate remained at 12% before taxes; for Daimler mobility, a cost of equity of 12% before taxes was applied (2019: 13%). \uf0e4 /uni00A0B.03\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe quantitative development of value added and the related financial performance measures is explained in the chapter E /uni00A0profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial performance measures\n\n## Profit measure\n\nthe measure of operating profit at the divisional level is eBit (earnings before interest and income taxes). eBit thus reflects the divisions' responsibility for profit and loss. eBit that is calculated at the group level takes into account centrally managed matters and eliminations. in order to provide a more transparent presentation of our ongoing business, we additionally calculate and report adjusted eBit for both the group and the divisions. the adjustments include individual items if they lead to material effects in a reporting year. these individual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings and related measures, restructuring measures and m&A transactions. group eBit minus the centrally managed income taxes equals net operating profit. \uf0e4 /uni00A0 B.18 in chapter E /uni00A0profitability\n\n## Return on sales\n\nAs one of the main factors influencing value added, return on sales is of particular importance for assessing the automotive divisions' profitability. Return on sales is the ratio of eBit to revenue, whereby unit sales are the primary source of revenue. the measure of profitability for Daimler mobility is not return on sales but return on equity (the ratio of eBit to average equity on a quarterly basis). on the basis of adjusted eBit, we report an adjusted return on sales (Ros) for the automotive divisions and an adjusted return on equity (Roe) for Daimler mobility.\n\n## Net assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll assets, liabilities and provisions for which the automotive divisions are responsible in day-to-day operations are allocated to those divisions. performance measurement at Daimler mobility is implemented on an equity basis. Net assets at the group level include the net operating assets of the automotive divisions and the equity of Daimler mobility, as well as assets and liabilities from income taxes and other reconciliation items which cannot be allocated to the divisions. Average annual net assets are calculated on the basis of average quarterly net assets. E /uni00A0profitability\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, the global gross domestic product shrank at more than twice the rate as in the financial crisis of 2008/2009. Central banks and governments around the world have implemented extensive and unusually expansive measures in order to cushion the impact of this huge drop in economic activity on companies and jobs. thanks to this support, last year's trough of the crisis was already reached in the second quarter, globally, when national lockdowns greatly restricted large areas of economic activity in almost all of the world's major economies. the subsequent gradual easing of these measures initially caused a strong rebound, which, however, lost considerable momentum in some regions toward the end of the year due to a renewed rapid rise in the number of infections. the recession and the pandemic-related restrictions also caused global trade to contract substantially, which hampered growth further, particularly in export-dependent economies.\n\nthe pandemic hit the economies of the industrialized countries very hard. this was also the case in the united states, where the economy suffered a major drop in the first half of the year, accompanied by a huge increase in unemployment. thanks to numerous monetary and fiscal measures, as well as the comparatively moderate governmental restrictions despite continuously high infection rates, the economy recovered very dynamically in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, the country's economic output decreased by 3.5% during the year as a whole, compared to 2019. in the first half of the year, the covid-19 pandemic and the associated containment measures also caused the eurozone to plunge into a deep recession that affected the manufacturing and services sectors equally. however, this drop varied greatly among the different member states and was determined not only by the intensity of the pan-\n\ndemic but also by a country's dependence on sectors such as tourism and hospitality, which were particularly hard hit by the crisis. During the summer, economic activity in europe also recovered considerably amid the easing of restrictions. however, renewed restrictions as a result of an intense second wave of infections that began in the fall affected the economy once again and led to a decrease of about 7.0% for the year as a whole. the impact on the job market was at least mitigated somewhat by short-time work and other employment-protection measures. Within this context, the german economy shrank by an estimated 5.0%.\n\nAlthough China was the first country to be affected by the pandemic, it was also the first to contain the spread of the virus and return to its pre-crisis level already in the course of the year despite suffering a major slump in the first quarter. China was the only major economy in the world to achieve positive growth in the year as a whole, expanding by 2.3%. the other Asian economies were also affected by the pandemic to various extents, but in some cases were able to benefit from China's quick recovery. however, the economic downturn was especially pronounced in india, which had, in absolute terms, one of the highest numbers of infections worldwide. As a result, its gross domestic product dropped by around 7.5%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Against the us dollar, the euro moved between $1.070 and $1.228 during the year. At the end of the year, the euro was around 9% stronger than at the end of 2019. the range of fluctuation of the Japanese yen against the euro was 114.6 to 127.2. year-on-year, at the end of 2020, the euro had appreciated by about 4% against the yen. At the end of 2020, the value of the British pound compared to the euro was about 6% lower than at the end of the previous year. the euro rose by almost 40% against the Brazilian real and by around 35% against the turkish lira. the euro rose considerably against the ruble, gaining around 30% of its relative value.\n\n## Automotive markets\n\nthe development of the global car market was also affected by the covid-19 pandemic during the year under review. even though demand already reached its low point in the second quarter and recovered gradually therea/fter, the global market nevertheless contracted substantially by around 15% during the year as a whole. \uf0e4 B.05\n\nthe Chinese market, which was the first big sales market to be affected by the pandemic, decreased slightly. however, at around 6%, this drop was less severe than initially expected. the us light vehicle market also developed somewhat better than feared during the early stage of the pandemic. however, at around 15%, the drop in demand was still very pronounced.\n\nBy contrast, the covid-19 pandemic had an especially severe impact on the european market. overall car demand decreased by more than 20% in europe. of europe's three biggest individual markets, germany developed best, registering a decrease of around 19%, while the markets in France and the uK suffered even greater decreases of around 25% and almost 30% respectively.\n\nthe economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic also had a noticeable effect on demand for vans . in the eu30 region (european union, united Kingdom, Norway and switzerland), the market was significantly lower than in the previous year. the market volume for mid-size and large vans was 12% below that of the prior year, while the decrease in the small van segment was even more severe, at more than 25%. the us market for large vans was also substantially lower than in the prior year, declining by 19%. the demand for large vans also decreased considerably in Brazil. in China, however, the market for mid-size vans was significantly above the level of the prior year.\n\nthe severe economic crisis caused the demand for heavyduty trucks to decrease sharply in many of Daimler's key sales markets. the North American market contracted by 30%.

With unit sales of 2,052,000 (2019: 2,278,300) vehicles, mercedes-Benz was once again the strongest-selling luxury brand in the automobile industry. We remain number one in the premium segment in germany and some other key european markets, as well as in south Korea, Canada, south Africa and Japan. in addition, we delivered more exclusive vehicles than any other luxury brand in China, where we once again set a sales record.\n\nthe A-Class and B-Class models, including the ClA and ClA shooting Brake, attained unit sales of 449,000 vehicles (-15%). sales of C-Class vehicles decreased by 30% to 309,300 sedans, wagons, coupes and convertibles.

At 286,800 vehicles, unit sales in North America did not reach the high level of the prior year (2019: 368.900). sales decreased in the united states, our main market there, by 21% to 248.800 units.\n\n## B.06\n\n## Unit sales structure of Mercedes-Benz Cars\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| A-/B-Class   | 21%   |\n|--------------|-------|\n| C-Class      | 15%   |\n| E-Class      | 16%   |\n| S-Class      | 3%    |\n| SUVs*        | 42%   |\n| Sports Cars  | 1%    |\n| smart        | 2%    |\n\n- * including GLA and GLB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe smart brand sold 35,200 fortwo and forfour vehicles worldwide (2019: 107,100). this decrease was influenced by the complete switchover of the models to all-electric drive systems.\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans finished the 2020 financial year with unit sales of 374,700 vehicles worldwide (2019: 438,400). this substantial decrease of 15% was largely due to the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic.

Following the high sales figures of the previous years, this market had been expected to normalize. the covid-19 pandemic caused demand to decrease somewhat more than expected. our sales in the eu30 region amounted to 60,600 trucks (2019: 79,800).\n\nunit sales also decreased in latin America, where they dropped to 33,200 trucks (2019: 42,600). even though the decrease in our main latin American market of Brazil was somewhat less pronounced than in latin America as a whole, it was nevertheless significant, with unit sales dropping to 25,300 trucks (2019: 29,700).\n\nour sales also decreased in Asia, where they amounted to a total of 98,200 units (2019: 135,200). the decreases were especially strong in indonesia and india. in indonesia, our sales sank by 50% to 19,500 units, while they decreased by 34% to 9,600 vehicles in india. the decrease was much less in our third core market in Asia, Japan. however, our sales of 39,100 units were slightly lower than in the previous year here as well (2019: 42,200).\n\nDue to the strong rise in demand on the Chinese truck market, sales of Auman trucks, which we produce in China at our joint venture Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive Co., ltd. (BFDA), were significantly higher than in the prior year, at 126,400 units (2019:/uni200986,200).\n\nDaimler Buses sold 20,200 buses and chassis worldwide in financial year 2020 (2019: 32,600). the marked decrease was mainly influenced by the global effects of the covid-19 pandemic. in the eu30 region, Daimler Buses sold 7,500 fully equipped buses and chassis of the mercedes-Benz and setra brands. this was 19% less than in the previous year. unit sales decreased especially strongly in the touring coach segment. At 3,000 (2019: 3,000) units, sales in germany were at the prioryear level. our sales dropped substantially in mexico, where they decreased to 1,500 units (-43%). We sold 5,600 chassis in Brazil, which is our main market in latin America. this represents a decrease of 50%. our bus sales in india also dropped considerably to 500 units (2019: 1,600).",

        "page_content": "At the end of 2020, the Daimler Mobility division had a contract volume of \u20ac150.6 billion (-8%). Adjusted for the effects of currency translation, contract volume decreased by 3%. the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic caused new business to decrease considerably in the first half of the year, although it stabilized in the second half. Daimler mobility concluded/uni20091.8 million new financing and leasing contracts worth a total of \u20ac67.8 billion in 2020. the total value of all new contracts was therefore significantly below the prior-year level (-9%, adjusted for exchange-rate effects -7%). As a result of the pandemic, we were thus unable to meet our original forecast of a slight decrease in new business. New business decreased in almost all countries of europe. in germany, mercedes-Benz Bank's new business decreased to \u20ac11.7 billion (-12%). New business in europe totaled \u20ac27.4 billion, which was significantly below the prior year's level. As a result, Daimler mobility's contract volume in europe dropped by 4% to \u20ac64.8 billion. the fleet business, consisting of the brands Athlon and Daimler Fleet management, had a total of 402,000 contracts at the end of the year (-6%). this corresponds to a contract volume of \u20ac6.6 billion (-5%).\n\nDaimler mobility concluded new financing and leasing contracts worth \u20ac21.7 billion in the Americas in 2020 (-11%). New business decreased substantially in the two biggest countries of the region, the united states (-7%) and Canada (-14%). Contract volume in the Americas region amounted to \u20ac51.2 billion at the end of December and was thus 14% lower than at the end of 2019.\n\nAt \u20ac6.8 billion, new business in the Africa & Asia-pacific region (excluding China) was also much lower than the prior-year level (-19%). At the end of 2020, contract volume in this region amounted to \u20ac16.8 billion, which was 14% lower than in the previous year. By contrast, new business increased significantly in China, where we concluded new leasing and financing contracts worth \u20ac11.9 billion (+29%) in 2020. At the end of 2020, contract volume in China amounted to \u20ac17.7 billion - an increase of 8% compared with the end of the previous year.\n\nAround 2.3 million policies were brokered in the insurance business. this corresponds to a decrease of 2%. Following the covid-19-related decrease in the first half of the year, the number of transactions at the mobility services of the youR NoW joint ventures FRee NoW & ReACh NoW, shARe NoW, and pARK NoW & ChARge NoW stabilized. since the beginning of the second covid-19-wave mid of october the transactions slightly declined again. At the same time, the joint ventures consistently expanded their offerings in 2020.\n\n## Order situation\n\nthe mercedes-Benz Cars, mercedes-Benz vans and Daimler trucks & Buses divisions produce both preconfigured vehicles and vehicles built to order, in accordance with customers' specifications. While doing so, we flexibly adjust the production capacities for the individual models to changing levels of demand. largely due to the demand in China and the positive development of the european and North American markets, the number of incoming orders at mercedes-Benz Cars recovered more quickly than expected during the reporting year, despite the big drop caused by the covid-19 pandemic in march and April. this was driven on the product side primarily by the A-Class and B-Class models and the e-Class, as well as by the continued strong success of our off-road vehicles. mercedes-Benz vans also experienced a sharp drop in the number of new orders in march and April as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. the order situation recovered in the following months, especially due to the high demand in the united states and the positive development in China and many european markets. this recovery was mainly due to the sales incentives that we initiated as well as to the availability of a broad range of products and variants, a great demand for the sprinter and the positive development of the vito and the v-Class during the year as a whole. At the end of 2020, total orders at Daimler trucks & Buses were at the same level as in the previous year. in fact, the order backlog was considerably higher than at the end of 2019. the main reason for this was the substantially higher number of orders in North America.",

At \u20ac4.9 billion, investments in property, plant and equipment in 2020 were 17% lower than the high level of the prior year.\n\ninvestments in property, plant and equipment at Daimler Trucks & Buses amounted to \u20ac0.8 billion in 2020 (2019: \u20ac1.1 billion). of this amount, about 55% was dedicated to the optimization of the sales network and to investments in other infrastructure projects. this high share of non-product projects is due to a covid-19-related reduction of the product projects. Despite the efficiency and capacity measures intensified by the covid-19 pandemic, we retained our key strategic goals: investments in future-oriented technologies such as electric mobility and automated driving. Another focus was on global powertrain projects concerning emission standards and fuel efficiency, the successor generations of existing products, and tailored products for key growth markets.",

Despite the covid-19-related reductions of the development budget, the topics of automated driving, electric mobility (including the eActros) and connectivity played an important role. the subsequent generations of existing products, fuel efficiency and emissions reduction were further focal points, along with customized products and technologies for key growth markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B.12\n\n## Research and development expenditure by division\n\n2020\n\n| in millions of euros      |       | 2019   |   20/19 % change |\n|---------------------------|-------|--------|------------------|\n| Daimler  group            | 8,614 | 9,662  |              -11 |\n| thereof capitalized       | 2,498 | 3,076  |              -19 |\n| mercedes-Benz Cars & vans | 7,199 | 8,061  |              -11 |\n| thereof capitalized       | 2,391 | 3,000  |              -20 |\n| Daimler trucks & Buses    | 1,488 | 1,689  |              -12 |\n| thereof capitalized       | 107   | 76     |              +41 |",

Further information on the management system can be found in the chapter E /uni00A0Corporate profile section of the Combined management Report.\n\n## Adjustment of prior-year figures\n\nin order to ensure that the figures for 2020 are comparable with the prior-year figures, the figures for 2019 have been adjusted to the new segment structure. internal supply relationships within the new segments have been taken into account. Furthermore, in the figures for the previous year, the effects of certain legal issues and equity investments not previously allocated to the segments have been reclassified from the reconciliation to the vehicle segments.\n\nAs of the 2020 financial year, the effects of capitalized borrowing costs are recognized in eBit and in the group's assets and the assets of the segments. As a result, eBit is reported as an accounting parameter in the consolidated statement of income from the 2020 financial year onwards. in order to ensure comparability of the figures for the 2020 financial year with those of the previous year, the reported figures for 2019 have been adjusted accordingly.",

Also adjusted for negative exchange rate effects, it was significantly lower than in 2019. \uf0e4 B.13 \uf0e4 B.14\n\nin the 2019 management Report, we had forecasted revenue at the prior-year level for the Daimler group. Due to the major impact of the covid-19 pandemic in the automotive segments, we adjusted this forecast in the context of our capital market reporting during 2020 to an expectation of revenue significantly below the prior-year level.\n\nCost of sales amounted to \u20ac128.7 billion in 2020, decreasing by 10.3% compared with the previous year. the decrease in cost of sales was caused by production and cost adjustments in response to the covid-19 pandemic. on the other hand, expenses in connection with the adjustment and realignment of capacities within the global production network at the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans segment adversely affected cost of sales. Cost of sales increased at the Daimler mobility segment due to higher expenses for credit-risk provisions and the impairment of so/ftware in the context of streamlining the itarchitecture.\n\n## B.14\n\n/uni2003\n\n53\n\nin the prior-year period, a reassessment of risks in connection with ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures taken with regard to mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles in various regions had significant negative effects on earnings through cost of sales. Furthermore, expenses connected with an updated risk assessment for an expanded recall of takata airbags in europe and other markets and expenses in connection with terminating production of the X-Class had a negative impact on cost of sales in the previous year. \uf0e4 B.14\n\n## B.13\n\n## Revenue by segment and region\n\n|                           | 2020    | 2019    | 20/19    |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| in millions of euros      |         |         | % change |\n| Daimler group             | 154,309 | 172,745 | -11      |\n| segments                  |         |         |          |\n| mercedes-Benz Cars & vans | 98,576  | 106,897 | -8       |\n| Daimler trucks & Buses    | 34,671  | 44,429  | -22      |\n| Daimler mobility          | 27,699  | 28,646  | -3       |\n| Reconciliation            | -6,637  | -7,227  | 8        |\n| Regions                   |         |         |          |\n| europe                    | 64,226  | 69,541  | -8       |\n| thereof germany           | 25,262  | 26,339  | -4       |\n| North America             | 42,937  | 52,196  | -18      |\n| thereof united states     | 37,801  | 45,422  | -17      |\n| Asia                      | 39,944  | 40,657  | -2       |\n| thereof China             | 21,343  | 18,954  | 13       |\n| other markets             | 7,202   | 10,351  | -30      |\n\n| Condensed statement of income                                                       | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Industrial Business   | Industrial Business   | Daimler Mobility   | Daimler Mobility   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                     | 2020           | 2019           | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2020               | 2019               |\n| in millions of euros                                                                |                |                |                       |                       |                    |                    |\n| Revenue                                                                             | 154,309        | 172,745        | 126,610               | 144,099               | 27,699             | 28,646             |\n| Cost of sales                                                                       | -128,721       | -143,580       | -104,153              | -118,626              | -24,568            | -24,954            |\n| Gross profit                                                                        | 25,588         | 29,165         | 22,457                | 25,473                | 3,131              | 3,692              |\n| selling expenses                                                                    | -11,058        | -12,801        | -10,375               | -12,038               | -683               | -763               |\n| general administrative expenses                                                     | -3,534         | -4,050         | -2,752                | -3,139                | -782               | -911               |\n| Research and non-capitalized  development costs                                     | -6,116         | -6,586         | -6,116                | -6,586                | -

As a percentage of revenue, selling expenses decreased from 7.4% to 7.2%. \uf0e4 B.14\n\nAt \u20ac3.5 billion, general administrative expenses decreased by \u20ac0.5 billion. As a percentage of revenue, general administrative expenses remained at the prior-year level of 2.3% (2019: 2.3%). \uf0e4 B.14\n\n## Research and non-capitalized development expenditure of\n\n\u20ac6.1 billion in 2020 was below the prior-year level (2019: \u20ac6.6 billion). it is mainly related to the development of new models, advance expenditure for the renewal of existing models, and the further development of fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly drive systems as well as safety technologies, automated and autonomous driving and the digital connectivity of our products. As a proportion of revenue, research and noncapitalized development costs increased from 3.8% to 4.0%. Further information on the group's research and development is provided in the chapter E /uni00A0investment and research activities of this Combined management Report. \uf0e4 B.14\n\nOther operating income of \u20ac1.3 billion was above the level of the previous year (2019: expense of \u20ac1.6 billion). in 2019, it included significantly higher expenses in connection with ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures relating to mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles in various regions. Furthermore, the previous year included income of \u20ac0.7 billion from the merger of the business units for mobility services of the Daimler group and the BmW group. \uf0e4 B.14\n\nin 2020, profit from equity-method investments of \u20ac0.8 billion was above the prior-year level (2019: \u20ac0.5 billion). earnings were boosted by a \u20ac0.5 billion reduction in the negative impact on earnings from the mobility services of the youR NoW group and a \u20ac0.2 billion increase in earnings from there holding B./uni2009v. this was partially offset by an impairment loss of \u20ac0.3 billion on the equity interest in BAiC motor Corporation ltd. (BAiC motor) in 2020. \uf0e4 B.14\n\nOther financial expense worsened from \u20ac0.3 billion to \u20ac0.4 billion. \uf0e4 B.14\n\nthe Daimler group achieved earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT) of \u20ac6.6 billion in 2020, which is significantly higher than in the previous year (2019: \u20ac4.3 billion). the Daimler group's adjusted eBit amounted to \u20ac8.6 billion (2019: \u20ac10.3 billion). Net exchange rate effects had a positive impact on operating profit. \uf0e4 B.14\n\nthe reconciliation from eBit to adjusted eBit is shown in table \uf0e4 B.16 .\n\nWe had originally forecasted a significant increase in the eBit of the Daimler group. Due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, we adjusted this forecast in the context of our capital market reporting during 2020 to an expectation of eBit at the prioryear level. Despite the difficult conditions, the Daimler group was able to significantly exceed this expectation due to a strong fourth quarter.\n\nNet interest expense improved by \u20ac0.2 billion to \u20ac0.3 billion (2019: \u20ac0.5 billion). \uf0e4 B.14\n\nthe tax expense of \u20ac2.3 billion (2019: \u20ac1.1 billion) stated under income taxes increased mainly due to the increased profit before income taxes. the effective tax rate for 2020 was 36.8% (2019: 29.3%). in 2020, the impairment of deferred tax assets as well as non-tax-deductible expenses, mainly in connection with our shareholdings, led to an increase in the effective tax rate. \uf0e4 B.14\n\nNet profit of \u20ac4.0 billion is significantly above the prior-year figure (2019: \u20ac2.7 billion). Net profit of \u20ac0.4 billion is attributable to non-controlling interests (2019: \u20ac0.3 billion). Net profit attributable to the shareholders of Daimler AG amounts to \u20ac3.6 billion (2019: \u20ac2.4 billion), representing an increase in earnings per share to \u20ac3.39 (2019: \u20ac2.22). \uf0e4 B.14\n\nthe calculation of earnings per share is based on an unchanged average number of outstanding shares of 1,069.8 million.\n\nFurther information on the individual items of the statement of income is provided in E /uni00A0Notes 4 ff. of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue and EBIT by segment\n\nDue to the significant decrease in unit sales caused by the worldwide covid-19 pandemic, the revenue of the MercedesBenz Cars & Vans segment in the year 2020 fell by 8% to \u20ac98,576 million (2019: \u20ac106,897 million). the segment's revenue was therefore significantly lower than in the previous year, in line with our forecast as adjusted during 2020; in the 2019 management Report, we had originally forecasted revenue at the prior-year level.\n\nthe decline in unit sales, particularly in europe and North America, had a major negative impact on gross profit. on the other hand, there was a positive effect from a more favorable sales structure and improved pricing. expenses for enhanced vehicle equipment and a higher level of depreciation reduced gross profit in relation to revenue, but this was offset by the efficiency measures introduced as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic. As a result, gross profit in relation to revenue rose from 16.5% to 17.6%. in addition, the measures introduced, including the use of short-time working in germany and continued successful cost discipline, led to cost reductions in the other functional cost areas.\n\nthe segment's earnings were also reduced by restructuring expenses of \u20ac1,476 million. this includes expenses of \u20ac871 million for the adjustment and realignment of capacities within the global production network in connection with the intended sale of the car plant in hambach (France) as well as capacity adjustments at the plants in Aguascalientes (mexico), tuscaloosa (usA) and iracem\u00e1polis (Brazil). the restructuring expenses also included \u20ac605 million for personnel-cost optimization programs. effects from ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures taken relating to mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles led to a reduction in earnings of \u20ac154 million. earnings in the previous year were reduced primarily by individual items relating to ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures taken relating to mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles (\u20ac4,491 million) as well as expenses connected with an updated risk assessment for an expanded recall of takata airbags (\u20ac941 million). earnings in 2019 were also reduced by restructuring expenses in connection with terminating production of the X-Class (\u20ac828 million).\n\nB.15\n\n/uni2003\n\n55\n\neBit amounted to \u20ac5,172 million (2019: minus \u20ac109 million) and adjusted eBit amounted to \u20ac6,802 million (2019: \u20ac6,151 million). the adjusted return on sales of 6.9% was above the adjusted prior-year figure of 5.8%. in the management Report on the year 2019, an adjusted return on sales of between 4% and 5% was forecasted for the segment. Within the framework of our capital market reporting during 2020, we adjusted this forecast to the expectation of an adjusted return on sales of 4.5% to 5.5%. Due to a strong fourth quarter, the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans segment significantly exceeded this expectation. \uf0e4 B.15\n\nDue to the strong decrease in unit sales, the revenue of the Daimler Trucks & Buses segment decreased in the year 2020 by 22% to \u20ac34,671 million (2019: \u20ac44,429 million). the segment achieved revenue significantly below the prior-year figure, thus confirming the forecast we made at the beginning of the year.\n\nthe development of revenue in 2020 was substantially adversely affected by declining unit sales in all regions, primarily due to contracting markets caused by the expected cycle as well as the covid-19 pandemic. there was a negative impact from a smaller contribution from the a/ftersales business due to weaker demand. Cost of sales was therefore significantly lower than in the previous year, and was also affected by additions to provisions for warranty claims. gross profit in relation to revenue decreased from 18.5% to 15.2%. the measures initiated to adjust costs and capacities in response to the covid-19 pandemic, including the use of short-time working in germany, led to cost reductions in all functional cost areas. in particular, there was a positive impact from a significant reduction in fixed costs, which was achieved through strict cost controls and the gradual implementation of restructuring measures. there was an opposing effect from expenses of \u20ac153 million for the optimization of personnel costs in all functional-cost areas.\n\neBit amounted to \u20ac525 million (adjusted \u20ac678 million; 2019: \u20ac2,672 million). the segment's adjusted return on sales was below the prior-year figure at 2.0% (2019: 6.0%). Daimler trucks & Buses therefore confirmed the forecast as adjusted during the year in the context of our capital-market reporting due to the covid-19 pandemic of an adjusted return on sales of between 1% and 2%. in the management Report on the year 2019, we had originally anticipated an adjusted return on sales for the segment of 5%. \uf0e4 B.15\n\n| EBIT of Industrial Business                     | Industrial Business   | Industrial Business   | Mercedes-Benz   Cars & Vans   | Mercedes-Benz   Cars & Vans   | Daimler   Trucks & Buses   | Daimler   Trucks & Buses   | Reconciliation   | Reconciliation   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                 | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2020                          | 2019                          | 2020                       | 2019                       | 2020             | 2019             |\n| in millions of euros                            |                       |                       |                               |                               |                            |                            |                  |                  |\n| Revenue                                         | 126,610               | 144,099               | 98,576                        | 106,897                       | 34,671                     | 44,429                     | -6,637           | -7,227           |\n| Cost of sales                                   | -104,153              | -118,626              | -81,194                       | -89,266                       | -29,400                    | -36,198                    | 6,441            | 6,838            |\n| Gross profit                                    | 22,457                | 25,473                | 17,382                        | 17,631                        | 5,271                      | 8,231                      | -196             | -389             |\n| selling expenses                                | -10,375               | -12,038               | -8,539                        | -9,963                        | -2,520                     | -2,897                     | 684              | 822              |\n| general administrative expenses                 | -2,752                | -3,139                | -1,458                        | -1,575                        | -1,351                     | -1,479                     | 57               | -85              |\n| Research and non-capitalized  development costs | -6,116                | -6,586                | -4,808                        | -5,061                        | -1,381                     | -1,613                     | 73               | 88               |\n| other income/expense                            | 1,953                 | -1,537                | 2,595                         | -1,141                        | 506                        | 430                        | -1,148           | -826             |\n| EBIT                                            | 5,167                 | 2,173                 | 5,172                         | -109                          | 525                        | 2,672                      | -530             | -390             |",

Although functional costs were affected by expenses of \u20ac67 million in connection with personnel cost optimization programs, positive effects occurred overall in all functional cost areas as a result of the measures initiated to improve the cost position. the decrease in other operating income was due to a positive effect of \u20ac718 million in 2019 from the merger of the mobility services of the Daimler group and the BmW group. income from investments accounted for using the equity method included in particular the earnings of youR NoW holding gmbh. Compared with the previous year, however, there was a \u20ac313 million lower adverse effect on earnings from restructuring measures in 2020.\n\n## B.16\n\neBit amounted to \u20ac1,436 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac2,140 million) and adjusted eBit amounted to \u20ac1,595 million (2019: \u20ac1,827 million). Adjusted return on equity of 10.9% was below the adjusted prior-year figure of 13.1%. At the beginning of the year, we forecasted an adjusted return on equity of 12%. We adjusted this during 2020 in the context of our capital-market reporting to the expectation of an adjusted return on equity of 9% to 10%. the Daimler mobility segment exceeded this expectation.\n\nthe reconciliation of the divisions' eBit to group eBit comprises gains and/or losses at the corporate level and the effects on earnings of eliminating intra-group transactions between the divisions.\n\nitems at the corporate level resulted in expenses of \u20ac652 million (2019: \u20ac361 million), including the impairment of Daimler's equity investment in BAiC motor. Furthermore, expenses of \u20ac86 million in connection with cost-optimization programs are included. in the previous year, mainly expenses in connection with 'project Future' had a negative impact on eBit.\n\nthe elimination of intra-group transactions resulted in earnings of \u20ac122 million in 2020 (2019: expenses of \u20ac29 million).\n\nthe reconciliation from eBit to adjusted eBit is shown in table \uf0e4 B.16 .\n\n| Reconciliation EBIT to adjusted EBIT                | Mercedes-Benz  Cars & Vans   | Daimler Trucks & Buses   | Daimler Mobility   | Recon- ciliation   | Daimler Group   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| in millions of euros                                |                              |                          |                    |                    |                 |\n| 2020                                                |                              |                          |                    |                    |                 |\n| EBIT                                                | 5,172                        | 525                      | 1,436              | -530               | 6,603           |\n| legal proceedings (and related measures)            | 154                          | -                        | -                  | 10                 | 164             |\n| Restructuring measures                              | 1,476                        | 153                      | 159                | 86                 | 1,874           |\n| m&A transactions                                    | -                            | -                        | -                  | -                  | -               |\n| Adjusted EBIT                                       | 6,802                        | 678                      | 1,595              | -434               | 8,641           |\n| Return on sales/return on equity  (in %)            | 5.2                          |                          | 9.8                |                    |                 |\n| Adjusted return on sales/return on equity  (in %) 1 |                              | 1.5                      |                    |                    |                 |\n|                                                     | 6.9                          | 2.0                      | 10.9               |                    |                 |\n| 2019                                                |                              |                          |                    |                    |                 |\n| EBIT                                                | -109                         | 2,672                    | 2,140              | -390               | 4,313           |\n| legal proceedings (and related measures)            |                              |                          |                    |                    |                 |\n| as well as takata                                   | 5,432                        | -                        | -                  | 16                 | 5,448           |\n| Restructuring measures                              | 828                          | -                        | 405                | -                  | 1,233           |\n| m&A transactions                                    | -                            | -                        | -718               | -                  | -718            |\n| Adjusted EBIT                                       | 6,151                        | 2,672                    | 1,827              | -374               | 10,276          |\n| Return on sales/return on equity                    |                              |                          |                    |                    |                 |\n| (in %)                                              | -0.1                         | 6.0                      | 15.3               |                    |                 |\n| Adjusted return on sales/return on equity  (in %) 1 | 5.8                          | 6.0                      | 13.1               |                    |                 |\n\n- 1  Return on sales adjusted is calculated as the ratio of adjusted eBit to revenue.

An additional positive impact on value added resulted from the decrease in average net assets by \u20ac2.3 billion, which was mainly caused by lower average inventories and higher average provisions for other risks. this was partly offset by the increased capitalized development costs.\n\nvalue added a t Daimler Trucks & Buses fell sharply by \u20ac2.0 billion to minus \u20ac0.6 billion as a result of the eBit development. this development was slightly offset by the significant decrease in average net assets to \u20ac9.5 billion, which was primarily the result of lower average inventories.\n\nAt the Daimler Mobility segment, value added of minus \u20ac0.3 billion was significantly below the prior-year level of plus \u20ac0.3 billion. the segment's return on equity amounted to 9.8% (2019: 15.3%). the development of value added primarily reflects the decrease in earnings of \u20ac0.7 billion.\n\n## B.17\n\n## Value added\n\n2020\n\ntable \uf0e4 B.17 shows value added for the group and for the individual segments. the reconciliation of the segments' eBit to net operating profit as well as the average net assets are shown in tables \uf0e4 /uni00A0 B.18 and \uf0e4 B.19 . table \uf0e4 B.20 shows how net assets are derived from the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n| in millions of euros      |       | 2019   | 20/19 Change   |\n|---------------------------|-------|--------|----------------|\n| Daimler Group             | -591  | -2,046 | +1,455         |\n| mercedes-Benz Cars & vans | 1,239 | -4,317 | +5,556         |\n| Daimler trucks & Buses    | -616  | 1,361  | -1,977         |\n| Daimler mobility          | -316  | 325    | -641           |\n\n## B.18\n\n## Reconciliation to net operating profit\n\n| in millions of euros      | 2020   | 2019   | 20/19 Change   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| mercedes-Benz Cars & vans | 5,172  | -109   | +5,281         |\n| Daimler trucks & Buses    | 525    | 2,672  | -2,147         |\n| Daimler mobility          | 1,436  | 2,140  | -704           |\n| EBIT of the segments      | 7,133  | 4,703  | +2,430         |\n| income taxes 1            | -2,404 | -1,256 | -1,148         |\n| other reconciliation      | -530   | -390   | -140           |\n| Net operating profit      | 4,199  | 3,057  | +1,142         |\n\n- 1  Adjusted for tax effects on interest income/expense.\n\n## B.19\n\n## Net assets (average)\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n20/19\n\n| in millions of euros      |        |        | % change   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| mercedes-Benz Cars & vans | 32,768 | 35,070 | -7         |\n| Daimler trucks & Buses    | 9,513  | 10,921 | -13        |\n| Daimler mobility 1        | 14,601 | 13,961 | +5         |\n| Net assets                |        |        |            |\n| of the segments           | 56,882 | 59,952 | -5         |\n| equity-method             |        |        |            |\n| investments 2             | 463    | 662    | -30        |\n| Assets and                |        |        |            |\n| liabilities from          |        |        |            |\n| income taxes 3            | 2,088  | 2,720  | -23        |\n| other reconciliation 3    | 436    | 448    | -3         |\n| Daimler Group             | 59,869 | 63,782 | -6         |\n\n- 1  total equity.\n- 2  to the extent not allocated to the segments.\n- 3  to the extent not allocated to Daimler mobility.",

Worldwide financial management is performed within the framework of legal requirements consistently for all group entities by the treasury department of the Daimler group. Financial management operates within a framework of guidelines, limits and benchmarks, and on the operational level is organizationally separate from other financial functions such as settlement, financial controlling, reporting and accounting.\n\nCapital structure management designs the capital structure of the group and its subsidiaries. Decisions regarding the capitalization of Daimler's mobility, production, sales or financing companies are based on the principles of cost-optimized and risk-optimized liquidity and capital resources.\n\nthe purpose of liquidity management is to enable the group to meet its payment obligations at any time. For this purpose, the group records the cash flows from operating and financial activities in a rolling plan. the resulting financial requirements are covered by the use of appropriate instruments for liquidity management (e.g., bank credit, commercial paper and notes); liquidity surpluses are invested in the money market or the capital market taking into account risk and return expectations. our goal is to ensure the level of liquidity regarded as necessary at optimal costs. Besides operational liquidity, the Daimler group maintains additional liquidity reserves which are available in the short term. those additional financial resources include a pool of receivables from the financial services business which are available for securitization in the capital market, a contractually confirmed syndicated credit facility, as well as a credit facility additionally agreed in 2020 in the event that capital market transactions cannot be carried out (bridge facility).\n\nCash management centrally determines the cash requirements and surpluses. By means of cash-pooling procedures, liquidity is centrally concentrated on bank accounts of the Daimler group in various currencies. most of the payments between group companies are made through internal clearing accounts so that the number of external cash flows is reduced to a minimum. the Daimler group has established standardized processes and systems to manage its bank accounts and internal cash-clearing accounts, and to execute automated payment transactions.",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\n59\n\nManagement of market-price risks aims to minimize the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices on the earnings of the divisions and the group. the group's overall exposure to these market-price risks is determined to provide a basis for hedging decisions, which include the definition of hedging volumes and corresponding periods, as well as the selection of hedging instruments. the hedging strategy is specified at group level and uniformly implemented in the segments. Decisions regarding the management of risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, as well as decisions on asset/liability management (liquidity and interest rates), are regularly made by the relevant internal committees.\n\nManagement of pension assets (plan assets) includes the investment of the assets to cover the corresponding pension obligations. the plan assets are legally separated from the group's assets and are invested primarily in funds; they are not available for general business purposes. the plan assets are spread across various investment categories such as equities, fixed-interest securities, alternative investments and real estate, depending on the expected development of pension obligations and with the help of risk-return optimization. the performance of asset management is measured by comparison with defined reference indices. the investment risks are limited via a group-wide guideline. in addition, there are local regulations for risk management for the individual plan assets. Additional information on pension plans and similar obligations is provided in E Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements.\n\nthe risk volume that is subject to credit risk management includes all of the Daimler group's worldwide creditor positions with financial institutions, issuers of securities, and customers in the financial services business and the automotive business. Credit risks with financial institutions and issuers of securities arise primarily from investments executed as part of our liquidity management and from the application of derivative financial instruments. the management of these credit risks is mainly based on an internal limit system that reflects the creditworthiness of the respective financial institution or issuer. the credit risk with customers of our automotive business results from relationships with contracted dealerships and general agencies, other corporate customers and retail customers. in connection with the export business, general agencies that according to our creditworthiness analyses are not sufficiently creditworthy are generally required to provide collaterals such as first-class bank guarantees. the credit risk with end-customers in the financial services business is managed by Daimler mobility on the basis of a standardized risk management process. in this process, minimum requirements are defined for the sales-financing and leasing business and standards are set for credit processes, as well as for the identification, measurement and management of risks. Key elements for the management of credit risks are appropriate creditworthiness assessments supported by statistical risk-classification methods, as well as structured portfolio analysis and portfolio monitoring.\n\nFinancial country risk management includes various aspects: the risk from investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the risk from the cross-border financing of group companies in risk countries, and the risk from direct sales to customers in those countries. the Daimler group has an internal rating system that assigns all countries in which it operates to risk categories. Risks from cross-border receivables are partially protected with the use of export-credit insurance, letters of credit and bank guarantees in favor of Daimler Ag and other group companies. in addition, an internal committee sets and restricts the level of hard-currency credits granted to Daimler mobility companies in risk countries.\n\nFurther information on the management of market-price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk is provided in E Note 33 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nCash provided by operating activities \uf0e4 B.21 amounted to \u20ac22.3 billion in 2020 (2019: \u20ac7.9 billion) and was particularly affected by the worldwide consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. Whereas in the prior-year period, the growth of the leasing and sales-financing portfolio negatively affected cash provided by operating activities, the current year saw a significantly positive cash-flow effect due to the decrease in the sales-financing business caused by the corona crisis. temporary suspensions of production during the second quarter of 2020, a renewed increase in customer demand during the second half of the year and active working capital management were the main factors influencing the development of working capital. Compared with the previous year, there were positive effects in all automotive segments. Furthermore, cash provided by operating activities was affected by increased cash inflows from dividends received from Beijing Benz Automotive Co., ltd., as well as by lower payments than in 2019 in connection with ongoing governmental and court proceedings and related measures taken with regard to mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. the prior year was mainly affected by the fine of \u20ac870 million paid in conclusion of the administrative offense proceedings against Daimler Ag.\n\nopposing effects resulted from the change in cash earnings before taxes, as the positive business performance in the second half of the year could not fully offset the negative consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. Additional effects resulted from the payments made in the context of reviewing and prioritizing the product portfolio for the planned discontinuation of the X-Class production in the first quarter of 2020.",

Compared to the previous year, there were higher total cash inflows (net) in 2020. Furthermore, cash used for investing activities during the first quarter of 2019 had been affected by the merger of the mobility services of the Daimler group and the BmW group, which resulted in cash

Compared with the prior year, the development of working capital was positive in all automotive segments. Furthermore, the implemented cost-cutting measures had an impact and resulted in lower investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. positive effects resulted from increased cash inflows from dividends received from Beijing Benz Automotive Co., ltd., as well as from lower payments than in 2019 in connection with ongoing governmental and court proceedings and related measures taken with regard to mercedesBenz diesel vehicles. the previous year was mainly affected by the fine of \u20ac870 million paid in conclusion of the administrative offense proceedings against Daimler Ag.\n\n## B.22\n\n## Free cash flow of the industrial business\n\n| in millions of euros                                           | 2020   | 2019   | 20/19 Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Cash provided by  operating activities                         | 17,016 | 12,985 | +4,031         |\n| Cash used for  investing activities                            | -6,609 | -9,986 | +3,377         |\n| Change in marketable  debt securities and  similar investments | -1,929 | -883   | -1,046         |\n| Right-of-use assets                                            | -351   | -987   | +636           |\n| other adjustments                                              | 132    | 239    | -107           |\n| Free cash flow of the industrial business                      | 8,259  | 1,368  | +6,891         |\n| legal proceedings   (and related measures)                     | 595    | 1,341  | -746           |\n| Restructuring measures                                         | 301    | -      | +301           |\n| m&A transactions                                               | -      | -      | -              |\n| Free cash flow of the industrial  business adjusted            | 9,155  | 2,709  | +6,446         |\n\nopposing effects resulted from the change in cash earnings before taxes, as the positive business performance in the second half of the year could not fully offset the negative consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. Additional effects resulted from the payments made in the context of reviewing and prioritizing the product portfolio for the planned discontinuation of X-Class production in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nin the interest of greater transparency in reporting on the ongoing business, starting with the first quarter of 2020, we also report an adjusted free cash flow of the industrial business \uf0e4 B.22 . the adjustments for legal proceedings include payments by the automotive segments in connection with ongoing governmental and legal proceedings and related measures taken with regard to mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. the adjustments for restructuring measures include payments made in connection with the review and prioritization of the product portfolio. the adjusted free cash flow of the industrial business led to a cash inflow of \u20ac9.2 billion ( 2019: \u20ac2.7 billion).\n\nin 2020, the free cash flow of the Daimler Group resulted in a cash inflow of \u20ac13.4 billion (2019: cash outflow of \u20ac4.8 billion). Besides the effects of the free cash flow of the industrial business, the free cash flow of the Daimler group is mainly affected by the leasing and sales-financing business of Daimler mobility. Additional effects in 2019 resulted from the cash outflows (net) relating to the merger of the mobility services of the Daimler group and the BmW group.",

For that purpose, Daimler made use of a broad spectrum of various financing instruments in various currencies and markets. they include bank loans, commercial paper in the money market, bonds with medium and long maturities, promissory-note loans, customer deposits at mercedes-Benz Bank, and the securitization of receivables from customers in the financial services business (asset-backed securities).\n\nvarious issuance programs are available for raising longer-term funds in the capital market. they include the euro medium term Note program (emtN) with a total volume of \u20ac70 billion, under which Daimler Ag and several subsidiaries can issue bonds in various currencies. other local capital-market programs exist, which are significantly smaller than the emtN program. Capital-market programs allow flexible, repeated access to the capital markets.\n\nthe situation in the bond markets was significantly influenced by the covid-19 pandemic in the reporting year. the supporting measures taken by governments and central banks meant that risk premiums for companies with an investment-grade rating returned to a moderate level in the second half of the year.\n\n## B.26\n\n## Net liquidity of the industrial business\n\n|                                                                  | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31,  2019   | 20/19   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n| in millions of euros                                             |                 |                  | Change  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                        | 20,344          | 16,152           | +4,192  |\n| marketable debt securities  and similar investments              | 5,468           | 7,522            | -2,054  |\n| Liquidity                                                        | 25,812          | 23,674           | +2,138  |\n| Financing liabilities                                            | -9,168          | -13,289          | +4,121  |\n| market valuation and  currency hedges  for financing liabilities | 1,211           | 612              | +599    |\n| Financing liabilities (nominal)                                  | -7,957          | -12,677          | +4,720  |\n| Net liquidity                                                    | 17,855          | 10,997           | +6,858  |\n\n## B.27\n\n## Net debt of the Daimler Group\n\n|                                                                  | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31,  2019   | 20/19   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n| in millions of euros                                             |                 |                  | Change  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                        | 23,048          | 18,883           | +4,165  |\n| marketable debt securities  and similar investments              | 6,397           | 8,655            | -2,258  |\n| Liquidity                                                        | 29,445          | 27,538           | +1,907  |\n| Financing liabilities                                            | -145,842        | -161,780         | +15,938 |\n| market valuation and  currency hedges  for financing liabilities | 1,224           | 579              | +645    |\n| Financing liabilities (nominal)                                  | -144,618        | -161,201         | +16,583 |\n| Net debt                                                         | -115,173        | -133,663         | +18,490 |",

A large proportion of those bonds were placed in the form of so-called benchmark issuances (bonds with high nominal volumes) by Daimler Ag in the euro market and by Daimler Finance North America llC in the us-dollar area. this includes a 'green bond' with a volume of \u20ac1.0 billion. Further information on this bond can be found in the chapter E /uni00A0sustainability at Daimler.\n\n## \uf0e4 B.28\n\nin the Chinese market, Daimler international Finance B.v. placed three so-called panda bonds with a total volume of CNy 6.0 billion. in addition, a large number of smaller bonds were issued in various currencies and markets.\n\nDaimler also issued small volumes of commercial paper in 2020.\n\nin the reporting year, asset-backed securities (ABS) were\n\nissued in eight countries worldwide. in the united states, a total refinancing volume of usD 8.8 billion was generated in seven transactions. in addition, two ABs bonds with a refinancing volume of \u20ac2.4 billion were issued in germany, of which \u20ac1.3 billion was placed on the market. the remaining \u20ac1.1 billion was acquired by mercedes-Benz Bank Ag itself (retained interests). the securities can be used as collateral for openmarket transactions with the Deutsche Bundesbank. in 2020, mercedes-Benz Bank Ag received \u20ac0.9 billion from these open market transactions. Furthermore, three ABs transactions with a total volume of CNy 15.5 billion were placed in China. ABs transactions were also successfully placed with investors in Canada, Australia, the united Kingdom, France and south Korea.\n\nBank credit was another important source of refinancing in 2020. loans were provided by globally active banks as well as by banks operating nationally. the lenders also included supranational banks such as the european investment Bank and the Brazilian Development Bank.\n\nsince July 2018, Daimler has had at its disposal a syndicated credit facility with a volume of \u20ac11 billion from a consortium of international banks. Following the exercise of an extension option of one further year, it grants Daimler additional financial flexibility until 2025. Daimler does not intend to utilize the credit line.\n\nFurthermore, an additional agreed credit facility has been available to Daimler since the beginning of April 2020 (a bridge facility). A/fter capital-market transactions were carried out in 2020, the originally agreed amount decreased from \u20ac12.0 billion to \u20ac8.8 billion. At December 31, 2020, the credit line was still available but had not been utilized.\n\nthe carrying values of the main refinancing instruments and the weighted average interest rates are shown in table \uf0e4 B.29 . At December 31, 2020, they are mainly denominated in the following currencies: 46% in euros, 24% in us dollars, 10% in Chinese renminbi, 3% in British pounds, 3% in Canadian dollars and 3% in Japanese yen.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the total of financing liabilities shown in the consolidated statement of financial position amounted to \u20ac145.8 billion (2019: \u20ac161.8 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetailed information on the amounts and terms of the main items of financing liabilities is provided in E /uni00A0Notes 24 and 33 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements.

Fitch Ratings and s&p global Ratings downgraded their long-term ratings by one notch. DBRs downgraded its long-term rating by two notches and lowered its short-term rating from R-1 (low) to R-2 (high). the long-term and short-term credit ratings for Daimler Ag and its finance companies provided by moody's investors service and scope Ratings remained unchanged in 2020. \uf0e4 B.30\n\non march 26, 2020, S&P Global Ratings (s&p) lowered its long-term rating for Daimler Ag from A- to BBB+ and affirmed its short-term rating of A-2. the outlook was unchanged at 'negative.' s&p justified these measures primarily with the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on Daimler's sales volumes, which will be lower than originally anticipated. in addition, production shutdowns will reduce the group's revenue and cash flow in 2020.\n\non January 21, 2021, s&p changed its outlook for our longterm credit rating from 'negative' to 'stable.' s&p expects Daimler to increasingly benefit from a stabilization of demand, cost-cutting measures and a more favorable model mix. overall, s&p assumes that these factors will have a positive impact on profitability and the free cash flow of the industrial business.\n\non April 14, 2020, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded Daimler's long-term issuer default rating from A- to BBB+ with a stable outlook. its short-term rating remained unchanged at F1. Fitch stated that the downgrade reflects the deterioration of the group's financial profile. Fitch anticipates only a slow recovery. Furthermore, Fitch expects a sustained weakened economic environment and its effect on sales of new cars and heavy trucks in the next one to two years to exacerbate the underlying fundamental challenges facing the group.\n\nthe Canadian agency DBRS downgraded its long-term rating for Daimler Ag and its rated subsidiaries from A to BBB (high) on August 11, 2020. At the same time, DBRs lowered its shortterm rating from R-1 (low) to R-2 (high). however, the trend was li/fted from 'negative' to 'stable.' DBRs justified the downgrades with the structural headwinds that have been considerably exacerbated by the global escalation of the covid-19 pandemic. this reflects in particular the electrification of Daimler's product portfolio, ongoing investments in self-driving technologies and the related expenses at mercedes-Benz Cars.\n\n/uni2003\n\n65\n\n## B.30\n\n## Credit ratings\n\n## End of 2020 end of 2019\n\n| long-term credit rating   |            |           |\n|---------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| s&p                       | BBB+       | A-        |\n| moody's                   | A3         | A3        |\n| Fitch                     | BBB+       | A-        |\n| scope                     | A          | A         |\n| DBRs                      | BBB (high) | A         |\n| short-term credit rating  |            |           |\n| s&p                       | A-2        | A-2       |\n| moody's                   | P-2        | p-2       |\n| Fitch                     | F1         | F1        |\n| scope                     | S-1        | s-1       |\n| DBRs                      | R-2 (high) | R-1 (low) |",

Daimler mobility accounts for \u20ac161.3 billion of the balance sheet total (2019: \u20ac174.8 billion), equivalent to 56% of the Daimler group's total assets (2019: 58%).\n\nthe global impact of the covid-19 pandemic affected balance sheet items to varying degrees as of December 31, 2020. the decrease in total assets primarily reflects the reduced volume of the financial services business, lower inventories and lower property, plant and equipment due to, among other things, the adjustment and realignment of capacities within the global production network. opposing effects came from significantly higher cash and cash equivalents. on the liabilities side of the balance sheet, there were decreases in financing liabilities while provisions for pensions and similar obligations were above the prior-year level. table \uf0e4 B.31 shows the condensed statement of financial position for the group as well as for the industrial business and Daimler mobility.\n\n## B.31\n\nCurrent assets account for 40% of the balance sheet total, which is below the prior-year level (2019: 42%).

Capitalized development costs amounted to \u20ac2.5 billion in 2020 (2019: \u20ac3.1 billion) and accounted for 29% of the group's total research and development expenditure (2019: 32%).\n\nProperty,

Although new business stabilized in the second half of the year, contract volume was below the prior-year level, mainly due to lower customer demand caused by the corona crisis. the leasing and salesfinancing business as a proportion of 50% of total assets was lower than in the previous year (2019: 51%).\n\nEquity-method investments decreased to \u20ac5.2 billion (2019: \u20ac5.9 billion). they mainly comprise the carrying amounts of our equity interests in Beijing Benz Automotive Co., ltd., BAiC motor Corporation ltd. (BAiC motor), there holding B.v. and youR NoW holding gmbh (youR NoW). the decrease came primarily from the interests in BAiC motor and youR NoW.\n\nInventories decreased from \u20ac29.8 billion to \u20ac26.4 billion; also as a proportion of total assets, they were below the prior-year level at 9% (2019: 10%). the decrease of \u20ac2.1 billion, adjusted for exchange rate effects, mainly came from the two automotive segments, and, among other things, is due to the lower business volume in 2020 resulting from the covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken for active working-capital management.\n\nTrade receivables of \u20ac10.6 billion are below the prior-year level of \u20ac12.3 billion. the decrease was partially due to the sales development and the stronger focus on working capital. the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans segment accounts for 64% of these receivables (2019: 61%) and the Daimler trucks & Buses segment accounts for 29% (2019: 28%).\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased compared with the end of 2019 by \u20ac4.2 billion to \u20ac23.0 billion.\n\n## Marketable debt securities and similar investments\n\ndecreased compared with December 31, 2019 from \u20ac8.7 billion to \u20ac6.4 billion. those assets include the debt instruments that are allocated to liquidity, most of which are traded in active markets. they generally have an external rating of A or better.\n\nOther financial assets of \u20ac6.9 billion are above the prior-year level (2019: \u20ac6.1 billion). they primarily consist of derivative financial instruments, equity and debt instruments, investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries, and loans and other receivables due from third parties. the increase is mainly attributable to higher positive fair values of derivative financial instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther assets of \u20ac11.7 billion (2019: \u20ac12.5 billion) primarily comprise deferred tax assets and tax refund claims. the main effect here was from lower refund claims in connection with value added taxes.\n\nthe group's equity decreased compared with December 31, 2019 from \u20ac62.8 billion to \u20ac62.2 billion. positive effects on equity resulted from the net profit of \u20ac4.0 billion and from the remeasurement of derivative financial instruments not recognized in profit or loss (\u20ac0.8 billion). this was offset by the effects of currency translation of \u20ac2.5 billion, actuarial losses from defined-benefit pension plans recognized in retained earnings of \u20ac1.9 billion and the dividend of \u20ac1.0 billion paid out to Daimler's shareholders. equity attributable to the shareholders of Daimler Ag decreased accordingly to \u20ac60.7 billion (2019: \u20ac61.3 billion).\n\nWhile the balance sheet total decreased by 6%, equity decreased by 1% compared with the previous year. the group's equity ratio of 21.3% was therefore above the level at the end of 2019 (20.5%); the equity ratio for the industrial business was 37.3% (2019: 36.7%). it is necessary to consider the fact that the equity ratios at the end of 2019 and 2020 are adjusted for the paid and proposed dividend payments.\n\nProvisions increased from \u20ac30.7 billion to \u20ac32.5 billion; as a proportion of the balance sheet total, they were also above the prior-year level at 11% (2019: 10%). provisions for pensions and similar obligations increased to \u20ac12.1 billion (2019: \u20ac9.7 billion). opposing the significant increase in the present value of defined-benefit pension obligations to \u20ac39.9 billion (2019: \u20ac36.2 billion) was the fair value of the pension-plan assets applied to finance those obligations of \u20ac28.9 billion (2019: \u20ac27.8 billion). especially the further decrease in discount rates led to an increase in the present value of defined-benefit pension obligations. this effect was only partially offset by positive income from the plan assets. provisions also relate to liabilities from product warranties of \u20ac8.5 billion (2019: \u20ac8.7 billion), from personnel and social costs of \u20ac4.6 billion (2019: \u20ac4.2 billion) and from liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings of \u20ac4.6 billion (2019: \u20ac4.9 billion), as well as provisions for other risks of \u20ac2.7 billion (2019: \u20ac3.1 billion).",

Adjusted for exchange rate effects, the decrease of \u20ac8.9 billion was primarily due to the lower refinancing requirement of the leasing and sales-financing business. 53% of the financing liabilities were accounted for by bonds, 22% by liabilities to financial institutions, 11% by liabilities from ABs transactions and 10% by deposits in the direct banking business.\n\nTrade payables decreased compared with December 31, 2019 by \u20ac0.3 billion to \u20ac12.4 billion. the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans segment accounts for 71% (2019: 71%) of those payables and the Daimler trucks & Buses segment accounts for 23% (2019: 22%).\n\nOther financial liabilities amounted to \u20ac8.6 billion (2019: \u20ac9.9 billion) and mainly consist of liabilities from residual-value guarantees, wages and salaries, derivative financial instruments, deposits received and accrued interest on financing liabilities. the decrease is partially attributable to lower negative fair values of derivative financial instruments.\n\n## B.33\n\nNet Assets of the automotive segments\n\ntable \uf0e4 B.33 shows the derivation of net assets for the automotive segments. they relate to the operating

        "page_content": "## Daimler Ag\n\nCondensed version in accordance with the german Commercial Code (hgB)\n\nin addition to reporting on the Daimler group, the development of Daimler Ag is also described in this section.\n\nDaimler Ag is the parent company of the Daimler group and its headquarters are in stuttgart.\n\nDaimler Ag acts as an operational and strategic management holding company and provides services to the companies of the group. As the parent company, it also decides on the group's strategy, decides on matters of major importance for business operations, and ensures regulatory, legal, and compliance functions throughout the group.\n\nthe annual financial statements of Daimler Ag are prepared in accordance with the german Commercial Code (hgB). the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the international Financial Reporting standards (iFRs), as adopted by the european union (eu). this results in some differences with regard to recognition and measurement, primarily in connection with provisions, financial instruments, the leasing business and deferred taxes.\n\nFor Daimler Ag as an operational and strategic management holding company, net profit or loss is the main performance indicator.\n\n## profitability\n\nthe profitability of Daimler Ag in the 2020 financial year was affected by significantly higher financial income and improved operating profit. \uf0e4 B.34\n\nDaimler Ag generated revenue of \u20ac1.7 billion primarily from the provision of services to companies of the group (2019: \u20ac2.0 billion). the decrease in revenue was the result of providing a lower volume of services to the companies of the group, due to short-time working and efficiency measures.\n\nCost of sales decreased to \u20ac1.6 billion (2019: \u20ac2.0 billion) and primarily comprises expenses incurred for the generation of revenue from services provided to companies of the group.\n\nGeneral administrative expenses amounted to \u20ac0.9 billion (2019: \u20ac1.0 billion), including expenses of \u20ac0.1 billion from ongoing programs for the optimization of personnel costs. the prior-year figure takes into consideration costs in connection with 'project Future' of \u20ac0.2 billion.\n\nOther operating income amounted to \u20ac0.3 billion (2019: expense of \u20ac0.3 billion) and primarily comprises income from the sale of patents in connection with combining the groupwide fuel-cell activities and relating to group-internal derivatives of the vehicle business.\n\nFinancial income increased by \u20ac3.4 billion to \u20ac2.9 billion, primarily due to higher income from investments in subsidiaries and associated companies. this was the result of a positive development with profit transfers from subsidiaries.\n\nthe income tax expense amounted to \u20ac0.1 billion (2019: \u20ac0.0 billion).\n\nNet profit amounts to \u20ac2.1 billion (2019: net loss of \u20ac1.7 billion) and is thus in line with the expectation stated in the outlook chapter of Annual Report 2019.\n\nthe economic situation of Daimler Ag in its function as a management holding company mainly depends on the development of its subsidiaries. Daimler Ag participates in the operating results of its subsidiaries through dividend distributions and profit-and-loss transfers. its economic situation therefore corresponds with that of the Daimler group, which is described in the chapter E /uni00A0overall Assessment of the economic situation.\n\n## B.34\n\n| Condensed income statement of Daimler AG   |        |        |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n| in millions of euros                       |        |        |\n| Revenue                                    | 1,685  | 2,019  |\n| Cost of sales                              | -1,641 | -1,959 |\n| general administrative expenses            | -928   | -964   |\n| other operating income/expense             | 280    | -272   |\n| Operating profit                           | -604   | -1,176 |\n| Financial income/expense                   | 2,878  | -546   |\n| income taxes                               | -141   | 44     |\n| Net profit/loss                            | 2,133  | -1,678 |\n| transfer to/from retained earnings         | -689   | 2,641  |\n| Distributable profit                       | 1,444  | 963    |",

Furthermore, lower tax-refund claims in particular led to a decrease in other assets of \u20ac0.6 billion.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased from \u20ac2.9 billion to \u20ac7.7 billion.\n\nGross liquidity - defined as cash and cash equivalents and other marketable securities recognized as current assets, as well as fixed-term deposits presented under other assets increased by \u20ac3.4 billion to \u20ac13.0 billion on the balance sheet date. the increase in gross liquidity is primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac4.8 billion. there was an opposing effect from a decrease of \u20ac1.3 billion in other securities held as current assets.\n\nCash provided by operating activities amounted to \u20ac2.6 billion in 2020 (2019: \u20ac6.8 billion). the decrease resulted in particular from lower dividend distributions from subsidiaries. there was an opposing, positive effect on cash provided by operating activities from the improved operating profit.\n\nCash flows from investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of \u20ac2.3 billion in 2020 (2019: outflow of \u20ac7.6 billion). Compared with the previous year, there were lower cash outflows in the area of financial assets from the corporate restructuring within the framework of 'project Future.' in addition, there was an effect in 2020 from a capital repayment by the subsidiary Daimler Nederland B.v. to Daimler Ag. there was a net cash inflow of \u20ac1.3 billion from acquisitions and disposals of securities held as current assets conducted in the context of liquidity management.\n\nCash flows from financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of \u20ac0.1 billion (2019: \u20ac2.6 billion). the change is explained on the one hand by a lower dividend payment to the Daimler shareholders. on the other hand, the change is due to the net positive development of receivables from and liabilities to subsidiaries from intra-group transactions in connection with central financial and liquidity management. the repayment of external financing liabilities resulted in a cash outflow in 2020, whereas proceeds from financing liabilities resulted in a cash inflow in the previous year.\n\n## B.35\n\n## Balance sheet structure of Daimler AG\n\n|                                                 | Dec. 31,  2020   | Dec. 31,  2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| in millions of euros                            |                  |                  |\n| Assets                                          |                  |                  |\n| Non-current assets                              | 56,161           | 57,214           |\n| Receivables, securities and other assets        | 28,471           | 38,925           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                       | 7,658            | 2,942            |\n| Current assets                                  | 36,129           | 41,867           |\n| Prepaid expenses                                | 341              | 285              |\n|                                                 | 92,631           | 99,366           |\n| Equity and liabilities                          |                  |                  |\n| share capital                                   | 3,070            | 3,070            |\n| (conditional capital \u20ac500 million)              |                  |                  |\n| Capital reserve                                 | 11,480           | 11,480           |\n| Retained earnings                               | 23,230           | 22,541           |\n| Distributable profit                            | 1,444            | 963              |\n| Equity                                          | 39,224           | 38,054           |\n| provisions for pensions and similar obligations | 193              | 94               |\n| other provisions                                | 1,550            | 1,511            |\n| Provisions                                      | 1,743            | 1,605            |\n| trade payables                                  | 140              | 227              |\n| other liabilities                               | 51,487           | 59,474           |\n| Liabilities                                     | 51,627           | 59,701           |\n| Deferred income                                 | 37               | 6                |\n|                                                 | 92,631           | 99,366           |\n\nEquity increased in 2020 by \u20ac1.2 billion to \u20ac39.2 billion, primarily as a result of the net profit for 2020, of which \u20ac0.7 billion was transferred to retained earnings pursuant to section 58 subsection 2 of the german stock Corporation Act (Aktg). the equity ratio at December 31, 2020 was 42.3% (December 31, 2019: 38.3%). Daimler Ag holds no treasury shares at December 31, 2020.\n\nProvisions increased compared with December 31, 2019 by \u20ac0.1 billion to \u20ac1.7 billion.\n\nLiabilities decreased by \u20ac8.1 billion to \u20ac51.6 billion. this was mainly because of the decrease of \u20ac3.5 billion in liabilities to subsidiaries, which mainly reflects lower losses transferred from subsidiaries. in addition, bonds and notes of \u20ac3.1 billion were redeemed and liabilities to banks of \u20ac1.5 billion were repaid.",

        "page_content": "## Risks and opportunities\n\nthe business development of Daimler Ag as the operational and strategic management holding company mainly depends on the development of its worldwide subsidiaries and is therefore - through the profit and loss contributions from subsidiaries and associated companies - fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Daimler group. Daimler Ag generally participates in the risks of its subsidiaries and associated companies in line with the percentage of its respective equity interest. the risks and opportunities are described in the Risk and opportunity Report. Risks may additionally arise from relations with subsidiaries and associated companies in connection with statutory or contractual obligations (in particular with regard to financing), as well as from the impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associated companies. Based on the criteria stated in the Risk and opportunity Report, the possible impact and probability of occurrence of the risks are assessed as medium.\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to section 133 subsections 1 and 3 of the german transformation Act (umwg), Daimler Ag is jointly and severally liable for liabilities of \u20ac14.3 billion that were transferred to mercedes-Benz Ag and Daimler truck Ag within the framework of 'project Future.' According to the current appraisal, due to the assessment of the creditworthiness of mercedes-Benz Ag and Daimler truck Ag, an actual cash outflow for Daimler Ag is considered to be unlikely.\n\n## outlook\n\nthe financial position, cash flows and profitability of Daimler Ag depend on the business development and performance of its operating subsidiaries, in whose development it participates through profit-and-loss-transfer agreements and dividend distributions.\n\nFor the year 2021, we expect Daimler Ag to post a significantly higher net profit than for the year 2020. in particular, we anticipate improved financial income resulting from higher dividend distributions and profit transfers from major subsidiaries. possible effects from the Daimler truck spin-off are not included in the outlook.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin addition, due to the interrelations between Daimler Ag and its subsidiaries, we refer to the statements in the chapter E /uni00A0outlook, which largely reflect our expectations also for the parent company.",

We therefore design the solutions we offer today to be central components of mobility systems that will be climate-neutral and sustainable tomorrow. together with players from industry, government and society we thus create value added for all of society while also laying the foundation for our future business success. this holistic strategic approach applies not only to our own products and manufacturing locations but also to our entire upstream and downstream value chain.\n\n## Our sustainable business strategy\n\nthe foundation for our approach here is provided by the sustainable business strategies of our divisions, which were adopted by the Board of management in 2019. since that time, our sustainability and business strategies have merged and there is no longer any distinction between them. this means that rather than being a supplement to our business strategies, sustainability issues are instead an integral component of them. Just as relevant as promising business targets are the ambitions, goals and measures that we are implementing so that Daimler can increase the positive impact it is having on society and the environment.\n\nAmong other things, we focused extensively on the 17 sustainable Development goals (sDgs) defined by the united Nations when we formulated our strategic goals, with special emphasis placed on sDgs 8, 9 and 11-13.\n\nWe also orient ourselves on international frameworks, the needs of our external and internal stakeholders and global trends. We used these points of reference to derive groupwide areas of action and to define areas of responsibility as well as business-specific targets, processes and measures.\n\nmore specifically, our strategic objectives involve the following six areas of action:\n\n- -   Climate protection and air quality: plans call for our new vehicle fleet to be Co 2 -neutral by 2039, when it should no longer have any relevant impact on air quality in inner cities.\n- -   Resource conservation: We want to decouple resource consumption from business volume growth.\n- -   livable cities: We are improving the quality of life in cities through our leading mobility and transport solutions.\n- -   traffic safety: We are working to make our vision of accident-free driving a reality as we develop automated driving systems while also taking social and ethical issues into account.\n- -   Data responsibility: our future will consist of sustainable, data-based business models. they will enable us to focus on our customers' needs and handle all data responsibly.\n- -   human rights: We have assumed responsibility for respecting and upholding human rights along our automotive value chain.\n\nWe work closely together with our partners in industry, government and society at large in order to achieve our objectives. We also rely on the dedication and commitment of our employees, who are helping to shape the transformation. We have defined three enablers, or principles, that are crucial for achieving success in the six areas of action: integrity, people and partnerships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmore detailed information on 'sustainability at Daimler' can also be found in the new Daimler sustainability Report for financial year 2020, which will be available on the group's website from the end of march 2021. w /uni00A0daimler.com/sustainability",

        "page_content": "## Materiality\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis in 2020 in order to determine which sustainability issues are particularly relevant for Daimler and its stakeholders. the analysis addressed both existing strategic areas of action and fundamentals, as well as further potential significant sustainability issues and trends. the analysis consisted of four components: a document analysis, a large-scale online stakeholder survey, interviews with experts and an sDg impact assessment.\n\nin a subsequent step, the sustainability issues that resulted from this analysis were assessed with regard to assets, financial position, profitability and business development in order to define the topics for this non-financial declaration.\n\n## Sustainable corporate governance\n\nin accordance with our sustainable business strategies, we are managing our activities in the six areas of action by means of an internal reporting process that uses detailed scorecards. our management and organizational structures support this process by means of clear lines of responsibility in all business divisions.\n\nthe group sustainability Board (gsB) is our central management body for all sustainability issues and reports to the Board of management. the gsB is headed by Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger (the Board of management member responsible for integrity and legal Affairs) and markus sch\u00e4fer (the Board of management member responsible for group Research; also mercedesBenz Cars Chief operating officer). Besides performing its other tasks, the gsB also monitors the progress made in the six areas of action defined in the sustainable business strategies. this progress is reported in the form of detailed scorecards that the gsB receives at least once a year. the operational work is done by the sustainability Competence office, which consists of representatives from the units managed by the two Co-chairs as well as additional representatives from Corporate strategy and Corporate Communications.\n\nWe also use the ten principles of the uN global Compact as a fundamental guide for our business operations. As a founding member and part of its leAD group, we are strongly committed to the uN global Compact. our internal principles and policies are founded on this international frame of reference and other international principles, including the Core labor standards of the international labour organization (ilo), the oeCD guidelines for multinational enterprises, and the uN guiding principles on Business and human Rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe short-term and medium-term components of the remuneration/uni00A0- the Daimler Company Bonus/uni00A0- have been further developed for the Board of management and level 1-3 managers, with effect as of January 1, 2020. these components are linked not only to financial targets but also to sustainability-related transformation targets and non-financial targets that focus on employees, customers, integrity and diversity. Further information can be found in the E /uni00A0Remuneration Report.\n\n## Sustainable investment\n\nthe volume of managed assets relating to investments made on the basis of sustainability criteria (esg criteria) has been increasing steadily over the last few years. this trend is also reflected by the increasing number of investors who have committed themselves to the uN principles for Responsible investment (pRi).\n\nour sustainable business strategies, with their 'Ambition 2039' component for mercedes-Benz Cars, for example, are the reason why Daimler is viewed as a sustainable investment object on the capital market. in 2020 we published a reference table for climate-related reporting for the first time. our approach here corresponds to the recommendations issued by the task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (tCFD). Further information can be found at our website. w /uni00A0daimler. com/documents/investors/presentations/daimler-ir-tcfden-20200307.pdf\n\nin 2020, we developed a group-wide green Finance Framework in order to more effectively position Daimler as a sustainable investment object and enable us to exploit the opportunities sustainable financing offers for corporate development. the green Finance Framework makes it possible for us to finance investment in sustainable technologies through bonds and loans, for example. on the basis of the green Finance Framework, Daimler issued a green bond with a volume of \u20ac1 billion at the beginning of september 2020. the framework is also based on the international Capital market Association's (iCmA) voluntary process guidelines/uni00A0- the green Bond principles. the green Finance Framework was presented in a virtual roadshow and has attracted a great deal of interest among investors. the framework has also received certification with the highest rating/uni00A0- 'Dark green'/uni00A0- from the Center for international Climate and environmental Research (CiCeRo).\n\n## Tax information\n\nDaimler views itself as a responsible company that endeavors to meet all global tax obligations while taking into account its corporate values and its social and ethical responsibility.\n\nWithin the framework of our corporate tax strategy, we especially pursue the following principles:\n\n- -   We ensure that group companies meet all of their tax obligations and integrity standards through the use of suitable measures such as efficient, high-quality and reliable expertise, processes, systems, methods and controls.\n- -   establishment of an active risk management system for the Daimler group and its relevant employees through the application of an adequate tax Compliance management system ( tax Cms).\n- -   in line with the principle of being a 'good corporate tax citizen', we conduct legal and proactive, but non-aggressive, tax planning activities on the basis of economic considerations ('tax follows business'). We also strive to work cooperatively, transparently and constructively with the tax authorities, whereby we maintain our legal standpoints and defend our interests wherever we believe such actions are appropriate and legitimate.",

For further information also see the chapter E /uni00A0integrity and Compliance.\n\nthe corporate tax department has established a tax Cms in order to ensure tax compliance. A tax Cms is a separate subunit of the Compliance management system. the tax Cms also operates an active tax-risk management system and monitors and checks the fulfillment of tax obligations. the goal of this consistent group-wide risk management system is to effectively identify and reduce tax risks at the Daimler group, and thus the associated personal risks that may be faced by the employees active in this area. this comprises numerous measures that include a tax risk review and the incorporation of tax risk issues into the internal control system (iCs) and the group-wide risk management process in line with our risk management policies. We did not become aware of any material violations of tax laws during the reporting year.\n\n## Risk and opportunity management\n\nRisk and opportunity management is a firm component of the group-wide planning, controlling and reporting process. it is designed to support the sustained achievement of corporate targets and to ensure risk awareness at the group. sustainability aspects are integrated into the group-wide risk management process at Daimler. they are understood as conditions, events or developments involving environmental, social or governance factors (esg), the occurrence of which may have an actual or potential impact on the Daimler group's profitability, cash flows and financial position, as well as on its reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nesg-related risks and opportunities in accordance with the CsR Directive implementation Act (CsR-Rug) can be found in the respective categories of the Risk and opportunity Report according to their cause. in addition, legal risks or social violations by partners and suppliers can have a negative influence on the reputation of the Daimler group, on the environment and on the employees of partner companies and suppliers.  As one of the basic principles of corporate activity, Daimler therefore pays particular attention to compliance with legal and ethical rules - also when selecting partners and suppliers. Further information can be found in the E /uni00A0Risk and opportunity Report.\n\n## Sustainability in the supply chain\n\ninvestors and analysts/uni00A0- and governments and societies as well/uni00A0- are increasingly calling on the automotive industry to ensure greater sustainability throughout the entire supply chain. Daimler is convinced that companies that want to be sustainable must also focus on their supply chain. that's because we procure raw materials indirectly, and components and services directly, from all over the world. our goal is to combine achieving business success with acting responsibly toward the environment, people and society/uni00A0- and doing so along the entire value chain. We correspondingly expect our direct suppliers to display the same sense of responsibility by complying with environmental and social standards.\n\nour vehicles generally contain several thousand parts and components, and our supply chain is therefore complex. it comprises around 60,000 direct suppliers for production and non-production materials, with most of them based in europe, North America and Asia. these suppliers in turn have sub-suppliers, and sometimes a supply chain can contain up to seven or eight sub-levels, with additional sub-suppliers on each level. With every innovation and every market development, the supply chain dynamically develops further/uni00A0- and this also occurred during the reporting period.\n\nWe use a variety of measures and concepts in order to ensure the sustainable management of our supply chain. these include supplier screenings, audits, risk-based due diligence analyses, qualification modules for production material suppliers and workshops with selected service providers. our goal here is to ensure compliance with social standards and environmental regulations on the one hand and greater transparency in the supply chain on the other.\n\nour three procurement units/uni00A0- mercedes-Benz Cars procurement and supplier Quality, global procurement trucks and Buses, and international procurement services/uni00A0- work together to ensure responsible procurement of materials and services.\n\nthe Daimler supplier sustainability standards serve as the guideline for our sustainable supply chain management system. the supplier sustainability standards define our requirements for working conditions, respecting and upholding human rights, environmental protection, safety, business ethics and compliance. We demand that our direct suppliers recognize these sustainability standards and communicate them to their employees and to their upstream value chains. We also expect them to check that the standards are complied with. w /uni00A0supplier-portal.daimler.com/docs/DoC-1458",

        "page_content": "During the year under review, we tightened our sustainability requirements for suppliers even further and revised our contractual terms accordingly. For example, we now require our direct suppliers to establish processes that ensure the fulfillment of human rights due diligence obligations in accordance with the provisions of the uN guiding principles on Business and human Rights and the relevant oeCD guidelines and principles. We also reserve the right to examine and audit these processes. in addition, suppliers are required to inform us of any human rights risks and countermeasures identified. they must also disclose to us upon request any risk hotspots that exist along their supply chain. We have also revised our contractual terms with regard to our specific environmental requirements. For example, direct suppliers that provide production materials to the mercedes-Benz Cars and vans division must now disclose certain environmental figures/uni00A0- including their Co 2 emissions, energy and water consumption, and the amount of waste they produce, for example.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin 2020 a total of 658 on-site inspections were conducted at suppliers of production materials. By way of exception, virtual audits were also made, due to the covid-19 pandemic. For further information also see the chapter E /uni00A0integrity and Compliance.\n\nin addition, we examine our existing direct suppliers within the framework of risk analyses conducted on a regular basis. Among other things, we conduct annual database research to identify any violations of our sustainability and compliance rules. this is part of our supplier screening process.\n\nour complaint management process enables individuals to draw attention to possible human rights violations at suppliers. in this context, we work together closely with the World employee Committee. We also investigate specific cases that Ngos bring to our attention.\n\nWe systematically follow up on all reports of violations and suspected violations in the supply chain. in cases where we identify a need to take action, we implement the necessary measures. if we become aware of a suspected violation, we first bring together all the available information and ask the suppliers to respond to the allegations. We then assess the facts of each case and take any necessary measures. this may mean that we will work with the supplier in question to solve the problem. however, it may also mean that we will terminate the business relationship with that supplier.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the year under review, our on-site inspections at direct suppliers to mercedes-Benz Cars & vans, Daimler trucks & Buses and our international procurement services unit uncovered no specific suspected cases of child labor or forced labor, nor were there any indications of violations against the right to collective bargaining or freedom of association. see the chapter E /uni00A0integrity and Compliance.\n\nsince 2018, we have been cooperating with the 'Drive sustainability' initiative on the implementation of measures to make suppliers in various focus countries such as india and Argentina more aware of the importance of sustainability, and we also provide such suppliers with helpful information on this issue. We select the focus countries jointly with the initiative. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic, no physical training modules took place in 2020. instead, we developed a concept for a new e-learning program.\n\nin the area of services, we implement additional measures to raise awareness of human rights issues in particular. For example, a cross-functional team from our procurement units meets with suppliers in good practice sharing Workshops, which have also been held online since the spring of 2020. the workshops promote an open and constructive exchange of ideas and experiences among the participants, and they also provide information on what we expect from our business partners. w /uni00A0For further information on supplier management, see the Daimler sustainability Report, which will be published at the end of march 2021.",

We are taking deliberate measures to counteract this trend and have made climate protection a core element of our business strategy.\n\nFor us, the paris Agreement represents more than just an obligation, as our commitment to its targets stems from our fundamental convictions. We therefore believe that it is our mission to develop technical innovations that will lead to Co 2 -neutral mobility around the world.\n\nour goal for mercedes-Benz Cars & vans is to make our entire new car fleet Co 2 -neutral by 2039. We plan to achieve this goal using a holistic approach that includes ambitious targets for all stages of automotive value creation/uni00A0- from the supply chain to production, the vehicle use phase, and vehicle disposal and recycling. We plan to offer our customers several electric variants in all mercedes-Benz car segments (from the smart to large suvs) by 2022 and to have plug-in hybrids or all-electric vehicles account for more than 50% of our car sales by 2030. By 2030, we also plan to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the new vehicle fleet during the vehicle use phase ('well-towheel') by more than 40% as compared to 2018. this target has been confirmed by the science Based targets initiative.\n\nWe have set ourselves the goal of making our fleet of new commercial vans in europe, Japan and North America  Co 2 -neutral by 2039. this relates to Co 2 emissions in driving operation ('tank-to-wheel').\n\nthe ultimate goal at Daimler trucks & Buses is to achieve Co\u2082neutral transport on the road by 2050. As early as 2022, we want our vehicle portfolio to additionally include series-produced vehicles with battery-electric drive systems in the main sales regions europe, the united states and Japan. in the second half of the decade, we plan to augment our vehicle portfolio with series-produced fuel cell vehicles that run on hydrogen. As it will take about ten years to completely renew a fleet by 2050, another of our goals is to only offer new vehicles that are Co 2 -neutral in driving operation ('tank-to-wheel') in europe, Japan and North America by 2039. Daimler's management is responsible for setting strategic goals, including targets for reducing our Co 2 emissions, and for monitoring the progress made in achieving these goals.\n\nWe are developing all-electric and electrified model variants for all of our vehicle models/uni00A0- from cars and vans to trucks and buses. our development focus is battery-electric mobility for cars and all-electric drive systems with batteries or fuel cells for trucks and buses. the product steering Board (psB) is responsible for monitoring the development of the Co\u2082 emissions of the car fleet in markets in which such emissions are regulated. it is also responsible for providing forecasts. in its evaluations, the psB takes into account the increasing degree of vehicle electrification and the changes that have been made to legal requirements, for example those related to the introduction of the new Wltp (Worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure). the Board of management then decides which measures need to be implemented. on the market side of the equation, price and volume control measures can also affect our ability to achieve our targets over the short term. For\n\nthis reason, such measures are discussed with the Board of management within the framework of its regular reporting on the current state of Co 2 fleet compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the reporting year, the average Co 2 emissions of our total passenger car fleet in europe (european union, united Kingdom, Norway and iceland) decreased to an estimated 104 g/km as measured on the basis of legal regulations (NeDC, including vans that are registered as passenger cars). this means that we achieved the Co 2 targets in europe (european union, united Kingdom, Norway and iceland) in 2020. Whereas the Co 2 fleet targets were determined on the basis of the NeDC in 2020, they will be based on the Wltp values in 2021, in accordance with the regulatory requirements. this will lead to an adjustment of the fuel consumption targets and an increase of the certification values. Due to their greater relevance, we have for the first time defined the Co 2 emissions of our total passenger new car fleet in europe as 'the most important' non-financial performance indicator in the reporting year 2020. For more information on how we expect the Co 2 emissions of our car fleet in europe to develop, see the chapter E /uni00A0outlook.\n\nin the united states, fleet values are regulated by two co-regulating standards for limiting greenhouse gases and fuel consumption in vehicle fleets: the greenhouse gas standard (ghg) and the Corporate Average Fuel economy (CAFe) standards. the ghg fleet figures for the Co 2 emissions of Daimler vehicles in the united states have improved over the last few years. For the 2020 model year, these figures are 256 g Co 2 / mi for the passenger car fleet and 289 g Co 2 /mi for light trucks (on the basis of the most recent forecast). Nevertheless, we were unable to achieve our average fleet targets of 196 g Co 2 /mi for the car fleet and 265 g Co 2 /mi for light trucks. however, we were able to close the remaining gap by taking advantage of the flexibility measures specified in the legislation (including the purchase of external credits).\n\nin China, domestic and imported cars are reported separately and according to fleet consumption values, unlike in europe and the united states. this means the figures for the imported fleet are the relevant figures for our wholly owned subsidiary mercedes-Benz China (mBCl). the target was 6.27 l/100 km; the figure that was actually achieved was 8.02 l/100 km (preliminary fleet consumption value/uni00A0- the final fleet consumption value might be better if off-cycle technologies are included). We will purchase external credits at short notice in order to close consumption gaps in the fleet's achievement of the target. We aim to achieve our emission targets in China in the medium term with our joint venture partner Beijing Benz Automotive (BBAC) by expanding our range of all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.\n\nthe eu has stipulated a 15 percent reduction of the Co 2 emissions of new heavy-duty trucks (>16 t) by 2025 and a 30 percent reduction by 2030 (as compared to 2019/2020). to this end, the european Commission worked with automakers, scientists and other experts to develop a standardized simulation program known as veCto (vehicle energy Consumption Calculation tool) for all of europe. veCto also includes associated procedures for testing and measuring Co\u2082 emissions and fuel consumption. Data will be collected from all over europe and will be made transparent. We have defined a clear technology roadmap to enable us to meet the eu's requirements.",

From the Board of management to our training and qualification units and the trainers at the plant level, we pursue the goal of safeguarding our competitiveness throughout the company.\n\nour group's digital transformation is changing the requirements profiles of many jobs and making it necessary for staff in many positions to gain new expertise. We are addressing this issue by expanding the range of professions in which we offer training, increasing the number of programs offered by our dual study programs, and recruiting young talent with extensive digital expertise.\n\nDuring the year under review, for example, we offered dual work-study programs and commercial and technical training programs in germany for more than 30 different professions. We continuously update the programs in order to take into account future requirements and technological innovations in each profession.\n\nWe support change processes such as the company's digital transformation by offering suitable qualification measures for the entire workforce. in 2020 the focus was on it skills and professions, high-voltage and battery technology, and the development and offer of digital learning formats. Among other things, we implemented a global digitalization qualification campaign for our it specialists in 2019 and 2020. in addition, we prepared the Digital Readiness program that will be used to launch a comprehensive range of digital professional training measures worldwide beginning in January 2021. Among other things, the Digital Readiness program covers methodological, technical and cultural aspects of digitalization.\n\n## Diversity and equal opportunity\n\nour workforce is as diverse as our customers, and Daimler is convinced that diversity makes us more successful as a company. that's because diversity helps us to find new viewpoints and acts as a driving force behind creative ideas and innovations. We promote a working environment in which all of our employees can develop and make full use of their talent/uni00A0regardless of their age, gender, sexual orientation or any other characteristic that relates to diversity. We therefore need to be tolerant of one another and remain open-minded, which means there is no place for discrimination in the workplace.\n\nWe expect all of our employees to treat each other in a respectful, open and fair manner. managers serve as role models here and thus have a special responsibility for ensuring a corporate culture marked by fairness.\n\nthe integrity and Diversity units at Daimler design the framework and processes for such a culture. the global Diversity office is a corporate function that is part of the group human Resources organization. this office defines strategic targets and areas of action in cooperation with the business units and initiates group-wide projects, training programs and measures to increase awareness of the importance of diversity. For example, Daimler Diversity Day was once again held in 2020. Activities were held at various locations worldwide in line with the motto 'link perspectives/uni00A0- bring the mix alive.' As a result of the covid-19 pandemic, many locations primarily focused on digital communication offers such as virtual workshops and discussion rounds.\n\nour goal is to attract the most highly qualified specialists and managers to our company and support their professional development, regardless of their age, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and identity, and any physical limitations they may have.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe Daimler Ag supervisory Board is legally required to have a gender ratio of at least 30% women. the supervisory Board fulfills this requirement as a whole and also in terms of the side of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders and the side representing the employees. At the end of 2020, 25% of the members of the Board of management were women. this means we exceeded the target of 12.5% for the proportion of women on the Board of management that the supervisory Board defined and whose deadline for achievement was December 2020. As early as 2006, we had agreed to increase the share of women in management positions, and we regularly check to see how we are progressing with regard to our goals. Additional information about the targets and results can be found in the chapter E /uni00A0Corporate governance.\n\n## Occupational health and safety\n\nensuring the health and safety of our employees is a very high priority at Daimler. For example, we design our workplaces in line with ergonomic criteria and offer health maintenance programs and occupational safety training. in everything we do, we focus on the health and safety of our employees. our overarching goal is to prevent health risks and maintain the health of all Daimler employees over the long term.",

        "page_content": "the current covid-19 pandemic isn't the only reason why it's so important to have a sustainable health and occupational safety management system in place, as the demographic transformation and advances in technology are also leading to new challenges. As a responsible employer, we seek to ensure that our employees can work in a safe and healthy environment. We utilize a holistic health and occupational safety management system in order to prevent work accidents and work-related illnesses. the focus here is mainly on preventive measures that we continuously review and develop further.\n\nour occupational safety strategy sets high standards for the design of workplaces and work processes. moreover, we are systematically striving to reduce occupational and healthrelated risks. the Daimler group operates on the basis of globally uniform guidelines for risk prevention. our occupational health and safety policy and our occupational health and safety guidelines serve as overarching, internationally valid group regulations. they are based on international standards and national laws and emphasize the managers' obligation to act responsibly. however, they also underscore the employees' own responsibility. We use internal due diligence audits to generally check every five years whether safety standards are met at our production locations. the audits didn't take place during the reporting year, due to the covid-19 pandemic. various locations have their occupational safety and health management systems certified independently by external certification agencies in accordance with the iso 45001 (formerly ohsAs 18001) standard in addition to the safety due diligence audits. Approximately 40% of our employees at production locations (about 100,000 employees) work with an occupational safety management system certified according to iso 45001/ohsAs 18001.\n\nsince 2019 Daimler has also been committed to achieving vision Zero. this global campaign aims to prevent job-related accidents and illnesses while also promoting employees' health, safety and well-being. in the reporting year 2020 we introduced a global accident documentation system, for example. this system includes an integrated international digital reporting process that enables the rapid documentation of all covid-19 cases among the employees and thus the rapid follow-up of possible contacts by the plant medical service. We also derive standardized accident statistics from our production sites while taking all applicable data protection regulations into account. these statistics are regularly reported.\n\noccupational health and safety issues throughout the group are managed by the health & safety unit, which is part of human Resources and under the direction of the Chief group physician of Daimler Ag, mercedes-Benz Ag and Daimler truck Ag. All key occupational health and safety issues are discussed on a regular basis with works council representatives and management representatives at all levels of the company. All decisions resulting from such discussions are made jointly.\n\n## The covid-19 pandemic\n\nthis Annual Report is being released at a time when people around the world continue to struggle with the covid-19 pandemic. During the reporting year, we at the Daimler group implemented numerous measures to slow the spread of the virus and protect our employees.\n\nin a first step, the Daimler group had decided to suspend the majority of its production in europe, as well as work in selected administrative departments, for an initial period of two weeks (23th of march until April 3rd, 2020). As the covid-19 pandemic worsened, short-time work was then introduced in germany on April 6. the group took this step in response to the wide-ranging effects of the coronavirus and the increasingly negative impact the pandemic was having on the economy and society.\n\nWe also developed new workplace rules that include preventive hygiene and safety measures for production units and offices, company restaurants, and areas in which staff need to meet with customers. Business travel that was not absolutely necessary was also reduced to a minimum until the end of 2020. We expanded our it infrastructure in order to enable mobile working and ensure the technical functioning of digital formats such as conference calls and video conferences. even a/fter most short-time work arrangements ended at the beginning of July, we encouraged our employees to keep working from home if at all possible, and we continue to recommend that they do so. We have also implemented new shi/ft concepts for departments and units where a physical presence in the office remains necessary.\n\nthe global covid-19 pandemic presented companies and employees with many challenges last year, and it continues to do so. With this in mind, the Board of management, in consultation with the general Works Council, decided to issue a special one-time 'coronavirus bonus' to non-exempt employees and team leaders of Daimler Ag, mercedes-Benz Ag, Daimler truck Ag, the Daimler mobility division, and all subsidiaries in germany. this special payment is meant to mitigate financial and personal hardship and honor the great dedication and flexibility displayed by the workforce during the crisis. in some cases an appreciation bonus was paid to employees outside germany.",

We therefore regularly share information with our stakeholders and communicate our interests in an open and fair dialog with governments and political representatives.\n\nhuman beings can only overcome the major social and environmental challenges we face, such as climate change and increasing urbanization, by working together. We at Daimler strive to achieve such cooperation by contributing our expertise to the social dialog and by working together with others to create solutions. We are guided by the vision of utilizing exemplary formats for political dialog that allow us to establish ourselves as a leading corporate citizen in the automotive industry. the overarching goal of our approach is to harmonize the company's interests with the interests of society at large. the specific aim of our discussions with political decision-makers is to achieve greater planning security for Daimler.\n\nDaimler has defined its own principles for political dialog and the responsible communication of our interests. Among other things, we maintain political restraint, balance and neutrality in our dealings with political parties, members of parliament and government officials. our central coordinating body for political dialog at the national and international levels is the external Affairs and public policy unit.\n\nWe use various instruments to ensure that our political lobbying is carried out in accordance with applicable regulations and ethical standards. in our work as a member of sector associations and in our cooperation with other companies, we pay particular attention to antitrust regulations. We have also defined internally binding requirements that are laid down in various documents including a worldwide policy and the group's integrity Code. in addition, our policy for 'lobbying and political Donations' governs grants, donations to political parties, and the use of other instruments for representing our interests in the political realm. our employees can find these policies in the policy database on the intranet. Daimler is also listed in the transparency register of the european union and accepts the register's Code of Conduct.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe policies mentioned above also define how we intend to address risks in connection with the political representation of our interests. these risks are also addressed through firmly established group-wide compliance processes. Complaints and information relating to our lobbying activities can be addressed to our whistleblower system Bpo (Business practices office) see the chapter E /uni00A0integrity and Compliance.\n\nin accordance with the legal requirements and our in-house policies, we also regularly conduct training courses. We train not only employees at Daimler group companies but also other employees at Daimler Ag who represent our interests and who are not organizationally under the direction of the external Affairs unit.\n\n## Incorporation of stakeholders\n\nWe consider it important to engage in a continuous dialog with all of our interest groups. this allows us to consider various perspectives on our involvement with sustainability issues, identify and address new trends, and share experiences. We also want to engage in constructive discussions of controversial themes at a very early stage. We always focus on conducting a dialog that is fruitful and productive for all parties involved. our primary stakeholders are our customers, investors, employees and suppliers. however, we also communicate regularly with civil groups such as Ngos, as well as associations, trade unions, the media, analysts, municipalities, residents in the communities where we operate, and representatives of science and government.\n\nWe utilize various instruments to engage in a dialog with our relevant stakeholders. on the one hand, we use our own dialog formats, which include the Daimler sustainability Dialogue and the virtual mobility lab dialog series. We also conduct stakeholder surveys, specialist conferences and thematic dialog sessions that can also take the form of workshops or are held by our Advisory Board for integrity and Corporate Responsibility. on the other hand, we keep ourselves up to date on the latest discussions and the associated expectations by participating in industry-specific and cross-industry networks and initiatives. We also evaluate studies and other scientific publications and conduct our own media analyses. these measures help us to identify developments and the associated expectations in areas beyond the dialog events we have initiated.\n\n## Dialog at the Group level\n\none essential tool of the dialog with our stakeholders is the Daimler sustainability Dialogue, which has been held annually in stuttgart since 2008 and brings various stakeholder groups together with members of the Daimler Board of management and executive management. the participants attend a range of workshops, where they discuss issues related to sustainability and work together to further develop their approaches. our personnel responsible for specific themes take up the impulses generated by the participants and work together with the stakeholders to incorporate these ideas into their work. they then report at the event in the following year on the progress made in the interim. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, we held our Daimler sustainability Dialogue via a digital meeting platform for the first time in 2020. more than 200 external and Daimler participants split up into working groups to discuss themes such as human rights, environmental protection, livable cities and the topic of 'employees and integrity.'

For this reason, we organize Daimler sustainability Dialogue events in other countries and regions as well. During the reporting year, more than 300 stakeholders attended the eighth Daimler sustainability Dialogue in China, which was virtual for the first time as well. At the event, they discussed topics such as green manufacturing, urban mobility and social responsibility.\n\nin 2020, we established the Daimler mobility lab (Dml) in Berlin. this is a new platform for a public dialog with citizens, government, business and industry, and Ngos. At the Dml, we discussed current issues with stakeholders and worked with them to find answers to social and environmental questions. the focus was on sustainability, electric mobility, digitalization and urbanization, and the impact these issues have on society. various formats were utilized at different locations in Berlin. these included an internal series of talks on the topic of 'transformation in the New Normal,' as well as panel discussions on 'the Future of urban mobility in the New Normal.'\n\nthe Advisory Board for integrity and Corporate Responsibility has been an important source of input for sustainability activities at Daimler since 2012. the board's members/uni00A0- independent external experts from the fields of science and business, as well as from civic organizations/uni00A0- offer us constructive criticism in questions related to integrity and corporate responsibility at Daimler. the board meets at regular intervals and also holds discussions with members of the Board of management and responsible personnel from the specialist units. During the year under review, the Advisory Board also held a joint meeting with representatives from the supervisory Board. the Advisory Board's members have extensive experience and possess diverse specialized knowledge regarding environmental and social policy, various human rights and ethical issues, and the development of transport, traffic and mobility. During the reporting year, the Advisory Board focused in particular on the transformation of the automotive industry, the further development of Daimler's sustainable business strategies and the handling of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDaimler also maintains regular contact with representatives from civic organizations and other companies. in addition to the dialogs we initiate, we also participate in various associations, committees and sustainability initiatives. some of the\n\nmost important initiatives here are the uN global Compact, econsense/uni00A0- german Business Forum for sustainable Development, and the World Business Council for sustainable Development. Further information on our memberships in various organizations can be found here: w /uni00A0sustainabilityreport.daimler. com/2019/servicepages/downloads/files/daimler\\_2019\\_ memberships.pdf\n\n## Political dialog and representation of interests\n\nthe specific aim of our discussions with political decision-makers is to achieve greater planning security for Daimler. During the reporting year, we focused on the following issues in particular:\n\n- -   Achieving climate targets and improving air quality\n- -   making cities more livable places\n- -   improving traffic safety\n- -   establishing standards for human rights due diligence\n- -   Creating transparency with regard to sustainable financing\n- -   solving location-specific issues through discussions\n- -   promoting free and fair trade\n- -   modernizing labor laws\n\nDaimler did not make any financial or non-financial contributions to political parties during the reporting year. this decision was not based on current political or economic events.\n\n## Traffic safety\n\nAccident-free driving/uni00A0- this vision drives us and is a firm component of our sustainable business strategies. our innovative driving assistance systems already offer drivers and passengers a high level of safety and comfort today. these systems can help drivers avoid or safely manage critical situations on the road in order to protect vehicle occupants and other road users. system warnings and active brake applications are now increasingly mitigating the consequences of accidents or even preventing them altogether.\n\n- -   stakeholder consultation in topic-related working groups\n- -   Advisory Board for integrity and Corporate Responsibility\n- -   peer review within the framework of sustainability initiatives such as the uN global Compact",

We are aiming to:\n\n- -   Further improve our accident-prevention systems/uni00A0- for example with Active Brake Assist.\n- -   make our vehicles even safer for vehicle occupants both during and a/fter an accident/uni00A0- for example with appropriate vehicle structures, effective restraint systems, and systems that can engage a/fter an accident.\n- -   make our vehicles safer for others/uni00A0- for example with pedestrian recognition systems and systems that protect other road users.\n- -   increase traffic safety in general/uni00A0- for example through CsR safety initiatives such as sAFe RoADs and mobile Kids.\n- -   Contribute to ensuring safety for all road users by sharing data/uni00A0- for example within the framework of the pilot project in the Zollernalb district in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\nWe utilize our holistic 'integral safety' concept in our vehicle development activities. We first used this concept in the late 1990s to describe how we had divided the utilization of safety systems into four phases: 'Driving safely,' 'Dangerous situations,' 'in the event of an Accident' and 'A/fter an Accident.'\n\nour safety measures establish a bridge between active and passive safety within these four phases/uni00A0- i.e. between accident prevention (phases 1 and 2) and protection when an accident occurs (phases 3 and 4).\n\nthe models from mercedes-Benz Cars repeatedly earn top marks in safety tests conducted by independent institutes. of particular note in this regard are the marks mercedes-Benz regularly receives from the American insurance institute for highway safety (iihs). the iihs rating assesses crash safety and accident-prevention and lighting systems. the mercedesBenz C-Class and the gle received the iihs '2020 top sAFety piCK+' award for the 2020 model year.\n\nDuring the reporting year, the european New Car Assessment programme (euro NCAp) issued ratings for driving assistance systems in a comparison of various vehicle models for the first time. the current gle with its driver assistance package received a rating of 'very good.' this means that the experts at euro NCAp believe that among the vehicles in the competitive field the gle offers the system that displays the greatest balance as well as a very high degree of effectiveness.\n\nour expenditure of \u20ac 8.6 billion on research and development includes, among other things, R&D expenditure for our safety measures and concepts.\n\n## integrity and compliance\n\nWe are convinced that companies stay successful in the long term only if their actions are ethical and legally responsible. that is especially the case during times of turmoil and transformation such as those we are experiencing today. that's why integrity and compliance are top priorities at Daimler.\n\n## Integrity management\n\nthe automotive industry is in a state of radical change. New fields of business are developing, and they are requiring companies to reorient themselves. meanwhile, new technologies are raising new questions/uni00A0- ethical as well as legal ones. moreover, the covid-19 pandemic has led to profound transformations all over the world. in such times of change and uncertainty, value-based action matters more than ever.\n\nWe are always striving to be the best. our goals are to develop progressive technologies, build outstanding vehicles and offer smart mobility solutions. this commitment to excellence also applies to the way we deal with one another, with our customers and with our business partners. We also want to live up to our social responsibilities in ways that set benchmarks.\n\nthat's why integrity is a central element of our corporate culture. For us, this involves more than just obeying laws. We also align our actions with a shared system of values, which include fairness, responsibility, respect, openness and transparency as key elements.\n\n## How we make integrity part of our daily business activities\n\nintegrity, compliance and legal affairs are combined in a single executive division at Daimler. the integrity and legal Affairs division supports all of our corporate units in their efforts to embed these topics in our daily business activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour group-wide integrity Code is our shared standard of values and defines the guidelines for acting with integrity. it is binding on all employees of Daimler Ag and our controlled group companies. employees from a variety of corporate units all over the world have helped to formulate the integrity Code. it is available in ten languages and includes, among other things, regulations concerning anti-corruption measures, data management, product safety and compliance with technical regulations. We most recently updated our integrity Code in 2019. our employees can find all the important information related to the integrity Code/uni00A0- such as FAQs, points of contact and contact persons/uni00A0- on the intranet.

Reports can also be submitted anonymously if local laws permit this. in germany, whistleblower reports can also be submitted to an external neutral intermediary in addition to the Bpo. the information provided to the whistleblower system Bpo enables us to learn about potential risks to the company and its employees and thus to prevent damage to the company and its reputation. A globally valid corporate policy defines Bpo procedures and the corresponding responsibilities. this policy aims to ensure a fair and transparent process that takes into account the principle of proportionality for the affected parties, while also giving protection to whistleblowers. it also defines a standard for evaluating incidents of misconduct and making decisions about their consequences. if the initial assessment of an incident categorizes it as a low-risk rule violation, the Bpo hands the case over to the responsible unit/uni00A0- for example, the hR department, Corporate security or group Data protection. the\n\nrespective unit investigates the incident and deals with the case on its own authority. examples of low-risk rule violations include the/ft, breach of trust, and undue enrichment valued at less than \u20ac100,000/uni00A0- if the violation does not fall into the category of corruption.\n\nif the Bpo's risk-based initial assessment categorizes an incident as a high-risk rule violation, the Bpo hands the case over to an investigation unit. the Bpo provides support for the subsequent investigation until the case is closed. examples of high-risk rule violations include offenses related to corruption, breaches of antitrust law and violations of anti-money laundering regulations, as well as infringements of binding technical provisions or environmental protection regulations. in an effort to constantly increase trust in our whistleblower system and make it even better known to our employees, we use a variety of communication measures. For example, we provide informational materials such as country-specific information cards, pocket guides and an instructional video. We also regularly inform employees about the type and number of reported violations and make case studies available on a quarterly basis.\n\nA total of 53 new cases were opened in 2020. overall, 42 cases, in which 66 individuals were involved, were closed 'with merit.' in these cases, the initial suspicion was confirmed. of these cases, six were in the category 'Corruption,' two were in the category 'technical Compliance' and eight were in the category 'Reputational Damage.' in 11 cases, accusations of inappropriate behavior of employees toward third parties were confirmed. seven cases were categorized as 'Damage over 100,000 \u20ac' the remaining cases fell into other categories. With regard to those cases that are closed 'with merit,' the company decides on appropriate response measures in line with the principles of proportionality and fairness. the personnel measures taken in the reporting year 2020 included (written) warnings, separation agreements and (extraordinary) terminations.\n\n## Compliance on the part of our business partners\n\nWe expect not only our employees to comply with laws and regulations. We also require our sales partners and suppliers to adhere to clear compliance requirements, because we regard integrity and conformity with regulations as a precondition for trusting cooperation. in the selection of our direct sales partners and in our existing sales partnerships, we therefore ensure that our partners comply with laws and regulations and observe ethical principles. in financial year 2020, we refined and made full use of our globally standardized process for the effective and efficient assessment of all new sales partners and the step-by-step re-evaluation of our existing sales partners (sales Business partner Due Diligence process). our continuous monitoring in this area is designed to ensure that we can identify possible integrity violations by our sales partners. We also reserve the right to terminate cooperation with, or terminate the selection process for, any sales partner who fails to comply with our standards. in addition, we work with our procurement units to continuously improve our processes for selecting and cooperating with suppliers.",

        "page_content": "our global Daimler sustainability standards apply in this area. on the basis of these standards and our integrity Code, we make available to each of our suppliers and sales partners a specific Compliance Awareness module developed with their activities in mind. this module is intended to sensitize them to current integrity and compliance requirements such as those related to anti-corruption measures and technical Compliance. through these measures we also offer our business partners assistance for dealing with possible compliance risks.\n\n## Communication and training\n\nWe offer extensive compliance training courses that are based on our integrity Code/uni00A0- for example, courses for employees in administrative units and in the compliance and legal affairs departments as well as for members of the supervisory Board and the executive management. the contents and topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of the respective target group. We regularly analyze the need for our training program, expand or adapt it as necessary and conduct evaluations.\n\n## Monitoring and improvements\n\nWe monitor the processes and measures of our Cms annually and conduct analyses to find out whether our measures are appropriate and effective. For these activities, we rely on information about the group companies as well as additional locally gathered information. We also monitor our processes regularly on the basis of key performance indicators such as the duration and quality of individual processes. to determine these indicators, we check, among other things, whether formal requirements are being met and whether the content is complete. We also take into account the knowledge gained through internal as well as independent external assessments.\n\nif changed risks or new legal requirements call for adjustments, we adapt our Cms accordingly. the group companies implement the respective improvement measures on their own authority. they also regularly monitor these measures to determine their effectiveness and continually inform the responsible management committees about the results of their monitoring process.\n\n## Anti-corruption compliance\n\nDaimler has committed itself to fighting corruption/uni00A0- because corruption is harmful to fair competition, society and our group. our anti-corruption measures extend beyond compliance with national laws. We also adhere to the rules of the oeCD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign public officials in international Business transactions (1997) and the united Nations Convention against Corruption (2003). our anti-corruption compliance program is based on our groupwide Cms. the Cms Anti-corruption was audited in accordance with the 980 standard of the institute of public Auditors in germany by Kpmg Ag Wirtscha/ftsprufungsgesellscha/ft. this audit, which was based on the principles of appropriateness, implementation and effectiveness was successfully completed at the end of 2019.\n\n## Antitrust compliance\n\nin order to ensure an independent external assessment of our Antitrust Compliance program, Kpmg Ag Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft audited the Compliance management system for antitrust law in accordance with the 980 standard of the institute of public Auditors in germany. this audit for antitrust law, which was based on the principles of appropriateness, implementation, and effectiveness, was successfully completed at the end of 2016. this program is oriented to national and international standards as well as the regulations and the constant evolution of legal practice for ensuring fair competition. the program establishes a binding, globally valid Daimler standard that defines how matters of antitrust law are to be assessed and how compliance with all of the local and international antitrust laws in force can be ensured. By means of a variety of communication and training measures, a central advisory hotline, guidelines and practical support as well as local legal advisors, we help our employees around the world to recognize situations that might be critical from an antitrust perspective and to act in compliance with all regulations. the results of our annual compliance risk analysis serve as the basis for the formulation of measures that address antitrust risks. in addition to monitoring the management activities that fall within the framework of group management duties, the legal department conducts corporate audit monitoring measures in order to assess and safeguard the implementation of each respective measure. the assessments make it possible to continuously improve our Antitrust Compliance program.\n\n## Technical Compliance\n\nFor us, technical Compliance means adhering to technical and regulatory requirements, standards and laws. in doing so, we take into account the fundamental spirit of these laws and regulations and we adhere to internal development requirements and processes. our objective is to identify risks within the product creation process (product development and certification) at an early stage and to implement preventive measures. For this purpose we have established a technical Compliance management system (tCms) in our automotive divisions. its objective is to safeguard compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements throughout the entire product development and certification process. the tCms defines values, principles, structures and processes in order to provide our employees with guidance and orientation especially with regard to challenging questions on how to interpret technical regulations. measures such as the integrity Code, supportive points of contact and the 'speak up' and 'Judgement Calls' commitment statements that have been specially defined for the development units offer support in this area. the commitment statements provide employees with a basis for a common understanding of responsible behavior in the product creation process.\n\nin order to ensure an independent external assessment of our tCms, Kpmg Ag Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft audited the tCms with focus on emissions in accordance with the 980 standard of the institute of public Auditors in germany. this audit with focus on emissions was based on the principles of appropriateness, implementation and effectiveness, and was successfully completed at the end of 2020.",

We are addressing the increased regulatory requirements by means of our groupwide Data Compliance management system (Data Cms), which along with our Data vision and our Data Culture is a fundamental component of our overarching Data governance system.\n\nthe Data Cms, which combines all group-wide measures, processes and systems for ensuring data compliance, is based on the existing Daimler Cms. the Data Cms supports the systematic planning, implementation and monitoring of compliance with data protection requirements.\n\n## Anti-financial crime compliance\n\nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism cause tremendous damage/uni00A0- to the economy and society in equal measure. even an accusation of money laundering can compromise our reputation and have financial consequences for us as well as our shareholders and stakeholders. For this reason, the prevention of money laundering and the implementation of antimoney laundering measures have been defined as central compliance goals in our integrity Code. to this end, we employ an integrated compliance approach. Before we implement measures to prevent money laundering, we check against current sanctions lists. on the one hand, through these measures we prevent criminals from evading supranational and national sanctions; on the other, we enhance the effectiveness of our measures to prevent money laundering, the financing of terrorism, organized crime and other types of corporate crime.\n\n## Social compliance\n\nAs an internationally operating company, we too bear responsibility for ensuring respect for and safeguarding of human rights along our entire value chain. We actively proceed here and conduct risk-based and systematic monitoring to ensure that human rights are upheld at our own companies and our suppliers. in order to procure raw materials in a responsible manner, we also work together with associations, organizations and other companies in multiple various projects and initiatives.\n\nto ensure that human rights are respected and safeguarded, we have developed an in-house due diligence approach called the human Rights Respect system (hRRs). We use this system to monitor human rights risks within our own group companies, at our direct suppliers (tier 1) and at suppliers beyond the tier 1 level on the basis of potential risks.\n\nthe hRRs encompasses four steps: risk assessment, program implementation, monitoring and reporting. it is designed to systematically identify and avoid risks and possible negative effects of our business activities on human rights early on, to avoid them and, if necessary, to initiate adequate measures. in addition to protecting the company, the hRRs thus also primarily protects third parties, the so-called rights holders.. external stakeholders are regularly involved as we continue to expand the hRRs step by step. Among other things, we hold talks with international Ngos concerning the human rights risks arising from the extraction of certain raw materials, and we also organize the annual Daimler sustainability Dialogue ( w /uni00A0daimler. com/documents/sustainability/other/sd2020-overall-plenaryreports-working-groups-en.pdf). At this event, we annually discuss and evaluate our progress as well as the challenges that arise during the implementation of our management approach. the respective departments then evaluate the results and the ideas provided by the stakeholders and incorporate them into their work processes.\n\nAs part of the integration of the hRRs into the group-wide Compliance management system, the group companies in which Daimler has a majority share are examined for possible human rights-related risks, analogously to other compliance fields such as anti-corruption. in the first step, we classify the group companies according to fixed criteria, including countryspecific and business-specific risks. the focus is on the most important human rights issues that have been identified for the group companies, including employee rights, diversity and safety. in the process, we take into account fundamental human rights standards such as those defined in the universal Declaration of human Rights and those of the international labour organization (ilo). on this basis we conduct a more thorough analysis every year with the help of a survey regarding human rights and use the findings to derive packages of risk-specific measures.\n\nDuring the reporting period, this newly developed method was used for the first time at high-risk group companies. the local compliance officers, who are part of our global compliance network, provide assistance for the human rights survey at the group companies. in order to obtain useful insights from the survey, the compliance experts were trained in advance in an in-depth online training that was tailored to their needs. this training enabled them to recognize the human rights risks of our focal areas. it allowed us to identify the specific local risks and explore them further in discussions with the compliance officers of the respective group companies. the results of this more in-depth risk analysis are correspondingly documented and incorporated into the development of targeted measures for minimizing human rights risks. We plan to continuously refine this analysis in the years ahead and to expand it to all group companies in which we have a majority stake. Coupled with this is the development of risk-specific packages of measures that we will supply to the respective group companies in line with their risk classification. they provide a systematic means of preventing human rights risks.",

For example, we have identified child labor, health and safety as the most urgent human rights risks for cobalt, while the risks associated with the procurement and processing of lithium are largely related to rights that are affected by the extensive use of water at the procurement locations. We are also closely cooperating with relevant stakeholders in raw material supply chains in order to help improve working conditions and prevent human rights violations in raw material mining operations. important platforms here include raw material initiatives such as the initiative for Responsible mining Assurance (iRmA), which we joined during the reporting year. they provide cross-sector mechanisms such as auditing standards and certification systems that help, among other things, to make it possible to trace the origins of materials such as cobalt, iron ore and bauxite, which is necessary for producing aluminum.\n\nWe want to continue to make recognizable progress on this important topic. Respect for and protection of human rights is therefore one of the focal topics of our sustainable business strategies. We have set measurable goals that we consistently pursue.\n\nWithin the framework of an advanced risk assessment, we have identified 27 service areas and 24 raw materials whose use, extraction and further processing pose potentially critical human rights risks. our objective for the period through 2028 is to define and implement appropriate measures for addressing 100% of our production raw materials that harbor a higher risk of human rights violations. By the end of 2020, we had planned to assess 20 percent of all highest-risk raw materials. this figure is set to rise to 70 percent by 2025. improving the transparency and traceability within our supply chains is fundamental to these efforts. through these improvements we aim to identify potential risks and negative effects early on. our assessment process basically consists of three steps. We want to:\n\n- 1.  Create transparency along the raw materials supply chains for certain focus components, such as battery cells,\n- 2.  identify risk hotspots in these supply chains, and\n- 3.  Define and implement measures that address the risk hotspots.\n\nBy the end of 2020 we had assessed 24% of all high-risk raw materials.\n\nthese are our long-term goals:\n\n- -   in the first step regarding our services supply chains, our goal is to conduct an initial review in the period through 2021 of 100% of our service product groups that pose a high risk of human rights violations.\n- -   our objective for the period through 2025 is to review 70% of all the high-risk production raw materials we use that pose a high risk of human rights violations and to define any necessary improvement measures.\n- -   our objective for the period through 2028 is to define and implement appropriate measures for addressing 100% of our production raw materials that harbor a higher risk of human rights violations.\n\nFurther information can be found in the Daimler sustainability Report 2020, available from the end of march 2021 at w /uni00A0sustainabilityreport.daimler.com",

When determining the total remuneration of the individual Board of management members on the basis of the remuneration system that was approved by the Annual shareholders' meeting, Daimler takes the condition of the Company into account as well as the members' areas of activity and responsibility. this is done in line with legal requirements and with a clear focus on the competition. A balanced combination of non-performance-related (fixed) and performance-related (variable) components of remuneration that also takes into account suitably ambitious performance parameters and performance indicators provides the Board of management with an incentive to implement the corporate strategy and ensure the group's sustained success. in this way, Daimler reconciles the interests of all stakeholders, in particular those of the shareholders as the owners of the Company and those of the employees.\n\nin addition to ensuring the appropriateness of the remuneration with regard to performance and market conformance while taking the size, complexity and economic situation of the group into account, Daimler strongly focuses on making the remuneration system of the Board of management consistent with that of the management team. the latter aspect ensures that all of the decision-makers pursue uniform goals while taking the same financial and sustainability/environment social governance (esg) aspects into account and promoting Daimler's cultural and organizational realignment. Further information about the remuneration system that was approved by the Annual shareholders' meeting is available on the company's website at w /uni00A0daimler.com/company/corporate-governance/board-of-management/compensation.\n\n## Practical implementation\n\nFor each upcoming financial year, the presidential Committee at first prepares a review by the supervisory Board of the remuneration system and the level of remuneration and where necessary prepares suggestions for changes. in the process, the presidential Committee and the supervisory Board can avail themselves of the advice of external remuneration experts. this was also done in the year under review.\n\nthe remuneration system agreed upon by the supervisory Board is presented to the Annual shareholders' meeting for its approval. the supervisory Board regularly reviews the Board of management remuneration system on the basis of the preparations and recommendations made by the presidential Committee. the supervisory Board makes any changes that are deemed necessary. if major changes are made to the remuneration system, or at least at intervals of four years, it is presented to the Annual shareholders' meeting for approval. if the Annual shareholders' meeting does not approve the remuneration system, a revised remuneration system has to be submitted for approval to the next ordinary Annual shareholders' meeting at the very latest.\n\non the basis of the approved remuneration system, the supervisory Board determines the amount of the target total remuneration of the individual Board of management members for the upcoming financial year. it is set in an appropriate relationship to the responsibilities and performance of each Board of management member and to the situation of the group. in addition, the supervisory Board makes sure that the target total remuneration is appropriate to the market. to do this, it makes both a horizontal and a vertical comparison.\n\ntaking into account Daimler's market position (especially with regard to sector, size and country), the horizontal (external) comparison of the target total remuneration draws on a suitable group of companies from the DAX and comparable companies in germany along with a group of international competitors consisting of listed automotive manufacturers. the following aspects are given particular attention:\n\n- -    the effects of the individual fixed and variable components, that is, the methods behind them and their performance parameters;\n- -    the relative weighting of the components, that is, the relationship between the fixed base salary and the short, medium and long-term variable components;\n- -    and the amount of the target remuneration consisting of a fixed base remuneration, an annual bonus as a short and medium-term variable component, and a long-term variable remuneration, also with consideration of entitlement to a retirement pension and fringe benefits.",

For each financial year, the supervisory Board links the variable remuneration components to targets derived from the strategy. the degree to which these targets are achieved determines how high the payments actually are.\n\nFor each financial year, the supervisory Board also specifies a target bonus for the annual bonus if target achievement amounts to 100%. in addition, it sets an amount that is granted for the ppsp.\n\nit also decides on the relevant financial performance parameters and the respective targets that are to be used in the bonus calculations (the short and medium-term variable remuneration components) for the upcoming financial year. Furthermore, sustainability-based non-financial targets are drawn up for the Board of management as a whole, as are transformation targets oriented toward the implementation of futurefocused measures for the group's technological and sustainable realignment. since the 2019 financial year, the annual bonus for the Board of management and for managers has been calculated according to uniform goals/criteria and a uniform system.\n\nFor the long-term variable component of remuneration (ppsp) the supervisory Board sets an amount to be granted for the upcoming financial year in the form of an absolute amount in euros and sets the respective performance targets. the uniform approach for the targets/criteria and the ppsp system has been in force for the Board of management and for managers since it was introduced in 2005.\n\nA/fter the end of each financial year, the amount of the annual bonus is determined by measuring the achievement of the financial, non-financial and transformation targets by the Board of management as a whole. the presidential Committee then calculates the annual bonus and submits its proposal to the supervisory Board for its approval.\n\nthe amount to be paid out for the long-term variable remuneration component (ppsp) is determined at the end of the fouryear plan period and approved for payment a/fter the presidential Committee and the supervisory Board have been informed.",

        "page_content": "## Financial targets\n\nthe target value of eBit for each financial year continues to be derived on the basis of the desired medium-term return, which is set by the supervisory Board and is ambitious and oriented toward the competitive environment, and derived from the growth targets. the starting point of the calculation is the revenue of the previous year. the target value for the free cash flow of the industrial business in the respective financial year is based on the defined eBit target of the segments of the automobile business as well as on a strategic target for the cash conversion rate. the cash conversion rate is the proportion of the period's result that is scheduled to flow into the group's liquidity a/fter the payments for the necessary investments in research, development, tangible fixed assets and working capital are taken into account as part of the strategic growth target. When comparing the target free cash flow of the industrial business to the actual one, adjustments are made for certain factors that were taken into account in the target achievement of the annual bonus in 2019 or earlier.\n\n## Reference parameters:\n\n- - 50% comparison of actual eBit in 2020 with eBit targeted for 2020\n- - 50% comparison of actual free cash flow of the industrial business in 2020 with free cash flow of the industrial business targeted for 2020\n\nthe range of possible target achievement for the two financial targets (eBit and free cash flow of the industrial business) is between 0% and 200%. the lower limit of this range is 25% of the target value; the upper limit is 125% of the target value. if the actually achieved value is at or under the lower limit of the range, the target achievement degree is always 0%. the total absence of a bonus is therefore possible.\n\nif the actually achieved value is at or above the upper limit of the range, the target achievement degree is 200%, which is the maximum it can reach. the degree of target achievement develops linearly within the range. \uf0e4 /uni00A0B.43\n\n## Non-financial targets\n\nthe non-financial targets, which are oriented toward sustainability and cultural aspects and have been uniform at all management levels since financial year 2019, are divided into four categories. each category is weighted equally and receives an addition or a deduction of up to 2.5 percentage points to or from the degree of achievement of the financial target. A/fter the end of the financial year, the degree of target achievement is calculated by comparing the target value and the actual value. on this basis, an addition to or a deduction from the degree of financial target achievement of up to a total amount of 10 percentage points is possible. the total of the addition or deduction resulting from the non-financial targets is rounded to two significant figures. For the financial year 2020 this results in an addition of +6% (rounded).\n\n## B.43\n\n## Financial targets:\n\n## EBIT and free cash flow of the industrial business (FCF IB)\n\nAchievement of EBIT respectively FCF IB target results in 150% target achievement\n\n<!-- image -->",

With regard to vehicles, a comparison of the target number and the actual number of claims during a predefined period of time (mis xx) was carried out. With regard to services, this comparison was carried out by means of a customer satisfaction index. the degree of target achievement at the group level (+1.0%) was derived as a weighted average of the individual divisional degrees of target achievement. \uf0e4 /uni00A0B.45\n\nthe degree of the employees' commitment to the group (employee engagement) was calculated on the basis of their answers to certain standardized questions in our global employee survey. these answers, together with the participation rate achieved in the employee survey, were used to derive a +1.0% degree of target achievement at the group level for the maintenance and enhancement of a high level of satisfaction and motivation among the employees. \uf0e4 /uni00A0B.46\n\nA target for the proportion of women in executive positions was defined at the group level for a period of several years on the basis of Daimler's in-house guidelines for the proportion of women in management positions (gender Diversity Aspirational guidelines), which go beyond the legally obligatory targets. A +2.0% degree of target achievement was determined for this in a comparison of actual and target values that was conducted at the end of the financial year. \uf0e4 B.47\n\n## Transformation targets\n\nthe transformation targets represent both quantitative and qualitative aspects. they can add up to 25 percentage points to the degree to which the financial targets have been achieved.\n\nin order to take into account the implementation of the futureoriented measures for the technological and sustainable realignment of the group, the divisions defined measurable key performance indicators and target values from the futureoriented fields at the beginning of financial year 2020. here, as an integral part of our corporate strategy, sustainability/environment social governance (esg) aspects have an explicit significance for our business dealings.\n\nA/fter the conclusion of financial year 2020, a comparison of the actual and target values was conducted for the transformation targets of each division in the topic areas of sustainability/Digitalization/Connectivity/integrated service/electric Driving/Autonomous Driving. the supervisory Board derived the Board of management's shared degree of target achievement from the divisions' degree of target achievement as well as the strategic, organizational and structural contribution of the Board of management as a whole, taking into account the economic environment and the competitive situation and positioning of the group. For the financial year 2020 this leads to the addition of +20% to the degree to which the financial targets have been achieved.",

For the measurement of success, the competitors' average return on sales is calculated over a period of three years. target achievement occurs to the extent to which Daimler's return on sales deviates by a maximum of +/-2 percentage points from/uni2009105% of the calculated average of the competitors.\n- -target  achievement  of 100% only occurs when the average return on sales of the Daimler group reaches 105% of the revenue-weighted average return on sales of the group of competitors. maximum target achievement of 200% occurs if Daimler's return on sales exceeds/uni2009105% of the revenue-weighted average of the competitors by 2 percentage points or more. An additional limitation was implemented starting with ppsp 2015: if a target achievement of between/uni2009195% and 200% occurs, the maximum target achievement calculated from the performance parameter of return on sales compared to the group of competitors will only be deemed to be 200% if the actual return on sales for Daimler's automotive business reaches at least the strategic target for return on sales in the third year of the performance period. otherwise, target achievement will be limited to/uni2009195%.\n- -    target achievement of 0% occurs if Daimler's return on sales is 2 percentage points or more lower. in the deviation range of +/- 2 percentage points, target achievement varies in proportion to the deviation.\n- -    50% relates to 'relative share performance,' i.e. the performance of Daimler's share in a three-year comparison with the performance of the defined group of competitors (index). if the performance of Daimler's share (in percent) is the same as that of the index (in percent), target achievement is deemed to be/uni2009100%. if the performance of Daimler's share price (in percent) is 50 percentage points or more below (above) the performance of the index, target achievement is deemed to be 0% (200%). in the deviation range of +/- 50 percentage points, target achievement varies in proportion to the deviation.\n\n## Range of possible target achievement\n\n0 to 200%, that is, the plan has an upper limit. it may also be zero.\n\n## Policies for share ownership\n\nAs a supplement to these three components of remuneration, 'stock ownership policies' exist for the Board of management. these policies require the members of the Board of management to purchase Daimler shares over several years and to hold those shares until the end of their Board of management membership. the number of shares to be held is set between 20,000 and 75,000. in fulfillment of the policies, up to 25% of the gross/uni00A0remuneration out of each performance phantom share plan is generally to be used to acquire ordinary shares in the/uni00A0Company, but the required shares can also be acquired in other ways.",

Daimler merely makes a commitment to guarantee the total of contributions paid, which are invested in the capital market according to a precautionary investment concept.\n\nthe supervisory Board of Daimler Ag has approved the application of this system for all members of the Board of management newly appointed since 2012. the amount of the annual contributions results from a fixed percentage of the base salary (2020: without taking into account the voluntary salary waiver) and the total annual bonus for the respective financial year calculated as of the balance sheet date. this percentage is/uni2009currently 15%. this calculation takes into consideration the maximum level of retirement provision for each Board of management member/uni00A0- also according to the period of membership/uni00A0- and the resulting annual and long-term expense for the Company. the contributions to the retirement provision are granted until the age of 62. the benefit from the Daimler pensions plan is payable in the committed amount (sum of the capital components credited including interest) to surviving Board of management members at the earliest at the age of 62, irrespective of their age upon retirement. if a member of the Board of management retires due to disability, the benefit is paid as a disability pension, even before the age of 62.\n\nthe pension Capital system was used from the beginning of 2006 until the end of 2011. existing pension agreements of active Board of management members at the beginning of this period were adjusted correspondingly. All Board of management members newly appointed during that period were subject exclusively to the pension Capital system.\n\nunder this system, each Board of management member is credited with a capital component each year. this capital component comprises an amount equal to/uni200915% of the sum of the Board of management member's fixed base salary and the total annual bonus for the respective financial year on the balance sheet date, multiplied by an age factor equivalent to a rate of return of 6% until 2015 and 5% from 2016 (Wilfried porth: 5% for all years). these contributions to pension plans are granted only until the age of 60. the benefit from the pension capital is payable in the committed amount (sum of the capital components credited including interest) to surviving Board of management members at the earliest at the age of 60, irrespective of their age upon retirement. if a/uni00A0member of the Board of management retires due to disability, the benefit is paid as a disability pension, even before the age of 60.\n\npayments under the pension Capital system and the Daimler pensions plan can be made in three ways:\n\n- -    as a single amount;\n- -    in twelve annual installments, whereby interest accrues on each partial amount from the time payments commence until the payout is complete (pension Capital 6% or 5%; Daimler pensions plan in accordance with applicable law);\n- -    as an annuity with annual increases (pension Capital 3.5% or in accordance with applicable law; Daimler pensions plan in accordance with applicable law).\n\nthe contracts specify that if a Board of management member passes away before retiring for reason of age, the spouse/registered civil partner or dependent children is/are entitled to the full committed amount in the case of the pension Capital system, and to the credit amount reached plus an imputed amount until the age of 62 in the case of the Daimler pensions plan. if a Board of management member passes away a/fter retiring for reason of age, in the case of payment of twelve annual installments the heirs are entitled to the remaining present value. in the case of a pension with benefits for surviving dependents, the spouse/registered partner or dependent children is/are entitled to 60% of the discounted terminal value (pension Capital), or the spouse/registered civil partner is entitled to 60% of the actual pension (Daimler pensions plan).\n\nuntil the end of 2005, the pension agreements of Board of management members included a commitment to an annual retirement pension, calculated as a proportion of the former base salary and depending on the number of years of service; an analogous implementation of this commitment for the corresponding hierarchical level applied to Wilfried porth for the period prior to his serving as a member of the Board of management. such pension claims remained in effect a/fter the conversion to the pension Capital system but were frozen at the level reached at the beginning of 2006.\n\npayments of these pension claims start upon request when the term of service ends at or a/fter the age of 60, or are paid as disability pensions if the term of service ends before the age of 60 due to disability. the respective agreements provide for 3.5% annual increases starting when benefits are received (with the exception that Wilfried porth's benefits are adjusted in accordance with applicable law). the agreements guarantee the spouse/registered civil partner of a deceased Board of management member 60% of that member's pension.\n\nthat amount can increase by up to 30 percentage points depending on the number of dependent children.\n\nDeparting Board of management members are also provided with a company car, in some cases for a defined period.\n\nservice costs for pension obligations to Board of management members in accordance with iFRs amounted to \u20ac2.1 million in financial year 2020 (2019: \u20ac2.0 million). the present value of the total defined benefit obligation according to iFRs amounted to \u20ac31.6 million as of December 31, 2020 (2019: \u20ac32.9 million). taking age and period of service into account, the individual entitlements, service costs and present values are shown in the table. \uf0e4 /uni00A0 B.56",

E the Board of management\n\nin the case of unilateral early termination without an important reason, Board of management service contracts include commitments to payment of the base salary and provision of a company car until the end of the original service period at a maximum. such persons are only entitled to payment of the annual bonus pro rata for the period until the end of the membership in the Board of management. entitlement to payment of the performance-related components of remuneration with a long-term incentive effect (ppsp) that has already been allocated is defined by the conditions of the respective plans. to the extent that the payments described above are subject to the provisions of the severance cap of the german Corporate governance Code as amended on December 16, 2019, their total including fringe benefits is limited to double the annual remuneration and may not exceed the total remuneration for the remaining period of the service contract.\n\nin the event of an early termination of the service contract, both the short-term and the delayed medium-term component (deferral) of the annual bonus, and the proceeds from the longterm ppsp, are paid out not when the contract is terminated but instead at the points in time agreed upon in the service contract or in the terms and conditions of the ppsp plan. there are no assurances for cases in which membership in the Board of management is terminated early because of a change of control or assurances for compensation in the case of dismissal.\n\n## Sideline activities of Board of Management members\n\nthe members of the Board of management should accept management board or supervisory board positions and/or any other administrative or honorary functions outside the group only to a limited extent. Furthermore, they require the consent of the supervisory Board before commencing any sideline activities. this ensures that neither the time required nor the remuneration paid for such activities leads to any conflict with the members' duties to the group. insofar as such sideline activities are memberships of statutory supervisory boards or comparable boards of business enterprises, they are disclosed in the notes to the annual financial statements of Daimler Ag, which are published on our website. in general, Board of management members have no right to separate remuneration for board positions held at other companies of the group.\n\n## Loans to members of the Board of Management\n\nin 2020, no advances or loans were made or abated to members of the Board of management of Daimler Ag.\n\n## Payments made to former members of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and their survivors\n\npayments made in 2020 to former members of the Board of management of Daimler Ag and their survivors amounted to \u20ac26.0 million (2019: \u20ac19.5 million). pension provisions according to iFRs for former members of the Board of management and their survivors amounted to \u20ac362.5 million as of December 31, 2020 (2019: \u20ac355.8 million).",

Additional payments are made for activities in a maximum of three committees; any persons who are members of more than three such committees receive additional payments for the three most highly paid functions. members of a supervisory Board committee are only entitled to remuneration for such membership in a financial year if the committee has actually convened to fulfill its duties in this period.\n\nthe members of the supervisory Board and its committees receive a meeting fee of \u20ac1,100 for each supervisory Board meeting and committee meeting that they attend. the meeting fee is paid only once if several meetings of the supervisory Board and/or its committees are held on the same calendar day.\n\nFurthermore the members of the supervisory Board receive a refund of their expenses and the cost of any value added tax incurred by them in performance of their office.\n\nthe members of the supervisory Board were also covered by consequential loss-liability insurance taken out by the company in its own interest in an appropriate amount for boards and specific managers. the company paid the premiums.\n\nin connection with the remuneration adjustment in 2017, all members of the supervisory Board have made a self-commitment to purchase Company shares in the amount of 20% of their gross annual salary (excluding committee remuneration and the meeting fee) every year and to hold these shares until the end of one year a/fter they have le/ft the Company's supervisory Board (voluntary obligation in accordance with the 'comply or explain' principle).\n\nthis does not apply to supervisory Board members whose supervisory Board remuneration is subject in a mandatory or voluntary manner to the guidelines of the german trade union Confederation on the transfer of supervisory board remuneration to the hans B\u00f6ckler Foundation, or to the same extent is subject to a transfer to the employer or claim to payment due to a service or employment contract. in the event that a lower amount of the supervisory Board remuneration is transferred or credited, the voluntary commitment applies to 20% of the amount not transferred or credited. With this voluntary commitment, the members of the supervisory Board are expressing their focus on and commitment to the long-term, sustainable success of the Company.\n\nin financial year 2020, no remuneration was paid for services provided personally beyond the aforementioned board and committee activities, in particular for advisory or agency services, except for the remuneration paid to the members of the supervisory Board representing the employees in accordance with their contracts of employment.\n\nthe individual remuneration of the members of the supervisory Board is shown in the following table. \uf0e4 /uni00A0 B.57\n\ntaking into account the voluntary agreement on the part of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag to forgo 20% of their fixed remuneration and their meeting fees from April 1 to December 31, the total remuneration of all the activities of the members of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag in the year 2020 was thus \u20ac5.5 million (2019: \u20ac4.6 million).\n\npursuant to section 113 subsection 3 of the german stock Corporation Act (Aktg) in the revised version of the law for the implementation of the second shareholders rights directive (ARug ii) the Annual shareholders' meeting of a listed corporation shall approve the remuneration of the supervisory Board members at least every four years, whereby a resolution confirming the remuneration is permissible. such a resolution is planned for the ordinary Annual shareholders' meeting 2021. the remuneration of the supervisory Board members according to Article 10 of the Articles of incorporation are to be amended in the course of this so that the additional functionrelated remuneration for the Chair and membership of the legal Affairs Committee are adjusted to \u20ac115,200 and \u20ac57,600 respectively.\n\n## Loans to members of the Supervisory Board\n\nNo advances or loans were made or abated to members of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag in 2020.",

A risk is understood as the danger that events, developments or actions will prevent the group or one of its segments from achieving its targets. this includes financial and non-financial risks. At the same time, it is important to identify opportunities in order to safeguard and enhance the competitiveness of the Daimler group. An opportunity is understood as the possibility due to events, developments or actions to safeguard or to surpass the planned targets of the group or of a segment.\n\nin order to identify business risks and opportunities at an early stage and to assess and manage them actively, effective management and control systems, which have been brought together in an overall risk and opportunity management system, are applied. Risks and opportunities are not offset.\n\n## B.58\n\n## Assessment of probability of occurrence / possible impact\n\n| Level   | Probability of occurrence   |                           |        |\n|---------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| low     | 0% <                        | probability of occurrence | \u2264 33%  |\n| medium  | 33% <                       | probability of occurrence | \u2264 66%  |\n| high    | 66% <                       | probability of occurrence | < 100% |\n\n| Level   | Possible impact   |        |                |\n|---------|-------------------|--------|----------------|\n| low     | \u20ac0 <              | impact | < \u20ac500 million |\n| medium  | \u20ac500 million \u2264    | impact | < \u20ac1 billion   |\n| high    |                   | impact | \u2265 \u20ac1 billion   |\n\n## Risk and opportunity management system\n\nthe risk management system is intended to systematically and continually identify, assess, control, monitor and report on risks threatening the Daimler group's existence and other material risks jeopardizing the group's success, in order to support the achievement of corporate targets and to enhance risk awareness at the group. the risk management system is integrated into the value-based management and planning system of the Daimler group and is a fixed component of the overall planning, management and reporting process in the companies, segments and corporate functions.\n\nthe opportunity management system at the Daimler group is based on the risk management system. the objective of opportunity management is to recognize the possible opportunities arising in business activities as a result of positive developments at an early stage, and to use them in the best possible way for the group by taking appropriate measures. By taking advantage of opportunities, planned targets should be met or exceeded. opportunity management considers relevant and realizable opportunities that have not yet been included in any planning.\n\nin the context of the planning, risks and opportunities are considered with an observation period of up to five years. the reporting of risks and opportunities in the management Report generally relates to a period of one year.\n\nRisk assessment takes place on the basis of probability of occurrence and possible impact according to the levels 'low,' 'medium' and 'high.' these levels also apply to the possible impact of opportunities. An analysis of the probability of occurrence is not considered here. When assessing the impact of a risk or opportunity, unless otherwise reported, its effect in relation to eBit is considered.",

For the quantification of each risk and opportunity category in the management Report, the individual risks and opportunities are summarized for each category. the assessment of the dimensions, probability of occurrence and possible impact is based on the levels shown in table \uf0e4 B.58 and is conducted before measures are planned. in the context of describing the risk and opportunity categories, significant changes in comparison to the prior year are explained.\n\nsustainability aspects are integrated into the group-wide risk management process at Daimler. they are understood to be conditions, events, or developments involving environmental, social or governance factors (esg), the occurrence of which may have an actual or potential impact on the Daimler group's profitability, cash flows and financial position, as well as on its reputation. esg-related risks and opportunities that are very likely to have a serious negative impact on non-financial aspects in accordance with the CsR Directive implementation Act (CsR-Rug) can be found in the respective categories of the Risk and opportunity Report according to their cause. Furthermore, Daimler follows the recommendations of the task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (tCFD) with regard to climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nRisk management is based on the principle of completeness. this means that at the level of the individual entities, all identified risks enter the risk management process.\n\nthe scope of consolidation for risk and opportunity management corresponds to the scope of the consolidated financial statements and goes beyond that if necessary. the risks and opportunities of the segments and operating units, important associated companies, joint ventures, joint operations and the corporate departments are included.\n\nFurthermore, the employees responsible for risk management have the task of defining measures and, if necessary, initiating such measures to avoid, reduce or protect the group against risks. Within the context of opportunity management, measures are to be taken with which opportunities can be seized, improved and (fully or partially) realized. the cost-effectiveness of a measure is assessed before its implementation. the possible impact and probability of occurrence of all risks and opportunities of the individual entities and the related measures that have been initiated are continually monitored. the management activities take place at the level of the segments based on individual risks and opportunities. As the parent company of the Daimler group, Daimler Ag monitors implementation by the segments as part of its regulatory, legal, and compliance functions.\n\n## the organizational embedding of risk and opportunity\n\nmanagement takes place through the risk management organization established at the group. Responsibility for operational risk management and for the risk management processes lies with the segments, corporate functions, organizational entities and companies. they report on the specific risks and opportunities to the next-higher level unit on a regular basis. significant, unexpected risks must be reported on immediately. through the segments, this information is passed on to group Risk management for reporting to the Board of management and the supervisory Board. the group Risk management Committee (gRmC) is responsible for the continual improvement of the risk management system and for assessing its efficiency and effectiveness. the gRmC is composed of representatives of Accounting & Financial Reporting, the legal department, Compliance, technical Compliance, Corporate & information security and the members responsible for finance of the Boards of management of mercedes-Benz Ag, Daimler truck Ag and Daimler mobility Ag; it is chaired by the Board of management members of Daimler Ag responsible Finance & Controlling / Daimler mobility and for integrity and legal Affairs. the internal Auditing department contributes material findings on the internal control and risk management system.\n\nthe internal control system with regard to the accounting process has the objective of ensuring the correctness and effectiveness of accounting and financial reporting. it is designed in line with the internationally recognized framework for internal control systems of the Committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway Commission (Coso internal Control/uni00A0- integrated Framework), is continually developed further, and is an integral part of the accounting and financial reporting processes in the relevant companies, organizational units and corporate functions. the system includes principles and procedures as well as preventive and detective controls. Among other things, it is regularly checked as to whether\n\n- -   the group's uniform financial reporting, valuation and accounting guidelines are continually updated and regularly taught and adhered to;\n- -   transactions within the group are accounted for and properly eliminated;\n- -   issues relevant for financial reporting and disclosure from agreements entered into are recognized and appropriately presented;\n- -   processes are established to guarantee the completeness of financial reporting;\n- -   processes are established for the segregation of duties and for the 'four-eyes principle' in the context of preparing financial statements, and whether authorization and access rules exist for relevant it accounting systems.\n\nthe effectiveness of the internal control system is systematically assessed with regard to the corporate accounting process. the first step consists of risk analysis and a definition of control with the objective of identifying significant risks relating to the processes of corporate accounting and financial reporting in the main companies, organizational entities and corporate functions. the controls required are then defined and documented in accordance with group-wide guidelines. Random samples are regularly tested to assess the effectiveness of the controls. those tests constitute the basis for selfassessment of the appropriate magnitude and effectiveness of the controls. the results of this self-assessment are docu-",

At the end of the annual cycle, the selected companies, organizational entities and corporate functions confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system with regard to the corporate accounting process. the Board of management and the Audit Committee of the supervisory Board are regularly informed about potential significant control weaknesses and the effectiveness of the control mechanisms installed. however, the internal control and risk management system for the accounting process cannot ensure with absolute certainty that material misstatements in accounting are avoided.\n\nthe Audit Committee of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag and the committees of the supervisory Boards of mercedesBenz Ag, Daimler truck Ag and Daimler mobility Ag are responsible for monitoring the internal control and risk management system. the internal Auditing department monitors whether the statutory conditions and the group's internal guidelines concerning the internal control and risk management system of the group are adhered to. if required, measures are initiated in cooperation with the respective management. external auditors audit the system for the early identification of risks, which is integrated in the risk management system, for its general suitability to identify risks threatening the existence of the group; in addition, they report to the Audit Committee and the supervisory Board on any significant weaknesses that have been recognized in the internal control and risk management system.\n\n## Risks and opportunities\n\nthe following section describes risks and opportunities that can have a significant influence on the profitability, cash flows and financial position of the Daimler group. in general, the reporting of risks and opportunities takes place in relation to the individual segments. if no segment is explicitly mentioned, the risks and opportunities described relate to all the segments.\n\nin addition to the risks and opportunities described below, risks and opportunities that are not yet known or classified as not material can also influence profitability, cash flows and financial position in the future.\n\n## industry and business risks and opportunities\n\nthe following section describes the industry and business risks and opportunities of the Daimler group. A quantification of these risks and opportunities is shown in table \uf0e4 B.59 .\n\n## Economic risks and opportunities\n\neconomic risks and opportunities constitute the framework for the risks and opportunities listed in the following categories and are integrated as premises into the quantification of these risks and opportunities. overall economic conditions have a significant influence on vehicle sales markets and thus on the group's success.\n\nlike the majority of economic research institutes, Daimler expects the world economy to recover noticeably in 2021 from the recession of the previous year. economic developments in 2020 are described in detail in the E /uni00A0economic Conditions and Business Development section of this management Report; growth assumptions and forecasts for general developments in 2021 are explained in the E /uni00A0outlook.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA significant risk for the development of the global economy is the further course of the covid-19 pandemic. if the further course of the infection necessitates even more drastic and comprehensive containment measures than assumed in the outlook section of this management Report, this would have a major impact on the economic recovery and international trade relations. the broader and more comprehensive the lockdowns, the greater the impact.\n\nif the restrictions resulting from the pandemic last significantly longer than the first quarter, this could place an excessive burden on households, companies and governments. Among other things, this could lead to a noticeable rise in unemployment, which in turn would have significant adverse effects on private consumption and would also have a lasting negative impact on the recovery. the already strained situation of many companies could worsen as a result. A possible wave of insolvencies resulting from this could jeopardize the stability of the banking sector and lead to distortions in the financial markets. For the Daimler group, the risks arising from the further course of the pandemic could on the one hand adversely affect both unit sales and sales processes, and on the other hand could lead to significant negative effects on production and supply chains.\n\nif the service sector, which has been particularly hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, fails to recover as expected due to ongoing restrictions or voluntary changes in consumer behavior, this would have a noticeable impact on employment and wages in this sector. this would significantly reduce consumer confidence and consumption, one of the most important pillars of the economic recovery. the resulting lower growth or even decline in overall economic consumption would have a correspondingly negative impact on sales prospects, in particular of mercedes-Benz Cars & vans.\n\nin addition, if expectations of a recovery are not fulfilled, there could be a sharp correction on the stock markets, as they have already priced in a noticeable improvement of the real economy. sharply falling share prices could set off a chain reaction on global stock markets, with sharp market corrections and phases of extraordinary volatility as a consequence. such developments could lead to major asset losses worldwide and also depress consumer sentiment and the investment climate, and have a negative impact on the global economy. this would have significant adverse effects in particular on the sales prospects of all segments and on the Daimler group's earnings.",

        "page_content": "however, the successful containment of the pandemic within the first months of the year, for example, through more rapid and widespread deployment of suitable vaccines or the development of effective medication for covid-19, could lead to a significantly more dynamic recovery than assumed in the outlook section. Reduced uncertainty about the ongoing pandemic and the economic outlook could ensure that household savings, which rose sharply during the shutdown, are released more quickly than assumed. this would noticeably boost consumption and have a positive impact on unit sales by mercedes-Benz Cars & vans. in this case, the willingness of companies to invest could also increase, which could be reflected in rising demand for commercial vehicles, with corresponding positive effects for unit sales by Daimler trucks & Buses.\n\nthe increase in public and private debt resulting from the pandemic and the countermeasures required to combat it could lead to speculation in the capital market due to some countries' debt situations. this in turn could further increase uncertainty among consumers and investors. in the event of rising interest rates, this development could worsen further. Furthermore, the premature withdrawal of government support measures could slow down the economic recovery. Both developments would result in weaker consumer and investment activity and would be accompanied by a correspondingly weaker business developments for all divisions of the Daimler group. in addition, the rising burden of interest and principal payments could restrict companies' scope for future investment, thus dampening future economic activity. lower investment activity would have a particularly negative impact on unit sales by Daimler trucks & Buses.\n\nAt the country level, those emerging economies (such as turkey, south Africa or Brazil) with high foreign debt and high current account deficits could come under pressure, resulting in significant currency devaluations. Financial-market turbulence and even currency crises would be possible consequences and could have a massive negative impact on the economies concerned. since Daimler is either already very active in these countries or these markets play a strategic role, this would have a significantly negative impact on the group's sales prospects.\n\nDespite the phase one partial trade deal, a renewed escalation of the trade conflict between the united states and China would continue to be a significant risk for the further development of the world economy. Furthermore, more and more areas are meanwhile affected by the conflict and there is the threat of increasing technological and economic disconnection between the two countries. this could significantly affect the development of unit sales by mercedes-Benz Cars & vans. in addition, there is a danger that countries will implement increasingly protectionist measures such as specific marketaccess barriers or industry requirements for increased local value added. this would lead to higher costs at mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and Daimler trucks & Buses, adversely affecting business developments and sales possibilities. on the other hand, unforeseen trade facilitations could provide positive impulses and lead to more trade and higher growth. in that case, the Daimler group could also benefit.\n\nthe European market will continue to be of great importance for all segments of the Daimler group in the future, so changes in investment and consumer behavior will affect the development of unit sales in all segments. in the european union (eu), the risk of political conflicts remains high. phases of political uncertainty could have a negative impact on consumption and investment decisions by households and companies, and consequently have a negative impact on the economic development and sales opportunities of the Daimler group. if, however, concerted stimulus measures in the european union, above all the eu reconstruction bonds, or the eCB's expansionary measures have a greater impact than currently assumed, this could lead to a stronger recovery in growth, with positive effects on companies and households. Although the trade and cooperation agreement concluded by the eu and the united Kingdom on December 24, 2020 avoids the feared hard cut and provides for tariff-free trade, a general condition for this is that the respective product-specific value-added rules and rules of origin are complied with. in addition, it will bring about fundamental changes in relations between the eu and the united Kingdom, such as time-consuming customs procedures in the cross-border trade in goods. long waiting times at the border could lead to delays in deliveries. in addition, possible customs payments if the required rules of origin are not complied with could lead to pressure on vehicle prices or margins.\n\nthe fiscal program decided upon in late 2020 and potential further stimulus measures by the new administration in the United States could result in opportunities for economic developments. if this leads to significantly more dynamic consumption and investment, demand could benefit in all automotive segments. As mercedes-Benz Cars & vans, Daimler trucks & Buses and Daimler mobility generate substantial proportions of their revenues in the united states, these developments would have considerable consequences for the group's success. Furthermore, stronger economic growth in the united states would also have spillover effects on the rest of the world. however, increasing domestic political tension in the united states could unsettle consumers and investors and thus dampen economic growth.\n\nin China, support measures to combat the consequences of the corona pandemic could exacerbate structural imbalances such as overcapacity, indebtedness and low productivity. From an economic perspective, above all the high indebtedness of Chinese companies, especially state-owned enterprises, also represents a considerable risk. if the government's expected efforts to scale back fiscal and monetary support measures lead to a more significant growth slowdown than currently expected, this could result in an excessive increase in credit defaults, which would then lead to turbulences in the banking sector and the financial markets. in particular at the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans division, for which China is now one of the biggest sales markets, the aforementioned risks could result in significant negative effects on unit sales. however, growth in 2021 could turn out to be stronger than expected due to ongoing stimulus measures by the Chinese government. the resulting stronger growth in overall economic consumption would offer additional opportunities, especially for mercedes-Benz Cars & vans.",

Causes of declining vehicle sales may also result in particular from the partially unstable economic environment and in the context of political or economic uncertainties. A rising oil price and volatile exchange rates can also lead to market uncertainty and thus to falling demand for vehicles. Differences between the segments exist due to the partly varying regional focus of their activities. the development of markets, unit sales and inventories is continually analyzed and monitored by the segments; if necessary, specific marketing and sales programs are implemented.\n\nvolatilities with regard to market developments can also lead to the overall market or regional conditions for the automotive industry developing better than assumed in the internal forecasts and premises, resulting in business opportunities in the market. opportunities may also arise from an improvement in the competitive situation or a positive development of demand. the utilization of opportunities is supported by sales and marketing campaigns.\n\nDue to the partly difficult financial situation of some dealerships and vehicle importers, support actions by mercedesBenz Cars & vans and Daimler trucks & Buses might become necessary to ensure the performance of the business partners. the financial situation of strategically relevant dealerships and vehicle importers is continuously monitored. the loss of important dealerships and vehicle importers can lead to customer demand not being fully served and lower unit sales. taking over the costs of contract cancellations and of processing outstanding customer contracts cannot be ruled out as a result of dealer insolvencies and may have a negative impact on earnings.\n\nthe launch of new products by competitors, more aggressive pricing policies and poorer effective pricing in the a/ftersales business can lead to increasing competitive and price pressure in the automotive segments and have a negative impact on profitability. Continuous monitoring of competitors is carried out in order to recognize these risks at an early stage. Depending on the situation, product-specific and possibly regionally different measures are taken to support weaker markets. Daimler also applies various programs to boost sales, including financial incentives for customers.\n\nin connection with the sale of vehicles, Daimler offers its customers a wide range of financing and leasing options. the resulting risks for the Daimler mobility segment are mainly due to borrowers' worsening creditworthiness, so receivables might not be recoverable in whole or in part because of customers' insolvency (default or credit risk). Daimler counteracts credit risks by means of creditworthiness checks on the basis of standardized scoring and rating methods, the collateralization of receivables, and effective risk management with a firm focus on monitoring both internal and macroeconomic leading indicators.\n\nAgainst the background of the covid-19 pandemic, the Daimler mobility segment has granted selected customers improved payment terms in the form of deferrals, and deferrals were also granted due to government support programs. in order to take into account the increased credit risks due to the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, Daimler mobility has increased its debt-collection activities as a precautionary measure and has intensified internal monitoring and reporting by Risk management.",

        "page_content": "in connection with leasing agreements, risks and opportunities arise if the market value of a leased vehicle at the end of the agreement term differs from the residual value that was originally calculated and forecasted at the time the agreement was concluded and used as a basis for the leasing installments. particularly at mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and Daimler mobility, risks exist relating to a negative development of used-car markets with a corresponding impact on vehicles' residual values. Residual-value management processes are defined to counteract these risks. Depending on the region and the current market situation, the measures taken generally include continuous market monitoring as well as, if required, price-setting strategies or sales promotion measures designed to regulate vehicle inventories. the quality of market forecasts is verified by periodic comparisons of internal and external sources, and, if required, the determination of residual values is adjusted and further developed with regard to methods, processes and systems.\n\nAcross all segments, the assessment of general market risks is unchanged compared to the previous year. the impact of market opportunities has increased from 'medium' to 'high' due to the potentially stronger development of demand than assumed in the planning of the automotive segments.\n\n## Risks and opportunities related to the legal and political framework\n\nthe automotive industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation worldwide. Risks and opportunities from the legal and political framework have a considerable influence on Daimler's future business success. Regulations concerning vehicles' emissions, fuel consumption, safety and certification, as well as tariff aspects, play a particularly important role. the possible impact of risks from the legal and political framework remains unchanged at 'high' compared to the previous year; the probability of occurrence of risks has decreased from 'medium' to 'low.' this is due in particular to the lower probability of occurrence for risks in connection with tariffs. the assessment of the possible impact of opportunities decreased from 'medium' to 'low.'\n\nmany countries and regions have already implemented stricter regulations to reduce vehicles' emissions and fuel consumption or are currently preparing such laws. they relate, for example, to the environmental impact of vehicles, including limits on noise emissions, as well as pollutants from the emissions caused by production facilities. Non-compliance with regulations applicable in the various regions might result in significant penalties and reputational harm, and might even mean that vehicles could not or could no longer be registered in the relevant markets. this also includes risks from ongoing activities relating to legislation on Real Driving emissions (RDe). in addition, the risk exists that vehicles already in the markets will have to be reworked. the cost of compliance with these regulations is significant, especially for conventional engines.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars & Vans faces the described risks with respect to regulations on mandatory targets for the average fleet fuel consumption and Co 2 emissions of new vehicles. especially in the markets of China, europe and the united states, Daimler gives these targets due consideration in its product planning. the increasingly ambitious targets require significant proportions of actual unit sales of plug-in hybrids and cars with other types of electric drive. the ambitious statutory requirements will be difficult to fulfill in some countries. the market success of alternative drive systems is greatly influenced not only by customer acceptance but also by regional market conditions such as the battery-charging infrastructure and state support.\n\nthe described regulations for the reduction of vehicles' emissions and fuel consumption also create potential risks for Daimler Trucks & Buses, because it will be difficult to fulfill the strict statutory requirements in some countries. Above all, this applies to the markets of Japan, the united states, China and europe. the ambitious targets, especially in europe, cannot be achieved solely with conventional technology. Daimler trucks & Buses will therefore have to apply the latest technologies in order to fulfill these requirements. Achieving the 2025 target will require significant proportions of battery-electric trucks or other electrified drive systems in the actual market, which may only be achievable at higher costs.\n\nFurthermore, the position of the Daimler group in key foreign markets could be affected by the conclusion of or changes in free-trade agreements. if free-trade agreements are concluded without the participation of countries in which Daimler has production facilities, this could result in a competitive disadvantage for Daimler compared with competitors that produce in the countries that are members of the free-trade agreements. in addition, if the content of the free-trade agreements currently used by Daimler is made significantly stricter or the conditions of future free-trade agreements are more restrictive, this could also significantly impair the position of the Daimler group, as the group could no longer or only partially benefit from those free-trade agreements. At the same time, however, the conclusion of new free-trade agreements could also result in opportunities for the Daimler group vis-\u00e0vis its competitors, if the competitors do not produce in the countries concerned, but Daimler does.",

Cutting technological and economic links between major markets can also adversely affect earnings if research and development have to be conducted locally or value chains have to be adjusted because certain technologies are not allowed to be used in the final products. in addition, attempts are being made to limit growth in imports through barriers to market access such as by making certification processes more difficult, delaying certification and imposing other complicated tariff procedures.\n\nin addition to the described emission and fuel-consumption regulations, traffic-policy restrictions for the reduction of traffic jams, noise and emissions are becoming increasingly important in cities and urban areas worldwide. Although this may have an adverse impact on the development of unit sales of conventional vehicles, it may also lead to growing demand for vehicles with alternative drive systems.\n\nDaimler continuously monitors the development of statutory and political conditions and attempts to anticipate foreseeable requirements and long-term targets at an early stage in the process of product development.\n\n## Procurement market risks and opportunities\n\nprocurement market risks arise for the automotive divisions in particular from fluctuations in prices of raw materials and energy. Financial bottlenecks of suppliers, restricted capacity caused by supplier failures, limited scope for influencing the prices of supplied parts and excessive or insufficient utilization of production capacities at suppliers can also lead to lower earnings. overall, the risk situation is unchanged compared with the previous year in terms of probability of occurrence at 'medium' and possible impact at 'high.' the impact of the opportunities is also unchanged at 'medium.'\n\nthe automotive segments of the Daimler group require certain raw materials for the manufacture of vehicle components and vehicles, which are purchased on the world market. the level of costs depends on the price development of raw materials. Due to largely unchanged macroeconomic conditions, price fluctuations are expected with uncertain and inconsistent trends also for the year 2021. For example, raw-material markets can be impacted by uncertainties and political crises/uni00A0combined with possible supply bottlenecks/uni00A0- as well as by volatile demand for specific raw materials. in general, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets. Rising raw-material prices may therefore have a negative impact on the profit margins of the vehicles sold and thus lead to lower earnings in the respective segment.\n\nthe financial situation of some suppliers remains tense due to the gloomy market environment. the resulting possible production losses at suppliers may cause an interruption in the supply chain of the Daimler group's automotive segments and prevent vehicles from being completed and delivered to customers on time. in order to counteract such interruptions in the supply chain, support measures may be necessary to ensure production and sales by suppliers. supplier risk management aims to identify potential financial bottlenecks for suppliers at an early stage and to initiate suitable countermeasures. specifically, depending on the warning signals recorded and the internal classification, regular reporting dates are agreed upon for suppliers at which key performance indicators are reported to Daimler and any support measures can be determined if necessary.\n\nDue to, among other things, the planned electrification of new model series and the better-than-expected recovery of demand for vehicles, mercedes-Benz Cars & vans in particular is faced with the risk that Daimler will require changed volumes of components from suppliers. this could result in overor under-utilization of production capacities for certain suppliers, and thus lead to supply-chain disruption. uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic may also lead to supply bottlenecks and thus production interruptions. if suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is also the risk that they may demand compensation payments. Necessary capacity expansion at suppliers' plants could also require cost participation.",

A quantification of these risks and opportunities is shown in table \uf0e4 B.60 .\n\n## Production and technology risks and opportunities\n\ntechnical developments and innovations are of key importance for the safe and sustainable mobility of the future. through the design of the product range, technical innovations are integrated in the strategic product planning of the automotive segments. technological risks can arise especially as a result of increasing technical complexity, the continually rising scope of requirements to be fulfilled in terms of emissions, fuel consumption and safety, as well as meeting and steadily raising the Daimler group's quality standards. these risks exist in the automotive segments particularly in connection with launching and manufacturing the products. Risks cannot be ruled out that could have a negative impact on earnings also in relation to the increasing automation and connectivity of vehicles and production facilities.\n\nin the context of product launches in the automotive segments, the required parts and equipment components have to be available. to avoid restrictions in this context, the related processes are continuously evaluated and improved. in order to secure and enhance the long-term future viability of production facilities in the automotive segments, modernization, expansion, construction and restructuring measures are carried out as required. the execution of modernization activities and the launch of new products are generally connected with high investments. inefficiencies in the production process can occur, and as a consequence, a temporary reduction in production volumes. Furthermore, the planned increase in battery production due to the increasing electrification of the vehicle fleet means that initial problems during the production of the various battery types cannot be ruled out, and can have a negative impact on earnings.\n\nin principle, there is a danger that reduced plant availability or the failure of production equipment or production plants may cause internal bottlenecks that would consequently generate costs. these risks mainly exist for mercedes-Benz Cars & vans. production equipment is continuously maintained and modernized. As a precaution, spare parts are held available or, if required, spare machines are purchased for the production plants that might be at risk.\n\n## B.60\n\n## Company-specific risks and opportunities\n\n| Risk category                                                        | Probability of occurrence   | Impact   | Opportunity category                                                        | Impact   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| production and technology risks                                      | low                         | high     | production and technology opportunities                                     | medium   |\n| information technology risks                                         | low                         | high     | information technology opportunities                                        | -        |\n| personnel risks                                                      | medium                      | high     | personnel opportunities                                                     | -        |\n| Risks related to equity investments and coopera- tions with partners | low                         | low      | opportunities related to equity investments and  cooperations with partners | low      |\n\nCapacity restrictions on the availability of batteries for certain vehicle models, interruptions in the supply chain and possible interruptions of supply by energy providers can lead to bottlenecks, especially at mercedes-Benz Cars & vans. New technical requirements could also lead to restrictions on the sale of vehicles already produced by Daimler trucks & Buses. Restrictions on certain equipment components in new vehicle models and the lack of availability of vehicle parts at the right time could also mean that vehicles could not be handed over to customers as planned. in order to avoid such bottleneck situations, importance is placed upon being able to compensate for capacity constraints through forward planning, with a special focus on the uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, supply chains and the availability and quality of products are continuously monitored within the context of managing the entire value chain. supplier management is undertaken for the prevention of risks with the aim of ensuring the quantity and quality of the components required to manufacture the vehicles. the lack of availability and quality problems with certain vehicle parts can lead to production downtimes and cause costs. in connection with possible production increases due to higher utilization of production capacities than planned, there are opportunities at mercedes-Benz Cars & vans that could lead to higher sales volumes and thus have a positive impact on earnings.\n\nWarranty and goodwill cases could arise at the Daimler group if the quality of products does not meet requirements, regulations are not fully complied with, or support cannot be provided in the required form in connection with product problems and product care. such warranty and goodwill cases as well as quality problems both with components in vehicles and in connection with technical innovations in vehicles require adjustments that can lead to expenses. possible claims in connection with such risks are examined and, if necessary, the appropriate measures are initiated for the affected products.\n\nin the third quarter of 2020, Daimler Ag and mercedes-Benz usA, llC (mBusA) reached agreements with various us authorities to settle civil and environmental claims regarding emission control systems of certain mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, which are still subject to final approval by the court.

Nonetheless, the high penetration of information technology (it) at all divisions also brings risks for their business and production processes, as well as for their services and products.\n\nthe ever-growing threat from cybercrime and the spread of aggressive malicious code brings risks that can affect the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information and itsupported operating resources. Despite extensive precautions, in the worst-case scenario, this can lead to a temporary interruption of it-supported business processes with severe negative effects on the group's earnings. in addition, the loss or misuse of sensitive data may under certain circumstances lead to a loss of reputation. in particular, stricter regulatory requirements such as the eu Data protection Directive may, among other things, give rise to claims by third parties and result in costly regulatory requirements and penalties with an impact on earnings.\n\nit is essential for the globally active Daimler group and its wide-ranging business and production processes that information is available and can be exchanged in an up-to-date, complete and correct form. Daimler's internal framework for it security is based on international standards and its protective measures also apply industry standards and good practice. New regulatory requirements for cyber security and cyber security management systems are taken into account in the further development of our processes and policies. Appropriately secure it systems and a reliable it infrastructure must be used to protect information. Cyber threats must be identified over the entire lifecycle of applications and it systems, and dealt with in line with their seriousness. particular attention is paid to risks that could result in the interruption of business processes due to the failure of it systems or which could cause the loss or corruption of data. the advancing digitization and connectivity of production equipment is accompanied by coordinated technical and organizational security measures.\n\nDue to growing requirements concerning the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, Daimler has implemented various preventive and corrective measures so that the related risks are minimized and possible damage is limited. For example, the group reduces potential interruptions of operating processes in data centers by means of mirrored data sets, decentralized data storage, outsourced data backups and it systems designed for high availability. emergency plans are developed and employees are trained and regularly sensitized in order to maintain operating capability. specific threats are analyzed and countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active Cyber intelligence & Response Center. the protection of products and services against the danger of hacking and cybercrime is continually developed.\n\nthe possible impact and probability of occurrence of information-technology risks are unchanged compared to the previous year.\n\n## Personnel risks and opportunities\n\nCompetition for highly qualified staff and management is still very intense in the industry and the regions in which Daimler operates. the future success of the Daimler group also depends on the extent to which it succeeds over the long term in recruiting, integrating and retaining specialist employees. the established human resources instruments take such personnel risks into consideration. one focus of human resources management is the targeted personnel development and further training of the workforce. in order to remain successful as a company, we continuously develop the way we work together and our management culture.\n\nDue to demographic developments, the group has to cope with changes relating to an aging workforce and has to secure a sufficient number of qualified young persons with the potential to become the next generation of highly skilled specialists and executives. this is addressed by measures taken in the area of generation management that do justice to the scope of the issue. We counter economic, market and competitive fluctuations with the established time and flexibility instruments to enable us to react appropriately to the situation. in order to achieve the long-term reduction in personnel costs necessary for the transformation, Daimler's management and the general Works Council concluded an agreement in 2019 which includes a staff-reduction program. Due to the covid-19 pandemic and the fact that the staff-reduction program is voluntary for both parties, there is a risk that implementation may not be able to take place to the full extent planned. Risks also exist in particular due to upcoming negotiations on wage conditions in the metal and electrical industry and the associated possible production losses.\n\nDue to the ongoing transformation process, the probability of occurrence of personnel risks has increased from 'medium' to 'high.' the possible impact is unchanged compared with the previous year.\n\n## Risks and opportunities related to equity investments and cooperation with partners\n\nCooperation with partners in associated companies and joint ventures is of key importance to Daimler, both in the transformation toward electric mobility and comprehensive digitization and in connection with mobility solutions. in particular with new technologies, these shareholdings help to utilize synergies and improve cost structures in order to respond successfully to the competitive situation in the automotive industry.",

Furthermore, ongoing business activities, especially the integration of employees, technologies and products, can lead to risks. in addition, further financial obligations or an additional financing requirement can arise. Risks from associated companies and joint ventures exist above all at Daimler trucks & Buses and Daimler mobility, as well as at the associated companies and joint ventures directly allocated to the group. the associated companies and joint ventures are subject to a monitoring process so that, if required, decisions can be promptly made on whether or not measures can be taken to support or ensure their profitability. the recoverable value of investments in associated companies and joint ventures is also regularly monitored.\n\nthe possible impact of risks has decreased from 'medium' to 'low' due to measures already taken in the portfolio of equity interests. the overall assessment of the probability of occurrence of both risks and opportunities remains unchanged compared with the previous year.\n\n## Financial risks and opportunities\n\nthe following section deals with the financial risks and opportunities of the Daimler group. Risks and opportunities can have negative or positive effects on the profitability, cash flows and financial position of the Daimler group. the probability of occurrence and possible impact of these risks and opportunities is presented in table \uf0e4 B.61 . the probability of occurrence and impact of the financial risks and opportunities are essentially unchanged from the previous year. only in the case of country risks, the possible impact has decreased from 'medium' to 'low' because of declining risk factors, and with risks of limited access to capital markets, our assessment of the probability of occurrence has increased from 'low' to 'medium' due to the increased volatility of the financial markets.\n\n## B.61\n\nFinancial risks and opportunities\n\n| Risk category                              | Probability of occurrence   | Impact   | Opportunity category                               | Impact   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| exchange rate risks                        | low                         | high     | exchange rate opportunities                        | high     |\n| interest rate risks                        | low                         | low      | interest rate opportunities                        | low      |\n| Commodity price risks                      | low                         | low      | Commodity price opportunities                      | low      |\n| Credit risks                               | low                         | low      | Credit opportunities                               | -        |\n| Country risks                              | low                         | low      | Country opportunities                              | -        |\n| Risks of restricted  capital-market access | medium                      | high     | opportunities of restricted  capital-market access | -        |\n| Risks of credit  repayment requirements    | low                         | low      | opportunities of credit  repayment requirements    | -        |\n| Risks from changes in credit ratings       | medium                      | low      | opportunities from changes in credit ratings       | low      |\n| Risks related to pension plans             | low                         | high     | opportunities relating to pension plans            | high     |\n\nin principle, the group's operating and financial risk exposures underlying its financial risks and opportunities can be divided into symmetrical and asymmetrical risk and opportunity profiles. With the symmetrical risk and opportunity profiles (e.g., currency exposures), risks and opportunities exist equally, while with the asymmetrical risk and opportunity profiles (e.g., credit and country exposures), the risks outweigh the opportunities.\n\nDaimler is generally exposed to risks and opportunities from changes in market prices such as currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. market price changes can have a negative or positive influence on the group's profitability, cash flows and financial position. Daimler systematically manages and monitors market price risks and opportunities primarily in the context of its operational business and financing activities, and applies derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes where needed, thus limiting both market price risks and opportunities.\n\nin addition, the group is exposed to credit-, country- and liquidity-related risks, risks of restricted access to capital markets, risks of early credit repayment requirements and risks from changes in credit ratings. As part of the risk management process, Daimler regularly assesses these risks by considering changes in key economic indicators and market information. pension plan assets to cover retirement and healthcare benefits (market-sensitive investments including equities and interest-bearing securities) are not included in the following analysis.\n\n## Exchange rate risks and opportunities\n\nthe Daimler group's global orientation means that its business operations and financial transactions are connected with risks and opportunities related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. this applies in particular to fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar, Chinese renminbi, British pound and other currencies such as those of growth markets. An exchange rate risk or opportunity arises in business operations primarily when revenue is generated in a currency different from that of the related costs (transaction risk). this applies in particular to mercedes-Benz Cars & vans. A major portion of its revenue is generated in foreign currencies while most of its production costs are denominated in euros. Daimler trucks & Buses is also exposed to such transaction risks, but to a lesser degree because of its worldwide production network. Regularly",

Any overcollateralization caused by changes in exposure is generally reversed by suitable measures without delay. exchange rate risks and opportunities also exist in connection with the translation into euros of the net assets, revenues and expenses of the companies of the group outside the euro zone (translation risk); these risks are not generally hedged.\n\n## Interest rate risks and opportunities\n\nChanges in interest rates can create risks and opportunities for business operations as well as for financial transactions. Daimler employs a variety of interest-rate sensitive financial instruments to manage the cash requirements of its business operations on a day-to-day basis. most of these financial instruments are held in connection with the financial services business of Daimler mobility. interest rate risks and opportunities arise when fixed-interest periods are not congruent between the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. By means of refinancing coordinated with the terms of the financing agreements, the risk of maturity mismatch is minimized from both an interest-rate and a liquidity perspective. Remaining interest-rate risks are managed with the use of derivative financial instruments. the funding activities of the industrial business and the financial services business are coordinated at group level. Derivative interest rate instruments such as interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired interest rate maturities and asset/liability structures (asset and liability management).\n\n## Commodity price risks and opportunities\n\nAs described in the section on procurement market risks and opportunities, Daimler is exposed to risks arising from changes in prices of raw materials. A small proportion of the raw-material price risks, primarily from the planned purchase of certain metals, is reduced through the use of derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Credit risks\n\nCredit risk describes the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to meet its contractual payment obligations. Credit risk includes both the direct risk of default and the risk of a deterioration in creditworthiness, as well as concentration risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe group is exposed to credit risks which result primarily from its financial services activities and from the operations of its vehicle business. the risks from leasing and sales financing are dealt with in the E general market risks and opportunities section.\n\nCredit risks also arise from the group's liquid assets. should defaults occur, this would adversely affect the group's financial position, cash flows and profitability. the limit methodology for liquid funds deposited with financial institutions has been continuously further developed in recent years. in connection with investment decisions, priority is placed on the borrowers' very high creditworthiness and on balanced risk diversification. most liquid assets are held in investments with an external rating of 'A' or better.\n\n## Country risks\n\nCountry risk describes the risk of financial loss resulting from changes in political, economic, legal or social conditions in the respective country, for example due to sovereign measures such as expropriation or a ban on currency transfers. Daimler is exposed to country risks that primarily result from crossborder financing or collateralization for group companies or customers, from investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, and from cross-border trade receivables. Country risks also arise from cross-border cash deposits with financial institutions. the group addresses these risks by setting country limits (e.g., for hard-currency portfolios of Daimler mobility companies). Daimler also has an internal rating system that divides all countries in which it operates into risk categories.",

An increase in the cost of refinancing would have a negative impact on the competitiveness and profitability of our financial services business to the extent that the higher refinancing costs cannot be passed on to customers; a limitation of the financial services business would also have negative consequences for the vehicle business. Access to capital markets in individual countries may be limited by government regulations or by a temporary lack of absorption capacity. in addition, pending legal proceedings as well as Daimler's own business policy considerations and developments may temporarily prevent the group from covering any liquidity requirements by means of borrowing in the capital markets.\n\n## Risks of premature credit repayment requirements\n\nDaimler may be required to make premature repayment of special-purpose loans in the case of adverse results of ongoing legal proceedings. Any resulting refinancing requirement could have to be concluded at a higher cost.\n\n## Risks and opportunities from changes in credit ratings\n\nRisks and opportunities exist in connection with potential downgrades or upgrades to credit ratings by the rating agencies, and thus to Daimler's creditworthiness. Downgrades could have a negative impact on the group's financing if such a downgrade leads to an increase in the costs for external financing or restricts the group's ability to obtain financing. A credit rating downgrade could also discourage investors from investing in Daimler Ag.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to pension plans\n\nDaimler has pension benefit obligations and to a lesser degree, obligations relating to healthcare benefits, which are largely covered by plan assets. the balance of pension obligations less plan assets constitutes the carrying amount or funded status of those employee benefit plans. the measurement of pension obligations and the calculation of net pension expense are based on certain assumptions. even small changes in those assumptions such as a change in the discount rate have a negative or positive effect on the funded status and group equity in the current financial year, and lead to changes in the periodic net pension expense in the following financial year. the fair value of plan assets is determined to a large degree by developments in the capital markets. unfavorable or favorable developments, especially relating to share prices and fixedinterest securities, reduce or increase the carrying value of plan assets. A change in the composition of plan assets can also have a positive or negative impact on the fair value of plan assets. the broad diversification of investments, the selection of asset managers on the basis of quantitative and qualitative analyses, and the ongoing monitoring of returns and risks contribute to a reduction in the investment risk. the structure of pension obligations is taken into consideration with the determination of the investment strategy for the plan assets in order to reduce fluctuations of the funded status.\n\nFurther information on the pension plans and their risks is provided in E /uni00A0Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements. Further information on financial risks, risk-limiting measures and the management of these risks is provided in E /uni00A0Note 33 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements. information on the group's financial instruments is provided in E /uni00A0Note 32 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements.\n\n## legal and tax risks and opportunities\n\nthe group continues to be exposed to legal and tax risks. provisions are recognized for those risks if and insofar as they are likely to be utilized and the amounts of the obligations can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Legal risks\n\nRegulatory risks. the automotive industry is subject to extensive governmental regulations worldwide. laws in various jurisdictions govern occupant safety and the environmental impact of vehicles, including emissions levels, fuel economy and noise, as well as the emissions of the plants where vehicles or parts thereof are produced. in case regulations applicable in the different regions are not complied with, this could result in significant penalties and reputational harm or the inability to certify vehicles in the relevant markets. the cost of compliance with these regulations is considerable, and in this context, Daimler continues to expect a significant increase in such costs.",

Daimler Ag and its subsidiaries are confronted with various legal proceedings and claims as well as governmental investigations and orders (legal proceedings) on a large number of topics, including vehicle safety, emissions, fuel economy, financial services, dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships, intellectual property rights (especially patent infringement lawsuits), warranty claims, environmental matters, antitrust matters (including actions for damages) as well as investor litigation. productrelated litigation involves claims alleging faults in vehicles. some of these claims are asserted by way of class actions. if the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to Daimler or such proceedings are settled, the group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive damages or to undertake service actions, recall campaigns, monetary penalties or other costly actions. some of these proceedings and related settlements may have an impact on the group's reputation.\n\n## Risks from legal proceedings in connection with diesel exhaust gas emissions/uni00A0- governmental proceedings.\n\nDaimler is continuously subject to governmental information requests, inquiries, investigations, administrative orders and proceedings relating to environmental, criminal, antitrust and other laws and regulations in connection with diesel exhaust emissions.\n\nseveral authorities and institutions worldwide were, and still are, active in the form of inquiries, investigations, procedures and/or orders. these activities particularly relate to test results, the emission control systems used in mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and/or Daimler's interaction with the relevant authorities as well as related legal issues and implications, including, but not limited to, under applicable environmental, criminal and antitrust laws.\n\nin the united states, Daimler Ag and mercedes-Benz usA, llC (mBusA) reached agreements in the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to settle civil and environmental claims regarding emission control systems of certain diesel vehicles. the involved us authorities are the environmental agencies environmental protection Agency ('epA') and California Air Resources Board ('CARB'), the environmental and Natural Resources Division of the u.s. Department of Justice ('DoJ'), the California Attorney general's office and the u.s. Customs and Border protection ('CBp').\n\nthe authorities take the position that Daimler failed to disclose Auxiliary emission Control Devices (AeCDs) in certain of its us diesel vehicles and that several of these AeCDs are illegal defeat devices. As part of these settlements, Daimler denies the allegations by the authorities and does not admit liability, but has agreed to, among other things, pay civil penalties, conduct an emission modification program for affected vehicles, provide extended warranties, undertake a nationwide mitigation project, take certain corporate compliance measures and make other payments. the company has cooperated fully with the us authorities. the settlements are subject to final court approval. upon approval, they will be final and effective. Daimler expects costs of the settlements with the us authorities of approximately usD 1.5 billion. the estimated cost for the us consumer class action mentioned below amounts to around usD 700 million. in addition, Daimler estimates further expenses of a mid three-digit-million euro amount to fulfill requirements of these settlements.\n\nAs already reported, in April 2016, the DoJ requested that Daimler conduct an internal investigation. While Daimler has conducted such internal investigation as part of the DoJ's investigation, the DoJ's investigation is ongoing. in Canada, the Canadian environmental regulator environment and Climate Change Canada ('eCCC') is conducting an investigation in connection with Diesel exhaust emissions. Daimler continues to cooperate with the investigating authorities.\n\nin germany, the stuttgart district attorney's office is conducting criminal investigation proceedings against Daimler employees on the suspicion of fraud and criminal advertising. in February 2019, the stuttgart district attorney's office also initiated a formal investigation proceeding against Daimler Ag with respect to an administrative offense. in september 2019, it issued a fine notice against Daimler based on a negligent violation of supervisory duties in the amount of \u20ac870 million, which has become legally binding, thereby concluding the administrative offense proceedings against Daimler.\n\nsince 2018, the german Federal motor transport Authority ('KBA') has repeatedly issued subsequent auxiliary provisions for the eC type approvals of certain mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and has ordered mandatory recalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first registration. in each of those cases, it held that certain calibrations of specified functionalities in certain mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles are to be qualified as impermissible defeat devices. Daimler has a contrary legal opinion on this question. since 2018, however, it has (in view of the KBA's interpretation of the law as a precautionary measure) implemented a temporary delivery and registration stop with respect to certain models, also covering the usedcar, leasing and financing businesses, and is constantly reviewing whether it can li/ft this delivery and registration stop in whole or in part. Daimler has filed timely objections against the KBA's administrative orders mentioned above. in early 2021, the KBA issued objection orders ('Widerspruchsbescheide') in certain of the proceedings not following the arguments brought forward by Daimler. since Daimler still does have a different understanding of the relevant legal provisions, it currently analyzes whether the controversial questions at issue should be clarified in a court of law. irrespective of such objections and possibly following lawsuits, Daimler continues to cooperate fully with the KBA. the new calibrations requested by the KBA are being processed, and for a substantial proportion of the vehicles, the relevant so/ftware has already been",

        "page_content": "approved by the KBA; the related recalls have insofar been initiated. it cannot be ruled out that under certain circumstances, so/ftware updates may have to be reworked, or further delivery and registration stops may be ordered or resolved by the Company as a precautionary measure, also with regard to the usedcar, leasing and financing businesses. in the course of its regular market supervision, the KBA is routinely conducting further reviews of mercedes-Benz vehicles and is asking questions about technical elements of the vehicles. in addition, Daimler continues to be in a dialogue with the german ministry for transport and Digital infrastructure (Bmvi) to conclude the analysis of the diesel-related emissions matter and to further the update of affected customer vehicles. in light of the aforementioned administrative orders issued by the KBA, and continued discussions with the KBA and the Bmvi, it cannot be ruled out completely that additional administrative orders may be issued in the course of the ongoing and/or further investigations. since september 1, 2020, this also applies to responsible authorities of other member states and the european Commission, which conduct market surveillance under the new european type Approval Regulation and can take measures upon assumed non-compliance, irrespective of the place of the original type approval.\n\nin the course of its formal investigation into possible collusion on clean emission technology, the european Commission sent a statement of objections to Daimler and other automobile manufacturers in April 2019. in this context, Daimler filed an application for immunity from fines (leniency application) with the european Commission some time ago.\n\nin addition to the aforementioned authorities, national cartel authorities and other authorities of various foreign states, the south Korean ministry of environment, the south Korean competition authority (Korea Fair trade Commission) and the seoul public prosecutor's office (south Korea) are conducting various investigations and/or procedures in connection with Diesel exhaust emissions.\n\nDaimler continues to fully cooperate with the authorities and institutions. irrespective of such cooperation and in light of the recent developments, it is possible that further regulatory, criminal and administrative investigative and enforcement actions and measures relating to Daimler and/or its employees will be taken or administrative orders will be issued. such actions, measures and orders may include subpoenas, that is, legal instructions issued under penalty of law in the process of taking evidence, or other requests for documentation, testimony or other information, or orders to recall vehicles, further search warrants, a notice of violation or an increased formalization of the governmental investigations, coordination or proceedings, including the resolution of proceedings by way of a settlement. Additionally, further delays in obtaining regulatory approvals necessary to introduce new or recertify existing vehicle models could occur.\n\nin light of the legal positions taken by epA, CARB and the KBA, it is likely that, besides these authorities, one or more regulatory and/or investigative authorities worldwide will reach the conclusion that other passenger cars and/or commercial vehicles with the brand name mercedes-Benz or other brand names of the Daimler group are equipped with impermissible defeat devices. likewise, such authorities could take the view that certain functionalities and/or calibrations are not proper and/or were not properly disclosed. Furthermore, the authorities have increased scrutiny of Daimler's processes regarding running-change, field-fix and defect reporting as well as other compliance issues. As described above, the stuttgart district attorney's office's administrative offense proceedings and the proceedings underlying the civil settlements with the us authorities have been resolved. the other inquiries, investigations, legal actions and proceedings as well as the replies to the governmental information requests and the objection proceedings against KBA's administrative orders, are in part still ongoing and open. hence, Daimler cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries, investigations and proceedings at this time. Due to the outcome of the administrative offense proceedings by the stuttgart district attorney's office against Daimler and the civil settlements with the us authorities, as well as the above and any potential other information requests, inquiries, investigations, administrative orders and proceedings, it is possible that Daimler will become subject to, as the case may be, significant additional monetary penalties, fines, disgorgements of profits, remediation requirements, further vehicle recalls, further registration and delivery stops, process and compliance improvements, mitigation measures and the early termination of promotional loans, and/or other sanctions, measures and actions (such as the exclusion from public tenders), including further governmental investigations and/or administrative orders and additional proceedings. the occurrence of the aforementioned events in whole or in part could cause significant collateral damage including reputational harm. Further, due to negative allegations, determinations or findings with respect to technical or legal issues by one of the various governmental agencies, other agencies/uni00A0- or also plaintiffs/uni00A0- could also adopt such allegations, determinations or findings, even if such allegations, determinations or findings are not within the scope of such authority's responsibility or jurisdiction. thus, a negative allegation, determination or finding in one proceeding, such as the fine notice issued by the stuttgart district attorney's office or the allegations underlying the civil settlements with the us authorities, carries the risk of being able to have an adverse effect on other proceedings, also potentially leading to new or expanded investigations or proceedings, including lawsuits.\n\nin addition, Daimler's ability to defend itself in proceedings could be impaired by the fine notice issued by the stuttgart district attorney's office, the civil settlements with the us authorities and by the underlying allegations and other unfavorable allegations, as well as by findings, results or developments in any of the information requests, inquiries, investigations, administrative orders, legal actions and/or proceedings discussed above.",

District Court for New Jersey. in the class action, plaintiffs alleged that Daimler Ag and mBusA used devices that impermissibly impair the effectiveness of emission control systems in reducing nitrogen-oxide (No X ) emissions and which cause excessive emissions from vehicles with diesel engines. in addition, plaintiffs alleged that consumers were deliberately deceived in connection with the advertising of mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles.\n\nin the third quarter of 2020, Daimler Ag and mBusA reached a settlement with plaintiffs' counsel of this consumer class action. As part of the settlement, Daimler Ag and mBusA deny the material factual allegations and legal claims asserted by the class action plaintiffs, but have agreed to provide payments to certain current and former diesel vehicle owners and lessees. the estimated cost of the class action settlement is approximately usD 700 million. Daimler expects costs of the settlements with the us authorities mentioned above in the amount of approximately usD 1.5 billion. in addition, Daimler estimates further expenses of a mid three-digit-million euro amount to fulfill requirements of these settlements. the settlement with the us consumer class action plaintiffs is still subject to final court approval.\n\nin a separate lawsuit filed by the state of Arizona in January 2019, the plaintiff claims that, amongst others, Daimler Ag and mBusA deliberately deceived consumers in connection with advertising mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. Consumer class actions containing similar allegations were filed against Daimler Ag and further Daimler group companies in Canada in April 2016, in the united Kingdom since may 2020, in the Netherlands in June and December 2020 as well as against Daimler Ag in israel in February 2019. in a separate lawsuit filed by the environmental protection Commission of hillsborough County, Florida in september 2020, the plaintiff claims that, amongst others, Daimler Ag and mBusA violated municipal regulations prohibiting vehicle tampering and other conduct by using alleged devices claimed to impair the effectiveness of emissions control systems.\n\nin germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehicles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission of sales contracts. they assert that the vehicles contained inadmissible defeat devices and/or showed impermissibly high levels of emissions or fuel consumption. they refer to, in particular, the german Federal motor transport Authority's recall orders mentioned above. given the current development of case numbers, we expect a continued high number of lawsuits being filed in this respect.\n\nFurthermore, class actions have been filed in the united states and Canada alleging anticompetitive behavior relating to vehicle technology, costs, suppliers, markets and other competitive attributes, including diesel emissions control technology.\n\nDaimler Ag and the respective other affected companies of the group regard the lawsuits set out above as being without merit and will/uni00A0- except for the us consumer class action settlement/uni00A0- defend themselves against the claims.\n\nA securities class action lawsuit was pending in the united states on behalf of investors in Daimler Ag American Depositary Receipts which alleged that the defendants had made materially false and misleading statements about diesel emissions in mercedes-Benz vehicles. the parties have agreed to settle the lawsuit. on December 23, 2020, the court granted final approval of the settlement. upon expiry of the appeal period on January 22, 2021, the proceedings were legally terminated.\n\nin addition, investors have filed lawsuits in germany alleging the violation of disclosure requirements. Daimler Ag regards these lawsuits as being without merit and will defend itself against them. in this context, motions to initiate model proceedings in accordance with the Act on model proceedings in Capital markets Disputes (Kapmug) have been filed by investors as well as by Daimler Ag. on January 14, 2021, the stuttgart Regional Court issued an order for reference to commence such model case proceedings before the stuttgart higher Regional Court. Daimler Ag will continue to defend itself against the investors' allegations also in these model case proceedings.\n\nDaimler's ability to defend itself in the court proceedings could be impaired by the us consumer class action settlement as well as unfavorable allegations, findings, results or developments in any of the governmental or other court proceedings discussed above, in particular by the fine notice issued by the stuttgart district attorney's office and by the civil settlements with the us authorities.",

Following the settlement decision by the european Commission adopted on July 19, 2016 concluding the trucks antitrust proceedings, Daimler Ag and Daimler truck Ag are facing customers' claims for damages to a considerable degree. Respective legal actions, class actions and other forms of legal redress have been initiated in various states in and outside of europe and should further be expected. Daimler takes appropriate legal remedies to defend itself.\n\nAs legal proceedings are fraught with a large degree of uncertainty, it is possible that a/fter their final resolution, some of the provisions we have recognized for them could prove to be insufficient. As a result, substantial additional expenditures may arise. this also applies to legal proceedings for which the group has seen no requirement to recognize a provision.\n\nit cannot be ruled out that the regulatory risks and risks from legal proceedings discussed above, individually or in the aggregate, may materially adversely impact the profitability, cash flows and financial position of the group or any of its segments.\n\nAlthough the final result of any such litigation may influence the group's earnings and cash flows in any particular period, Daimler believes that any resulting obligations are unlikely to have a sustained effect on the group's financial position.\n\nFurther information on legal proceedings is provided in E /uni00A0Note 30 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements.\n\n## Tax risks and opportunities\n\nDaimler Ag and its subsidiaries operate in many countries worldwide and are therefore subject to numerous different statutory provisions and tax audits. Any changes in legislation and jurisdiction, as well as different interpretations of the law by the fiscal authorities/uni00A0- especially in the field of cross-border transactions - may be subject to considerable uncertainty. it is therefore possible that the provisions recognized will not be sufficient, which could have negative effects on the group's net profit and cash flows.\n\npositive effects on the group's net profit and cash flows are also possible as a result of retroactive legislation, future court rulings or changes in the opinions of the tax authorities.\n\nAny changes or interventions by the fiscal authorities are continuously monitored by the tax department and measures are taken if required.\n\nin addition, if future taxable income is not earned or is too low, there is a risk that the tax benefit from loss carryforwards and tax-deductible temporary differences may not be recognized or may no longer be recognized in full, which could have a negative impact on net profit. however, there is an accounting opportunity that tax benefits currently not recognized in full may be utilized or recognized in future years and could thus also have a positive impact on the group's net profit.\n\n## overall assessment of the risk and opportunity situation\n\nthe overall view of the group's risk and opportunity situation is the sum of the described individual risks and opportunities of all risk and opportunity categories.\n\nin addition to the risk categories described above, unforeseeable events can have a negative impact on the business operations and thus on the Daimler group's profitability, cash flows, financial position and reputation. in particular, legal risks or social violations by partners and suppliers can have a negative influence on the reputation of the Daimler group, the environment and the employees of partner companies and suppliers. As one of the basic principles of corporate activity, Daimler therefore pays particular attention to compliance with legal and ethical rules/uni00A0- also when selecting partners and suppliers. in order to recognize risks and opportunities at an early stage and to deal successfully with the current risk and opportunity situation, the established risk and opportunity management system is continuously monitored and further developed.\n\nthe overall risk and opportunity situation of the Daimler group remains essentially unchanged. No risks are recognizable/uni00A0neither on the balance sheet date nor at the time of preparing the consolidated financial statements/uni00A0- that either alone or in combination with other risks could endanger the continued existence of the group.",

        "page_content": "## outlook\n\nthe statements made in the outlook chapter are based on the business plan of Daimler Ag as approved by the Board of management and the supervisory Board. that plan is based on the premises we set regarding the economic situation and the development of automotive markets. it involves assessments made by Daimler, which are based on analyses by various renowned economic research institutes, international organizations and industry associations, as well as on the internal market analyses of our sales companies. the prospects for our future business development as presented here reflect the targets of our divisions as well as the opportunities and risks presented by the anticipated market conditions and the competitive situation during the planning period. Against this backdrop, we adjust our expectations for business development to reflect updated forecasts for the development of the various automotive markets. the statements made below are based on the facts known to us at the beginning of 2021. the Daimler Business plan is based on the existing group structure, including Daimler trucks & Buses, and for reasons of comparability covers the full 2021 financial year. As previously announced, the Board of management decided to evaluate a spin-off of Daimler trucks & Buses, including significant parts of the related financial services business (Daimler truck), and to begin preparations for a separate listing of Daimler truck before the end of 2021. Before the spin-off, we will reclassify Daimler truck as discontinued operations. We expect considerable positive effects in connection with the spin-off in the second half of the year, which cannot be reliably determined at present.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour assessments for the year 2021 are based on the assumption of a gradual normalization of economic conditions in the markets that are most important for us. our expectations for business developments in 2021 are based in particular on the assumption that the global economy can recover from the pandemic-related weakness of 2020, helped by, among other things, the increasing availability of effective vaccines. We expect demand for cars and commercial vehicles to exceed the prior-year levels significantly in many markets. the development we have outlined is subject to various opportunities and risks, which are explained in detail in the E Risk and opportunity Report.\n\n## the world economy\n\nWe assume that the global economy will grow strongly in 2021 following the deep recession of 2020; this applies both to the industrialized countries and to the emerging markets. however, especially in the northern hemisphere, containment of the covid-19 pandemic is likely to affect the first few months of the year. Along with the expected spread of effective vaccines through the population, the situation should improve from the second quarter onwards and the upturn should gain momentum. over the course of the year, the global economy should be able to return to its pre-crisis level of the fourth quarter of 2019. global trade should also increase again significantly a/fter the deep slump in 2020.\n\nthe economy of the european monetary union is expected to remain severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic in 2021, but a/fter a weak start, it should increasingly gain momentum as the year progresses. this should be supported both by the recovery in global trade and by improved prospects for domestic demand as restrictions on economic activity are gradually eased or li/fted. in addition, the european Central Bank's monetary policy is likely to remain very expansionary and support the economic recovery. investment activity in the euro zone should also benefit from the start of implementation of the eu Recovery Fund. overall, these developments should lead to an economic growth rate in the european monetary union of approximately 4 %, while developments within the region will continue to be very heterogeneous. the german economy should follow a similar pattern and grow by about 3.5 %, primarily because of an expected strong second half. the uK economy should also continue to recover, but is likely to suffer noticeably in the first few months of the year in particular from the stringent measures taken to combat the covid-19 pandemic and the growthdampening impact of the country's exit from the eu single market effective January 1, 2021.\n\nWe also expect the us economy to grow strongly by about 5 % in 2021, driven primarily by dynamic growth in private consumption and possibly by additional fiscal stimulus. As vaccination rates rise, especially those services sectors should recover which were severely affected by pandemic-related restrictions. this should also ensure that unemployment continues to decline noticeably. the us Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to maintain its expansionary monetary policy as announced and to continue supporting the economic recovery.",

        "page_content": "the Japanese economy is expected to recover at a rather moderate rate of approximately 3 % this year, driven mainly by strong export growth in the context of the recovery in global trade.\n\nWe expect strong growth momentum in China as the recovery in private consumption is steadily gaining pace, while industrial production and exports continue to rise. Based on a recovery of the labor market and improved consumer sentiment, consumption is likely to contribute significantly to the expected growth of more than 8 % this year. Against the backdrop of this robust development, the Chinese government is likely to gradually scale back its fiscal and monetary support measures.\n\nthe emerging markets as a whole will also recover noticeably this year, whereby the positive effects of coronavirus vaccinations are only likely to materialize with a certain delay compared with the industrialized countries. the Asian region is likely to recover most strongly, even though the growth momentum in the various countries is likely to remain disparate. in contrast, the recovery of latin American and Central and eastern european economies is expected to be significantly more moderate. the countries of the middle east are likely to benefit from a slight recovery of the oil price, but in a long-term comparison, the oil price will remain moderate according to current estimates. taken together, the emerging economies should achieve overall growth in the region of 6 % in 2021.\n\noverall, the world economy is likely to experience a strong recovery in 2021 with growth of about 5 %, thus expanding at a pace that is well above average by long-term standards.\n\n## Automotive markets\n\non the basis of the assumed economic recovery, a significant increase in worldwide demand for cars is to be expected in 2021.\n\nthe european market is likely to grow significantly compared to the very weak level caused by the crisis last year. We expect a significant increase in car sales also for most of the large individual european markets.\n\nlight vehicle demand in the us market is expected to recover significantly following the sharp decline in the previous year. the Chinese car market, which developed better than most of the other major sales markets last year, is expected to expand slightly this year.\n\nWe also expect demand for vans to improve significantly compared with the previous year. in the eu30 region (the european union, united Kingdom, switzerland and Norway), significant growth is expected in 2021, both in the combined market segment of mid-size and large vans and in the market for small vans. in the united states and Brazil, demand for large vans is also expected to be significantly stronger than in 2020. in China, we expect the positive development in the mid-size van segment to continue with further significant market growth.\n\nthe economic upturn should also result in a better development of demand in key truck markets .\n\nin North America, we assume that the market for heavy-duty trucks (class 8) will expand significantly. significant growth in demand for heavy-duty trucks is anticipated also in the eu30 region. We expect slight expansion in the Brazilian market, while a market volume at the prior-year level is likely in Japan.",

We intend to launch more than half a dozen new and revised models in the year 2021.

And we intend to make use of additional market opportunities and enhance customer satisfaction with the continuous expansion of our online sales channels.\n\nWe see further growth potential in fleet management, the insurance business and mobility services, especially in the luxury segment.\n\non the basis of our assumptions concerning the development of automotive markets and the divisions' planning, we expect the Daimler Group to achieve total unit sales in 2021 significantly above the level of the year 2020.\n\n## Revenue and earnings\n\nWe assume that the Daimler group will generate revenue in 2021 at significantly above the level of the previous year. this applies for both of our automotive divisions: mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and Daimler trucks & Buses. the Daimler mobility division expects its revenue to be slightly below the prior-year level.\n\nBased on the expected significant growth in unit sales and revenue, we anticipate a significant increase in earnings for the Daimler group in 2021. this development reflects two opposing effects: eBit in 2020 was sharply reduced by the effects of the worldwide covid-19 pandemic; furthermore, there were costs from the initiated restructuring measures. on the other hand, we expect positive contributions to eBit in 2021, in addition to the stimulus from the economic recovery, also from the efficiency and cost-cutting measures we have implemented. they include personnel and material cost savings, portfolio and model adjustments, the continuing implementation of platform strategies, and more stringent capital allocation.\n\nour ongoing measures to increase efficiency also involve optimizing the utilization of our production facilities. in the context of the regular review of useful lives, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment subject to scheduled depreciation were reassessed and, in some cases, extended at the end of 2020. these amended estimates will be applied as of January 1, 2021. the expected positive impact on earnings before interest and taxes (eBit) amounts to \u20ac0.8 billion for 2021 and mainly relates to mercedes Benz Cars & vans.\n\non the basis of the market developments we anticipate, the aforementioned factors and the planning of our divisions, we assume that group eBit in 2021 will be significantly above the level of 2020, which was affected in particular by the covid-19 pandemic. group eBit in 2021 will include a positive contribution from the planned fuel-cell joint venture with volvo, probably of between \u20ac1.2 billion and \u20ac1.3 billion, which is planned to be allocated equally to the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and Daimler trucks & Buses divisions. these transactions will have no effect on the adjusted earnings of the automotive divisions.\n\nthe individual divisions have the following expectations for adjusted returns in 2021:\n\nmercedes-Benz Cars & vans: adjusted return on sales of 8-10% Daimler trucks & Buses: adjusted return on sales of 6-7% Daimler mobility: adjusted return on equity of 12-13%\n\nAt mercedes-Benz Cars & vans, positive effects on the adjusted return on sales will result from rising volumes of unit sales, a more favorable sales structure, further improved pricing and the extended useful lives of property, plant and equipment. however, earnings in the 2021 financial year will be adversely impacted by rising functional costs compared with the previous year, which also featured strict cost-cutting measures.",

        "page_content": "At Daimler trucks & Buses, the adjusted return on sales will reflect positive earnings effects from recovering markets, a more favorable unit-sales structure, further improved pricing, and the a/fter-sales business. measures to increase efficiency, such as material-cost savings, will have a supporting effect. there will be a negative impact in 2021 from increasing functional costs compared with the previous year, which strict savings measures.\n\nDaimler mobility anticipates positive effects on adjusted return on equity from lower credit-risk costs and improved operating profit in its business with mobility services. opposing effects are likely to result from expenses for new project investments.\n\n## Free cash flow and liquidity\n\nthe free cash flow of the industrial business will continue to be adversely affected by high advance expenditure for new products and technologies. the payments agreed in the third quarter of 2020 in the context of the settlements with us authorities and with plaintiffs' council in the us consumer class actions relating to diesel emissions are also included in the forecasted free cash flow. Further possible expenses in connection with legal and regulatory proceedings are not included. Furthermore, we expect higher tax payments than in the previous year. An opposing, positive effect will result from the planned fuel-cell joint venture with volvo in the amount of the sale proceeds of probably \u20ac0.6 billion, which is to be allocated proportionately to mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and Daimler trucks & Buses. this cash inflow will not affect the adjusted cash conversion rate. in total, we expect the free cash flow of the industrial business in 2021 to be significantly below the prior-year level.\n\nWe expect the adjusted cash conversion rate for the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans division to be within a corridor of 0.7 to 0.9 in 2021. the adjusted cash conversion rate for Daimler trucks & Buses is likely to be between 0.8 and 1.0.\n\nFor the year 2021, we aim to have liquidity available in a volume appropriate to the general risk situation in the financial markets and to Daimler's risk profile. When measuring the level of liquidity, we give due consideration to possible refinancing risks caused for example by temporary distortions in the financial markets. We continue to assume, however, that we will have very good access to the capital markets and the bank market also in the year 2021. We aim to cover our funding needs in the planning period primarily by means of bonds, commercial paper, bank loans, customer deposits in the direct banking business and the securitization of receivables in the financial services business; the focus will be on bonds and loans from globally and locally active banks. in view of our ongoing strong creditworthiness and in a continuing environment of high liquidity in the international capital markets, we anticipate stable refinancing conditions. Furthermore, our goal is to continue to ensure a high degree of financial flexibility.\n\n## Dividend\n\nAt the Annual shareholders' meeting on march 31, 2021, the Board of management and the supervisory Board will propose the payment of a dividend of \u20ac1.35 per share for the year 2020 (previous year: \u20ac0.90). this represents a total distribution of \u20ac1.4 billion (previous year: \u20ac1.0 billion).\n\nin line with a sustainable dividend policy, Daimler sets the dividend based on a distribution ratio of 40% of the net profit attributable to Daimler shareholders. We also take into consideration the free cash flow from the industrial business when setting the dividend.",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\n## Capital expenditure and research activities\n\n## Investment in property, plant and equipment\n\nWe will continue to invest heavily in the attractiveness and future viability of our product range and production processes in 2021. this applies in particular to the increasing electrification of our product portfolio and to the digital connectivity of our products and processes along the entire value chain. At the same time, we will continue the measures we have initiated to reduce costs and make more efficient use of resources. Against this background, we plan to invest in property, plant and equipment in 2021 at the prior-year level.\n\nA main feature of investment in property, plant and equipment at mercedes-Benz Cars & vans will be the product ramp-ups of the next-generation C-Class and the battery-electric vehicles on the evA2 platform. in addition, we will push ahead with the development of alternative drive systems and will also continue to invest in conventional drive systems. investment in property, plant and equipment at mercedes-Benz Cars & vans is therefore also expected to be at the prior-year level.\n\nDaimler trucks & Buses anticipates a slight increase in investment in property, plant and equipment in 2021. Non-product projects will account for approximately 50% of the total; infrastructure optimizations will be the main drivers here. the increase in the share of product projects is partially the result of strategically relevant activities in the areas of electric mobility and automated driving. other key areas include emission standards and fuel efficiency for our conventional powertrains, active safety, and the completion of the Freightliner vocational product portfolio.\n\n## Research and development\n\nWith our research and development activities, our goal is to further strengthen Daimler's competitive position against the backdrop of upcoming technological challenges. We are focusing on the strategic areas for the future of connectivity, automated driving, and especially the development of electric drive systems. therefore, we expect our research and development expenditure in 2021 to be slightly above the prior-year level.\n\nAt mercedes-Benz Cars & vans, a large proportion of the research and development expenditure in 2021 will be for the renewal of the product portfolio. Research and development expenditure is expected to increase slightly compared with the previous year, mainly due to the successor series to the e-Class and the compact cars. the topics of digitization, automated driving and electric drive remain at the focus of our activities.\n\nthe Daimler trucks & Buses division anticipates a slightly higher volume of research and development expenditure than in 2020. its development activities will focus on new technologies, including for truck automation and connectivity as well as for electric drive powered by batteries and fuel cells. Another key area will be the development of successor generations of existing products, especially in the segment of heavy-duty trucks, as well as tailored products and technologies for important growth markets.\n\n## Co 2 emissions of the new-car fleet in europe\n\nin 2020, the average Co 2 emissions of our new car fleet in europe (european union, united Kingdom, Norway and iceland) probably decreased to 104 g/km with application of the applicable legal regulations for the respective year (NeDC, including vans registered as passenger cars). We therefore achieved the Co 2 targets in the european union in 2020. transition from the current NeDC to the new Wltp test procedure is foreseen for the year 2021. this will involve the adjustment of fuel-consumption targets and rising certification figures. on the basis of Wltp, we expect our fleet average in europe (european union, Norway and iceland) to decrease again significantly in 2021 compared with the comparable figures for the previous year calculated according to Wltp (probably between 130 to 140 g/km, based on preliminary figures for fuel consumption in 2020 taking into account the statutory regulations of 2021). this development will be driven in particular by the rising proportion of battery-electric vehicle models and plug-in hybrids in our new-car fleet.\n\n## overall statement on future development\n\nFollowing the unexpected and extraordinary impact of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, financial challenges remain high for the Daimler group in 2021. this applies both to the ongoing impact of the pandemic, the duration of which we cannot predict, and to the high advance expenditure still required for the necessary transformation to a Co 2 -neutral future. our ambitious Co 2 targets set out in 'Ambition 2039' continue to necessitate high investments in electric mobility and far-reaching structural adjustments. only in this way will we be able to play a leading role in the transformation to a Co 2 -neutral future. in order to successfully master these challenges, we will push forward with our measures to improve cost efficiency and implement our strategic initiatives. Achieving appropriate returns and a sound cash flow have absolute priority along this path.\n\nAgainst this backdrop and supported by the group's brand strengths and innovative capabilities, we look forward with confidence to the year 2021. Compared with the particularly difficult previous year, we should be able to significantly increase our unit sales, revenue and earnings. however, this is based on the assumption that the covid-19 pandemic is gradually contained in our most important markets and that further setbacks for global economic development are avoided.",

Furthermore, it discusses the effectiveness and functional capabilities of the risk management system, the internal control system, the internal auditing system and the compliance management system. A/fter the external auditors are elected by the Annual shareholders' meeting, the Audit Committee engages the external auditors to conduct the annual audit and the auditors' review of interim financial statements. Furthermore, the Audit Committee determines the important audit issues and negotiates the audit fees with the external auditors. the Audit Committee also commissions the external auditors to carry out a voluntary examination of the non-financial report within the framework of a limited assurance engagement and to audit the non-financial declaration as part of the management Report.\n\n## Equal representation\n\nAudit Committee Chairman Dr. Clemens B\u00f6rsig and Joe Kaeser served as the shareholder representatives on the Audit Committee in financial year 2020. Both are independent and have expertise in the field of financial reporting, as well as special knowledge of and experience in the auditing of financial statements and the application of methods of internal control. During financial year 2020, the employees were represented on the Audit Committee by michael Brecht as the Deputy Chairman of the Committee and by ergun l\u00fcmali.\n\n## Meetings and participants\n\nthe Audit Committee met six times in financial year 2020.

Furthermore, the Audit Committee approved the Report of the Audit Committee for financial year 2019.\n\nin this meeting, the Audit Committee also discussed the report on the total fees paid to the external auditors in financial year 2019 for auditing and non-auditing services and defined the framework of approval for engaging the external auditors to provide non-audit services during the period January 1, 2020 to February 15, 2021. the Audit Committee also decided to recommend to the supervisory Board, and subsequently to the Annual shareholders' meeting, that Kpmg Ag Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft be engaged to conduct the annual external audit, the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the external auditors' review of interim financial reports for financial year 2020 and also to conduct the external auditors' review of interim financial reports for financial year 2021 in the period leading up to the Annual shareholders' meeting in 2021. the Audit Committee based this recommendation on the quality of the annual audit and the results of the independence review, for which no indications of partiality or a threat to independence were found. moreover, the Audit Committee decided to propose to the supervisory Board that it have the contents of the non-financial report for 2020 voluntarily reviewed again (with limited assurance). subject to the election of the proposed external auditors by the Annual shareholders' meeting, the Audit Committee also discussed the proposal to be made regarding the fees to be agreed upon with the external auditors for financial year 2020. Finally, the Audit Committee dealt with the annual audit plan for 2020 of the internal Auditing department and, within the framework of its responsibility, with the agenda for the 2020 Annual shareholders' meeting, which at this point was still scheduled to take place on April 1, 2020.\n\nin the meetings during 2020 related to the quarterly results, the Audit Committee discussed the interim financial reports and the results of the auditors' review before their publication with the Board of management and with the external auditors. in addition, the Committee received reports from the internal Auditing, Compliance and legal departments. the Board of management reported regularly to the Audit Committee on the current status of the main legal proceedings, including antitrust proceedings as well as inquiries, investigations, proceedings and administrative orders in connection with diesel emissions. in addition, the Audit Committee regularly dealt with notifications concerning possible violations of rules submitted by employees and third parties to the group's own Bpo (Business practices office) whistleblower system.\n\nthe meeting of the Audit Committee in April 2020 dealt with the interim financial report for the first quarter of 2020, focusing intensively on the fiscal impact of the covid-19 pandemic. moreover, the Audit Committee received reports from the internal Auditing, Compliance and legal departments, which also addressed the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. Another item on the agenda was the agreement on the external auditor fees for financial year 2020.\n\nin its meeting in June 2020, the Audit Committee discussed aspects of the group's risk management system and dealt in particular with its changes and further development. it also discussed the methods and processes of, and changes to, the internal control system. in this meeting, the Committee also addressed the agreement on the external auditor fees and discussed planning measures for the annual external audit and the key audit issues for financial year 2020. in addition, the Audit Committee extensively investigated current accounting issues. these included the regulatory statements concerning sARs-Cov-2 that were of key importance for the company as well as the methodology for evaluating the existing fleet of leased vehicles. the meeting was also used to discuss the results of the internal quality analysis of the external audit for financial year 2019. lastly, the Audit Committee learned about liquidity management within the group and the sub-groups and the methodological approach used to hedge against raw material and currency risks. in conclusion, the Committee took note of a report about current tax-related issues.\n\nin the meeting held in July 2020, the Audit Committee dealt with the results of the second quarter of 2020. in doing so, it also addressed the financial implications of the covid-19 pandemic. As part of its risk reporting activities, the Audit Committee mainly addressed legal proceedings as well as sales and production-related risks. in addition, the Committee received quarterly reports from the Compliance, internal Auditing and legal departments. Finally, the Audit Committee discussed with the Board of management the annual report produced by the group's Data protection officer.\n\nin october 2020, the Committee dealt with the interim financial report for the third quarter of 2020. in addition, the Committee expanded the range of key audit issues for the external auditors and conducted its annual review of the authorized non-audit services provided by the external auditors. it also decided to adjust the current catalog of authorized non-audit services. Due to the Board of management's decision to integrate the former non-financial report into the combined management report as the non-financial declaration, the Audit Committee resolved to recommend to the supervisory Board that the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report by the external auditors should be correspondingly expanded. in response to the current public debate concerning escrow accounts, the Audit Committee obtained in-depth reports about the management of the bank and escrow accounts within the Daimler group. in addition, the Committee received quarterly reports from the Compliance and legal departments. moreover, it obtained reports about the work and structure of the post settlement Audit team (psAt), which is located in the internal Auditing department. the psAt was set up during the reporting year on the basis of a settlement with the us regulatory authorities in connection with emission control systems. the team monitors the company's fulfillment of the settlement and, within a specified scope, its compliance with environmental regulations.",

With the discontinuation of the Corporate governance Report as stipulated in the new german Corporate governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019, the Declaration on Corporate governance has, in accordance with sections 289 f,  315 d of the german Commercial Code (hgB), become the central instrument for corporate governance reporting. the Board of management and the supervisory Board jointly issue the Declaration on Corporate governance and are responsible for the sections of the report that pertain to them. the Declaration on Corporate governance has been combined for Daimler Ag and the Daimler group. the following statements thus apply equally to Daimler Ag and the group insofar as not otherwise stated. pursuant to section 317 subsection 2 sentence 6 of the german Commercial Code (hgB), the purpose of the audit of the statements pursuant to section 289f subsections 2 and 5 and section 315d of the hgB is limited to determining whether such statements have actually been provided. the Declaration on Corporate governance can also be viewed on the internet at w /uni00A0daimler.com/corpgov/en.\n\nDeclaration by the Board of management and the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag pursuant to section 161 of the german stock Corporation Act (Aktg) regarding the german Corporate governance Code\n\nsince the issuance of the last compliance declaration in December 2019, Daimler Ag has satisfied all recommendations of the german Corporate governance Code published in the official section of the german Federal gazette on April 24, 2017 in the Code version dated February 7, 2017 ('Code 2017'), with the exception of Clause 3.8 paragraph 3 (D&o insurance deductible for the supervisory Board) and Clause 5.4.5 paragraph 1 sentence 2 (maximum number of supervisory board memberships for members of the management board of a listed corporation).\n\nD&O insurance deductible for the Supervisory Board (Clause 3.8, Paragraph 3, Corporate Governance Code, 2017). the Directors' & officers' insurance contains no provision for a deductible for the members of the supervisory Board that corresponds to the legally required deductible for members of the Board of management. given the function-related fixed remuneration without performance bonus components, setting such a deductible for supervisory Board members would not increase the motivation and sense of responsibility with which its members perform their tasks.\n\nthis recommendation is no longer contained in the german Corporate governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019.\n\nMaximum number of supervisory board memberships for\n\nmembers of the management board of a listed corporation (Clause 5.4.5 Paragraph 1 Sentence 2, Corporate Governance Code, 2017). in accordance with this recommendation, members of the management board of a listed corporation shall not accept more than a total of three supervisory board memberships in non-group listed corporations or on supervisory bodies of non-group entities that make similar requirements.\n\nA parallel recommendation with even stricter requirements can be found in Clause 5 of the german Corporate governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019.\n\nDaimler Ag satisfies the recommendations of the german Corporate governance Code published in the official section of the german Federal gazette on march 20, 2020, in the Code version dated December 16, 2019 ('Code 2019'), with the exception of the recommendations contained in C. 4 and C. 5 (maximum number of supervisory board memberships), and will continue to observe the recommendations with the aforesaid deviations.",

Between supervisory Board meetings, the Chairman of the supervisory Board has regular contact with the Board of management, and in particular with the Chairman of the Board of management, to discuss not only the group's strategy and business development but also issues relating to risk management and compliance. in addition, the Board of management regularly informs the Audit Committee and the supervisory Board of the most important risks facing the company and the group as a whole. the legal Affairs Committee supports the supervisory Board in carrying out its tasks with respect to the complex proceedings relating to emissions regulations and antitrust law with which Daimler Ag and its subsidiaries are confronted. the internal Auditing department monitors adherence to the legal framework and to group standards by means of targeted audits and initiates appropriate actions as required.\n\n## Accounting and the external audit\n\nDaimler prepares its consolidated financial statements and interim financial reports in accordance with the international Financial Reporting standards (iFRs), as adopted by the european union. the annual financial statements of Daimler Ag are prepared in accordance with the accounting standards of the german Commercial Code (hgB). Daimler prepares both halfyearly and quarterly financial reports. the consolidated financial statements and annual financial statements of Daimler Ag are audited by external auditors; interim financial reports are reviewed by external auditors. the consolidated financial statements and the group management reports are made publicly accessible via the Company's website within 90 days from the end of the reporting year; the interim financial reports are made publicly accessible in the same manner within 45 days from the end of the reporting period.\n\nBased on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the supervisory Board submits a proposal to the shareholders' meeting for the election of the external auditors for the annual company financial statements, for the consolidated financial statements and for the auditors' review of the interim financial reports. At the Annual shareholders' meeting on July 8, 2020, Kpmg Ag Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft, Berlin was elected to conduct the audit of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, and the external auditors' review of interim financial reports, for financial year 2020, as well as the external auditors' review of interim financial reports for financial year 2021 in the period leading up to the shareholders' meeting in 2021. Kpmg Ag Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft has been conducting the audit of the annual company financial statements and consolidated financial statements of Daimler Ag since the 1998 financial year; since 2014, the responsible auditor commissioned to carry out the external audit has been Dr. Axel th\u00fcmler.\n\nprior to issuing its recommendation to the Annual shareholders' meeting, the Audit Committee of the supervisory Board obtained a declaration from the external auditors under consideration. the external auditors were requested to state whether any business, financial, personal or other relationships existed between the external auditors and their bodies and audit managers on the one hand, and the Company and the members of its bodies on the other, which could justify concerns regarding a conflict of interest. this statement also describes the extent to which other services were performed for the Daimler group in the previous financial year or had been contractually agreed upon for the following year.\n\nthe Audit Committee instructed the external auditor to immediately inform the Committee Chairman of any indications of partiality or grounds for exclusion uncovered during the audit or the auditors' review of interim financial statements, and of all key findings and events relevant to the tasks of the supervisory Board, particularly findings or events related to suspected irregularities in accounting. the Audit Committee also reached an agreement with the external auditors stipulating that the external auditors would inform the Audit Committee, and make a note in the audit report, of any facts uncovered during the annual audit that would reveal inaccuracies in the Board of management's and the supervisory Board's declaration of compliance with the german Corporate governance Code.",

We rely on the diversity of our employees and the differences between them because such differences form the foundation for an effective and successful company. the aim of our activities is to bring together the right people to tackle our challenges, to create a work culture that promotes the performance, motivation and satisfaction of our employees and managers, and to help attract new target groups to our products and services. our activities for shaping diversity at Daimler focus on three areas: best mix, work culture and customer interaction. With our specific measures, activities and initiatives for everything from training formats for employees and managers to workshops, conferences, policies and target group-specific communication and awarenessraising measures, our diversity management system makes a major contribution to the further development of our corporate culture.\n\ntargeted support for women on the basis of the best-mix principle was a central component of our diversity management activities even before the legislation on the equal participation of women and men in executive positions went into effect. such support has also included and continues to include flexible working-time arrangements, company nurseries and special mentoring programs for women. in order to meet legal requirements, the Board of management of Daimler Ag has defined targets for the proportion of women at the two management levels below the Board of management and a deadline for achieving those targets. the details are described in a separate section. independently of the legal requirements, Daimler continues to affirm the goal it already set itself in 2006 of increasing the proportion of women in executive positions at the group (with the exception of Daimler greater China and trucks Asia) to 20% by 2020.

At least four times a year, the Audit Committee receives a report from the whistleblower system Bpo (Business practices office) on complaints and information about any breaches of regulations or guidelines by high-level executives, as well as violations by other employees of the regulations in a defined catalog of legal provisions. it regularly receives information about the handling of these complaints and notifications.\n\nthe Audit Committee discusses with the Board of management the interim reports before they are published. on the basis of the report of the external auditors, the Audit Committee reviews the annual company financial statements and the annual consolidated financial statements, as well as the management report of the Company and the group, and discusses them with the external auditors. the Audit Committee makes a proposal to the supervisory Board on the adoption of the annual company financial statements of Daimler Ag, on the approval of the annual consolidated financial statements, and on the appropriation of profits. the Committee also makes recommendations for the supervisory Board's proposal on the election of external auditors, assesses those auditors' suitability, qualifications and independence, and, a/fter the external auditors are elected by the Annual shareholders' meeting, it engages them to conduct the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements and to review the interim reports, negotiates an audit fee, and determines the focus of the annual audit. the external auditors report to the Audit Committee on all accounting matters that might be regarded as critical and on any material weaknesses of the internal control and risk management system with regard to accounting that might be discovered during the audit.\n\nFinally, the Audit Committee approves in advance permitted services that are not directly related to the annual audit and which are provided by the firm of external auditors or its affiliates to Daimler Ag or to companies of the Daimler group.\n\n## Legal Affairs Committee\n\nthe legal Affairs Committee is composed of six members, who are elected by a majority of the votes cast by the members of the supervisory Board. the members of the legal Affairs Committee during the reporting period were shareholder representatives Dr. Clemens B\u00f6rsig (Chairman of the legal Affairs Committee), Dr. manfred Bischoff and marie Wieck and employee representatives michael Brecht, michael h\u00e4berle and sibylle Wankel. the committee coordinates the exercise and performance of the rights and obligations of the supervisory Board with regard to ongoing legal proceedings relating to emissions regulations and antitrust law with which Daimler Ag and group companies are confronted. it also prepares and recommends associated resolutions for adoption by the supervisory Board. Within the framework of the agreement in principle reached in the reporting period with various us authorities concerning the settlement of civil and environmental law proceedings in connection with the emissions control systems of certain diesel vehicles, the Committee was assigned additional tasks and granted expanded decision-making authority with regard to fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the agreements in principle. these additional tasks include the control and supervision of the post settlement Audit team that was set up as part of this agreement in principle.\n\n## Mediation Committee\n\nAs prescribed by law, the mediation Committee is composed of the Chairman of the supervisory Board, Dr. manfred Bischoff, and his Deputy, michael Brecht, as well as one member of the supervisory Board representing the employees and one member of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders, each elected with a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders' and employees' representatives, respectively. During the reporting period, these two additional members were Dr. J\u00fcrgen hambrecht for the shareholders and Roman Zitzelsberger for the employees. the mediation Committee is formed solely to perform the function laid down in section 31 subsection 3 of the german Codetermination Act (mitbestg). As in previous years, the mediation Committee did not have to take any action in financial year 2020.",

At the same time that the targets are set, the boards have to set periods for their achievement, which may not be longer than five years.\n\non December 8, 2016, the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag passed a resolution stipulating that the target figure for the proportion of women on the Board of management of Daimler Ag would be 12.5%, while the deadline would be December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the eight-member Board of management included two women, Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger and Britta seeger. this means that women account for 25% of the Board of management members. on December 3, 2020, the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag passed a resolution stipulating that the target figure for the proportion of women on the Board of management of Daimler Ag would be 25%, while the deadline would be December 31, 2025.\n\non November 8, 2016, the Board of management passed a resolution stipulating a target of 15% women for both the first and second management levels of Daimler Ag below the Board of management, with a deadline of December 31, 2020. At the time of the resolution, the proportion of women at the first and second management levels below the Board of management was 8.0% and 12.4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the proportion of women at the first management level below the Board of management was 11.8%; at the second level it was 23.5%. the target for the first management level below the Board of management could not be reached by December 31, 2020. At the time the target was set in 2016, the deconsolidation of the Cars & vans and trucks & Buses divisions to the newly established mercedes-Benz Ag and Daimler truck Ag in financial year 2019 was not yet foreseeable. As a result of the deconsolidation, many management positions were transferred from Daimler Ag to mercedes-Benz Ag and Daimler truck Ag. Because of this, Daimler Ag has very few management positions overall at the first level below the Board of management. the target could no longer be achieved for these positions in financial year 2020. however, only a single woman still had to be appointed to reach the target.\n\nthe Board of management of Daimler Ag has also set itself the goal for the coming year of further increasing the proportion of women in top management positions. on November 25, 2020, the Board of management therefore passed a resolution stipulating a target of 20% women for the first management level below the Board of management and 25% for the second management level below the Board of management, with a deadline of December 31, 2025.\n\nlisted companies that have supervisory boards in which shareholders and employees are equally represented are required to have a proportion of at least 30% women and 30% men. this requirement has to be fulfilled by the supervisory Board as a whole. if the side of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders or the side representing the employees objects to the Chairman of the supervisory Board about the application of the ratio to the entire supervisory Board, the minimum ratio is to apply separately to the shareholders' side and to the employees' side for that election.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 30% of the shareholder representatives on the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag were women (sari Baldauf, petraea heynike and marie Wieck), while 70% were men. on that date, 30% of the employee representatives on the supervisory Board were women (elke t\u00f6njes-Werner, sibylle Wankel and Dr. sabine Zimmer), while 70% were men. in its meeting on December 3, 2020, the supervisory Board considered its nominations for the election at the 2021 shareholders' meeting and decided, upon the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, to propose at the 2021 Annual shareholders' meeting that elizabeth Centoni, Ben van Beurden and Dr. martin Bruderm\u00fcller be elected to the supervisory Board. the legally required gender ratio will be met both on the shareholder representatives' side and for the supervisory Board as a whole if these persons are elected to the supervisory Board, provided that no other changes occur.\n\nAlong with Daimler Ag itself, there are other group companies subject to codetermination law. these companies have defined their own targets for the proportion of women on their supervisory boards, executive management bodies and the two levels below the board or executive management level, and have also set deadlines for target achievement. All relevant information here has been published in accordance with applicable law.",

Decisions regarding appointments to specific positions on the Board of management are always governed by the Company's interests under consideration of all circumstances in each case.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the requirements profile for the Board of management included the following aspects in particular:\n\n- -   the members of the Board of management should have different educational and professional backgrounds, whereby at least two members should have a technical background. With markus sch\u00e4fer and Wilfried porth, as of December 31, 2020 the Board of management had two members who are engineers. since taking over as head of group Research & mercedes-Benz Cars Development on January 1, 2017, ola K\u00e4llenius has sustainably displayed his technical expertise.\n- -   on December 8, 2016, the supervisory Board defined a target of 12.5% for the proportion of women on the Board of management, with a deadline of December 31, 2020. the Board of management currently has two female members, Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger and Britta seeger. this means the proportion of women on the Board of management was 25% on December 31, 2020.\n- -   As a rule, 62 years of age serves as orientation for agerelated retirement. When it set this age limit, the supervisory Board deliberately decided in favor of a flexible rule allowing the required scope for the appropriate assessment of the circumstances of each individual case. As of December 31, 2020, all eight Board of management members were younger than the age limit.\n- -   in addition, a sufficient generational mix among Board of management members is to be taken into account in appointment decisions, whereby if possible at least three\n\nmembers of the Board of management should be 57 years of age or younger at the beginning of their respective term of office. this is the case for all current members of the Board of management, with the exception of Wilfried porth.\n\n- -   Decisions related to the composition of the Board of management should also take into account internationality in the sense of varied cultural backgrounds or international experience through assignments abroad lasting several years, whereby if possible, at least one member of the Board of management should come from a country other than germany. irrespective of the many years of international experience of a large majority of members of the Board of management, this target was achieved as of December 31, 2020 due to the international origins of ola K\u00e4llenius and Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger and through hubertus troska's focus on activities in China.\n- -   members of the Board of management do not hold more than three memberships of supervisory boards of non-group listed corporations or of supervisory board committees at non-group companies that have comparable requirements. this stipulation was met as of December 31, 2020. the only listed company in which hubertus troska is a member of a supervisory board or similar board outside the Daimler group is BAiC motor Corporation ltd. hubertus troska's other board memberships are at joint ventures that fall within his areas of responsibility and that do not have comparable requirements to a board membership at a listed company outside the group. the same applies to the external board memberships of Britta seeger. in spite of this, a deviation from the new german Corporate governance Code's recommendation regarding the maximum number of board memberships for board members of listed corporations has been disclosed and explained in the declaration of compliance for 2020. the new Code 2019 reduces this recommended maximum number relative to the Code 2017 from three to two supervisory board memberships or similar positions and further recommends that board members of listed corporations should not accept a position as chairman of a supervisory board in a non-group listed corporation.\n\nthe supervisory Board has made adjustments to two aspects of the requirements profile for members of the Board of management, with effect from January 1, 2021:\n\n- -   in the future, the unchanged age limit of 62 for members of the Board of management will apply to the beginning of the term of office of the Board of management member in question.\n- -   in view of the recommendations contained in the new german Corporate governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019, the members of the Board of management shall generally not accept more than two supervisory board memberships in listed corporations or assume similar positions, nor shall they accept a position as chairman of the supervisory board of a listed corporation, whereby any deviation from this principle shall be disclosed in the annual declaration of compliance. the supervisory board memberships of Board of management members in joint ventures that fall within their areas of responsibility are not considered similar positions within the meaning of the requirements profile.",

        "page_content": "the requirements profile for the Board of management otherwise remains unchanged. the aspects described above are to be taken into consideration when making Board of management appointments. on the basis of a target profile that takes into account specific qualification requirements and the abovementioned criteria, the presidential Committee creates a shortlist of available candidates whom it interviews. it then recommends a candidate to the supervisory Board for its approval and includes an explanation of its recommendation. Decisions regarding appointments to the Board of management are always governed by the Company's interests under consideration of all circumstances in each individual case. in the supervisory Board's view, fundamental personal criteria that make a person suited for a Board of management position include, in particular, the individual's personality, integrity, credible leadership qualities, expertise for the division he or she will head, previous achievements, knowledge of the Company, and the ability to adapt business models and processes in a changing world.\n\nin cooperation with the Board of management, the supervisory Board also ensures a long-term succession plan for the Board of management, for which it takes the requirements profile and the individual circumstances into account. the supervisory Board's presidential Committee regularly holds discussions about the Company's talented and extraordinary leaders. in doing so, it discusses the duration of the contracts of current Board of management members and the possibility of extending them as well as potential successors. executives at the management level below the Board of management and people of especially high potential are evaluated on the basis of an analysis of potential and the criteria of the requirements profile. the next development steps are then discussed and defined in cooperation with the Board of management. the successor planning process also includes a regular report from the Board of management regarding the proportion and development of the women managers, particularly with regard to the first and second management levels below that of the Board of management. the Board of management has to recommend a sufficient number of candidates to the supervisory Board. Daimler Ag wishes to primarily fill Board of management positions with managers that have risen within the Company. Despite this, it also evaluates potential external candidates for specific cases with the help of external human resources consultants and considers them in the selection procedure.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nthe supervisory Board is to be composed so that its members together are knowledgeable about the business sector in which the Company operates.\n\nthe requirements profile for the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag also aims at a supervisory Board as diverse and mutually complementary as possible. the supervisory Board as a whole shall understand the Company's business model and also possess the knowledge, skills and experience needed to properly execute its task of supervising and advising the Board of management, in particular specialized knowledge in the areas of finance, accounting, annual audits, risk management, methods of internal control and compliance. in general, the members of the supervisory Board should complement one another with regard to their specialist knowledge and professional experience in such a manner as to ensure that the supervisory Board can utilize the most broadly based wealth of experience and\n\nexpertise possible when making decisions. the supervisory Board also views the diversity of its members in terms of age, gender, internationality and other personal attributes as an important foundation for effective cooperation. the foundation for supervisory Board decisions regarding proposals on candidates for election at the shareholders' meeting is always the Company's interests under consideration of all circumstances in each individual case.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the requirements profile for the supervisory Board included the following aspects in particular:\n\n- -   the members of the supervisory Board should have different educational and professional backgrounds. At least five members should have completed a vocational technical training or education program or possess specific technological knowledge in fields such as information technology (including digitalization), chemistry, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. Decisions related to the composition of the supervisory Board should also take into account the fact that it may be necessary for members to obtain new skills and knowledge in order to be able to address product and market developments. irrespective of the specific knowledge in the above-mentioned areas acquired by many members of the supervisory Board in other functions, as of December 31, 2020, marie Wieck, Dr. J\u00fcrgen hambrecht, Dr. Bernd pischetsrieder, Dr. Frank Weber and Roman Zitzelsberger (three shareholder representatives and two employee representatives) had relevant university degrees, while another three employee representatives had completed vocational training in the above-mentioned fields or similar areas.\n- -   the gender composition of the supervisory Board meets the legal requirement stipulating that at least 30% of the members of the supervisory Board must be women and at least 30% must be men. As of December 31, 2020, the supervisory Board had three women who represent shareholders and three women who represent employees. the proportion of women is thus 30% among the shareholder representatives, the employee representatives and the supervisory Board as a whole.\n- -   Candidates for election to the supervisory Board who are to hold the position for a full term of office should generally not be over the age of 72 at the time of the election. in specifying this age limit, the supervisory Board has intentionally refrained from stipulating a strict upper age limit and instead decided in favor of a flexible general limit that leaves scope to appropriately assess each individual case, keeps the range of potential supervisory Board candidates sufficiently broad and allows reelection. in deciding to propose Dr. manfred Bischoff for reelection as a shareholder representative on the supervisory Board at the shareholders' meeting in 2016, it made use of this scope a/fter careful consideration and proper assessment. All other members of the supervisory Board during the reporting period, and the candidates who are to be proposed for election at the 2021 Annual shareholders' meeting, will not have reached the age limit at the time of their election.\n- -   A sufficient generational mix among supervisory Board members is also to be taken into account in appointment decisions. At least eight members of the supervisory Board should be no older than 62 years of age at the time of their",

None of the three candidates who are to be proposed for election at the 2021 Annual shareholders' meeting will be older than 62 years of age at the time the election takes place on march 31, 2021.\n\n- -   in order to ensure sufficient internationality, for example by means of many years of international experience, the supervisory Board has set a target of a proportion of at least 30% of international members representing the shareholders and the resulting proportion of at least 15% of the entire supervisory Board. irrespective of the many years of international experience of a large majority of the shareholder representatives on the supervisory Board, this target was overachieved as of December 31, 2020, with 25% for the entire supervisory Board due to the international origins of Bader Al saad, sari Baldauf, petraea heynike and marie Wieck on the shareholders' side (40%) and Raymond Curry on the employees' side.\n- -   At least half of the members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders should have\n- \u00b7  neither an advisory nor a board function for a customer, supplier, creditor or other third party,\n- \u00b7  nor a business or personal relationship with the company or its boards,\n\nwhose specific form could cause a conflict of interest.\n\nunder the premise that the performance of supervisory Board duties as an employee representative does not by itself constitute a potential conflict of interest, the requirements described here are deemed to be met by at least 15 members of the supervisory Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs described in the E /uni00A0Report of the supervisory Board, certain individual supervisory Board members did not participate in deliberations on certain specific agenda items during the reporting period in order to avoid the appearance of potential conflicts of interest in particular situations. sari Baldauf, for example, did not participate in discussions relating to the patent disputes between Daimler and Nokia. in addition, Dr. Bernd pischetsrieder and Dr. J\u00fcrgen hambrecht took highly precautionary measures to avoid potential conflicts of interest by not participating in several meetings that addressed legal proceedings relating to diesel exhaust gas emissions. As a result, in the case of at least half of the shareholder representatives on the supervisory Board, all of the employee representatives, and thus at least 15 members of the entire supervisory Board, there were no indications of potential conflicts of interest during the reporting period based on the premise described above.\n\n- -   in order to ensure the independent advice to, and supervision of, the Board of management by the supervisory Board, more than half of the members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders are to be independent as defined by the german Corporate governance Code. the supervisory Board may not include more than two former members of the Board of management of Daimler Ag or anyone who is a member of a board of, or advises, a significant competitor of the Daimler group. under the premise that the\n\nperformance of supervisory Board duties as an employee representative does not in itself call into question the independence of such an employee representative in this sense, at least 15 members of the supervisory Board are also deemed to be independent.\n\nthe supervisory Board itself, or the shareholder representatives themselves, are responsible for assessing the independence of supervisory Board members. Based on information that is known today, there are, in the view of the shareholder representatives, no indications for any members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders that relevant personal or business relationships or circumstances exist, in particular with the Company, members of the Board of management or other supervisory Board members, that could be construed as a substantial and permanent conflict of interest that would compromise the independence of a shareholder representative. in the view of the supervisory Board and under the premise described above with regard to employee representatives, this assessment also applies to all supervisory Board members representing the employees. No member of the supervisory Board is a member of a board of, or advises, a significant competitor. the Chairman of the supervisory Board, Dr. manfred Bischoff, is a former member of the Board of management.\n\nin the final analysis, the independence of supervisory Board member Bader Al saad is not compromised by his membership of the executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the Kuwait investment Authority. the Kuwait investment Authority is not a controlling shareholder of Daimler Ag that could attain an effective majority at an Annual shareholders' meeting. No other discernible circumstances exist that might call into question the independence of Bader Al saad. the mandate of supervisory Board member Roman Zitzelsberger as a member and as the Deputy Chairman of the codetermined supervisory Board of ZF Friedrichshafen Ag, a significant supplier to the Daimler group, cannot per se give rise to a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. on the one hand, this is not an executive, but rather a non-executive mandate. on the other, the Deputy Chairman of the supervisory Board of a codetermined company does not have the right of the Chairman of the supervisory Board to a casting vote in the event of a tie and renewed voting even in the absence of the Chairman.\n\nthe new recommendations in the german Corporate governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019 regarding the independence of members of supervisory boards went into effect on march 20, 2020. According to these recommendations, the supervisory Board should, while also taking the ownership structure into consideration, include what the shareholder representatives believe to be an adequate number of independent shareholder representatives as members of the supervisory Board. Within the meaning of the german Corporate governance Code, a supervisory Board member is to be considered independent if he or she is independent of the Company and its Board of management and of any controlling shareholder, whereby Daimler Ag has no controlling shareholder. Another new rule states that the recommendations contained in Code 2019 regarding the independence of members of codetermined supervisory boards only apply to shareholder representatives.",

        "page_content": "the new Code recommends that more than half of the members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders are to be independent of the Company and its Board of management - and these members must always include the Chairman of the supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the committee that makes decisions regarding remuneration for the Board of management. Within the meaning of this recommendation, a supervisory Board member is to be considered independent if he or she has no personal or business relationship with the Company or its Board of management that may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. it is up to the shareholders' side of the supervisory Board to assess the independence of members on the shareholders' side. Four indicators of a possible lack of independence are to be considered here: membership of the Board of management within a period of two years prior to the appointment as a member of the supervisory Board; a material business relationship with the Company or an enterprise dependent upon it - e.g. as a customer, supplier, creditor or advisor; a close family relationship with a member of the Board of management; membership in the supervisory Board for more than twelve years. All criteria here apply to both supervisory Board members themselves and to members of their immediate families. At the same time, the shareholders' side is expressly granted the right to consider a supervisory Board member independent if one or even multiple indicators apply. however, this view of the supervisory Board member as independent must be justified in the Declaration on Corporate governance.\n\nthe shareholder representatives on the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag have concluded that as of December 31, 2020, all members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders were independent of Daimler Ag and its Board of management this includes the Chairman of the supervisory Board, who is also the Chairman of the presidential Committee, which at Daimler Ag addresses issues including those relating to remuneration for the Board of management, and the Chairman of the Audit Committee.\n\neven under consideration of the indicators used in the new Corporate governance Code 2019, no supervisory Board member representing the shareholders has a personal or business relationship with Daimler Ag or its Board of management that may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. the patent dispute between Daimler and Nokia does not represent a set of circumstances that might cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest for sari Baldauf, nor is this the case with regard to the past memberships of Dr. J\u00fcrgen hambrecht or Dr. Bernd pischetsrieder. Joe Kaeser and timotheus h\u00f6ttges, as the Ceos of siemens Ag and Deutsche telekom Ag, respectively, do not have in their capacity as Ceo any material business relationship with Daimler Ag or an enterprise dependent upon Daimler Ag, within the meaning of the german Corporate governance Code. the volume of goods/services procured by Daimler from siemens and Deutsche telekom is very low.\n\nthe Chairman of the supervisory Board, Dr. manfred Bischoff, and the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr. Clemens B\u00f6rsig, as well as Dr. J\u00fcrgen hambrecht and sari Baldauf have been members of the supervisory Board for more than 12 years. however, these supervisory Board\n\nmembers also consistently maintain the required critical distance from the Company and its Board of management and employ the clear, vigilant and critical approach required for their supervision of the Board of management. All four of these members' administration of their offices has demonstrated that they perform their duties and carry out their various functions on the supervisory Board's committees in an exemplary manner. in addition, their many years of experience and expertise are of crucial importance for ensuring that the supervisory Board can effectively serve as a critical monitor of, and key and trusted advisor to, the Board of management. this is especially true with regard to Dr. manfred Bischoff in his capacity as Chairman of the supervisory Board, and thus the primary contact for the Board of management as well, and to Dr. Clemens B\u00f6rsig in his capacity as Chairman of the Audit Committee and Chairman of the legal Affairs Committee. the experience and knowledge of the Company they bring to the prominent positions they hold ensure stability and reliability. the supervisory Board believes that the stability and reliability of measures taken to supervise and advise the Board of management represent an important component for ensuring the sustained success of the Company, particularly in the current economic environment, which is making the extensive transformation of the automotive industry an even more difficult process. in conclusion, for these reasons, in the view of the shareholder representatives, all members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders - i.e. Dr. manfred Bischoff, Bader m. Al saad, sari Baldauf, Dr. Clemens B\u00f6rsig, Dr. J\u00fcrgen hambrecht, petraea heynike, timotheus h\u00f6ttges, Joe Kaeser, Dr. Bernd pischetsrieder and marie Wieck - are to be considered independent.\n\n- -   in accordance with the previous requirements profile, only candidates who have not yet been members of the supervisory Board for three full terms of office at the time of their election should generally be nominated for membership of the supervisory Board for a full term of office. this general length of service on the supervisory Board has not been exceeded by any current member. the indicator of a possible lack of independence due to membership of the supervisory Board for more than twelve years that was introduced in the new german Corporate governance Code (Code 2019), and with regard to which the members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders may take a different view, is taken into account in the updated requirements profile, with effect from January 1, 2021.\n- -   Candidates for membership of the supervisory Board and members of the supervisory Board must have sufficient time available to perform their duties. they must also be willing and able to dedicate themselves to their tasks and to participate in all courses of training and further training that might be necessary for the performance of their tasks.\n- -   in accordance with the previous requirements profile and the german Corporate governance Code in the version dated February 7, 2017, no member of the supervisory Board who is also a member of the board of management of a listed company may hold more than three memberships of supervisory boards of listed companies (including his or her membership of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag) or of supervisory bodies of other companies with similar requirements outside of the group of his or her board of management membership. in accordance with the requirements",

Nonetheless, a deviation from the maximum number of memberships for supervisory board members who are not members of the board of a listed corporation recommended in the new Code (2019) was disclosed and explained in the declaration of compliance from December 2020. pursuant to the Code (2019) such supervisory board members shall not accept more than five memberships of supervisory boards of nongroup listed corporations or comparable positions, whereby chairmanship of a supervisory board counts double.\n\nthe supervisory Board has made adjustments to three aspects of the requirements profile for members of the supervisory Board, with effect from January 1, 2021:\n\n- -Independence: Conditional upon the disclosure of a deviation in the declaration of compliance pursuant to section 161 of the german stock Corporation Act (Aktg), more than half of the members of the supervisory Board representing the shareholders are to be independent of the Company and its Board of management; the provision regarding an adequate number of members without any potential conflict of interest no longer applies, nor does the provision regarding an adequate number of independent members in relation to the supervisory Board as a whole.\n- -General limit on length of service: Candidates for (re)election to the supervisory Board should generally not have already served on the supervisory Board for 12 years.\n- -Maximum number of memberships: members of the boards of management of listed companies shall generally not accept more than a total of two supervisory board memberships in non-group listed corporations (including their membership of the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag) or similar positions, nor should they accept a position as chairman of the supervisory board of a non-group listed corporation, whereby any deviation from this principle must be disclosed in the annual declaration of compliance pursuant to section 161 of the german stock Corporation Act (Aktg); other members of the supervisory Board shall generally not accept more than a total of five supervisory board memberships in non-group listed corporations (including their membership on the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag) or similar positions, whereby chairmanship of a supervisory board\n\ncounts double. For the purposes of the requirements profile, membership of Daimler Ag supervisory Board members on two supervisory bodies within the Daimler group is still not taken into account.\n\nthe requirements profile otherwise remains unchanged.\n\nproposals by the supervisory Board of candidates for election by the shareholders' meeting as supervisory Board members representing the shareholders of Daimler Ag, for which the Nomination Committee makes recommendations, shall take into consideration the aspects described above and aim at fulfilling the overall requirements profile for the supervisory Board as a whole. on the basis of a target profile that takes into account specific qualification requirements and the abovementioned criteria, the Nomination Committee creates a shortlist of available candidates with whom it conducts structured discussions in which it also determines whether the candidate in question will have sufficient time available to perform his or her duties on the supervisory Board with due care. the Nomination Committee then recommends a candidate to the supervisory Board for its approval and includes an explanation of its recommendation. the foundation for supervisory Board decisions regarding proposals on candidates for election at the shareholders' meeting is always the Company's interests under consideration of all circumstances in each individual case .\n\nthe supervisory Board candidates elizabeth Centoni, Ben van Beurden and Dr. martin Bruderm\u00fcller will be nominated for election at the Annual shareholders' meeting 2021 for the first time. these candidates fulfill and strengthen the requirements profile of the supervisory Board.\n\nelizabeth Centoni, senior vice president strategy and emerging technology & incubation of Cisco systems, has a bachelor's degree in chemistry as well as many years of experience with so/ftware services, cloud computing and the internet of things. Ben van Beurden, Chief executive officer of Royal Dutch shell plc, has a master's degree in chemical engineering and Dr. martin Bruderm\u00fcller, Board of management Chairman of BAsF se, has a ph.D. in chemistry. the target of five supervisory Board members who have a technical background or specific technological expertise that has been more than met to date would thus be exceeded to an even greater extent if the nominated candidates were elected. moreover, the election of elizabeth Centoni would ensure that the legally required proportion of women (30%) would be met. All of the candidates are younger than 62 and have many years of international experience. in addition, elizabeth Centoni and Ben van Beurden come from a country other than germany. should the candidates be elected, the target of 30% international shareholder representatives would be exceeded even more than it already is.\n\nthe nominated candidates occupy high-level positions at other companies. Daimler has relations with almost all of these companies as part of its usual business operations. All of the nominated candidates are independent of the Company and its Board of management. None of them has a personal or business relationship with the Company, one of its dependent enterprises or its Board of management (e.g. as a customer, supplier, creditor or consultant) that may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. Ben van Beurden and Dr. martin Bruderm\u00fcller serve as the Chief executive offi-",

Besides the intended membership in the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag, neither of them is a member of a supervisory board at a non-group listed company or holds a similar position. in addition to being senior vice president of the listed company Cisco systems inc., elizabeth Centoni is a member of the Board of Directors of the listed company ingersoll Rand inc. however, she does not hold any other comparable positions beyond the intended membership in the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag. As a result, all of the candidates have fewer board memberships than the maximum number given in the requirements profile. the supervisory Board has also determined that all of the candidates for membership in the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag have sufficient time available to perform their duties and are willing and able to dedicate themselves to their tasks and to participate in all courses of training and further training that might be necessary for the performance of their tasks.\n\nthe terms of the shareholder representatives on the supervisory Board of Daimler Ag end at different times ('staggered board'). the Annual shareholders' meeting elects one or more shareholder representatives each year. having a staggered board enables the composition of the supervisory Board to be more flexibly adapted to a changing environment. moreover, it makes it easier to find suitable candidates because all of the shareholder representatives do not have to be elected during a single Annual shareholders' meeting.\n\nthe supervisory Board's Nomination Committee regularly determines which memberships end at which time and whether the respective members come into question for a further term in line with the aforementioned criteria and are also willing to do so. in its search for new candidates, the Nomination Committee also avails itself of independent external human resources consulting services.\n\n## shareholders and the shareholders' meeting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe shareholders exercise their membership rights, in particular their voting rights, at the shareholders' meeting. each share in Daimler Ag entitles its owner to one vote.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements\n\n## 1. significant accounting policies\n\n## General information\n\nDaimler Ag is a vehicle manufacturer with a worldwide product range of premium cars and commercial vehicles. its product portfolio is rounded out by a range of financial services and mobility services. Daimler Ag is the parent company of the Daimler group.\n\nthe Consolidated Financial statements of Daimler Ag and its subsidiaries ('Daimler' or 'the group') have been prepared in accordance with section 315e of the german Commercial Code (hgB) and comply with the international Financial Reporting standards (iFRs) as adopted by the european union (eu).\n\nDaimler Ag is a stock corporation organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of germany. the Company is entered in the Commercial Register of the stuttgart District Court under No. hRB 19360 and its registered office is located at mercedesstra\u00dfe 120, 70372 stuttgart, germany.\n\nthe Consolidated Financial statements of Daimler Ag are presented in euros (\u20ac). unless otherwise stated, all amounts are stated in millions of euros. All figures shown are rounded in accordance with standard business rounding principles.\n\nthe Board of management of Daimler Ag authorized the Consolidated Financial statements for publication on February 17, 2021.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\n## Applied IFRS\n\nthe accounting policies applied in the Consolidated Financial statements comply with the iFRs required to be applied in the eu as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## IFRS issued, EU endorsed and initially adopted in the reporting period\n\nin the second quarter of 2020, the international Accounting standards Board published an amendment to IFRS 16 ('Covid19-Related Rent Concessions') , in which they provide an accounting policy choice to lessees to apply practical relief for rent concessions arising because of the covid-19 pandemic. Daimler does not apply this practical expedient for lessees.\n\n## IFRS issued but neither EU endorsed nor yet adopted in may 2017, the iAsB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.\n\niFRs 17 will replace the currently applicable iFRs 4. it establishes more transparency and comparability with regard to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts with the insurer. the application of iFRs 17 is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or a/fter January 1, 2023. early adoption is permitted. Daimler currently does not expect any material impacts on the group's profitability, liquidity and capital resources or financial position due to the application of iFRs 17. early adoption is not currently planned.\n\nin August 2020 the iAsB published amendments to iFRs 9, iAs 39, iFRs 7, iFRs 4 and iFRs 16 (interest Rate Benchmark Reform/uni00A0- phase 2: Amendments to iFRs 9, iAs 39, iFRs 7, iFRs 4 and iFRs 16). the amendments address issues related to the application of the reform and its effects on financial reporting for lease contracts, hedges and other financial instruments caused by replacing existing interest-rate benchmarks with alternative benchmark rates.\n\nApplication is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or a/fter January/uni20091, 2021. Daimler has not opted for early adoption and no significant impact is expected.\n\nin addition, further standards and interpretations have been approved which are not expected to have a material impact on the group's profitability, liquidity and capital resources and financial position.\n\n## Presentation\n\npresentation in the Consolidated statement of Financial position differentiates between current and non-current assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are generally classified as current if they are expected to be realized or settled within one year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as assets and provisions for pensions and similar obligations are generally presented as non-current items.\n\nthe Consolidated statement of income is presented using the cost-of-sales method.",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\n## Adjustment of segment figures in the prior-year period due to the change in the Group's internal management and reporting structure as of January 1, 2020\n\nuntil December 31, 2019, the group's reportable segments were mercedes-Benz Cars, Daimler trucks, mercedes-Benz vans, Daimler Buses and Daimler mobility. since January 1, 2020, the group's activities are divided into the segments mercedes-Benz Cars, mercedes-Benz vans, Daimler trucks & Buses and Daimler mobility. this corresponds to the internal reporting and organizational structure. the segments mercedes-Benz Cars and mercedes-Benz vans are aggregated into the reportable segment mercedes-Benz Cars & vans in line with the nature of the products and services offered, as well as their brands, sales channels and customer profiles.\n\nthe figures for 2019 have been adjusted to the new segment structure to ensure that the figures for 2020 are comparable with the prior-year figures. the internal supply of goods and services within the new segments has been taken into account. Furthermore, in the figures for the previous year, the effects of certain legal issues and equity investments not previously allocated to the segments have been reclassified from the reconciliation to the vehicle segments.\n\nin this context, the amortization of capitalized borrowing costs is included in eBit as well as in the group's assets and the assets of the segments as of January 1, 2020. From the 2020 financial year onwards, eBit will be presented in the Consolidated statement of income as an arithmetical amount.\n\n## Measurement\n\nthe Consolidated Financial statements have been prepared on the historical-cost basis with the exception of certain items such as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, derivative financial instruments, hedged items, and pensions and similar obligations. the measurement models applied to those exceptions are described below.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nthe Consolidated Financial statements include the financial statements of Daimler Ag and the financial statements of all subsidiaries, including structured entities, which are directly or indirectly controlled by Daimler Ag. Control exists if the parent company has the power of decision over a subsidiary based on voting rights or other rights, if it participates in positive and negative variable returns from a subsidiary, and if it can affect these returns by its power of decision.\n\nstructured entities which are controlled also have to be consolidated. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated statement of Financial position. structured entities are entities which have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not relevant in deciding who controls the entity. this is the case for example if voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nthe financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries which are included in the Consolidated Financial statements are generally prepared as of the reporting date of the Consolidated Financial statements. the financial statements of Daimler Ag and its subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial statements are prepared using uniform recognition and measurement principles. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income and expenses as well as cash flows from transactions between consolidated entities are entirely eliminated in the course of the consolidation process.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.\n\nChanges in equity interests in group subsidiaries that reduce or increase Daimler's percentage ownership without change of control are accounted for as an equity transaction between owners.\n\n## Investments in associated companies, joint ventures or joint operations\n\nAn associated company is an entity over which the group has significant influence. significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Associated companies are generally accounted for using the equity method.\n\nFor entities over which Daimler has joint control together with a partner (joint arrangements), it is necessary to differentiate whether a joint operation or a joint venture exists. in a joint venture, the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. For joint ventures, the equity method has to be applied. A joint operation exists when the jointly controlling parties have direct rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. in this case, the prorated assets and liabilities and the prorated income and expenses are generally to be recognized (proportionate consolidation). Joint operations that have no significant impact on the Consolidated Financial statements are generally accounted for using the equity method.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the special event that the financial statements of associated companies, joint ventures or joint operations should not be available in good time, the group's proportionate share of the results of operations is included in Daimler's Consolidated Financial statements with a one to three-month time lag. significant events or transactions are accounted for without a time lag, however (see E /uni00A0Note 13).",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from sales of vehicles, service parts and other related products is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer. this generally occurs at the time the customer takes possession of the products.\n\ngenerally, payment from sales of vehicles, service parts and other related products is made when the customer obtains control of these products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDealers may finance their vehicle inventory by means of dealer inventory financing provided by Daimler mobility. Furthermore, end-customers may be credit financed by Daimler mobility. Receivables from sales financing with end-customers and dealers are presented in receivables from financial services. Further information is provided in E /uni00A0Note 14.\n\nRevenue recognition from the sale of vehicles for which the group enters into a repurchase obligation is dependent on the form of the repurchase agreement:\n\n- -   sales of vehicles by which Daimler is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as operating leases. this also applies to a call option that only grants Daimler the right to repurchase;\n- -   sales of vehicles including a put option (an entity's obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer's request) are reported as operating leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right at contract inception. otherwise, a sale with a right of return is reported. Daimler considers several factors when assessing whether the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his right. Amongst others, these are the relation between the agreed repurchase price and the expected future market value (at the time of repurchase) of the asset, or historical return rates.\n\nArrangements such as when Daimler provides customers with a guaranteed minimum resale value that they receive on resale (residual-value guarantee) do not constraint the customers in their ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the asset. At contract inception of a sale with a residual-value guarantee, revenue therefore has to be recognized, reduced by a potential compensation payment to the customer (revenue deferral).\n\nunder a contract manufacturing agreement, Daimler sells assets to a third-party manufacturer from which Daimler buys back the manufactured products a/fter completion of the commissioned work. if the sale of the assets is not accompanied by the transfer of control to the third-party manufacturer, no revenue is recognized under iFRs 15.\n\nthe group offers extended, separately priced warranties for certain products as well as service and maintenance contracts. Revenue from these contracts is deferred insofar as a customer has made an advance payment and is generally recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred based on historical information. A loss on these contracts is recognized in the current period if the expected costs for outstanding services under the contract exceed unearned revenue. usually, those contracts are paid in advance or in equal installments over the contract term.\n\nFor multiple-element arrangements, such as when vehicles are sold with free or reduced-in-price maintenance programs or with free online services, the group generally allocates revenue to the various elements based on their estimated relative stand-alone selling prices. to determine stand-alone selling prices, Daimler primarily uses price lists with consideration of average price reductions granted to its customers.\n\nvehicles may be initially sold to non-group dealers. subsequently a customer decides to enter into a leasing contract with Daimler mobility regarding such a vehicle. the vehicle is therefore sold by the non-group dealer to Daimler mobility and a leasing contract is entered into with the customer. When control of the vehicle is transferred to the non-group dealer Daimler recognizes revenue from the sale of the vehicle.\n\nthe incremental cost of obtaining contracts is recognized as an expense when incurred if the amortization period would be no longer than one year.\n\nDaimler does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if at contract inception it is expected that the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and payment by the customer will be no longer than one year.\n\nRevenue also includes revenue from the rental and leasing business as well as interest from the financial services business at Daimler mobility. Revenue generated from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the periods of the contracts. in addition, sales revenue is generated at the end of lease contracts from the subsequent sale of the vehicles. Revenue from receivables from financial services is recognized using the effective interest method.\n\nDaimler uses a variety of sales promotion programs dependent on various market conditions in individual countries as well as the respective product life cycles and product-related factors (such as amounts of discounts offered by competitors, excess industry production capacity, the intensity of market competition and consumer demand for the products). these programs comprise cash offers to dealers and customers as well as lease subsidies or loans at reduced interest rates which are reported as follows:",

Depreciation of the capitalized borrowing costs is presented within cost of sales.\n\n## Government grants\n\ngovernment grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in earnings over the life of a depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense. government grants which compensate the group for expenses are recognized as other operating income in the same period as the expenses themselves.\n\n## Profit/loss on equity-method investments\n\nthis item includes all income and expenses in connection with investments accounted for using the equity method. in addition to the prorated profits and losses from financial investments, it also includes profits and losses resulting from the sale of equity interests or the remeasurement of equity interests following a loss of significant influence or joint control. Daimler's share of dilution gains and losses resulting from the group's non-participation or under-proportionate participation in capital measures of companies in which shares are held and are accounted for using the equity method are also included in profit/loss on equity-method investments. this item also includes impairment losses and/or gains on the reversal of such impairments of equity-method investments.\n\n## Other financial income/expense, net\n\nother financial income/expense, net includes all income and expense from financial transactions which are included neither in interest income nor in interest expense, and which for Daimler mobility are included neither in revenue nor in cost of sales. For example, expense from the compounding of interest on provisions for other risks is recorded in this line item.\n\nFurthermore, income and expenses from equity interests are included in other financial income/expense, net, if such income or expenses are not presented under equity-method investments.\n\n## Interest income and interest expense\n\ninterest income and interest expense include interest income from investments in securities and from cash and cash equivalents as well as interest expense from liabilities. Furthermore, interest and changes in fair values related to interest rate hedging activities as well as income and expense resulting from the allocation of premiums and discounts are included. the interest components of defined benefit pension obligations and other similar obligations as well as of the plan assets available to cover these obligations and interest on supplementary income tax payments or reimbursements are also presented in this line item.\n\nFor the Daimler mobility segment interest income and expense and gains or losses from derivative financial instruments related to the financial services business are disclosed under revenue and cost of sales respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nincome taxes are comprised of current income taxes and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated based on the respective local taxable income and local tax rules for the period. in addition, current income taxes presented for the period include adjustments for uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods not yet finally assessed, however, excluding interest expenses and interest refunds and penalties on the underpayment of taxes. in cases for which it is probable that amounts declared as expenses in the tax returns might not be recognized (uncertain tax positions), a liability for income taxes is recognized. the amount is based on the best estimate of the expected tax payment (expected value or most likely amount). tax refund claims from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is probable that they can be realized. only in the case of tax loss carryforwards or unused tax credits, no liability for taxes or tax claim is recognized for these uncertain tax positions. instead, the deferred tax assets for the unused tax loss carryforwards or tax credits are to be adjusted.\n\nChanges in deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally recognized through profit and loss in deferred taxes in the Consolidated statement of income, except for changes recognized in other comprehensive income/loss or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated on the basis of temporary differences between the tax basis and the financial reporting of assets and liabilities including differences from consolidation, on unused tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. measurement is based on the tax rates expected to be effective in the period in which an asset is recognized or a liability is settled. For this purpose, the tax rates and tax rules are used which have been enacted at the reporting date or are soon to be enacted. Daimler recognizes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is unlikely that a corresponding amount of future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards and tax credits can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences in connection with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements are not recognized if the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.",

        "page_content": "## Daimler as lessee\n\nDaimler as a lessee recognizes for generally all lease contracts right-of-use assets as well as leasing liabilities for the outstanding lease payments.\n\nAccording to iFRs 16, a lessee may elect, for leases with a lease term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, not to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Daimler applies both recognition exemptions. the lease payments associated with those leases are generally recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis if appropriate.\n\nRight-of-use assets, which are included under property, plant and equipment, are initially measured at cost. the cost of a right-of-use asset comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received from the lessor, any initial direct costs and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling or removing the underlying asset.\n\nlease liabilities, which are assigned to financing liabilities, are measured initially at the present value of the lease payments. the lease liabilities include the following lease payments:\n\n- -   fixed payments including de facto fixed payments, less lease incentives receivables from the lessor;\n- -   variable lease payments linked to an index or interest rate;\n- -   amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees;\n- -   the exercise price of purchase options, when exercise is estimated to be reasonably certain and\n- -   contractual penalties for the termination of a lease if the lease term reflects the exercise of a termination option.\n\nDaimler generally also applies the option for contracts comprising lease components as well as non-lease components not to split these components.\n\nlease payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readily be determined. otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. the incremental borrowing rate, which is mainly applied at Daimler, is based on riskadjusted interest rates and determined for the respective lease terms and currencies. As the cash flow pattern of the reference interest rates (bullet bonds) does not correspond to the cash flow pattern of a lease contract (annuity), we use a duration adjustment in order to account for that difference.\n\nA right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and, if necessary, any accumulated impairment. if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. otherwise, the right-of-use asset is depreciated to the end of the lease term.\n\nin the subsequent measurement of a lease liability, the carrying amount is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced (through other comprehensive income) to reflect the lease payments made.\n\nAccording to iFRs 16, the depreciation of right-of-use assets is recognized within functional costs. the interest due on the lease liability is a component of interest expense.\n\nextension and termination options are part of a number of leases particularly of real estate. such contract terms offer Daimler the greatest possible flexibility. in determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances offering economic incentives for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options are taken into account. in determining the lease term, those options are only considered if they are reasonably certain.\n\n## Sale and leaseback\n\nin a sale and leaseback transaction, the requirements of iFRs 15 are applied to ascertain whether the transfer of an asset has to be accounted for as a sale.\n\nif the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirements of iFRs 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the transferred asset is still recognized and a financial liability is recognized equal to the transfer proceeds in accordance with iFRs/uni00A09.\n\nif the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale, the lessee accounting principles described above apply to those sold assets if Daimler leases them back from the buyer. Accordingly, only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor is recognized.",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\n## Daimler as lessor\n\nBased on the risk and rewards associated with a leased asset, it is assessed whether economic ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the lessee (so-called finance leases) or remains with the lessor (so-called operating leases).\n\noperating leases, i.e., by which economic ownership of the vehicle remains at Daimler, relate to vehicles that the group produces itself and leases to third parties. Additionally an operating lease may have to be reported with sales of vehicles for which the group enters into a repurchase obligation:\n\n- -   sales of vehicles by which Daimler is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future, are accounted for as operating leases. this also applies to a call option that only grants Daimler the right to repurchase.\n- -   sales of vehicles including a put option (an entity's obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer's request) are reported as operating leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right. otherwise, a sale with a right of return is reported. Daimler considers several factors when assessing whether a customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his right at contract inception. Amongst others these are the relation between repurchase price and the expected future market value (at the time of repurchase) of the asset or historical return rates.\n\nAs part of the residual-value management process, especially for operating lease contracts, certain assumptions are regularly made at local and corporate levels regarding the expected level of prices, based upon which the cars to be returned in the leasing business are evaluated. if changing market developments lead to a negative deviation from assumptions, there is a risk of lower residual values of used cars. Depending on the region and the current market situation, the measures taken generally include continuous market monitoring as well as, if required, price-setting strategies or sales-promotion measures designed to regulate vehicle inventories. the quality of market forecasts is verified by regular comparisons of internal and external sources, and, if required, the determination of residual values is adjusted and further developed with regard to methods, processes and systems.\n\nin the case of accounting as an operating lease, these vehicles are capitalized at (depreciated) cost of production under leased equipment and are depreciated over the contract term on a straight-line basis with consideration of the expected residual values. Changes in the expected residual values lead either to prospective adjustments of the scheduled depreciation or, if necessary, to an impairment loss. the vehicles are allocated to the segment which bears substantially all of the residual-value risk.\n\noperating leases also relate to vehicles, primarily group products that Daimler mobility acquires from non-group dealers or other third parties and leases to end customers. these vehicles are presented at (amortized) cost of acquisition under leased equipment in the Daimler mobility segment. if these vehicles are group products and are subsidized, the subsidies are deducted from the cost of acquisition. A/fter revenue is received from the sale to independent dealers, these group products generate revenue from lease payments and subsequent resale on the basis of the separate leasing contracts. the revenue received from the sale of group products to the dealers is estimated by the group as being of the magnitude of the respective addition to leased equipment at Daimler mobility. in 2020, additions to leased equipment from these vehicles at Daimler mobility amounted to approximately \u20ac11 billion (2019: approximately \u20ac14 billion).\n\nin the case of finance leases, the group presents the receivables under receivables from financial services in an amount corresponding to the net investment of the lease agreements. the net investment of a lease agreement is the gross investment (future lease payments and non-guaranteed residual value) discounted at the rate upon which the lease agreement is based.\n\n## Equity-method investments\n\non the date of acquisition, a positive difference between cost of acquisition and Daimler's share of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associated company or joint venture is determined and recognized as investor level goodwill. the goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the equity-method investment. if an equity interest in an existing associated company is increased without change in significant influence, goodwill is determined only for the additionally acquired interest; the previous investment is not remeasured at fair value.\n\nDaimler reviews on each reporting date whether there is any objective indication of impairments or impairment reversals of equity-method investments. if such indications exist, the group determines the impairment loss or reversal to be recognized. if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of an investment, the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment reversal is carried out if there is objective evidence for an impairment reversal. if such an assessment is made, the recoverable amount is remeasured. An impairment reversal is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount has increased subsequent to the impairment and is limited to the amount by which an asset has been impaired.\n\ngains or losses (to be eliminated) from transactions with companies accounted for using the equity method are recognized through profit and loss with corresponding adjustments of the investments' carrying amounts. gains or losses from the contribution of interests in subsidiaries to investments which are measured using the equity method are also subject to elimination adjustments to the carrying amount of the investment.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of non-current non-financial assets\n\nDaimler assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired or whether there is an indication that a previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed. if such indication exists, Daimler estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. the recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset unless the asset generates cash inflows that are not largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment; this takes place at the level of the cash-generating units. if the carrying amount of an asset or of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\n\nthe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For cash-generating units, Daimler in a first step determines the respective recoverable amount as value in use and compares it with the respective carrying amount (including goodwill). the cash-generating units are generally defined as the segments. At Daimler trucks & Buses impairment tests are carried out below the segment level. there is a differentiation between the two cash-generating units Daimler trucks and Daimler Buses.\n\nvalue in use is measured by discounting expected future cash flows from the continuing use of the cash-generating units using a risk-adjusted interest rate. Future cash flows are determined on the basis of the long-term planning, which is approved by management and which is valid at the date when the impairment test is conducted. this planning, which covers the period until 2025, is based on expectations regarding future market shares, the general development of respective markets as well as the products' profitability, taking into consideration the effects of the transformation of the automotive industry. Furthermore, in determining value in use, a risk assessment is performed, which includes for example market risks and risks related to the legal and political framework. the planning premises are checked for plausibility with regard to the historical development as well as external sources of information. the rounded risk-adjusted interest rates used to discount cash flows, which are calculated for each cash-generating unit, are unchanged from the previous year at 8% a/fter taxes for the cash-generating units of the automotive business. For the cash-generating unit Daimler mobility, a risk-adjusted interest rate of 9% a/fter taxes is applied (unchanged from the previous year). Whereas the discount rate for the cash-generating unit Daimler mobility represents the cost of equity, the risk-adjusted interest rate for the cash-generating units of the automotive business is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). this is calculated based on the capital asset pricing model (CApm), taking into account current market expectations. in calculating the risk-adjusted interest rate for impairment-test purposes, specific peer group information is used for beta factors, capital-structure data and cost of debt. periods not covered by the forecast are taken into account by recognizing a residual value (terminal value), which does not include any growth rates. in line with the detailed planning period, the derivation of the terminal value also considers expectations regarding the impacts of the transformation of the\n\nautomotive industry as well as possible regulatory changes, e.g., in connection with sustainability aspects. in addition, several sensitivity analyses are conducted. these show that even in the case of more unfavorable premises for main influencing factors with respect to the original planning, no need for impairment exists. if value in use is lower than the carrying amount, fair value less costs of disposal is additionally calculated to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nAn assessment for assets other than goodwill is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may be reversed. if this is the case, Daimler records a partial or entire reversal of the impairment; the carrying amount is thereby increased to the recoverable amount. however, the increased carrying amount may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior years.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups\n\nthe group classifies non-current assets or disposal groups as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. in this case, the assets or disposal groups are no longer depreciated but measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. immediately before classification as held for sale, the carrying amount of the asset is determined in accordance with the applicable individual requirements. if fair value less costs to sell subsequently increases, any impairment loss previously recognized is reversed. this reversal is restricted to the impairment loss previously recognized for the assets or disposal group concerned. the group generally discloses these assets or disposal groups separately in the Consolidated statement of Financial position.",

Acquisition or manufacturing costs for large numbers of inventories that are interchangeable are allocated under the average cost formula. in the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, manufacturing cost also includes production overheads based on normal capacity.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments in the form of financial assets and financial liabilities are generally presented separately. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as Daimler becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. in the case of purchases or sales of financial assets through the regular market, Daimler uses the transaction date as the date of initial recognition or derecognition.\n\nupon initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at fair value. For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial instruments are allocated to one of the categories mentioned in iFRs 9 Financial instruments (financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss). transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition or issuance are considered when determining the carrying amount if the financial instruments are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets primarily comprise receivables from financial services, trade receivables, receivables from banks, cash on hand, derivative financial assets, marketable securities and similar investments and financial investments. the classification of financial instruments is based on the business model in which these instruments are held and on their contractual cash flows.\n\nthe determination of the business model is carried out at the portfolio level and is based on management's intention and past transaction patterns. Assessments of the contractual cash flows are made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets with cash flows other than those of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding. Furthermore, financial assets that are held in a business model other than 'hold to collect' or 'hold to collect and sell' are included here.\n\nin addition, derivatives, including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract, which are not classified as hedging instruments in hedge accounting, as well as financial assets acquired for the purpose of selling in the short term that are classified as held for trading, are included here. gains or losses on these financial assets are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets at amortized cost. Financial assets at amortized cost are non-derivative financial assets with contractual cash flows that consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding and which are held with the aim of collecting the contractual cash flows, such as receivables from financial services, trade receivables or cash and cash equivalents (business model 'hold to collect'). Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, checks and demand deposits at banks, as well as debt instruments and certificates of deposits with a remaining term when acquired of up to three months, which are not subject to any material value fluctuations. Cash and cash equivalents correspond with the classification in the Consolidated statement of Cash Flows.",

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are non-derivative financial assets with contractual cash flows that consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding and which are held to collect the contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial assets, e.g., to achieve a defined liquidity target (business model 'hold to collect and sell'). this category also includes equity instruments not held for trading for which the option to present changes in the fair value of the instrument within other comprehensive income has been applied.\n\nA/fter initial measurement, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses being recognized in other comprehensive income/loss. upon disposal of debt instruments, the accumulated gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/loss resulting from measurement at fair value are recognized in profit or loss. interest earned on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is generally reported as interest income using the effective interest method. Changes in the fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or loss, but reclassified to retained earnings upon disposal. Dividends are recognized in profit or loss when the right to payment has been established.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, a loss allowance is recognized for financial assets, loan commitments and financial guarantees other than those to be measured at fair value through profit or loss reflecting expected losses for these instruments. expected credit losses are allocated using three stages:\n\nstage 1: expected credit losses within the next twelve months\n\nstage 1 includes all contracts with no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and usually includes new acquisitions and contracts with fewer than 31 days past due date. the portion of the lifetime expected credit losses resulting from default events possible within the next 12 months is recognized.\n\nstage 2: expected credit losses over the lifetime/uni00A0- not credit impaired\n\nif a financial asset has a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but is not yet credit impaired, it is moved to stage 2 and measured at lifetime expected credit loss, which is defined as the expected credit loss that results from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nstage 3: expected credit losses over the lifetime/uni00A0- credit impaired\n\nif a financial asset is defined as credit-impaired or in default, it is transferred to stage 3 and measured at lifetime expected credit loss. objective evidence for a credit-impaired financial asset includes 91 days past due date and other information about significant financial difficulties of the borrower.\n\nthe determination of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk is based on an assessment of the probability of default, which is made at least quarterly, incorporating external credit rating information as well as internal information on the credit quality of the financial asset. For debt instruments that are not receivables from financial services, a significant increase in credit risk is assessed mainly based on past-due information or the probability of default.\n\nA financial asset is migrated to stage 2 if the asset's credit risk has increased significantly compared to its credit risk at initial recognition. the credit risk is assessed based on the probability of default. For trade receivables, the simplified approach is applied whereby all trade receivables are allocated to stage 2 initially. hence, no determination of significant increases in credit risk is necessary.\n\nDaimler applies the low credit risk exception to the stage allocation to quoted debt instruments with investment-grade ratings. these debt instruments are always allocated to stage 1.\n\nin stage 1 and 2, the effective interest revenue is calculated based on gross carrying amounts. if a financial asset becomes credit impaired in stage 3, the effective interest revenue is calculated based on its net carrying amount (gross carrying amount adjusted for any loss allowance).",

For receivables from financial services, expected credit losses are mainly calculated with a statistical model using three major risk parameters: probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default.\n\nthe estimation of these risk parameters incorporates all available relevant information, not only historical and current loss data, but also reasonable and supportable forward-looking information reflected by the future expectation factors. this information includes macroeconomic factors (e.g., gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, cost performance index) and forecasts of future economic conditions. For receivables from financial services, these forecasts are performed using a scenario analysis (basic scenario, optimistic scenario and pessimistic scenario). the impairment amount for trade receivables is predominantly determined on a collective basis.\n\nA financial instrument is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, for example, at the end of insolvency proceedings or a/fter a court decision of uncollectibility.\n\nsignificant modification of financial assets (e.g., with a change in the present value of the contractual cash flows of 10%) also leads to derecognition of the financial assets with a simultaneous recognition of new financial assets. this is estimated to be rare and immaterial for receivables from financial services. if the terms of a contract are renegotiated or modified and this does not result in derecognition of the contract, then the gross carrying amount of the contract has to be recalculated and a modification gain or loss has to be recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Consolidated statement of Financial position provided that an enforceable right currently exists to offset the amounts involved, and there is an intention either to carry out the offsetting on a net basis or to settle a liability when the related asset is sold.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities primarily include trade payables, liabilities to banks, bonds, derivative financial liabilities and other liabilities.\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost. A/fter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Derivatives are presented as assets if their fair value is positive and as liabilities if the fair value is negative.",

For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative are recognized in profit or loss. For cash flow hedges, fair value changes in the effective portion of the hedging instrument are recognized a/fter tax in other comprehensive income.\n\nunder iFRs 9, for cash flow hedges in procurement transactions expected with a high degree of probability, designation can be made for separable risk components of these nonfinancial hedged items.\n\nunder iFRs 9, with cash flow hedges, amounts recognized in other comprehensive income as effective hedging gains or losses from hedging instruments are removed from the reserves for derivative financial instruments and directly included in the initial cost or carrying amount of the hedged item at initial recognition if the hedged item, e.g., forecast transaction, results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability.\n\nFor other cash flow hedges, the accumulated hedging gains or losses from hedging instruments are reclassified from the reserves for derivative financial instruments to the Consolidated statement of income when the hedged item affects profit or loss. the ineffective portions of fair value changes are recognized directly in profit or loss.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship, certain components can be excluded from designation and the changes in these components' fair value are then deferred in other comprehensive income under iFRs 9. this may apply for example to the time value of options, the forward element of a forward contract or cross currency basis spreads.\n\nhedge relationships are to be discontinued prospectively if a particular hedge relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting under iFRs 9. instances that require discontinuation of hedge accounting are, among others, changes to the designated hedged item, loss of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, disposal or termination of the hedging instrument, or a revision of the documented risk management objective of a particular hedge relationship.

For very long maturities, there are no high-quality corporate bonds available as a benchmark. the respective discount factors are estimated by extrapolating current market rates along the yield curve.\n\ngains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognized in profit or loss when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\n## Provisions for other risks\n\nA provision is recognized when a liability to third parties has been incurred, an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. the amount recognized as a provision represents the best estimate of the obligation at the reporting date. provisions with an original maturity of more than one year are discounted to the present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period. if the criteria of the regulations on recognition and measurement of provisions are not fulfilled and the possibility of a cash outflow upon settlement is not unlikely, the item is to be presented as a contingent liability, insofar as it is adequately measurable. the amount disclosed as a contingent liability represents the best estimate of the possible obligation at the reporting date. provisions and contingent liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change.\n\nA provision for expected warranty costs is recognized when a product is sold or when a new warranty program is initiated. estimates for accrued warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience.\n\nRestructuring provisions are set up in connection with programs that materially change the scope of business performed by a segment or business unit or the manner in which business is conducted. in most cases, restructuring expenses include termination benefits and compensation payments due to the termination of agreements with suppliers and dealers.

A refund liability occurs if Daimler receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received for which Daimler does not expect to be entitled and is thus not included in the transaction price.\n\nRefund liabilities occur at Daimler especially in the following circumstances:\n\n- -   obligations from sales transactions (especially performance bonuses, discounts and other price concessions) in the scope of iFRs 15, and\n- -   sales with the right of return and residual-value guarantees.\n\n## Share-based payment\n\nshare-based payment comprises cash-settled liability awards.\n\nliability awards are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement and are classified as provisions under consideration of vesting conditions. the profit or loss of the period equals the addition to and/or the reversal of the provision during the reporting period and the dividend equivalent paid during the period, and is included in the functional costs.\n\n## Presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n\ninterest paid as well as interest and dividends received are classified as cash provided by/used for operating activities. the cash flows from short-term marketable debt securities with high turnover rates and significant amounts are offset and presented within cash provided by/used for investing activities.",

Accounting estimates and management judgments\n\nin the Consolidated Financial statements, to a certain degree, estimates and management judgments have to be made which can affect the amounts and reporting of assets and liabilities, the reporting of contingent assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date, and the amounts of income and expense reported for the period. the major items affected by such estimates and management judgments are described as follows. Actual amounts may differ from the estimates. Changes in the estimates and management judgments can have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial statements.\n\n## Accounting estimates and management judgements due to the covid-19 pandemic\n\nDue to the still not fully foreseeable global consequences of the covid-19 pandemic, especially the accounting estimates and management judgements regarding the reporting of assets and liabilities are subject to increased uncertainty.\n\nWith the update of the accounting estimates and management judgements, available information on the expected economic developments and country-specific governmental countermeasures has been included.\n\nthis information was included in the analysis of the recoverability and collectability of financial assets, especially of receivables from financial services and equity-method investments, as well as in impairment tests for the cash-generating units. With regard to hedge accounting, estimates were updated concerning whether forecast transactions can still be assumed to be highly likely to occur. Furthermore, estimates of future residual values of leased vehicles, the measurement of provisions for residual-value guarantees and the measurement of the net realizable value of inventories have been updated to include the expected consequences of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Recoverable amounts of cash-generating units and equitymethod investments\n\nin the context of impairment tests for non-financial assets, estimates have to be made to determine the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units. Assumptions have to be made in particular with regard to future cash inflows and outflows for the planning period and the following periods. the estimates include assumptions regarding future market shares and the growth of the respective markets, as well as regarding the products' profitability. on the basis of the impairment tests carried out in 2020, the recoverable amounts are substantially larger than the net assets of the group's cash-generating units.\n\nWhen objective evidence of impairment or impairment reversal is present, estimates and assessments also have to be made to determine the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment. the determination of the recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding future business developments for the determination of the expected future cash flows of that financial investment. see E /uni00A0Note 13 for the presentation of carrying amounts and fair values of equity-method investments in listed companies.\n\n## Recoverable amount of equipment on operating leases\n\nDaimler regularly reviews the factors determining the values of its leased vehicles. in particular, it is necessary to estimate the residual values of vehicles at the end of their leases, which constitute a substantial part of the expected future cash flows from leased assets. in this context, assumptions are made regarding major influencing factors, such as the expected number of returned vehicles, the latest remarketing results and future vehicle model changes. those assumptions are determined either by qualified estimates or by publications provided by expert third parties; qualified estimates are based, as far as publicly available, on external data with consideration of internally available additional information such as historical experience of price developments and recent sale prices. the residual values thus determined serve as a basis for depreciation; changes in residual values lead either to prospective adjustments of the depreciation or, in the case of a significant decline in expected residual values, to an impairment. if depreciation is prospectively adjusted, changes in estimates of residual values do not have a direct effect but are equally distributed over the remaining periods of the lease contracts.\n\n## Collectability of receivables from financial services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe group regularly estimates the risk of default on receivables from financial services. many factors are taken into consideration in this context including historical loss experience, the size and composition of certain portfolios, current economic events and conditions and the estimated fair values and adequacy of collaterals. in addition to historical and current information on losses, appropriate and reliable forward-looking information on factors is also included. this information includes macroeconomic factors (e.g., gDp growth, unemployment rate, cost-performance index) and forecasts of future economic conditions. For receivables from financial services, these forecasts are determined using a scenario analysis (baseline scenario, optimistic and pessimistic scenario). Further external information, e.g., in connection with the covid-19 pandemic, which cannot be depicted in the scenarios, is/uni00A0- as far as necessary/uni00A0- included in the assessment through subsequent adjustments. Changes to the estimation and assessment of these factors influence the allowance for credit losses with a resulting impact on the group's net profit. see also E /uni00A0Notes 14 and 33 for further information.",

Based on historical warranty-claim experience, assumptions have to be made on the type and extent of future warranty claims and customer goodwill, as well as on possible recall campaigns for each model series. these assessments are based on experience of the frequency and extent of vehicle faults and defects in the past. in addition, the estimates also include assumptions on the amounts of potential repair costs per vehicle and the effects of possible time or mileage limits. the provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information. Further information on provisions for other risks is provided in E /uni00A0Note 23.\n\n## Liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvarious legal proceedings, claims and governmental investigations are pending against Daimler Ag and its subsidiaries on a wide range of topics. if the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to Daimler, the group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive damages, to undertake service actions or recall campaigns, to pay fines or to carry out other costly actions. litigation and governmental investigations o/ften involve complex legal issues and are connected with a high degree of uncertainty. Accordingly, the assessment of whether an obligation exists on the balance sheet date as a result of an event in the past, and whether a future cash outflow is likely and the obligation can be reliably estimated, largely depends on estimations by the management. Daimler regularly evaluates the current stage of legal proceedings, also with the involvement of external legal counsel. it is therefore possible that the amounts of provisions for pending or potential litigation will have to be adjusted due to future developments. Changes in estimates and premises can have a material effect on the group's future profitability. it is also possible that provisions recognized for some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient once such proceedings have ended. Daimler may also become liable for payments in legal proceedings for which no provisions were established. Although the final resolution of any such proceedings could have a material effect on Daimler's operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period, Daimler believes that it should not materially affect the group's financial position. Further information on liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings is provided in E /uni00A0Note 30.\n\n## Pensions and similar obligations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe calculation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations and the related pension cost are based on various actuarial valuations. the calculations are subject to various assumptions on matters such as current actuarially developed probabilities (e.g., discount factors and cost-of-living increases), future fluctuations with regard to age and period of service, and experience with the probability of occurrence of pension payments, annuities or lump sums. As a result of changed market or economic conditions, the probabilities on which the influencing factors are based, may differ from current developments. the financial effects of deviations of the main factors are calculated with the use of sensitivity analyses. see E /uni00A0Note 22 for further information.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nthe calculation of income taxes of Daimler Ag and its subsidiaries is based on the legislation and regulations applicable in the various countries. Due to their complexity, the tax items presented in the Consolidated Financial statements are possibly subject to different interpretation by taxpayers on the one hand and local tax authorities on the other. Different interpretations can occur especially in connection with the recognition and measurement of balance sheet items as well as in connection with the tax assessment of expenses and income. For the calculation of deferred tax assets, assumptions have to be made regarding future taxable income and the time of realization of the deferred tax assets. in this context, Daimler takes into consideration, among other things, the projected earnings from business operations, the effects on earnings of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and realizable tax strategies. As future business developments are uncertain and are sometimes beyond Daimler's control, the assumptions to be made in connection with accounting for deferred tax assets are connected with a substantial degree of uncertainty. on each balance sheet date, Daimler carries out impairment tests on deferred tax assets on the basis of the planned taxable income in future financial years; if Daimler assesses that the probability of future tax advantages being partially or fully unrealized is more than 50%, the deferred tax assets are impaired. Further information is provided in E /uni00A0Note 9.",

Furthermore, valuation allowances of \u20ac109 million that had been recognized in other comprehensive income/loss in 2019 were reversed. on the other hand, valuation allowances increased due to the recognition through profit and loss of \u20ac326 million. other neutral changes in valuation allowances resulted from, among other things, adjustments to tax-loss carryforwards from previous years, mainly due to expiration.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relates, among other things, to corporate income tax loss carryforwards (\u20ac772 million). \u20ac3 million of the deferred tax assets for corporate income tax loss carryforwards adjusted by a valuation allowance relates to tax loss carryforwards which expire in 2021, \u20ac173 million relates to tax loss carryforwards which expire at various dates from 2022 through 2025, \u20ac43 million relates to tax loss carryforwards which expire at various dates from 2026 through 2030, \u20ac10 million relates to tax loss carryforwards which expire at various dates from 2036 through 2040 and \u20ac543 million relates to tax loss carryforwards which can be carried forward indefinitely. valuation allowances of \u20ac46 million relate to tax loss carryforwards with regard to capital losses which can be carried forward indefinitely. With regard to trade tax loss carryforwards in germany, valuation allowances of \u20ac162 million relate to loss carryforwards which can be carried forward indefinitely. Furthermore, a large proportion of the valuation allowances relates to temporary differences as well as loss carryforwards for state and local taxes at the us-companies. Daimler believes that it is more likely than not that it will not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets or cannot reliably document that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards and tax credits can be offset. As the probability of more than 50% required by iAs 12 is therefore not fulfilled, valuation allowances were recognized on deferred tax assets also in countries with tax loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely.",

        "page_content": "the group had tax losses at the german tax group in 2020 and 2019 and at several subsidiaries in several countries in 2020 and prior years. A/fter offsetting the deferred tax assets with deferred tax liabilities, the deferred tax assets not subject to valuation allowances amounted to \u20ac2,197 million for those entities. Daimler believes it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow utilization of these deferred tax assets. Daimler's current estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that is considered realizable may change in the future, necessitating higher or lower valuation allowances.\n\nFrom the current perspective, the retained earnings of nongerman subsidiaries are largely intended to be reinvested in those operations. the group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings of non-german subsidiaries of \u20ac25,122 million (2019: \u20ac29,988 million) which are intended to be reinvested. if those earnings were paid out as dividends, an amount of 5% would be taxed under german taxation rules and, if applicable, with non-german withholding tax. Additionally, income tax consequences might arise if the dividends first have to be distributed by a non-german subsidiary to a nongerman holding company. Normally, the distribution would lead to an additional income tax expense. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxable temporary differences for these undistributed foreign earnings.\n\nthe group has various unresolved issues concerning open income tax years with the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. Daimler believes that it has recognized adequate liabilities for any future income taxes that may be owed for all open tax years. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that tax payments might exceed the liabilities recognized in the financial statements.\n\nAs a result of future adjudications or changes in the opinions of the fiscal authorities, it cannot be ruled out that Daimler might receive tax refunds for previous years.\n\n## D.23\n\n## Change of deferred tax assets, net\n\n|                                                                        | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in millions of euros                                                   |        |        |\n| Deferred tax assets, net                                               |        |        |\n| as of January 1                                                        | 1,868  | 259    |\n| Deferred tax benefit in the                                            |        |        |\n| Consolidated statement of income                                       | 206    | 1,261  |\n| Change of deferred tax assets/                                         |        |        |\n| liabilities on equity instruments/  debt instruments included in other |        |        |\n| comprehensive income/loss                                              | -42    | 3      |\n| Change of deferred tax assets/                                         |        |        |\n| liabilities on derivative financial                                    |        |        |\n| instruments included in other                                          |        |        |\n| comprehensive income/loss                                              | -345   | 186    |\n| Change of deferred tax assets/                                         |        |        |\n| liabilities on actuarial gains/                                        |        |        |\n| losses from defined benefit                                            |        |        |\n| pension plans included in other                                        |        |        |\n| comprehensive income/loss                                              | 841    | 232    |\n| other changes 1                                                        | 82     | -73    |\n| Deferred tax assets, net                                               |        |        |\n| as of December 31                                                      | 2,610  | 1,868  |\n\n- 1  the other changes primarily relate to effects from currency translation.\n\n## D.24\n\n## Tax expense in equity\n\n|                                                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in millions of euros                                        |        |        |\n| income tax expense in the Consolidated  statement of income | -2,330 | -1,121 |\n| income tax benefit  recorded in other reserves              | 454    | 421    |\n|                                                             | -1,876 | -700   |",

Receivables from financial services\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.40 shows the components of receivables from financial services.\n\n## Types of receivables\n\nReceivables from sales financing with customers include receivables from credit financing for customers who purchased their vehicle either from a dealer or directly from Daimler.\n\nReceivables from sales financing with dealers represent loans for floor financing programs for vehicles sold by the group's automotive businesses to dealers or loans for assets purchased by dealers from third parties, primarily, used vehicles traded in by dealers' customers or real estate such as dealers' showrooms.\n\nReceivables from finance lease contracts consist of receivables from leasing contracts for which all substantial risks and rewards incidental to the leasing objects are transferred to the lessee.\n\nAll cash flow effects attributable to receivables from financial services are presented within cash provided by/used for operating activities in the Consolidated statement of Cash Flows.\n\nin 2020, Daimler recognized a gain of \u20ac357 million (2019: \u20ac343 million) as the difference between the additions to receivables from finance lease contracts and the carrying amounts of the underlying assets (especially in connection with the delivery of vehicles to consolidated companies).\n\n## Loss allowances\n\nthe development of loss allowances for receivables from financial services due to expected credit losses is shown in table \uf0e4 D.42 .\n\n## D.40\n\n## Receivables from financial services\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.41 shows the

        |\n\nAt December 31, 2020, \u20ac0.4 billion of the loss allowances relates to the increase in the allowance for credit losses recognized at the Daimler mobility segment through profit and loss as a result of the economic development in connection with the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, the calculation of the allowance for credit losses considers, among other things, that customers' current financial solvency is positively affected by offered national programs and programs of Daimler mobility.\n\nthe carrying amounts of receivables from financial services based on modified contracts that are shown in stages 2 and 3, amounted to \u20ac2,440 million at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: \u20ac387 million). in addition, carrying amounts of \u20ac473 million (December 31, 2019: \u20ac314 million) in connection with contractual modifications were reclassified from stages 2 and 3 into stage 1.\n\n## Credit risks\n\ninformation on credit risks included in receivables from financial services is shown in table \uf0e4 D.43 .\n\nlonger overdue periods regularly lead to higher allowances.\n\nAt the beginning of the contracts, collaterals of usually at least 100% of the carrying amounts were agreed, which are backed by the vehicles based on the underlying contracts. over the contract terms, the amounts of the collaterals are included in the calculation of the risk provisioning, so the carrying amounts of the credit-impaired contracts are primarily backed by the underlying vehicles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on financial risks and the nature of risks is provided in E /uni00A0Note 33.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt December 31, 2020, receivables from financial services with a carrying amount of \u20ac11,463 million (December 31, 2019: \u20ac8,941 million) were pledged mostly as collateral for liabilities from ABs transactions (see also E /uni00A0N ote 24).",

service contract expired on December 31, 2019. expense in 2019 also includes the complete vesting of rights granted from 2017 to 2019.\n\n## Performance Phantom Share Plans\n\nin 2020, the group adopted a performance phantom share plan (ppsp), similar to those used in previous years, under which eligible employees are granted phantom shares entitling them to receive cash payments a/fter four years. During the four-year period between the allocation of the preliminary phantom shares and the payout of the plan at the end of the term, the phantom shares earn a dividend equivalent to the amount of the actual dividend paid on ordinary Daimler shares. the amount of cash paid to eligible employees at the end of the holding period is based on the number of vested phantom shares (determined over a three-year performance period) multiplied by the quoted price of Daimler's ordinary shares (calculated as an average price over a specified period at the end of the four-year plan period). the vesting period is therefore four years. For the existing plans, the quoted price of Daimler's ordinary shares to be used for the payout is limited to 2.5 times the Daimler share price at the date of grant. Furthermore, the payout for the members of the Board of management is also limited to 2.5 times the allotment value used to determine the preliminary number of phantom shares. the limitation of the payout for the members of the Board of management also includes the dividend equivalent.\n\nthe number of phantom shares that vest of the ppsps granted in 2015 to 2020 is based on the relative share performance, which measures the development of the price of a share-price index based on a competitor group including Daimler, and the return on sales (Ros) compared with the average Ros of a competitor group. in addition, beginning with plan ppsp 2018, the average Ros of the competitor group is revenue-weighted.\n\nspecial rules apply for the members of the Board of management: Daimler's Ros must be not equal to but higher than that of the competitors in order to achieve the same target achievement as the other plan participants. For the ppsp granted in 2015 to 2020, an additional limit on target achievement was agreed upon for the reference parameter Ros for the members of the Board of management. in the case of target achievement between 195% and 200%, an additional comparison is made on the basis of the Ros achieved in absolute terms. if the actual Ros for the automotive business is below the strategic target (currently 9%) in the third year of the performance period, target achievement is limited to 195%.\n\nthe group recognizes a provision for awarding the ppsp in the Consolidated statement of Financial position. since payment per vested phantom share depends on the quoted price of Daimler's ordinary shares, that quoted price essentially represents the fair value of each phantom share. the proportionate remuneration expenses from the ppsp recognized in the individual years are measured based on the price of Daimler ordinary shares and the estimated target achievement.",

        "page_content": "## 22. pensions and similar obligations\n\nAt the Daimler group, defined benefit pension obligations exist as well as, to a smaller extent, defined contribution pension obligations, specific to the various countries. in addition, healthcare benefit obligations are recognized outside germany.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans\n\nprovisions for pension obligations are made for defined commitments to active and former employees of the Daimler group and their survivors. the defined benefit pension plans provided by Daimler generally vary according to the economic, tax and legal circumstances of the country concerned. most of the defined benefit pension plans also provide benefits in the case of invalidity and death.\n\nthe group's main german and non-german pension plans are described below.\n\n## German pension plans and pension plan assets\n\nmost employees in germany have defined benefit pension plans; most of the pension plans for the active workforce are based on individual retirement benefit accounts, to which the Company makes annual contributions. the amount of the contributions for employees paid according to wage-tariff agreements depends on the tariff classification in the respective year or on their respective income, and for executives it depends on their respective income. For the commitments to retirement benefits made until 2011, the contributions continue to be converted into capital components and credited to the individual pension accounts with the application of fixed factors related to each employee's age. the conversion factors include a fixed value increase. For the commitments to retirement benefits made as of 2011, the Company guarantees at a minimum the value of the contributions paid into a cash-balance plan. pension payments are made either as a life annuity, twelve annual installments, or a single lump sum.\n\nin addition, previously concluded defined benefit plans exist which primarily depend on employees' wage-tariff classification upon transition into the benefit phase and which foresee a life annuity.\n\nAs well as the employer-financed pension plans granted by german companies, the employees of some companies are also offered various earnings-conversion models.\n\nmost of the pension obligations in germany relating to defined benefit pension plans are funded by investment funds. Contractual trust arrangements (CtA) exist between Daimler Ag as well as some subsidiaries in germany and the Daimler pension trust e.v. the Daimler pension trust e.v. acts as a collateral trust fund.\n\n## D.52\n\n## Composition of provisions for pensions and similar obligations\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.52 shows the composition of provisions for pension benefit plans and similar obligations.\n\n|                                               | At December 31,   | At December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                               | 2020              | 2019              |\n| in millions of euros                          |                   |                   |\n| provision for pension benefits                | 11,047            | 8,518             |\n| provision for other post-employment  benefits | 1,023             | 1,210             |\n|                                               | 12,070            | 9,728             |\n\nin 2018, Daimler Ag transferred certain defined benefit obligations and plan assets of retired employees to Daimler pensionsfonds Ag (pension fund). these benefits will be administrated by that non-insurance-like pension fund, which falls under the scope of the Act on the supervision of insurance undertakings and is therefore subject to the oversight of the Federal Financial supervisory Agency (BaFin). insofar as in the future, BaFin rules that a deficit has occurred in the pension fund, a supplementary contribution will be required from Daimler Ag.\n\nin germany, there are normally no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements.\n\n## Non-German pension plans and pension plan assets\n\nsignificant plans exist primarily in the united states and Japan. they comprise plans relating to final salaries as well as plans relating to salary-based components. most of the obligations outside germany from defined benefit pension plans are funded by investment funds.\n\n## Risks from defined benefit pension plans and pension plan assets\n\nthe general requirements with regard to retirement benefit models are included in guidelines with group-wide validity. Accordingly, the committed benefits are intended to contribute to additional financial security during retirement, and in the case of death or invalidity to be capable of being planned and fulfilled by the respective company of the group and to have a low-risk structure. in addition, a committee exists that approves new pension plans and amendments to existing pension plans as well as guidelines relating to company retirement benefits.\n\nthe obligations from defined benefit pension plans and the pension plan assets can be subject to fluctuations over time. this can cause the funded status to be negatively or positively impacted. Fluctuations in the defined benefit pension obligations result at the Daimler group in particular from changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and increases in the cost of living, but also from changes in demographic assumptions such as adjusted life expectancies. With most of the german plans, expected long-term wage and salary increases do not have an impact on the amount of the obligation.",

Comparable country-specific calculation methods are used for non-german plans.\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.56 shows the significant weighted average measurement factors used to calculate pension benefit obligations.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAn increase or decrease in the main actuarial assumptions would affect the present value of the defined benefit pension obligations as shown in table \uf0e4 D.57.\n\nthe calculations carried out by actuaries were done in isolation for the evaluation parameters regarded as important. this means that if there is a simultaneous change in several parameters, the individual results cannot be summed due to correlation effects. With a change in the parameters, the sensitivities shown cannot be used to derive a linear development of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nFor the calculation of the sensitivity of life expectancy, by means of fixed (non-age-dependent) factors for a reference person, a life expectancy one year higher or one year lower is arrived at.\n\n## Effect on future cash flows\n\nDaimler currently plans to make contributions of \u20ac0.8 billion to its pension plans for the year 2021; the final amount is usually set in the fourth quarter of a financial year. in addition, the group expects to make pension benefit payments of \u20ac1.1 billion in 2021.\n\nthe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations is shown in table \uf0e4 D.58 .\n\n## Defined contribution pension plans\n\nunder defined contribution pension plans, Daimler makes defined contributions to external insurance policies or investment funds. there are fundamentally no further contractual obligations or risks for Daimler in excess of the defined contributions. the group also pays contributions to governmental pension schemes. in 2020, the total cost from defined contribution plans amounted to \u20ac1.6 billion (2019: \u20ac1.6 billion). of those payments, \u20ac1.5 billion (2019: \u20ac1.5 billion) was related to governmental pension plans.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nCertain foreign subsidiaries of Daimler, mainly in the united states, provide their employees with post-employment health care benefits with defined entitlements, which have to be accounted for as defined benefit plans. in 2020, future contributions to other post-employment benefits of one plan in the united states were adjusted. this resulted in a gain of \u20ac147 million, which is presented under functional costs in the mercedes-Benz Cars & vans segment. table \uf0e4 D.59 shows key data for other post-employment benefits.\n\nsignificant risks in connection with commitments for other post-employment benefits (medical care) relate to rising healthcare costs and lower contributions to those costs from the public sector. in addition, these plans are subject to the usual risks for defined benefit plans, in particular the risk of changes in discount rates.",

various types of product warranties, under which it generally guarantees the performance of products delivered and services rendered for a certain period. the provision for these product warranties covers expected costs for legal and contractual warranty claims as well as expected costs for goodwill concessions and recall campaigns. this also includes measures relating to mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles in various regions as well as recalls, in particular for an extended recall of takata airbags. the utilization date of product warranties depends on the incidence of the warranty claims and can span the entire term of the product warranties. the cash outflow for non-current product warranties are primarily expected within a period until 2023.\n\n## Personnel and social costs\n\nprovisions for personnel and social costs primarily comprise expected expenses of the group for employee anniversary bonuses, profit sharing arrangements and management bonuses as well as early-retirement and partial-retirement plans. the additions recorded to the provisions for profit sharing and management bonuses in the reporting year usually result in cash outflows in the following year. the cash outflows for non-current provisions for personnel and social costs are primarily expected within a period until 2031.\n\n## D.60\n\nProvisions for other risks\n\n|

Consolidated statement of Cash Flows\n\n## Calculation of funds\n\nAt December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents included restricted funds of \u20ac133 million (2019: \u20ac64 million). the restricted funds primarily relate to subsidiaries where exchange controls apply so that the group has restricted access to the funds.\n\n## Cash provided by operating activities\n\nChanges in other operating assets and liabilities are shown in table \uf0e4 D.66 .\n\nthe decrease in provisions in comparison to the prior year period was significantly related to prior year effects that primarily resulted from provisions for warranties and customer goodwill obligations as well as provisions for litigation risks and regulatory proceedings. the increase of the provisions in the prior year period related to ongoing governmental and legal proceedings and measures taken with regard to mercedesBenz diesel vehicles, as well as recalls of vehicles especially related to takata airbags. in addition, the other provisions led to an increase especially due to the review and prioritization of the product portfolio at the mercedes-Benz vans segment. the increase of the miscellaneous other assets and liabilities in comparison to the prior year period was highly affected by the worldwide consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. positive effects resulted from tax rebates and liabilities in connection with vAt as well as liabilities related to employees which were partially offset by negative effects in connection with contract liabilities.\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.67 shows cash flows included in cash provided by operating activities. in the prior year period the cash effect of a carried out off-balance-sheet ABs transaction was shown in the cash flow provided by operating activities. the transaction resulted in a cash inflow of \u20ac0.9 billion.\n\nthe line item other non-cash expense and income within the reconciliation of profit before income taxes to cash provided by operating activities in the reporting year primarily comprised the group's share in the profit/loss of companies accounted for using the equity method as well as an impairment loss with respect to its investment in BAiC motor due to a reassessment of the business development in light of the covid-19 pandemic. in the prior year, the line item primarily comprised the group's share in the profit/loss of companies accounted for using the equity method and effects due to the review and prioritization of the product portfolio at the mercedes-Benz vans segment.\n\n## D.66\n\n## Changes in other operating assets and liabilities\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.68 includes changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, divided into cash and non-cash components. the decrease in other changes in comparison to the prior year primarily resulted from the initial application of lessee accounting according to iFRs 16 in the prior year.\n\n|                                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in millions of euros                       |        |        |\n| provisions                                 | -323   | 5,217  |\n| Financial instruments                      | -31    | 104    |\n| miscellaneous other assets and liabilities | 1,007  | 320    |\n|                                            | 653    | 5,641  |\n\n## D.67\n\n## Cash flows included in cash provided by operating activities\n\n|                                                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in millions of euros                               |        |        |\n| interest paid                                      | -158   | -725   |\n| interest received                                  | 179    | 337    |\n| Dividends received from  equity-method investments | 1,783  | 1,202  |\n| Dividends received from other  shareholdings       | 25     | 94     |\n\n## D.68\n\n## Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities\n\n|                                   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in millions of euros              |        |        |\n| Cash flows                        | -9,503 | 9,404  |\n| Changes in foreign exchange rates | -7,023 | 2,130  |\n| Fair value changes                | -584   | 157    |\n| other changes                     | 997    | 5,310  |\n\n## Cash used for financing activities\n\nCash used for financing activities includes cash flows from hedging the currency risks of financial liabilities. in 2020, cash used for financing activities included payments for the reduction of outstanding leasing liabilities of \u20ac729 million (2019: \u20ac701 million).",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\n## 30. legal proceedings\n\nDaimler Ag and its subsidiaries are confronted with various legal proceedings, claims as well as governmental investigations and orders (legal proceedings) on a large number of topics, including vehicle safety, emissions, fuel economy, financial services, dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships, intellectual property rights (including but not limited to patent infringement actions), warranty claims, environmental matters, antitrust matters (including actions for damages) as well as investor litigation. product-related litigation involves claims alleging faults in vehicles. some of these claims are asserted by way of class actions. if the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to Daimler or such legal proceedings are settled, the group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive damages or to undertake service actions, recall campaigns, monetary penalties or other costly actions. legal proceedings and related settlements may have an impact on the group's reputation.\n\n## Diesel emission behavior: governmental proceedings\n\nAs already reported, several authorities and institutions worldwide were, and still are, active in the form of inquiries, investigations, procedures and/or orders. these activities particularly relate to test results, the emission control systems used in mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and/or Daimler's interaction with the relevant authorities as well as related legal issues and implications, including, but not limited to, under applicable environmental, criminal and antitrust laws.\n\nin the united states, Daimler Ag and mercedes-Benz usA, llC (mBusA) reached agreements in the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to settle civil and environmental claims regarding emission control systems of certain diesel vehicles. the involved us authorities are the environmental agencies environmental protection Agency (\u00bbepA\u00ab) and California Air Resources Board (\u00bbCARB\u00ab), the environmental and Natural Resources Division of the u.s. Department of Justice (\u00bbDoJ\u00ab), the California Attorney general's office as well as the u.s. Customs and Border protection (\u00bbCBp\u00ab).\n\nthe authorities take the position that Daimler failed to disclose Auxiliary emission Control Devices (AeCDs) in certain of its us diesel vehicles and that several of these AeCDs are illegal defeat devices. As part of these settlements, Daimler denies the allegations by the authorities and does not admit liability, but has agreed to, among other things, pay civil penalties, conduct an emission modification program for affected vehicles, provide extended warranties, undertake a nationwide mitigation project, take certain corporate compliance measures and make other payments. the company has cooperated fully with the us authorities. the settlements are subject to final court approval. upon approval, they will be final and effective. Daimler expects costs of the settlements with the us authorities of approximately usD 1.5 billion. the estimated cost for the us consumer class action mentioned below amounts to around usD 700 million. in addition, Daimler estimates further expenses of a mid three-digit-million euro amount to fulfill requirements of these settlements.\n\nAs already reported, in April 2016, the DoJ requested that Daimler conduct an internal investigation. While Daimler has conducted such internal investigation as part of DoJ's investigation, DoJ's investigation is ongoing. in Canada, the Canadian environmental regulator environment and Climate Change Canada (\u00bbeCCC\u00ab) is conducting an investigation in connection with Diesel exhaust emissions. Daimler continues to cooperate with the investigating authorities.\n\nin germany, the stuttgart district attorney's office is conducting criminal investigation proceedings against Daimler employees on the suspicion of fraud and criminal advertising. in February 2019, the stuttgart district attorney's office also initiated a formal investigation proceeding against Daimler Ag with respect to an administrative offense. in september 2019, it issued a fine notice against Daimler based on a negligent violation of supervisory duties in the amount of \u20ac870 million which has become legally binding, thereby concluding the administrative offense proceedings against Daimler.\n\nsince 2018, the german Federal motor transport Authority ('KBA') has repeatedly issued subsequent auxiliary provisions for the eC type approvals of certain mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and has ordered mandatory recalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first registration. in each of those cases, it held that certain calibrations of specified functionalities in certain mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles are to be qualified as impermissible defeat devices. Daimler has a contrary legal opinion on this question. since 2018, however, it has (in view of KBA's interpretation of the law as a precautionary measure) implemented a temporary delivery and registration stop with respect to certain models, also covering the used car, leasing and financing businesses, and is constantly reviewing whether it can li/ft this delivery and registration stop in whole or in part. Daimler has filed timely objections against the KBA's administrative orders mentioned above. in early 2021, the KBA issued objection orders (\u00bbWiderspruchsbescheide\u00ab) in certain of the proceedings not following the arguments brought forward by Daimler. since Daimler still does have a different understanding of the relevant legal provisions, it currently analyzes whether the controversial questions at issue should be clarified in a court of law. irrespective of such objections and possibly following lawsuits, Daimler continues to cooperate fully with the KBA. the new calibrations requested by KBA are being processed, and for a substantial proportion of the vehicles, the relevant so/ftware has already been approved by KBA;",

        "page_content": "the related recalls have insofar been initiated. it cannot be ruled out that under certain circumstances, so/ftware updates may have to be reworked, or further delivery and registration stops may be ordered or resolved by the Company as a precautionary measure, also with regard to the used car, leasing and financing businesses. in the course of its regular market supervision, the KBA is routinely conducting further reviews of mercedes-Benz vehicles and is asking questions about technical elements of the vehicles. in addition, Daimler continues to be in a dialogue with the german ministry for transport and Digital infrastructure (Bmvi) to conclude the analysis of the diesel-related emissions matter and to further the update of affected customer vehicles. in light of the aforementioned administrative orders issued by the KBA, and continued discussions with the KBA and the Bmvi, it cannot be ruled out completely that additional administrative orders may be issued in the course of the ongoing and/or further investigations. since september 1, 2020, this also applies to other responsible authorities of other member states and the european Commission which conduct market surveillance under the new european type Approval Regulation and can take measures upon assumed non-compliance, irrespective of the place of the original type approval.\n\nin the course of its formal investigation into possible collusion on clean emission technology, the european Commission sent a statement of objections to Daimler and other automobile manufacturers in April 2019. in this context, Daimler filed an application for immunity from fines (leniency application) with the european Commission some time ago.\n\nin addition to the abovementioned authorities, national cartel authorities and other authorities of various foreign states, the south Korean ministry of environment, the south Korean competition authority (Korea Fair trade Commission) and the seoul public prosecutor's office (south Korea) are conducting various investigations and/or procedures in connection with Diesel exhaust emissions.\n\nDaimler continues to fully cooperate with the authorities and institutions.\n\n## Diesel emission behavior: consumer actions and other lawsuits in the United States, Canada, Germany and other States\n\nsince the beginning of 2016, several consumer class actions in u.s. federal district courts have been pending in the u.s., which have been consolidated into a consolidated class action against Daimler Ag and mBusA before the us District Court for New Jersey. in the class action, plaintiffs alleged that Daimler Ag and mBusA used devices that impermissibly impair the effectiveness of emission control systems in reducing nitrogen-oxide (No X ) emissions and which cause excessive emissions from vehicles with diesel engines. in addition, plaintiffs alleged that consumers were deliberately deceived in connection with the advertising of mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles.\n\nin the third quarter of 2020, Daimler Ag and mBusA reached a settlement with plaintiffs' counsel of this consumer class action. As part of the settlement, Daimler Ag and mBusA deny the material factual allegations and legal claims asserted by the class action plaintiffs, but have agreed to provide payments to certain current and former diesel vehicle owners and lessees. the estimated cost of the class action settlement is approximately usD 700 million. Daimler expects costs of the settlements with the us authorities mentioned above in the amount of approximately usD 1.5 billion. in addition, Daimler estimates further expenses of a mid three-digit-million euro amount to fulfill requirements of these settlements. the settlement with the us consumer class action plaintiffs is still subject to final court approval.\n\nin a separate lawsuit filed by the state of Arizona in January 2019, the plaintiff claims that, amongst others, Daimler Ag and mBusA deliberately deceived consumers in connection with advertising mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. Consumer class actions containing similar allegations were filed against Daimler Ag and further group companies in Canada in April 2016 and in the united Kingdom since may 2020 as well as against Daimler Ag in israel in February 2019. in a separate lawsuit filed by the environmental protection Commission of hillsborough County, Florida in september 2020, the plaintiff claims that, amongst others, Daimler Ag and mBusA violated municipal regulations prohibiting vehicle tampering and other conduct by using alleged devices claimed to impair the effectiveness of emissions control systems.\n\nin germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehicles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission of sales contracts. they assert that the vehicles contained inadmissible defeat devices and/or showed impermissibly high emission or consumption values. they refer to, in particular, the german Federal motor transport Authority's recall orders (see above). given the current development of case numbers, we expect a continued high number of lawsuits being filed in this respect.",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\nFurthermore, a class action against Daimler Ag and other group companies was filed in the Netherlands on June 23, 2020. the class action makes allegations comparable to the aforementioned us and Canadian class actions relating to all euro 5 and 6 diesel vehicles sold in the eu between 2009 and 2019. the plaintiff, a foundation under the laws of the Netherlands, is representing Dutch claimants and seeks certification of an opt-out Netherlands class (Dutch claimants are participating in the class action by law). in the course of the proceedings, other claimants who bought such vehicles in the eu market have the option to declare participation in the class action (opt-in). Furthermore, the plaintiff is seeking declarations of law concerning the customers' entitlement to nullify or rescind their vehicle purchase contracts, to demand replacement of their vehicle and/or to demand damages. A/fter the extension of the deadline granted by court, two further foundations filed statements of claim in court on December 30, 2020. the court has now to determine the lead plaintiff.\n\nDaimler Ag and the respective other affected companies of the group regard the lawsuits set out before as being without merit and will/uni00A0- except for the us consumer class action settlement/uni00A0- defend against the claims.\n\nin germany, a multitude of lawsuits by investors alleging the violation of disclosure requirements is pending against Daimler Ag. in addition, some investors have raised out-of-court claims for damages. the investors contend that Daimler Ag did not immediately disclose inside information in connection with the emission behavior of its diesel vehicles and that it had made false and misleading public statements. they further claim that the purchase price of the financial instruments acquired by them (in particular Daimler shares) would have been lower if Daimler Ag had complied with its disclosure duties. Daimler Ag regards these allegations and claims as being without merit and will defend itself against them. in this context, both investors as well as Daimler Ag have filed motions to initiate model proceedings in accordance with the Act on model proceedings in Capital markets Disputes (Kapmug). on January 14, 2021, the stuttgart Regional Court issued an order for reference to commence such model case proceedings before the stuttgart higher Regional Court. Daimler Ag will continue to defend against the investors' allegations also in these model case proceedings.\n\n## Accounting assessment of the legal proceedings in connection with diesel emission behavior\n\nWith respect to the legal proceedings described in the two preceding chapters, in accordance with iAs 37.92 no further information is disclosed with respect to whether, or to what extent, provisions have been recognized and/or contingent liabilities have been disclosed, so as not to prejudice Daimler's position. For recognized provisions, this does not apply to the extent a settlement has been reached or a proceeding has been concluded. A contingent liability from the class actions in the Netherlands cannot currently be measured.\n\n## Antitrust law proceedings (including actions for damages)\n\nstarting on July 25, 2017, a number of class actions were filed in the united states and Canada against Daimler Ag and other manufacturers of automobiles as well as various of their North American subsidiaries. plaintiffs allege to have suffered damages because defendants engaged in anticompetitive behavior relating to vehicle technology, costs, suppliers, markets, and other competitive attributes, including diesel emissions control technology, since the 1990s. on october 4, 2017, all pending us class actions were centralized in one proceeding by the Judicial panel on multidistrict litigation and transferred to the u.s. District Court for the Northern District of California. on march 15, 2018, plaintiffs in the us antitrust class action amended and consolidated their complaints into two pleadings, one on behalf of consumers and the other on behalf of dealers. on June 17, 2019, the court granted motions to dismiss in the consolidated us class action proceedings, albeit with leave to amend, and on August 15, 2019, the plaintiffs filed amended complaints making similar allegations. on march 31, 2020, the court granted motions to dismiss these first amended us class action complaints, albeit with leave to amend. on June 26, 2020, the plaintiffs filed second amended complaints. on october 23, 2020, the court granted motions to dismiss these second amended complaints in their entirety, with prejudice, ending the litigation in the us district court. plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. Daimler Ag and mBusA regard the us and Canadian lawsuits as being without merit, and will defend against the claims. this contingent liability cannot currently be measured.\n\nin late october 2017, the european Commission conducted preannounced inspections with Daimler in stuttgart (as well as further inspections with other manufacturers). in this context, Daimler Ag has filed a leniency application with the european Commission some time ago. in the third quarter of 2018, the european Commission opened a formal investigation into possible collusion on clean emission technology. in the course of such investigation, the european Commission, in April 2019, sent a statement of objections to Daimler and other automobile manufacturers to which Daimler responded in good time. At present, Daimler does not expect this issue to have any material impact on the group's profitability, cash flow and financial situation.",

        "page_content": "Following the settlement decision by the european Commission adopted on July 19, 2016, concluding the trucks antitrust proceedings, Daimler Ag and Daimler truck Ag are facing customers' claims for damages to a considerable degree. Respective legal actions, class actions and other forms of legal redress have been initiated in various states in and outside of europe and should further be expected. Daimler is taking appropriate legal remedies to defend itself. in accordance with iAs 37.92, no further information is disclosed with respect to whether, or to what extent, provisions have been recognized and/or contingent liabilities have been disclosed, so as not to prejudice Daimler's position.\n\n## Class-action lawsuits Takata airbag inflators\n\nAs already reported, class actions in connection with takata airbags are pending in Canada, the united states and israel, and a new collective action lawsuit was recently filed in Argentina. the lawsuits are based on the allegation that, along with takata entities and many other companies that sold vehicles equipped with takata airbag inflators, Daimler entities were allegedly negligent in selling such vehicles, purportedly not recalling them quickly enough, and failing to provide an adequate replacement airbag inflator. in detail: in August 2016, mercedes-Benz Canada (mB Canada) was added as a defendant to a putative nationwide class action that remains pending in ontario superior Court. in addition, Daimler Ag and mBusA were named as defendants along with takata companies in June 2017, in a us nationwide class action, which was filed in New Jersey Federal Court. in the third quarter of 2017, such lawsuit was transferred to federal court in the southern District of Florida for consolidation with other multidistrict litigation proceedings. Further class action lawsuits in the usA were integrated into the multiple district proceedings. one of the multidistrict litigation complaints also asserts claims by automotive recyclers who allege injury because they are not able to re-sell salvaged airbag inflators that are subject to the takata recall. in February 2019, Daimler Ag and its non-subsidiary israeli distributor (Colmobil) were named as defendants in an israel-wide class action alleging inadequacy of takata recall efforts in israel and that action remains pending. in september 2020, mercedes-Benz Argentina s.A. was named as a defendant in an Argentine class action alleging inadequacy of takata recall efforts in Argentina as well as a failure to warn consumers about a potential defect. Daimler Ag continues to regard all these lawsuits brought with regard to mercedes-Benz vehicles as being without merit, and the Daimler group affiliates respectively affected will further defend themselves against the claims. Contingent liabilities were disclosed to a low extent for this topic.\n\n## Accounting estimates and management judgments relating to all legal proceedings\n\nthe group recognizes provisions in connection with pending or threatened proceedings to the extent a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. such provisions are recognized in the group's consolidated financial statements and are based on estimates. if quantifiable, contingent liabilities in connection with legal proceedings are disclosed in the group's consolidated financial statements. Risks resulting from legal proceedings sometimes cannot be assessed reliably or only to a limited extent. Consequently, provisions recognized for some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient once such proceedings have ended. the group may also become liable for payments in legal proceedings for which no provisions were recognized and/or contingent liabilities were disclosed. uncertainty exists with regard to the amounts or due dates of possible cash outflows. Although the final result of any such proceedings could materially affect Daimler's operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period, Daimler believes that it should not exert a sustained influence on the group's financial position.\n\n## 31. Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the best estimate for obligations from contingent liabilities was \u20ac2,832 million (2019: \u20ac1,600 million). the increase in contingent liabilities is related to the legal proceedings described in E /uni00A0Note 30.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other financial obligations\n\nAt December 31, 2020, other financial obligations exist from the acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and lease property of \u20ac3,698 million (2019: \u20ac4,613 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin addition, the group had issued irrevocable loan commitments at December 31, 2020. these loan commitments had not been utilized as of that date. Further information with respect to these commitments is provided in E /uni00A0Note 33.",

Similar investments are measured at amortized cost and are not included in the measurement hierarchy, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short terms of these financial instruments and the fundamentally lower credit risk.\n\nEquity Instruments are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. equity instruments recognized through other comprehensive income are included in table \uf0e4 D.69 and comprise on the one hand the part of the investments in Aston martin lagonda global holdings plc, which is recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income, and on the other hand the investments in Farasis energy (ganzhou) Co. ltd. and BAiC Bluepark New energy technology Co. ltd. the remaining investments recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise further investments not material on an individual basis. Daimler does not generally intend to sell its equity instruments which are presented at December 31, 2020.\n\nmarketable debt securities and equity instruments recognized at fair value were measured using quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. if quoted market prices are not available for these debt and equity instruments, fair value measurement is based on inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in active markets. Fair values are calculated using recognized financial valuation models such as discounted cash-flow models or multiples.\n\nOther financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss include derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. these financial instruments as well as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting comprise:\n\n- -   derivative currency hedging contracts; the fair values of cross currency interest rate swaps are determined on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows (taking account of credit premiums and default risks) using market interest rates appropriate to the remaining terms of the financial instruments. the valuation of currency forwards is based on market quotes of forward curves; currency options are measured with option-pricing models using market data.\n- -   derivative interest rate hedging contracts; the fair values of interest rate hedging instruments (e.g. interest rate swaps) are calculated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows (taking account of credit premiums and default risks) using market interest rates appropriate to the remaining terms of the financial instruments.\n- -   derivative commodity hedging contracts; the fair values of commodity hedging contracts (e.g. commodity forwards) are determined on the basis of current reference prices with consideration of forward premiums and discounts and default risks.\n\nOther financial receivables and other financial assets are carried at amortized cost. Because of the predominantly short maturities and the fundamentally lower credit risk of these financial instruments, it is assumed that the fair values approximate the carrying amounts.\n\n## Financing liabilities\n\nthe fair values of bonds, loans, commercial paper, deposits in the direct banking business and liabilities from ABs transactions are calculated as present values of the estimated future cash flows (taking account of credit premiums and credit risks). market interest rates for the appropriate terms are used for discounting.\n\n## Trade payables\n\nDue to the short maturities of these financial instruments, it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts.\n\n## Contract and refund liabilities\n\nContract and refund liabilities include obligations from sales transactions that qualify as financial instruments.\n\nobligations from sales transactions should generally be regarded as short term. Due to the short maturities of these financial instruments, it is assumed that their fair values are equal to their carrying amounts.",

Because of the predominantly short maturities of these financial instruments, it is assumed that the fair values approximate the carrying amounts.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nthe group concludes derivative transactions in accordance with the master netting arrangements (framework agreement) of the international swaps and Derivatives Association (isDA) and comparable national framework agreements. however, these arrangements do not meet the criteria for netting in the Consolidated statement of Financial position, as they allow netting only in the case of future events such as default or insolvency on the part of the group or the counterparty.\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.70 shows the carrying amounts of the derivative financial instruments subject to the described arrangements as well as the possible financial effects of netting in accordance with the master netting arrangements.\n\n## Measurement hierarchy\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.71 provides an overview of the classification into measurement hierarchies of financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value (according to iFRs 13).\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, Daimler reviews the necessity of reclassification between the measurement hierarchies.\n\nFor the determination of the credit risk from derivative financial instruments which are allocated to level 2 measurement hierarchy, portfolios managed on basis of net exposure are applied.\n\nD.70\n\nDisclosure for recognized financial instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement\n\n## At December 31, 2020\n\nAt December 31, 2019\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.72 shows into which measurement hierarchies (according to iFRs 13) the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are classified which are not recognized at fair value in the Consolidated statement of Financial position.\n\n|                              |                                                                                                            |                                                    |              | gross and                                                                                       | gross and                                          | gross and    |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n|                              | gross and net  amounts of  financial  instruments  in the  Consolidated  statement of  Financial  position | Amounts subject  to a master  netting  arrangement | Net  amounts | net amounts  of financial  instruments  in the  Consolidated  statement of  Financial  position | Amounts  subject to a  master netting  arrangement | Net  amounts |\n| in millions of euros         |                                                                                                            |                                                    |              |                                                                                                 |                                                    |              |\n| other financial assets\u00b9      | 2,219                                                                                                      | -270                                               | 1,949        | 1,218                                                                                           | -542                                               | 676          |\n| other financial liabilities\u00b2 | 407                                                                                                        | -270                                               | 137          | 1,238                                                                                           | -542                                               | 696          |\n\n- 1  the other financial assets which are subject to a master netting arrangement comprise derivative financial instruments that are included in hedge accounting and financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss (see Note 16).\n- 2  the other financial liabilities which are subject to a master netting arrangement comprise derivative financial instruments that are included in hedge accounting and financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss (see Note 25).",

An equity price risk results from investments in listed companies. in addition, the group is exposed to credit risks from its leasing and financing activities and from its business operations (trade receivables). Furthermore, the group is exposed to liquidity and country risks relating to its credit and market risks or a deterioration of its business operations or financial market disturbances. if these financial risks materialize, they could adversely affect Daimler's profitability, liquidity and capital resources and financial position.\n\nDaimler has established internal guidelines for risk controlling procedures and for the use of financial instruments, including a clear segregation of duties with regard to financial activities, settlement, accounting and the related controlling. the guidelines upon which the group's risk management processes for financial risks are based are designed to identify and analyze these risks throughout the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks by means of reliable and up-to-date administrative and information systems. the guidelines and systems are regularly reviewed and adjusted to changes in markets and products.\n\n## D.84\n\nMaximum risk positions of financial assets, irrevocable loan commitments and financial guarantees\n\nmaximum\n\n|                              | Note   | maximum  risk  position  2020   | risk  position  2019   |\n|------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------|------------------------|\n| in millions of euros         |        |                                 |                        |\n| liquid assets                |        | 29,445                          | 27,538                 |\n| Receivables from             |        |                                 |                        |\n| financial services           | 14     | 96,185                          | 103,661                |\n| trade                        |        |                                 |                        |\n| receivables                  | 19     | 10,649                          | 12,332                 |\n| Derivative financial         |        |                                 |                        |\n| instruments used in          |        |                                 |                        |\n| hedge accounting             |        |                                 |                        |\n| (assets only)                | 16     | 2,145                           | 1,191                  |\n| Derivative financial         |        |                                 |                        |\n| instruments not used in      |        |                                 |                        |\n| hedge accounting             |        |                                 |                        |\n| (assets only)                | 16     | 74                              | 27                     |\n| other receivables and        |        |                                 |                        |\n| financial assets             | 16     | 2,942                           | 3,328                  |\n| irrevocable loan commitments |        | 2,109                           | 2,038                  |\n| Financial guarantees         |        | 563                             | 728                    |\n\nthe group manages and monitors these risks primarily through its operating and financing activities and, if required, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Daimler uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its business operations or refinancing activities or liquidity management. Without these derivative financial instruments, the group would be exposed to higher financial risks. Additional information on financial instruments and especially on the volumes of the derivative financial instruments used is included in E /uni00A0Note 32. Daimler regularly evaluates its financial risks with due consideration of changes in key economic indicators and up-to-date market information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe market sensitive instruments, including equity and debt securities, that the plan assets hold to finance pension and other post-employment healthcare benefits, are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative analysis. see E /uni00A0Note 22 for additional information on Daimler's pension and other post-employment benefits.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of economic loss arising from a counterparty's failure to repay or service debt in accordance with the contractual terms. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of a deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nthe maximum risk positions of financial assets which are generally subject to credit risk are equal to their carrying amounts at the balance sheet date (without consideration of collateral, if available). there is also a risk of default from irrevocable loan commitments which had not been utilized as of that date, as well as from financial guarantees. the maximum risk position in these cases is equal to the expected future cash outflows. table \uf0e4 D.84 shows the maximum risk positions at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Liquid assets\n\nliquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities and similar investments. With the investment of liquid assets, banks and issuers of securities are selected very carefully and diversified in accordance with a limit system. liquid assets are mainly held at financial institutions within and outside europe with high creditworthiness, as bonds issued by german federal states and as money market funds. in connection with investment decisions, priority is placed on the borrower's very high creditworthiness and on balanced risk diversification. the limits and their utilizations are reassessed continuously. in this assessment, Daimler also considers the credit risk assessment of its counterparties by the capital markets. in line with the group's risk policy, most liquid assets are held in investments with an external rating of 'A' or better. liquid assets are thus not subject to a material credit risk and are allocated to stage 1 of the impairment model, which is based on expected credit risk.",

        "page_content": "## Receivables from financial services\n\nDaimler's financing and leasing activities are primarily focused on supporting the sales of the group's automotive products. As a consequence of these activities, the group is exposed to credit risk, which is monitored and managed based on defined standards, guidelines and procedures. Daimler manages its credit risk irrespective of whether it is related to a financing contract or to an operating lease or a finance lease contract. For this reason, statements concerning the credit risk of Daimler mobility refer to the entire financing and leasing business, unless otherwise specified.\n\nexposure to credit risk from financing and lease activities is monitored based on the portfolio subject to credit risk. the portfolio subject to credit risk consists of wholesale and retail receivables from financial services and the portion of the operating lease portfolio that is subject to credit risk. Receivables from financial services comprise claims arising from finance lease contracts and repayment claims from financing loans. the operating lease portfolio is reported under equipment on operating leases in the group's Consolidated Financial statements. overdue lease payments from operating lease contracts are recognized in receivables from financial services.\n\nthe Daimler mobility segment has guidelines setting the framework for effective risk management at a global as well as a local level. in particular, these rules deal with minimum requirements for all risk-relevant credit processes, the definition of financing products offered, the evaluation of customer quality, requests for collateral and the treatment of unsecured loans and non-performing claims. the limitation of concentration risks is implemented primarily by means of global limits, which refer to single customer exposures. At December 31, 2020, exposure to the biggest 15 customers did not exceed 3.4% of the total portfolio (2019: 4.4%).\n\nWith respect to its financing and lease activities, the group holds collateral for customer transactions limiting actual credit risk through its fair value. the value of collateral generally depends on the amount of the financed assets. the financed vehicles usually serve as collateral. Furthermore, Daimler mobility limits credit risk from financing and lease activities, for example through advance payments from customers.\n\nFor the assessment of the default risk of retail and small business customers, scoring systems are applied to evaluate their creditworthiness. Corporate customers are evaluated using internal rating instruments. Both evaluation processes use external credit bureau data if available. the scoring and rating results as well as the availability of security and other risk mitigation instruments, such as advance payments, guarantees and, to a lower extent, residual debt insurances, are essential elements for credit decisions.\n\nif, in connection with contracts, a worsening of payment behavior or other causes of a credit risk are recognized, collection procedures are initiated by claims management to obtain the overdue payments of the customer, to take possession of the asset financed or leased or, alternatively, to renegotiate the impaired contract. Restructuring policies and practices are based on the indicators or criteria which, in the judgment of local management, indicate that repayment will probably continue and that the total proceeds expected to be derived from the renegotiated contract exceed the expected proceeds to be derived from repossession and remarketing. in 2020, because of the covid-19 pandemic, there were modifications in some markets of financial assets for financial receivables in particular in the context of relief programs offered by governments and by Daimler mobility. the design of these programs, however, led to the modification being assessed as not significant.\n\nAt the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, a crisis guideline was issued very promptly, specifying how customers can be supported as flexible as possible, but still risk management oriented, with extensions of payment terms. Credit risk development was discussed at all meetings of the crisis task force at Daimler mobility since the beginning of the crisis. Furthermore, a collection task force managed the best possible preparation of debt collection activities.\n\nthe allowance ratio increased significantly compared to the level of the previous year due to increased provisions for credit risks against the backdrop of the worsened economic outlook in connection with the covid-19 pandemic and national programs and programs of Daimler mobility offered to support the customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on credit risks included in receivables from financial services, see E /uni00A0Note 14. information on the measurement of expected credit losses is provided in E /uni00A0Note 1.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "/uni2003\n\n## Trade receivables\n\ntrade receivables are mostly receivables from worldwide sales of vehicles and spare parts. the credit risk from trade receivables encompasses the default risk of customers, e.g., dealers and general distribution companies, as well as other corporate and private customers. in order to identify credit risks, Daimler assesses the creditworthiness of customers. Daimler manages its credit risk from trade receivables using appropriate it applications and databases on the basis of internal guidelines which have to be followed globally.\n\nA significant proportion of the trade receivables from each country's domestic business is secured by various countryspecific types of collateral. this collateral includes conditional sales, guarantees and sureties, as well as mortgages and advance payments from customers.\n\nFor trade receivables from the export business, Daimler also evaluates its customers' creditworthiness by means of an internal rating process with consideration of the respective country risk. in this context, the year-end financial statements and other relevant information on the general distribution companies, such as payment history, are used and assessed.\n\nDepending on the creditworthiness of the customers, Daimler usually establishes credit limits and limits credit risks with the following types of collateral:\n\n- -credit  insurances,\n- -   first-class bank guarantees and\n- -   letters of credit.\n\nthese procedures are defined in the export credit guidelines, which have group-wide validity.\n\nFor impairments of trade receivables, the simplified approach is applied, whereby these receivables are allocated to stage 2. Credit losses until maturity for these trade receivables are recognized upon initial recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on trade receivables and the status of impairments recognized is provided in E /uni00A0Note 19.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nthe group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its operational business, financing activities or liquidity management. Daimler manages its credit risk exposure in connection with derivative financial instruments through a limit system, which is based on the review of each counterparty's financial strength. this system limits and diversifies the credit risk. As a result, Daimler is exposed to credit risk only to a small extent with respect to its derivative financial instruments. in accordance with the group's risk policy, most derivatives are contracted with counterparties which have an external rating of 'A' or better.\n\n## Other receivables and financial assets\n\nWith respect to other receivables and financial assets included in other financial assets in 2020 and 2019, Daimler is exposed to credit risk only to a small extent.\n\n## Irrevocable loan commitments\n\nthe Daimler mobility segment in particular is exposed to credit risk from irrevocable loan commitments to end customers and retailers. At December 31, 2020, irrevocable loan commitments amounted to \u20ac2,109 million (2019: \u20ac2,038 million). these loan commitments had a maturity of less than one year and are not subject to a material credit risk.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nthe maximum potential obligations resulting from financial guarantees amount to \u20ac563 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: \u20ac728 million) and include liabilities recognized at December 31, 2020 in the amount of \u20ac99 million (2019: \u20ac107 million). Financial guarantees principally represent contractual arrangements. these guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, the group will be required to settle such financial obligations generally up to a contractually agreed amount.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nliquidity risk comprises the risk that a company cannot meet its financial obligations in full.\n\nDaimler manages its liquidity by holding adequate volumes of liquid assets and by maintaining syndicated credit facilities in addition to the cash inflows generated by its business operations. Additionally, the possibility to securitize receivables of the financial services business (ABs transactions) also reduces the group's liquidity risk. liquid assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities and similar investments. the group can dispose of these liquid assets at short notice.\n\nthe funds raised are used to finance working capital and capital expenditure as well as the cash needs of the lease and financing business and unexpected liquidity needs. in accordance with internal guidelines, the refunding of the lease and financing business is generally carried out with matching maturities so that financing liabilities have the same maturity profile as the leased assets and the receivables from financial services.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, liquidity amounted to \u20ac29.4 billion (2019: \u20ac27.5 billion). in 2020, significant cash inflows resulted from the operations of the industrial business. Furthermore, dividend payments received from Beijing Benz Automotive Co., ltd. had a positive effect on liquidity. Cash outflows resulted in particular from investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and income taxes paid. At Daimler mobility, net cash inflows of the leasing and sales-financing activities mainly resulted from the portfolio reduction in the context of the corona crisis. there were also effects from cash inflows and outflows in connection with the cash flow from financing activities.",

Country risks also arise from cross-border cash deposits at financial institutions.\n\nDaimler manages these risks via country exposure limits (e.g., for hard currency portfolios of financial services entities). An internal rating system serves as a basis for Daimler's risk-oriented country exposure management; it assigns all countries to risk classes, with consideration of capital market indications of country risks.\n\n## Finance market risks\n\nthe global nature of its businesses exposes Daimler to significant market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. the group is also exposed to equity price risk in connection with its investments in listed companies.\n\nDaimler manages market risks to minimize the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices on the earnings of the group and its segments. the group calculates its overall net-exposure to these market risks to provide the basis for hedging decisions, which include the selection of hedging instruments and the determination of hedging volumes and the corresponding periods. the hedging strategy is specified at group level and uniformly implemented in the segments. Decisions regarding the management of market risks from foreign exchange rates and commodities, as well as asset-/liability management (interest rates), are regularly made by the relevant Daimler risk management committees. Net-exposures are the basis for the hedging strategies and are updated regularly.\n\nCertain existing benchmark interest rates including those of the london interbank offer Rate (for usD, gBp, ChF and Jpy) will be comprehensively and internationally reformed by the end of 2021. As a result, those interest rates will be gradually abolished and replaced with alternative risk-free reference rates. Alternative interest rates are being developed on a national level in the context of the respective legal systems and currencies; they can therefore vary with regard to their structure, methodology and period of publication.\n\nDespite market uncertainty, the existing benchmark interest rates are still applied as reference rates in financial markets and have an impact on the valuation of financial transactions. this also applies for financial instruments in hedging relationships with a maturity beyond the end of 2021. With euRiBoR reform already implemented, the material share of interest rate risk hedging relationships affected by the benchmark reform is based on the currencies usD and gBp.\n\nDaimler expects the conversion of reference rates of hedging instruments and their underlying transactions to be identical and without material delay in time. Daimler continues to consider the economic relationship and thus the continuation of hedge accounting to be still existing as of December 31, 2020.\n\nthe nominal values of the affected derivative financial instruments can be found in table \uf0e4 D.82 .\n\nthe effect of the application of the new interest rates on the Consolidated Financial statements is currently being reviewed. in order to conduct financial transactions based on the new indices, Daimler is preparing its it-systems accordingly. uncertainty still exists about future market standards with interest conventions for individual financial products (cash products and also interest derivatives) that reference the new risk-free rates.\n\nAs part of its risk management system, Daimler employs valueat-risk analyses. in performing these analyses, Daimler quantifies its market risk due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and certain commodity prices on a regular basis by predicting the potential loss over a target time horizon (holding period) and confidence level.",

        "page_content": "the value-at-risk calculations employed:\n\n- -   express potential losses in fair values, and\n- -   assume a 99% confidence level and a holding period of five days.\n\nAt the group level, Daimler calculates the value at risk for exchange rate and interest rate risk according to the variancecovariance approach. the value-at-risk calculation method for commodity hedging instruments is based on a monte Carlo simulation.\n\nWhen calculating value at risk using the variance-covariance approach, Daimler first computes the current market value of the group's financial instruments portfolio. then the sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in the relevant market risk factors, such as particular foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates of specific maturities, is quantified. Based on volatilities and correlations of these market risk factors, which are obtained from the Riskmetrics\u2122 dataset, a statistical distribution of potential changes in the portfolio value at the end of the holding period is computed. the loss which is reached or exceeded with a probability of only 1% can be derived from this calculation and represents the value at risk.\n\nthe monte Carlo simulation uses random numbers to generate possible changes in market risk factors consistent with current market volatilities. the changes in market risk factors allow the calculation of a possible change in the portfolio value over the holding period. Running multiple iterations of this simulation leads to a distribution of portfolio value changes. the value at risk can be determined based on this distribution as the portfolio value loss which is reached or exceeded with a probability of 1%.\n\n## Exchange rate risk\n\nTransaction risk and currency risk management. the global nature of Daimler's businesses exposes cash flows to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. these risks primarily relate to fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the British pound and other currencies such as currencies of growth markets. in the operating vehicle business, the group's exchange rate risk primarily arises when revenue is generated in a currency that is different from the currency in which the costs of revenue are incurred, it may be inadequate to cover the costs if the value of the currency in which the revenue is generated declined in the interim relative to the value of the currency in which the costs were incurred. this risk exposure primarily affects mercedes-Benz Cars & vans, which generates a major portion of its revenue in foreign currencies and incurs manufacturing costs primarily in euros. Daimler trucks & Buses is also exposed to transaction risks, but only to a minor degree because of its global production network and the overall lower foreign currency volume. the exposures of these segments serve as a basis for analyzing exchange rate risks at group level. in addition, the group is indirectly exposed to transaction risk from its equity-method investments.\n\nthe group's overall currency exposure is reduced by natural hedging, which consists of the currency exposures of the business operations of different entities and segments partially offsetting each other at group level. these natural hedges eliminate the need for hedging to the extent of the matched exposures. to provide an additional natural hedge against any remaining transaction risk exposure, Daimler generally strives to increase cash outflows in the same currencies in which the group has a net excess inflow.\n\nin order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations for the business operations (future transactions), Daimler continually assesses its exposure to exchange rate risks and hedges a portion of those risks by using derivative financial instruments. A committee manages the group's exchange rate risk and its hedging transactions through currency derivatives. the committee consists of representatives of the relevant segments and central functions. the Corporate treasury department aggregates foreign currency exposures from Daimler's subsidiaries and operational units and implements the committee's decisions concerning foreign currency hedging through transactions with international financial institutions. For reporting purposes and accounting for hedge relationships, those hedges are allocated to mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and Daimler trucks & Buses. suitable measures are generally taken without delay to eliminate any over-hedging at group level regarding hedging transactions caused by changes in exposure. in the case of over hedges at the level of mercedes-Benz Cars & vans or Daimler trucks & Buses, designated hedging relations are reviewed with respect to any requirements to discontinue hedge accounting.",

Based on this reference model and depending on the market outlook, the committee determines the hedging horizon, which usually varies from one to five years, as well as the average hedge ratios. Reflecting the character of the underlying risks, the hedge ratios decrease with increasing maturities. At year-end 2020, foreign exchange management showed an unhedged position in the automotive business in calendar year 2021 for the underlying forecasted cash flows in us dollars of 44%, for the underlying forecasted cash flows in Chinese renminbi of 52% and for the underlying forecasted cash flows in British pounds of 48%.\n\nto cover foreign currency exposure risks of the vehicle business operations forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are primarily used. Daimler's guidelines call for a mixture of these instruments depending on the assessment of market conditions. value at risk is used to measure the exchange rate risk inherent in these derivative financial instruments.\n\nHedge accounting. When designating derivative financial instruments, a hedge ratio of 1 is applied. in addition, the respective volume, interest curves and currency of the hedge and the underlying transaction as well as maturity dates are matched. the group ensures an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging transaction by ensuring consistency of currency, volume and maturity. option premiums and/uni00A0- since mid-2020 for newly designated hedge relationships/uni00A0- also forward components are not designated into the hedge relationship, but the hedging costs are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss at the due date of the underlying transaction or recognized as adjustment of acquisition cost of non-financial assets. the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the beginning and during the economic relationship. possible sources of ineffectiveness of the hedge relationship are:\n\n- -  effects of the credit risk on the fair value of the used derivative instrument which are not reflected in the change of the hedged currency risk.\n- - Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.\n\nin the context of focusing on the divisional perspective, the designation of hedge relationships for foreign currency risk existing from the group perspective from expected future cash flows from business operations, primarily from vehicle sales, have been assigned to mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and to Daimler trucks & Buses starting with 2019. Accordingly, the documentation required under iFRs with regard to this further differentiation of expected cash flows (i.e. the risk management objectives) has been revised for a large proportion of the already designated hedge relationships for foreign currency risk, although there has been no change in the overall group risk management strategy for foreign currency risk. pursuant to the described methods applied in preparation of the financial statements, this results in the formal discontinuation and immediate redesignation of existing hedge relationships according to the revised differentiation. Further information can be found in table \uf0e4 D.79 . there were no material effects on earnings in 2020 and 2019.",

        "page_content": "in 2020, the development of the value at risk from foreign currency hedging was mainly driven by a sharp increase in foreign currency rate volatilities in the first quarter and subsequently by a gradual decrease.\n\nthe group's investments in liquid assets or refinancing activities are generally selected so that possible currency risks are minimized. transaction risks arising from liquid assets or payables in foreign currencies that result from the group's investment or refinancing on money and capital markets are generally hedged against currency risks at the time of investing or refinancing in accordance with Daimler's internal guidelines. the group uses appropriate derivative financial instruments (e.g. cross-currency interest rate swaps) to hedge against currency risk.\n\nsince currency risks arising from the group's investment or refinancing in foreign currencies and the respective hedging transactions generally offset each other, these financial instruments are not included in the value-at-risk calculation presented.\n\nEffects of currency translation risk. For purposes of Daimler's Consolidated Financial statements, the income and expenses and the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone are converted into euros. therefore, period-toperiod changes in average exchange rates may cause translation effects that have a significant impact on, for example, revenue, segment results (eBit) and assets and liabilities of the group. unlike exchange rate transaction risk, exchange rate translation risk does not necessarily affect future cash flows. the group's equity position reflects changes in book values caused by exchange rates. in general, Daimler does not hedge against exchange rate translation risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nDaimler uses a variety of interest rate sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity needs of the group. A substantial volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities results from the leasing and sales financing business operated by the Daimler mobility segment. the Daimler mobility companies enter into transactions with customers that primarily result in fixed-rate receivables. Daimler's general policy is to match funding in terms of maturities and interest rates wherever economically feasible. however, for a limited portion of the receivables portfolio in selected and developed markets, Daimler mobility does not match funding in terms of maturities in order to take advantage of market opportunities. As a result, the Daimler group is exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates.\n\nAn asset/liability committee consisting of members of the Daimler mobility, mercedes-Benz Cars & vans and Daimler trucks & Buses segments and the Corporate treasury department manages the interest rate risk by setting targets for the interest rate risk position. the treasury Risk management department and the local Daimler companies are jointly responsible for achieving these targets. As separate functions, the treasury Controlling and the Daimler mobility Controlling & Reporting department monitors target achievement on a monthly basis. in order to achieve the targeted interest rate risk positions in terms of maturities and interest rate fixing periods, Daimler also uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. Daimler assesses its interest rate risk position by comparing assets and liabilities for corresponding maturities, including the impact of the relevant derivative financial instruments.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are also used in conjunction with the refinancing related to the automotive segments and liquidity management. Daimler steers the funding activities of the automotive and financial services businesses at the group level.\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.86 shows the period-end, high, low and average value-at-risk figures of the interest rate risk for the 2020 and 2019 portfolios of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments of the group, including the financial instruments of the leasing and sales financing business. lease liabilities are not included in the value at risk of the interest rate risk. these leasing liabilities have a fixed interest rate and changes in interest rates therefore have no effect on the group's net profit. the average values have been computed on an end-of-quarter basis.\n\nDuring the year, the change in the value at risk of interest rate sensitive financial instruments was primarily determined by the development of interest rate volatilities.",

When designating derivative financial instruments, a hedge ratio of 1 is generally applied. the respective volumes, interest curves and currencies of the hedged item and the hedging instrument as well as maturity dates are matched. in the case of combined derivative financial instruments for interest currency hedges, the cross-currency basis spread is not designated into the hedge relationship, but deferred as a hedging cost in other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss over the hedge term. the group ensures an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument by ensuring consistency of interest rates, maturity terms and nominal amounts. the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the beginning and during the economic relationship using the hypothetical derivative method. possible sources of ineffectiveness of the hedge relationship are:\n\n- -  effects of the credit risk on the fair value of the derivative instrument in use which are not reflected in the change in the hedged interest rate risk.\n- -  Changes in the parameters of the underlying hedged transactions.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nDaimler is exposed to the risk of changes in commodity prices in connection with procuring raw materials and manufacturing supplies used in production. A small portion of the raw material price risk, primarily relating to forecasted procurement of certain metals, is hedged with the use of derivative financial instruments.\n\nFor precious metals, central commodity management shows an unhedged position of 80% of the forecasted commodity purchases at year-end 2020 for calendar year 2021. the corresponding figure at year-end 2019 was 55% for calendar year 2020.\n\ntable \uf0e4 D.86 shows the period-end, high, low and average value-at-risk figures for the 2020 and 2019 portfolio of derivative financial instruments used to hedge raw material price risk. Average exposure has been computed on an end-of-quarter basis. the transactions underlying the derivative financial instruments are not included in the value-at-risk presentation. see also table \uf0e4 D.82 .\n\nin 2020, the development of the value at risk from commodity hedging was driven in the first quarter by an increase in volatilities and hedging volume. subsequently, volatilities as well as the hedging volume decreased gradually and so did the value at risk.\n\nHedge accounting. When designating currency derivative financial instruments, Daimler generally applies a hedge ratio of 1. the respective volumes and parameters relevant for the valuation of the hedged item and the hedging instrument as well as maturity dates are matched. the group ensures an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument by ensuring consistency of volumes, parameters relevant for valuation and maturity terms. effectiveness is assessed at initial designation and during the hedge term. possible sources of ineffectiveness of the hedge relationship are:\n\n- -  effects of the credit risk on the fair value of the derivative instrument in use which are not reflected in the change in the hedged commodity price risk.\n- -  Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nDaimler predominantly holds investments in shares of companies which are classified as long-term investments, some of which are accounted for using the equity method, such as BAiC motor. these investments are not included in a market risk assessment by the group.",

Furthermore, in the figures for the previous year, the effects of certain legal issues and equity investments not previously allocated to the segments have been reclassified from the reconciliation to the vehicle segments.\n\nthe mercedes-Benz Cars & vans segment develops, manufactures and sells passenger cars comprising premium and luxury vehicles of the mercedes-Benz brand including the brands mercedes-Amg, mercedes-maybach and mercedes-eQ as well as small cars under the smart brand. the mercedes me brand comprises the ecosystem of mercedes-Benz. the vans are mainly sold under the mercedes-Benz and Freightliner brands.\n\nthe Daimler trucks & Buses segment develops, manufactures and sells trucks under the mercedes-Benz, Freightliner, Fuso, Western star and BharatBenz brands. the segment's product range also includes buses of the mercedes-Benz, setra, thomas Built Buses and Fuso brands, as well as bus chassis.\n\nthe vehicle segments also sell related spare parts and accessories.\n\nthe Daimler mobility segment supports the sales of the group's vehicle segments worldwide. its product portfolio primarily comprises tailored financing and leasing packages for end-customers and dealers, brokering of automotive insurance and banking services. the segment also provides services such as fleet management in europe, which primarily takes place through the Athlon brand. Furthermore, Daimler mobility is active in the area of innovative mobility services.\n\n## Internal management and reporting structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe internal management and reporting structure at the Daimler group is principally based on the accounting policies that are described in E /uni00A0Note 1 in the summary of significant accounting policies according to iFRs.\n\nthe measure of the group's profit or loss used by Daimler's management and reporting structure is referred to as 'eBit'. eBit comprises gross profit, selling and general administrative expenses, research and non-capitalized development costs, other operating income/expense, and the profit/loss on equity-method investments, net, as well as other financial income/expense, net.\n\nAs of the 2020 financial year, the effects of capitalized borrowing costs are recognized in eBit as well as in the group's assets and the assets of the segments. to ensure comparability of the figures for the 2020 financial year with those of the previous year, the figures reported for 2019 have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nintersegment revenue is generally recorded at prices that approximate market terms.\n\ntransactions between the segments are generally eliminated in the reconciliation. the elimination of effects connected with intra-group transfers of equity investments takes place in the segments involved. the effects on earnings at the group are recognized upon completion of the external transaction in the corresponding segment. some simplifications have been made in the segment reporting with regard to accounting for leases in connection with intra-group transactions.\n\nsegment assets principally comprise all assets. the vehicle segments' assets exclude income tax assets, assets from defined-benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, and certain financial assets (including liquidity). segment liabilities principally comprise all liabilities. the vehicle segments' liabilities exclude income tax liabilities, liabilities from defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, and certain financial liabilities (including financing liabilities).\n\nthe residual value risks associated with the group's operating leases and finance lease receivables are generally borne by the vehicle segments that manufactured the leased equipment. Risk sharing is based on agreements between the respective vehicle segments and Daimler mobility; the terms vary by vehicle segment and geographic region.\n\nNon-current assets consist of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and equipment on operating leases.\n\nCapital expenditures for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the cash-effective additions to these intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as far as they do not relate to capitalized borrowing costs or goodwill.",

Capital management\n\nNet assets and value added represent the basis for capital management at Daimler. the assets and liabilities of the segments in accordance with iFRs provide the basis for the determination of net assets at group level. the vehicle segments are accountable for the operational net assets; all assets, liabilities and provisions which they are responsible for in day-to-day operations are therefore allocated to them. performance measurement at Daimler mobility is on an equity basis, in line with the usual practice in the banking business. Net assets at group level additionally include assets and liabilities from income taxes as well as other corporate items and eliminations.\n\nthe average annual net assets are calculated from the average quarterly net assets. the average quarterly net assets are calculated as an average of the net assets at the beginning and the end of the quarter and are shown in table \uf0e4 D.90 .\n\nthe cost of capital of the group's average net assets is reflected in value added. value added shows the extent to which the group achieves or exceeds the minimum return requirements of the shareholders and creditors, thus creating additional value. the required rate of return on net assets, and thus the cost of capital, are derived from the minimum rates of return that investors expect on their invested capital. the group's cost of capital comprises the cost of equity as well as the costs of debt and pension obligations unless these are allocated to Daimler mobility; in addition, the expected returns on liquidity and on the plan assets of the pension funds which are not allocated to Daimler mobility are considered with the opposite sign. in the reporting period, the cost of capital used for our internal capital management amounted to 8% a/fter taxes.\n\nthe objective of capital management is to increase value added, among other things, by optimizing the cost of capital. this is achieved on the one hand by the management of the net assets, e.g., by optimizing working capital, which is within the operational responsibility of the segments. in addition, taking into account legal regulations, Daimler strives to optimize the costs and risks of its capital structure and, consequently, the cost of capital, with due consideration of applicable law. examples of this include a balanced relationship between equity and financial liabilities as well as an appropriate level of liquidity, oriented towards the operational requirements.\n\n## D.90\n\n## Average net assets\n\n|                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in millions of euros       |        |        |\n| mercedes-Benz Cars & vans  | 32,768 | 35,070 |\n| Daimler trucks & Buses     | 9,513  | 10,921 |\n| Daimler mobility 1         | 14,601 | 13,961 |\n| Net assets of the segments | 56,882 | 59,952 |\n| equity-method              |        |        |\n| investments 2              | 463    | 662    |\n| Assets and liabilities     |        |        |\n| from income taxes 3        | 2,088  | 2,720  |\n| other corporate items      |        |        |\n| and eliminations 3         | 436    | 448    |\n| Net assets Daimler group   | 59,869 | 63,782 |\n\n- 1  equity.\n- 2  unless allocated to the segments.\n- 3  unless allocated to Daimler mobility.\n\n## 36. earnings per share\n\nthe calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on net profit attributable to shareholders of Daimler Ag.

We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the international standards on Auditing (isAs). our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial statements and of the Combined management Report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of european law and german commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other german professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. in addition, in accordance with Article 10 paragraph 2 letter f) of the eu Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 paragraph 1 of the eu Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and, in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## impairment Risk on operating leases\n\nplease refer with regard to the accounting policies and methods applied to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in E Note 1 \u00bbsignificant accounting policies\u00ab and E Note 2 \u00bbAccounting estimates and management judgments\u00ab. Further information on the operating leases can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in E Note 12 \u00bbequipment on operating leases\u00ab and in the comments in the combined management report in the section entitled \u00bbindustry and business risks and opportunities\u00ab .\n\n## The Risk for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nthe statement of financial position caption \u00bbequipment on operating leases\u00ab (\u20ac 47,552 million) includes among other things mercedes-Benz passenger cars, which are purchased by non-group dealers or other third parties and are the subject of an operating lease with the Daimler group. An impairment loss exists with regard to these vehicles that is primarily dependent on the residual value achievable at the end of the lease. these future residual values are dependent on the situation in the used vehicle markets prevailing when the vehicles are returned. the future-oriented valuation is based on a number of discretionary assumptions. the risk for the financial statements is that any impairment losses will not be recognized or that the amounts recognized will be inadequate.\n\n## Our Audit Approach\n\nWe audited the recoverability of the mercedes-Benz passenger cars purchased externally in the statement of financial position caption 'equipment on operating leases'. We investigated and appraised the indications assumed by the group for any need for an impairment loss and where necessary obtained an understanding of the write-downs calculated by Daimler. We have assessed Daimler's evaluation with regard to the residual values achievable by the end of the terms of the leases. in this connection, we in particular critically reviewed the main influencing factors, such as the expected number of returns from leasing, the current marketing results in order to assess the accuracy of the estimates and future vehicle model changes. For significant markets we furthermore also audited the consistency of the assumptions made by Daimler with residual value forecasts by independent expert third parties.\n\n## Our Observations\n\nthe assumptions and assessments providing the basis for the assessment of the recoverability of the externally purchased mercedes-Benz passenger cars in the statement of financial position caption 'equipment on operating leases' and the recorded impairment losses are appropriate.",

Further information on allowances on receivables from financial services can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in E /uni00A0Note 1 \u00bbsignificant Accounting policies\u00ab, in E Note 14 \u00bbReceivables from financial services\u00ab, in E Note 33 \u00bbmanagement of financial risks\u00ab and in the comments in the combined management report in the section entitled \u00bbindustry and business risks and opportunities\u00ab.\n\n## The Risk for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nReceivables from financial services (\u20ac 96,185 million) resulting from the group's financing and leasing activities include receivables from sales financing with customers, receivables from sales financing with dealers and receivables from finance lease contracts. the loss allowances on these receivables amounted at the reporting date to \u20ac 1,598 million.\n\nthe calculation of the loss allowances is based on expected credit losses and therefore also includes expectations regarding the future. Recognition of the expected credit losses is carried out by means of a three-parameter procedure for the determination of loss allowances. At the same time, various factors determining the value, such as the determination of statistical default probabilities and loss rates, the possible receivable amount on default, the parameter transfer criteria that are related to a significant change in the default risk of borrowers, and the calculation of future cash flows. Furthermore, macroeconomic scenarios (basis scenarios, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios) flow into the calculation, which also include covid-19 effects, the identification of which to a high degree includes discretionary judgments and uncertainties. Further external information, for instance in connection with the covid-19 pandemic which cannot be depicted through the scenarios, are included in the measurement, to the extent necessary, by downstream adjustments. there is a risk for the financial statements is that the creditworthiness of customers and future cash flows is misjudged or that the calculation of the risk provision parameters is incorrect so that loss allowances are not recognized or are insufficient.\n\n## Our Audit Approach\n\nWe obtained a comprehensive understanding of the development of the portfolios, the associated counterparty default risks and the processes for identifying, managing, monitoring and measuring credit risks by inspecting analyses and risk reports, interrogations, review of guidelines and working instructions, checking the defined methods and their implementation and checking and walking through the validation process and the individual validation reports.\n\nWe audited the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system with regard to the risk classification process and risk models and the identification of the factors determining the value and the loss allowances, also by rechecking the calculations. to this end, we also evaluated the relevant it systems and internal procedures. in addition to the audit by our it specialists of the propriety of the it systems affected and related interfaces to ensure the completeness and correctness of the data, the audit also included the audit of automatic controls for data entry and data processing. the main focus of our audit was the evaluation of the methodical approach in the determination of risk categories, default probabilities and loss rates that are derived from historical data. We took into account the impact of covid-19 in conjunction with the audit of the macroeconomic scenarios and the downstream adjustments. We obtained an understanding of this based on a risk-oriented selection of credit portfolios. We satisfied ourselves with regard to the appropriateness of significant risk parameters based on the results of a validation performed by Daimler mobility and evaluated the adjustments of the parameters to the current market situation. in this connection, we furthermore audited the data supporting the validations on the basis of a conscious sample.\n\n## Our Observations\n\nthe methodical approach, the procedures and the processes to calculate the impairment losses and the assumptions and risk parameters flowing into the measurement are appropriate to identify the credit risks in good time and to determine the recognition of adequate loss allowances.",

Based on historical analyses, we assessed the accuracy of the forecasts of past warranty, guarantee and goodwill costs. We also checked that updated assessments of the future repair costs and procedures were taken into account. We obtained an understanding for the underlying numbers of vehicles through the actual unit sales.\n\n## Our Observations\n\nthe calculation methods and the assumptions made are appropriate.\n\n## Accounting treatment of legal proceedings\n\nplease refer with regard to the accounting policies and methods applied to the notes to the consolidated financial statements E /uni00A0Note 1 \u00bbsignificant accounting policies \u00ab and in E /uni00A0Note 2 \u00bbAccounting estimates and management judgments\u00ab.

As of the reporting date, assessments were available from external attorneys on the relevant proceedings, which support the assessment of the risks by the legal representatives.\n\nWhere agreement has been reached in the meantime regarding individual matters, we compared the amounts originally estimated with the final obligations and in this way obtained an impression of the quality of the estimates.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the appropriateness of the description of the aforementioned legal proceedings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Our Observations\n\nthe discretionary assessments and assumptions of the legal representatives are appropriate.\n\n## Other information\n\nthe legal representatives and the supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. the other information comprises the following elements of the combined management report, the content of which we have not audited:\n\n- -   the combined declaration on corporate management, which is referred to in the combined management report.\n\nthe other information comprises in addition the remaining parts of the annual report.\n\nthe other information does not comprise the consolidated financial statements, the audited disclosures in the management report and our related auditor's report.\n\nour opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nin connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- -   is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, the audited disclosures in the management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- -   otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nif, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.",

We also\n\n- -   identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -   obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- -   evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures.",
