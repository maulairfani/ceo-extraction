Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nAfter  a  strong  year  in  2019,  we  had  a  good  momentum  coming into  the  new  year.  Unexpectedly, reports of a seriously infectious virus started spreading rapidly. We soon realised that the world was facing a new pandemic, but none of us could have predicted that the situation would prevail for so long. The health authorities have started vaccinating populations, but it will take time before we can put Covid-19 behind us. Lock-down, layoffs and bankruptcies in the business sector will probably be prevalent for years to come.\n\nStorebrand  provides  products  and  services  that  are  essential  for the functioning of our ociety. The pandemic put us all to the test. I am very proud of our ability to handle the situation in a good way, both  for  our  customers  and  each  other.  Customers,  authorities and our auditors have given us feedback of a well-organised and effective emergency response. We handled the increased risk well, delivered good returns on the capital we manage on behalf of our customers, paid out pensions and insurance settlements, we  issued loans  and payment deferrals, and we  provided extensive advice to our customers during a period of uncertainty. Most of the work was carried out while working from home. We adopted new ways of interacting and maintaining productivity, using digital tools and a spirit of collaboration. We implemented infection control measures quickly,  which  meant  that  we  were  fortunate  enough  to  avoid outbreaks of infection in connection with work carried out in our premises throughout the year.\n\nIn  the  corporate  market  in  Norway,  we  landed  several  large  new customers in a competitive market. We also received renewed trust from existing customers who announced bids on tenders. We are prepared to roll up our sleeves as individual pension accounts are introduced  in  Norway  in  2021.  We  will  continue  to  work  hard  to provide good customer experiences, so that customers will prefer Storebrand.\n\nIn  the  Norwegian  public  service  pension  market,  we  are  the  only challenger  to  KLP,  which  has  had  a  monopoly  for  several  years. Through our continuous efforts, we achieved several breakthroughs throughout  the  year  with  public  enterprises,  culminating  in  the agreement with Vestland County. This is an important step to realise business opportunities in the future.\n\nIn the market for defined contribution pensions, we have achieved the  best  return  in  the  market  for  several  of  the  last  five  years, which enhances our standing to new and existing customers. Our guaranteed products also had better returns than our competitors, both in Norway and Sweden. This was crucial to preserving financial solvency in a turbulent financial market. The results give us credibility as  a  professional  asset  manager  and  help  secure  the  basis  for further growth.\n\nOur subsidiary in Sweden, SPP, succeeds in transferring almost 90 per cent of the customer stock to a new technological platform, and is now the fastest growing pension company in Sweden. We continue to focus on the Swedish market, with digitisation, sustainability and service development as our most important value propositions. In  the  private  market  in  Norway,  we  established  several  solid\n\n6\n\npartnerships, including with Huseierne and Coop. Both organisations represent a large number of members and strengthen our distribution and  competitiveness  towards  retail  clients  all  over  Norway.  The purchase of Insr strengthened our position in non-life insurance. The takeover of the Insr portfolio is well underway.\n\nSales  of  non-life  insurance  increased  by  15  per  cent  from  2019  to 2020, and online sales in insurance rose by 63 percent. We see great growth opportunities in non-life insurance in the years to come.\n\nIn  Norway,  the  'My  Money'  app  was  downloaded  by  over  120,000 people.  The  cooperation  between  the  savings  branch  in  the  retail market,  and  Storebrand  asset  management  continued  its  positive development. We will build on our strong position in asset management to strengthen our value proposal to retail clients.\n\nStorebrand's  ability  to  create  value  contributed  to  several  new international agreements in asset management, including a mandate of NOK 5 billion in England. We currently manage over NOK 960 billion on behalf of our customers and have ambitions for further growth.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that our sustainability work leads to real-world  results,  whether  in  cooperation  with  large  international organisations to stop deforestation in Brazil, or through good returns in our specialised sustainability funds. In 2020, Storebrand was named the world's most sustainable insurance company by Corporate Knights Global 100. In addition, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index included the Storebrand stock on its list of the 10 per cent most sustainable companies in the world. Both are important recognitions of our longterm work on sustainability, and on systematic reporting on targets and results. In 2020, we introduced a new climate policy for the whole group, a new climate strategy for Storebrand's investments and a new purchasing policy with clear expectations for our suppliers.\n\nInspired by 2020, where developing new working habits were essential, we will, through the Future Storebrand project, further develop our workplace and practices so that they are adapted to the needs of individual  teams  and  departments.  The  aim  is  to  further  develop Storebrand as a leading and future-oriented workplace.\n\nAlthough  2020  was  a  different  year,  our  regular  employee  surveys showed that we had a high level of engagement among our employees, significantly above the industry average. This is important to the more than 200 new employees who were employed at Storebrand through last year, and all existing employees.\n\nFor  me,  I  will  look  back  at  2020  as  a  year  whereh  we  delivered  on our social mission in demanding circumstances. We were there when our  customers  needed  us  most,  and  our  employees,  products  and services helped create a future to look forward to for very many.\n\nOdd Arild Grefstad",

We will manage this responsibility in a proper manner. Storebrand collaborates with the companies we are invested in, and express clear expectations towards our suppliers, to achieve changes that contribute to a more sustainable world. We also help our customers make informed choices through long-term savings solutions that provide good returns and positive social development.\n\n## Didrik Munch Chairman, Storebrand ASA\n\nIn 2020, the pandemic outbreak put all parts of society to the test. Storebrand  was  conscious  of  its  responsibilities,  both  as  a  service provider and an employer. The Board would like to thank all employees for the all their contributions that enabled Storebrand to assist our customers when they needed us most. Everyone at Storebrand has shown  great  flexibility,  ensuring  that  our  critical  tasks  have  been solved in an extraordinary situation.\n\nThis  has  made  us  capable  of  delivering  good  results  throughout the  year.  The  total  return  for  the  year  was  slightly  higher  than  for comparable  European  companies 5) , and  defined  contribution pensions in Norway Storebrand still has higher average returns over the  past  five  years  than  our  competitors.  Within  savings,  which  is Storebrand's core business, we see increased fee and administration income as a result of strong underlying volume growth in unit linked and asset management.\n\nTo secure a future to look forward to, we must make good decisions today.  We  managed the pension and saving of around two million people in Norway and Sweden- and our decisions today will affect their future. In the following, I want to highlight some of the changes I  believe  will  have  the  greatest  impact  on  our  customers,  and  for Storebrand, over the next few years.\n\nIn  2021,  1.5  million  people  will  get  access  to  individual  pension accounts in Norway. Individual pension account means that pensions saved by current and former employers are collected in a separate pension account in the current employer's scheme. The purpose is to give employees a better overview and control of their own pension and savings, and ultimately higher payouts. Workers can also choose freely  to  move  the  pension  savings  out  of  the  employer's  pension scheme,  to  a  provider  of  their  choice.  The  individual  retirement account  is  expected  to  increase  competition,  both  to  attract  new\n\ncustomers and retain existing ones. Through this, margins in the industry will be ever more competitive. For Storebrand, this will require more costeffective services, and upholding our professional management. Our goal is to sustain our position as the leading provider of occupational pensions in the private sector.\n\nAlso, in Sweden we see that the competition is intensifying. The Swedish occupational  pension  market  is  fragmented,  with  mutual  pension companies,  bank-owned  life  and  pension  companies,  and  insurance providers.\n\nIn  the  past  two  years,  three  of  the  largest  brokerage  companies  have been acquired by private equity firms. This indicates a strong belief in growth in the financial advice market, in an industry that has traditionally been unavailable to new entrants. All competitors express strong growth ambitions.\n\nTo ensure healthy margins across our markets, we must continue to have cost-effective operations and foster digital innovation power. Digitisation of  the  entire  value  chain  ensures  good  distribution  and  self-service solutions that provide increased flexibility for customers.\n\nCustomers in the retail market expect ever more individualised services, which we can deliver through customer insights, analysis capacity, valueadded services, and good advice from capable employees. Going forward, we will build on newly established partnerships to strengthen distribution possibilities and further develop our value proposal to existing and new customers within savings, insurance and banking.  With long traditions, the breadth of our service offering, sustainable and innovative solutions, we are well positioned for further growth in the Norwegian retail market.\n\nStorebrand has a great starting point for strengthening our position in the public sector as well. The market potential is significant, and the public",

Based on our expertise and strong technological platform, and as the sole provider of occupational pensions to both the retail market and the public sector, we have all the prerequisites in place to achieve profitable growth, satisfied customers and efficient customer solutions.\n\nIn recent years, Storebrand asset management has evolved from a focus on investments in traditional asset classes such as equities and bonds- to an increasingly  diversified  portfolio  including  real  estate, private  equity  and  infrastructure.  Storebrand  asset  management is now recognised as a leading multi-boutique manager in the Nordic region. We will continue to build on the positive momentum, with the aim of realizing further growth ambitions as a Nordic powerhouse for asset management.\n\nStorebrand has 25 years of experience with sustainable investments, and is consistently ranked highly for our efforts, both nationally and internationally.  Sustainable  finance  is  high  on  the  EUs  agenda  and hence  important  Storebrand  and  our  stakeholders.  The  EU  Action Plan for Sustainable Finance will be a clear premise for the financial industry in the years ahead. The Disclosure Regulation, which comes into force in March 2021, sets clear requirements for the disclosure of environmental aspects, social aspects and corporate governance (ESG) for fund managers and institutional investors. Storebrand has been working systematically on sustainability for decades and is well prepared to adapt to the new regulatory requirement.\n\n5) Se kapittel 3, People - dette er fornoten p\u00e5 norsk?!\n\n8\n\nClimate adaptation and the transition to a low-emission society involve both  risks  and  opportunities  for  Storebrand.  Through  the  investor initiative Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), we are committed to adapting our investment portfolio to the 1.5-degree target of the Paris  Agreement,  which  means  that  the  investment  portfolio  must be  carbon  neutral  by2050,  at  the  latest.  This  is  an  ambitious  goal that requires close dialogue with the companies we invest in to help reduce their emissions.\n\nThe  time  ahead  will  present  a  number  of  exciting  challenges  for Storebrand. I am convinced that Storebrand's employees will handle these  in  an  excellent  way.  There  is  a  high  level  of  engagement  in the  organisation,  and  many  employees  highlight  that  sustainability gives their work and additional purpose.   This will make Storebrand capable of delivering value beyond financial returns to our customers. Storebrand will continue to contribute to lasting and positive changes, in line with our customers and society's expectations. We will continue to challenge ourselves, the companies in we invest in, our suppliers and partners, so that we all contribute to the transition we all face. At the same time, we will help our customers make good choices so that they have a future to look forward to.\n\nIn  2020, storebrand employees showed a fantastic ability to adapt, almost  overnight,  to  a  life  consisting  of  home  office,  home  school, closed kindergartens and limited social interaction. While still being there for our customers.  The experience was demanding for both managers and employees, but contributed to new ways of working together across the organisation. The team spirit was strengthened, and many acquired new knowledge that will be very valuable going forward.",

Appendix\n\n## Sustainability as a core business\n\nIn  2019,  the  UN    released  the  results  of  the  most  thorough planetary  health  check  ever  undertaken,  the  IPBES 6) report on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The report is clear in its conclusion:    Loss  of  biodiversity  and  ecosystems  occurs  to  a extent that must be limited urgently so as not to entail irreversible consequences.  The  backdrop  for  the  report  is  the  2018    UN Special Report on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C, which concluded that the transition to a low-emission society requires swift action. The transition  represents  both  financial  risks  and  opportunities  for Storebrand as an investor and asset manager.\n\nThe  financial  sector  plays  a  key  role  in  helping  to  achieve  the UN  Sustainable  Development  Goalsn(SDGs).  Through  good management,  our  pensions,  savings  and  investments  can  be powerful  tools  to  address  key  challenges  and  to  realise  the Sustainability  goals.  As  a  significant  asset  owner,  insurer  and asset manager, we also see great economic opportunities in the alignment of investment portfolios to a sustainable agenda, in line with international obligations. In the long term, this will also result in higher returns.\n\nCompanies  with  sustainability  as  a  key  part  of  their  business strategy  have  good  conditions  for  managing  climate  and sustainability  risks  and  capitalizing  on  the  opportunities  they represent. There is growing consensus that companies that have a  strategy  in  line  with  the  SDGs  and  the  Paris  Agreement  have better  conditions  than  others  to  create  long-term  returns  and may be better positioned to succeed in future markets.\n\n## Sustainability in Storebrand\n\nSustainability is integrated  in  our  business  strategy  and implemented across the entire business, including investments, products and product development, procurement, employment policies and business management.\n\nOur main objective is to leverage sustainability as a competitive advantage.  Members  of  the  executive  management  group are  responsible  for  achieving  our  main  strategic  goals  on sustainability within their respective business areas. Business unit goals and targets are reviewed three times a year by the executive management group and semi-annually by the Board of Directors.\n\nAt an operational level, our work on sustainability is divided into three areas: Keeping our house in order, products and services, and communication and stakeholder engagement.\n\n## Keeping our house in order\n\nIn our work, we rely on these sustainability principles:\n\n- \u00b7 We  base  our  business  activities  on  the  UN  Sustainable Development Goals.\n- \u00b7 We help our customers to live more sustainably. We do this by managing  our  customers'  money  in  a  sustainable  manner,  in addition to providing sustainable financing and insurance.\n- \u00b7 We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7 Our  processes  and  decisions  are  based  on  sustainability outcomes  -  from  the  Board  and  management,  who  have the  ultimate  responsibility,  to  each  employee  who  promotes sustainability in their respective business area.\n- \u00b7 We use the precautionary principle when it comes to mitigating social and environmental risk.\n- \u00b7 We  are  transparent  about  our  work  and  our  sustainability results.\n\nWe have identified three SDGs  which we can significantly impact by the way we manage our group's business and people processes.At the end of relevant chapters of this report, figures are provided that show how far we have come in this work.\n\nWe work actively  towards  equal  opportunities and gender balance in work and economic life (target 5.5).\n\nWe  aim  to  achieve  decent  work  for  all  our employees,  and  equal  pay  for  work  of  equal value (target 8.5).\n\nWe aim to  protect  labour  rights  and  promote safe  and  secure  working  environments  for  all our  workers,  contractors  and  suppliers  (target 8.8).\n\nWe continuously work towards encouraging and expanding  access  to  banking,  insurance  and financial services for all (target 8.10).\n\nWe strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climaterelated hazards and natural disasters in our operations and in our investments (target 13.1).\n\nWe integrate climate change measures into our policies, strategies and planning (target 13.2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n\n## Products and Services\n\nStorebrand is a leading financial player in the Nordic market and will  be  a  pioneer  in  sustainable  investments.  We  started  with sustainable investments already in the mid-1990s. In  2005, we introduced minimum standards for all our investments through the Storebrand standard, and in 2010 we integrated sustainability into all our funds through a separate ranking methodology. In 2020, Prospera ranked us in first  place  in  the  sustainable  investment category in both Norway and Sweden, and we achieved the highest score at Mercer within ESG. Furthermore, we scored best among the  major  financial  institutions  in  the  Ethical  Banking  Guide  in Norway and were included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index's list of the world's ten per cent most sustainable companies.\n\nThese  are  important  recognitions  of  the  work  both  with operationalization  of  sustainability  throughout  our  business, and the integration of criteria for sustainability in our investment products. All our funds are managed according to the Storebrand standard.  In  addition,  9.6  per  cent  of  our  capital  invested  in what we call solutions - companies that contribute to the UN's sustainability  goals,  green  bonds,  and  certified  green  property investments.   In addition, almost 40 per cent (379 billion NOK) of our assets under management at the end of 2020, were invested in fossil-free funds. All assets under management in our Swedish branch SPP Funds are invested in funds consisting of companies unaffiliated with the fossil sector.\n\nWe have  identified  eight  SDGs  (below)  where  we  can  have  the greatest impact through our investment activities. We use these sustainability  goals  actively  in  asset  management,  for  example when applying our sustainability rating. In addition, we consider accountability and anti-corruption (SDG 16) when engaging with the companies we invest in (see page 62). For Specific measures and objectives related to these sustainability  goals  in  our  asset management  are  described  in  the  chapter  a  driving  force  for sustainable investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communication and stakeholder dialogue\n\nWe  are  open  about  our  sustainability  efforts  and  report  in accordance  with  several  leading  reporting  standards,  including the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI),  task  force  on  ClimateRelatedFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) and Carbon Disclosure  Project (CDP), in line with the expectations of a number of key stakeholders. Strategic ambitions, specific goals, reporting and communication on sustainability are important success criteria in our work.  In addition, we engage in international sustainability initiatives such as  The Net Zero  Asset  Owner  Alliance  and  Climate  Action  100+  to    help  our customers have a future to look forward to.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  form  strong  partnerships  to  realise  our sustainability  objectives.  This  illustrates  our strong commitment to Sustainable development goal17:  collaboration  to  achieve  the  goals.  In addition,  through  stakeholder  dialogue  and communication,  we  want  to  influence  these sustainability goals:\n\nWe encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information  into  their  reporting  cycle  (target 12.6).\n\nWe strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in our operations and in our investments (target 13.1).\n\nWe integrate climate change measures into our policies, strategies and planning (target 13.2).",

Financial capital and investment universe\n- 2. Customer relations\n- 3. Our people\n- 4. Keeping our house in order\n\nThe focus areas and associated themes are presented in the materiality matrix above.\n\nThe material themes are ranked according to the influence they have on our stakeholders' assessments and  their decisions related to Storebrand, and their significance of business impact.\n\nThe materiality analysis forms the structure of this annual report and includes input from our stakeholders.  The focus area financial capital and investment universe and the three underlying material topics are consistently ranked as very significant among our stakeholders.  They are also very relevant to the Group's strategy and risk management. Therefore, our reporting on this focus area has been included in the Directors Report. Other material themes are also ranked with high importance, including topic E: Engaging, relevant and responsible advice,\n\nG: Simple and seamless customer experiences, and K: Governance and compliance: privacy and combating financial crime. These are discussed in relevant chapters in the main part of the annual report. Common for all chapters is that they are divided into four parts; why it is important for Storebrand and for our stakeholders, goals and ambitions, our approach, and reults. The key figures for each focus area are reported to the group management on an ongoing basis, and to the Board of Directors annually.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI standards (Core option). Our GRI index can be viewed on page 201. The guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) are also used as foundation for the report.\n\nThis year's report covers Storebrand's operations in Norway and Sweden. The environmental data presented in the chapter keeping our house in order includes the head offices of Norway and Sweden as well as Skagen's head office, representing the office premises of 95 per cent of the group's employees. The figures do not cover the smaller, local offices or Cubera, as these are not considered material due to their size.  See page 197  for more information about companies in the Storebrand Group.",

We will motivate our customers to make good decisions in savings, banking  and  insurance  by  delivering  customer  experiences  that meet their  needs  at  different  stages  of  life.  Through  good  asset management and structures for risk management, we will ensure that our customers get good returns in a sustainable manner on their investments. Dialogue with our customers takes place through both digital and serviced channels. Our goal is to be closest to the customer, simple and sustainable.\n\n## Why\n\nRecent reforms to the Norwegian and Swedish pension systems require greater responsibility from individuals for their own longterm  financial  situation,  including  pensions.  This  is  especially true  considering  that  life  expectancy  has  increased,  and  that Norwegians can expect less support from the government to meet living costs throughout retirement. Taking an active responsibility for your personal finances is important to lead the life you want, both throughout working life and as a pensioner.\n\nNorwegian  residents  received  their  own  pension  account  (Egen pensjonskonto)  from  February  2021.  It  is  intended  to  provide better oversight and control over your own pension and increase payouts. New rules for retirement savings are also being developed in  Sweden.  It  will  be  easier  and  more  affordable  for  employees to  move  pension  funds  saved  from  1  July  2007  to  the  present da.  Swedish  authorities  are  exploring  several  measures  to  limit fees related to insurance and savings schemes, to ensure proper freedom of choice for workers.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur aim is to offer customers a range of services designed to meet the breadth of their financial needs at all stages of life. In Norway, we offer relevant products and services in banking and insurance. In Sweden, our offer is limited to savings.\n\nOur  customers  should  be  confident  that  we  offer  relevant  and attractive products, and that we manage their savings so that they get the best return possible. We provide information and advice to our corporate customers to enable them to assist their employees in  making  better  financial  decisions.  We  work  to  build  strong\n\nrelationships  with  corporate  customers  and  their  employees through holistic and customised follow-up. Through digital solutions, customer seminars and consulting, we make it easier for companies to understand their pension schemes, and for their employees to gain oversight and control of their own pension. We value the use of qualified advisors and comprehensible communication. Overall, Storebrand is a preferred provider of pension services.\n\nThe Storebrand brand in Norway is communicated to the market through  the  communication  concept  'Good  money'.  Storebrand should be known for its ability to create value through sustainable investments,  profitable  sustainability.  In  2020,  we  developed several products and services that support this strategy. The target for 2021 in Norway is to increase the number of customers who have products from at least one of our product lines by 10 per cent. In  Sweden,  SPP  aims  to  be  the  occupational  pension  company known for being passionate about making occupational pensions easy  for  the  employees  of  our  corporate  customers.  We  offer extensive expertise, digital services, tailored advice, and a complete product  offering.  We  develop  attractive  benefit  packages  for employees and focus on sustainable investments, in line with the widespread demand for this type of pension and savings products in the Swedish market.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe provide information in an understandable manner and make good advice readily available to help our customers gain oversight of  their  personal  finances.  Development  of  digital  tools  and  the improvement of digital communication are important instruments, both in the Norwegian and Swedish markets.\n\nIn  Norway  we  launched  a  new  version  of  'My  Money'.  The  'My Money' app helps our customers get an overview and take control of  their  pension  and  other  savings.  Based  on  figures  from  the Norwegian  public  pension  scheme  (Folketrygdfondet),  private pension  savings  and  employers,  customers  can  calculate  their future  pensions.  We  also  use  the  app  to  encourage  our  own employees to become private customers at Storebrand. The service 'SmartPension' enables customers approaching retirement age to plan their transition to a new phase in their lives. During this phase, we see a higher demand from our customers for counselling.",

An example is the development of a new interface for calculating and updating pension contributions. In 2020, SPP also developed a fully digital service for employees to choose when and how they want their pension payouts.\n\nIn  the  autumn  of  2020,  we  launched  a  digital  tool  called  'your climate footprint' in Sweden. The tool shows the carbon footprint of  the  investments  associated  with  an  employee's  pensions  and savings, compared to the carbon footprint if the investments had been made in funds without a sustainability profile. Companies use the  information  in  communication  with  employees,  in  their  own sustainability  reporting,  and  to  strengthen  their  own  profiling  on sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are continuously working to stimulate, and  expand  access,  to  banking  and insurance services and financial services for all (target 8.10).\n\n## 'Storebrand shall be known for our ability to create value through sustainable investments.'\n\n## Results\n\nAlmost  half  a  million  people  have  checked  their  pension  on Storebrand' s website in Norway in 2020. Throughout the year, more than 120,000 customers downloaded the 'My Money' app, which was launched in a new version in 2020.\n\nIn Sweden, more than 410,000 customers logged into SPP's website to  attain  information  about  their  pension,  while  10,000  corporate customers logged in to review and manage the company's pension solutions.\n\nA  significant  number  of  corporate  customers  also  chose  to  enter into  an  agreement  on  digital  payment  of  occupational  pensions. After the service was introduced, more than 50 per cent of all private customers who retired in 2020 chose a fully digital pension payment solution.",

Appendix\n\n## Engaging, relevant and responsible advice\n\n## Why\n\nPensions  and  Insurance  are  often  perceived  as  complicated.  It can  be  difficult  to  understand  which  agreements  and  rights  are collective and which are personal, as well as which conditions apply to the various agreements.\n\nThrough the different phases of working life and up to retirement age,  our  customers  receive  insight  and  oversight  of  their  own pension, savings and insurance agreements.\n\nRelevant and responsible advisory services are the most important prerequisites  for  customer  satisfaction.  We  will  help  customers purchase products and services that are relevant and appropriate in the life situation they are in.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe aim to provide the customer with financial security and freedom through  attractive  products  and  services.  Through  professional management  of  capital  adapted  to  the  customer's  risk  profile and time horizon, and through a wide range of products, we shall contribute to growth in our customers' pension and savings capital. The goal is also to increase the number of products each customer has purchased through Storebrand.\n\nIn Norway, we have an ambition that 75 per cent of our advisors across savings, banking and insurance should be authorised at all times. In Sweden, certification 8) is required for advisors to carry out counselling, and all our advisers are certified.\n\n## Approach\n\nThe starting point for all customer contact is the principle of putting the customer first. This is reflected in our service standards:\n\n- \u00b7 Trustworthy - I keep what I promise, and I am a professional.\n- \u00b7 Caring - I treat everyone individually, help them, and give advice.\n- \u00b7 Enthusiastic - I am positive and exceed expectations.\n- \u00b7 Efficient -  I  make  the  customer  journey  easy  and  improve your organisation.\n\nHigh  ethical  standards,  good  quality  advisory  services  and  firstclass customer care are fundamental.  Our   advisors in Norway are authorised through the financial advisors authorisation scheme (AFR),  the non-life insurance and personal insurance authorisation scheme (AIS and AIP) and/or the authorisation scheme for credit and  personal  insurance,  all  under  the  auspices  of  the    financial industry.\n\nOur authorisation and competency requirements are communicated to customers across digital platforms. In 2020, a separate framework for  career  development  was  developed  among  the  advisors  in  the Norwegian retail market. The framework describes the requirements and responsibilities for the various roles, including the requirements for authorisations.\n\nThe  interaction  between  digital  and  physical  customer  service  will become  increasingly  important.  In  Storebrand,  teams  work  closely together  for  various  forms  of  customer  service  to  prioritise  and develop initiatives.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2020,  Storebrand  was  ranked  2nd  in  the  Norwegian  Customer Barometer's  annual  measurement  of  customer  satisfaction  in  the corporate  market.  The  score  of  73  points  (out  of  100)  indicates that customers were well satisfied with their customer relationship. Storebrand received the highest score on loyalty among corporate customers. It is also pleasing that sustainability was an important driver of loyalty and trust. This confirmed that Storebrand' s commitment to profitable sustainability will become an important differentiator in both the corporate and retail markets.\n\nIn the market for transferable savings 9) had a market share of 21.7 per cent at the end of 2020, up from 19.9 in 2019. In the non-life insurance market, we had a market share of 4.5 per cent.\n\nIn the market for banking we had a market share of 1.7 per cent in 2020.\n\nSPP has grown significantly in the Swedish market. Several companies demand sustainable management of employees' pension funds. In 2020, 25 per cent of transferable funds in the occupational pension market were transferred to the SPP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 8) The reason we do not have an ambition of 100 per cent is that there will always be some turnover in the Organization.\n- 9) Free funds (retail market), individual pension, individual capital, pension capital certificate (PKB), and policy of investment choice (FMI). .",

Technology  affects customer behavior and expectations, our ability to deliver services to the customer, and is a prerequisite for automating and improving both distribution and customer experiences.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur overall ambition is to increase the number of satisfied and loyal customers, and streamline the group, through the use of automation and digital services. Digital distribution and self-service enable us to serve our customers more efficiently. At the same time, customers are more satisfied when they can use self-service solutions at times and in channels that suit them.\n\n## Approach\n\nDigital  &  Innovation  was  established  as  a  separate  commercial group  unit  in  2019,  as  a  step  to  further  develop  our  operations and  customer  experiences  using  technology  and  digital  services. Digital business development takes place in multidisciplinary teams where product managers, business developers, analysts, developers and  designers  work  together  to  understand  customers,  improve customer  experiences,  and  solve  the  customers'  needs  through digital services.\n\nBy being close to our customers, we can understand their behaviour, challenges and needs.  Digital development had a high level of activity in  2020.  Multiple  improvements  were  made  to  existing  solutions, while  new  services  were  developed  throughout  the  year.  We integrated the work with digital trust and information security in the teams, so that they have better conditions for safeguarding privacy and  information  security  both  in  concept  development,  design, development, and operation of the services.\n\nNew working patterns because of Covid-19 resulted in a change of pace in digitalisation among Storebrand' s customers and employees, as  in  society  at  large.    Never  before  have  we  had  so  many  digital customer meetings, sold as much in digital channels and handled as many settlement cases digitally as in 2020.\n\nDigitalisation provides many opportunities for the development and provision of value-added services to our customers, based on their needs.  In  2020,  we  partnered  with  Aprila  Bank  for  credit  to  small and medium-sized businesses, with Homely for alarm services, with Justify for legal services and with The Home Doctors for Medical Care. In addition, we strengthened our cooperation with Dreams related to a new debt repayment service.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2020,  we  had  more  than  four  million  visits  to  Storebrand.no.The number of page views increased by approximately 10 per cent from 2019,  and  organic  traffic  increased  by  20  per  cent.  Additionally,  the number of digital sales of insurance and savings increased by 25 per cent.\n\nAlmost  half  a  million  people  checked  their  own  retirement  savings through our website and mobile app in 2020.\n\nStorebrand  Bank  reached  record  high  sales  figures  for  mortgages in  2020.  The  bank  is  providing  an  updated  digital  service  for  loan applications- and the number of people taking out loans after using the service increased by 15 per cent. In addition, we entered partnerships for mortgages into with the real estate chain Nordvik and Huseierne.\n\nAutomation of settlement processes improves customer experiences. Improvements to the processes contributed to a significant increase in fully or partially automated payments of disability pensions in 2020, from  400  to  1  200  payments.  Average  waiting  times  were  reduced by  75  percent,  and  the  number  of  cases  resolved  within  one  day  is increasing steadily.\n\nIn  2020  we  launched  the  app  'My  Money',  which  is  a  further development of 'My Pension'. The app gives the customer insight of their pensions and other savings at Storebrand overall, making financial planning a lot easier. After six months, nearly 120,000 customers had downloaded and adopted the app.\n\nWe  improved  the  health  insurance  app,  'Get  Healthy,'  and  added new partnerships during the year. In addition to physiotherapists, Eyr, online psychologist and digital self-help program, our customers now get access to Snapmed(dermatologists online),  ExorLive(exercises and programs made by physiotherapists) and Home Doctors(home visits from a doctor). The proliferation and use of the 'Dreams' app continued to increase in 2020, and the app cemented its position as one of the most popular savings services in Norway. The number of downloads increased from 200,000 in 2019 to more than 300,000 in 2020. By yearend, customers had saved more than 1billion NOK since the launch of the app in 2019. The new 'Debt-free' service in the app helps more and more of our customers get rid of debt faster. Users of the service have reduced their repayment period by two years on average.",

Appendix\n\n## Simple and seamless customer experiences\n\n## Why\n\nCustomers'  requirements  and  expectations  have  changed noticeably  in  recent  years,  and  the  bar  is  raised  continuously as  different  players  offer  solutions  that  improve  customer experiences.  Storebrand  invests  in  technology,  services,  and concepts to deliver holistic customer experiences, adapted to the individual, across digital and serviced surfaces.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nStorebrand  aims  to  create  increased  perceived  value  for  each customer  by  delivering  personalised  and  seamless  customer experiences across serviced and digital channels.\n\n## Approach\n\nAn important step in 2020 was to introduce a new data-driven CRM  platform  for  customer  engagement.  This  work  combines two  disciplines  for  improved  customer  experiences:  service design and new technology. The platform allows us to use data in a smarter way to offer solutions tailored to each customer. The platform is scheduled to be in effect for all customers in the retail market during 2021 and will be rolled out in the corporate market in 2022.\n\nWe are also working to develop holistic customer concepts based on different customer segments, life events and customer needs. In  2020,  we  established  a  separate  unit  with  responsibility  for developing concepts and holistic value suggestions for different customer  segments  in  the  retail  market.  Based  on  customer needs  and  commercial  potential,  Storebrand  has  chosen  to prioritise people in the establishment phase, wealthy individuals, and  people  approaching  retirement  age.  One  of  the  concepts is  'Smart  pension',  a  unique  service  in  the  Norwegian  market. The service is for people who plan the transition to retirement, and makes it possible, among other things, to simulate different withdrawals of their own pension. Through pension advice and digital  solutions,  we  aim  to  realise  the  potential  of  a  customer group  with  unmet  needs.  We  are  also  launching  a  dedicated concept for wealthy customers, with holistic follow-up and access to advice within the breadth of Storebrand' s service spectrum. In addition, a new concept aimed at the general consumer market is under development and testing.\n\n## Results\n\nWhen introducing the new CRM platform in 2020, we established a customer-journey framework. The framework will help guide for how we meet the customer across our own and paid channels, with  communications,  concepts,  and  products.  The  work  will continue in 2021.\n\n'Smart Pension' is increasingly successful in providing personal advice on pension withdrawals, which helps more people choose to continue their customer relationship after they retire. In 2020, customers placed over 500 million NOK of funds at Storebrand using the 'Smart Pension' service.\n\nWork on the development of a new concept for wealthy persons began in early 2020. The target group is people who have more than NOK 3 million in placeable wealth. In addition to a personal investment  advisor,  customers  have  access  to  personalised service and follow-up within all Storebrand' s services in the retail market. The concept will be further developed in 2021.",

At short notice, almost all employees had to start working from home, many of us while at the same time dealing with  home  schooling  and  closed  kindergartens.  Everyday  life entailed new challenges for our society and for our employees. Many people felt uncertain and worried, and the challenges have unfortunately continued into 2021. Digital tools and employees' ability to use them, meant that Storebrand was probably better equipped to cope with the situation than many other businesses. We  redesigned working processes, interactions, training programs  and  activities  to  develop  company  culture  swiftly. Employees initiated and adopted new methods of collaboration, and  increased  learning  and  knowledge  across  disciplines and  organisational  units  were  reported.  We  are  proud  of  the willingness to change and the flexibility that our employees have shown throughout the year. Many challenging tasks, both directly and  indirectly  related  to  the  pandemic  were  solved  by  making use of the foundations of the HR strategy: Learning, agility, and leadership in a new landscape.\n\n## Why\n\nTo  stay  competitive  in  a  rapidly  changing  industry,  we  must provide  our  employees  with  opportunities  to  learn  throughout their  employment.  Greater  breadth  and  diversity  in  employees' competence  will  contribute  to  continued  growth  and  ability  to meet changing customer expectations,  as  well  as  development opportunities  for  our  employees.  Digital  skills,  knowledge  of customer preferences and insight into market development are important success factors.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  build  a  learning  culture  characterised  by innovation, responsibility for one's own and others' learning, and feedback, to ensure continuous development and improvement. In 2020, we combined the potential of our new communication and interaction tools, with our digital learning platform Campus Storebrand, which enabled increased social learning and learning outcomes. This was in addition to the many courses and offers found in Campus Storebrand, where mandatory training in ethics, combating  corruption  and  anti-money  laundering  has  been facilitated.\n\nIn  2020,  we  improved  our  efforts  for  coordinated  customer dialogue in multiple channels through the introduction of a new customer  engagement  platform.  This  was  also  a  competence boost, made possible by an interaction between internal forces,\n\npartners  and  the  learning  platform.    Due  to  Covid-19,  we  also decided to digitise our annual Nordic training day, 'the Storebrand Day'. Through the digital learning platform, we facilitated the day with a focus on the development of a customer centric culture: 'Closest to the customer - closer to each other'.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe  recruit  people  who  want  to  contribute  to  a  future  to  look forward to for our customers and the society as a whole. It is important for us to give our courageous employees space and mandate  to  create  unprecedented  customer  experiences. Employees  are  not  only  responsible  for  their  own  learning;  by 2020 we stressed the importance of our shared responsibility to develop together, in line with the company's needs. We do this by continuously acquiring new knowledge through collaboration in cross-functional teams and creating good customer experiences together.\n\nTransparency and sharing are prerequisites for achieving the best possible interaction and learning across the group. In 2020, we introduced new communication and interaction tools to support this. More than 100 employees with a commitment to digital tools were engaged to ensure smart and efficient use, and this work will continue in 2021. Instead of offering traditional courses, we will adapt the training to specific needs as they emerge.\n\nDue  to  the  pandemic,  many  of  our  new  employees  became acquainted with Storebrand and new colleagues primarily through digital channels. Already in April, we developed a new introductory programme for new employees.  Through the program, 'Smart Start', new employees were included in a series of digital learning activities and joint meetings during their first month. In this way, they  became  well  acquainted  with  each  other  and  Storebrand, even though we could not meet physically at work. The managers closest  to  the  new  employees  were  invited  to  a  group  chat  to enhance their introduction.\n\nMore  than  35  middle  managers  participated  in  our  digital leadership development  program,  'Storebrand  Leadership Weekly',  focusing  on  issues  of  trust  and  transformation management  through  strength-based  development.  In  2010, the program was reinforced with a separate learning course in Campus Storebrand.\n\nIn  September  2020,  23  employees  with  up  to  three  years  of experience, completed the 'Storebrand future impact' program. The program was structured around the development of three skills:  self-management,  relationships  and  collaboration,  and complex problem solving. The participants completed a project based on agile development principles and used tools from the program to solve global challenges in a responsible, ethical and",

The  aim  of  the  program  is  to  educate  future leaders and change agents in Storebrand.\n\nWe  conducted  our  summer  internship  program  for  students, 'Sandbox', partly digital. Students held weekly presentations over video.  In  order  for  participants  to  get  to  know  each  other  well before they started, we facilitated a digital introduction (over four meetings) from May to June.\n\nThe Storebrand Academy for future leaders started up in April 2020 with 20 participants. The first two collections were conducted digitally.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2020, we offered 118 courses via the digital learning platform Campus Storebrand.\n\nA total of 1 997 people participated in one or more courses under the auspices of Storebrand. Our employees completed a total of 7 702 hours of learning, an average of 3.9 hours per person. However, this figure does not give a complete picture of all digital learning through last year, as many employees take courses on other online platforms, as well as over Teams, which we do not keep statisticson. By the end of 2020, more than 70 per cent of our employees had completed training in the new Personal Data Act.\n\nStorebrand was well equipped for the government-imposed home office situation initiated in March. By the end of 2020, more than 84 per cent of the workforce used Teams for digital meetings.  The peakon employee survey showed that employee satisfaction with their own work tools increased from 7.8 to 8.1 on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the highest score.\n\nTen students, out of 650 applicants, were accepted to our summer internship program in Norway, while five students participated in our summer program in Sweden. The participants consisted of nine women and six men, and they had backgrounds in economics, technology, psychology, development, entrepreneurship and  design.  The  students  were  very  pleased  with  the  digital introduction  they  received.  Therefore,  the  plan  is  to  facilitate digital introduction for future participants as well.\n\nThree  gatherings  were  held  for  the  23  talents  in  Storebrand Future Impact.  Two of sessions were conducted digitally due to Covid-19.  The  project  work,  which  lasted  eight  weeks  and  was carried out according to the Agile Business Exploration method, was  facilitated  and  carried  out  digitally.  Despite  the  changes explained above, the program achieved a satisfaction score of 84 out of 100. The goal of the program is to enable the participants to become effective ambassadors for change.  When evaluating goal achievement on this criterion, participants gave an average score for the program of 4.92 out of 6.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n\nFemale managers\n\nin group\n\n39%\n\n## Engaged, competent and courageous employees\n\nWhy\n\nStorebrand's  employees  are  our  main  source  of  innovation, development  and  growth.  Employees  who  are  courageous pathfinders who dare to innovate, and challenge prevailing norms are essential to realizing our goal of becoming a world-class savings group.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur ambition is to strengthen employee satisfaction, job satisfaction and  engagement  through  meaningful  work,  good  management, a  motivating  working  environment,  development  opportunities and  confidence  in  management.  Our  managers  are  responsible for  setting  clear  objectives  and  for  encouraging  employees  to collaborate with peers around how to achieve both collective and individual goals.\n\nTransparency is a prerequisite for motivation, trust, and security. All employees should experience that they can raise issues with management  and  others  in  the  Group.  Storebrand  has  its  own ethical guidelines.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand relies on the trust of customers, partners, authorities, shareholders,  and  society  at  large.  The  business  must  be characterised  by    high  ethical  standards  in  order  to  gain  trust. All  employees  shall  act  with  due  diligence,  accountability  and legality. The organisation uses e-learning for training in ethics, anticorruption, anti-money laundering and terror financing, and privacy and digital trust. The courses are mandatory to complete each year to ensure responsible business practices in line with our Code of Conduct.\n\nThe organisation also has an external third party notification channel through  an  auditing  company  (https://u.bdo.no/storebrand).  We also have well-established procedures for dealing with complaints, harassment, and other unacceptable behavior.\n\nOur driving force is to be closest to our customers and help them to achieve financial safety and freedom, so that they have a future to look forward to. This requires us to act as courageous pathfinders. Every year,  an  employee from across the group is awarded with the Courageous Pathfinder Award. The nomination process in 2020 was based on transparency, sharing and accessibility through digital platforms, leading to a record turnout and number of nominations. The award process clearly showed that our employees can rethink, innovative and challenge practices internally and globally.\n\nEmployee  surveys  are  conducted  regularly  (every  two  weeks  or monthly)  to  measure  workplace  engagement  and  satisfaction with  work,  management,  collaboration,  sustainability,  perceived self-determination,  and  freedom  of  opinion.  The  objectives  are strategically anchored and followed up by the group management.\n\nOur  goal  of  being  a  smart  and  agile  organisation  is  supported by  the  tool  by  allowing  us  to  use  real-time  data  for  continuous improvement. In 2020, we strengthened the use of insights about the condition of the organisation to ongoing improvements.\n\nAt  Storebrand,  we  encourage  a  good  work-life  balance  for  all employees.  After  the  outbreak  of  the  pandemic  in  2020,  we facilitated  an  increased  flexibility  in  where  and  when  you  work. Although what you deliver is more important than where you are, we see great value in employees meeting physically. Going forward, we will look at the design of the workplace of the future to ensure and  maintain  a  good  balance  between  efficiency,  interaction, creativity, competence development and engagement.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2020,  an  average  of  87  per  cent  of  employees  completed e-learning courses in ethics, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and terror financing, and privacy and digital trust.\n\nAll  members of the Board and senior management complete an annual course in ethics, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and terror financing, and privacy and digital trust, as part of the Group's risk management. More information about this can be found in the chapter: Corporate governance and compliance.\n\nIn 2020, our data protection and information security rules were distributed digitally through our HCM system. All employees must review the documents once a year and confirm that they have read and understood the content.\n\nAn  average  of  86  per  cent  of  employees  responded  to  the employee engagement survey at least once in the last three months throughout 2020.\n\nThe score for Our driving force in the employee survey was 7,8 out of 10 in 2020. The overall score for engagement increased from 8,0 to 8,3 out of 10.\n\nTo  strengthen  adherence  to  our  driving  force,  we  completed leadership training for all group leaders in 2020.   More than 70 per cent of all group leaders completed 'Our driving force leadership training' during the year.\n\nIn the latter half of 2020, employee engagement surveys also showed an improved score on all questions, and particularly on issues of organisational adaptation (including core values, sustainability and equality), self-determination, freedom of opinion, relationship with colleagues, support from the leader and significance of work tasks. The results showed room for improvement in terms of  physical working environment. One of several initiatives to address this is experimentation around the workplace of the future to strengthen agile collaboration and work processes across the organisation.",

Appendix\n\n## Diversity and equality\n\nWhy\n\nIt is important that Storebrand's organisation and business reflects our customers and the market in which we operate. Storebrand aims to be a good workplace for everyone, regardless of their background. We strongly believe in building an agile organisation and a culture of trust, inclusion and belonging. It is important that our employees have freedom and mandate to deliver unprecedented customer experiences regardless of their background.\n\nExternal  independent  sustainability  analyses  also  show  that companies that focus on diversity are more innovative and profitable. Goals and ambitions\n\nAll  employees  at  Storebrand  shall  be  treated  equally  regardless of  age,  gender,  disability,  cultural  background,  religious  belief,  or sexual orientation, both in recruitment processes and throughout their  employment.  We  have  zero  tolerance  for  harassment  and discrimination.\n\nOur goal is greater diversity and an equal distribution of men and women in senior positions in all parts of the Group. One strategy for achieving this is by nominating an increased proportion of women for  leadership  development  programmes  and  in  recruitment processes  for  leadership  positions.    For  the  Board  of  Storebrand ASA, the requirement is that each gender should be represented by at least 40 per cent.\n\nWe  work  actively  towards  equal  opportunities and gender balance in work and economic  life  (target  5.5).  Our  goal  is  a 50/50 distribution of men and women in leading  positions,  an  equal  distribution of men and women in our management development  programmes,  as  well  as recruitment  processes  for  management positions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  aim  to  achieve  decent  work  for all  our  employees.  We  have  a  goal of equal pay for work of equal value (target  8.5).  Our  policy  on  discrimination and our active promotion of good health and well-being at work support these objectives.\n\nWe will contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goal number 5, gender equality, by promoting  gender equality in the workplace. At Storebrand, equal work should be paid equally.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand  works  systematically  to  ensure  diversity  and  equality through  clearly  defined  processes  in  recruitment,  reorganisations, salary  adjustments,  leadership  training,  and  other  development initiatives.  In  2019,  we  established  a  diversity  committee  with participation from across the group. In 2020, the committee worked on various initiatives in diversity, inclusion and belonging.\n\nWe are actively working to achieve a gender balance through targeted recruitment initiatives and by nominating an equal number of women and  men  for  leadership  positions  and  leadership  development programmes.  Candidates  and    employees  should  experience  a transparent and inclusive recruitment process.\n\nStorebrand has participated in the tripartite programmemet Inclusive Working Life (IA) since 2002. The program is based on the assumption that work promotes good health and well-being, and that early, active intervention  can  prevent  absence.  The  Group's  managers  have established  procedures  for  inclusive  follow-up  of  employees  in  the event of illness.\n\nWe aim to offer  the  best  candidate  journey,  so  that  Storebrand  is considered an attractive workplace.\n\nThroughout  2020,  we  improved  our  recruitment  and  interview process to make it as digital and gender neutral as possible at every stage. Women and men shall be represented in the interview team, and there must be at least one female and one male final candidate when recruiting for leadership positions.\n\nWe  offer  permanent  employees  paid  parental  leave  beyond  the statutory requirements of Norway and Sweden and pay 100 per cent salary during parental leave.\n\n## Results\n\nIn the period from March 2020, all candidates were invited to digital first-time  interviews.  We  employed  over  200  employees  who  all signed their contracts digitally.\n\nOur  sustainability  work  appeals  strongly  to  young  professionals seeking  work.  Storebrand  was  ranked  13th  out  of  the  top  50 companies onthe attractiveness ofthe Young Professional Attraction",

The graduate program 'Storebrand Future  Impact'  received  more  than  200  external  applications  for five  positions.  Among  the  individuals  that  were  hired,  there  was  a predominance of women.\n\nTen women from different parts of the group were included in the talent  and  leadership  development  program  for  women,  'FiftyFifty' throughout the year. The program  was  initiated by Storebrand in cooperation with AFF and Flensby & Partners as part of our 250th anniversary in 2017. The programme is now led in its entirety by AFF. Together  with  40  women  from  other  companies,  the  participants work to develop initiatives that promote equality for themselves, their business and for society as a whole.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  year,  the  share  of  women  among  storebrand managers was 39 per cent. Three out of ten members (30 per cent) of the group management were women. Among the managers who reported directly to the group executive management, 38 per cent were women. 40 per cent of the Board members of Storebrand ASA were women.\n\nAmong  the  participants  in  the  'Storebrand  Academy'  and  at 'Storebrand Leadership Weekly', 40 per cent were women and 60 per cent men. In the Summer internship program, 'Sandbox', and in the graduate program 'Storebrand Future Impact', 60 per cent of the participants were female, and 40 per cent were male.\n\n'All Storebrand employees shall be treated equally, regardless of age, gender, disability, cultural background, religious beliefs or sexual orientation'\n\nThe  group's  salary  levels  were  reviewed  in  cooperation  with  the union  representatives  in  connection  with  the  wage  adjustment process in 2020. The review showed slightly lower average earnings among female employees than male employees.\n\nThe average age of an employee in the Storebrand Group was 43 years at the end of the year. The average tenure was eleven years in Norway and ten years in Sweden.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Storebrand Group had a total of 1,824 employees.\n\nWe have a good gender distribution among permanent employees in both Norway and Sweden, as can be seen in the table below.\n\nSickness absence has been low and stable for several years. In 2020, the absence rate was 2.3 per cent in our Norwegian operations and 1.8 per cent in our Swedish operations.\n\nNo physical injuries were reported in the Storebrand Group in 2020.\n\n## Gender distribution\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our customers must feel certain that their personal data is in safe hands and handled in a responsible manner. Therefore, we are reliant on proper security measures, established procedures and processes.  Moreover,  our  employees  receive  training  to  ensure they  have  expertise  in  handling  of  personal  information  in  a prudent manner.\n\nNew  technology  combined  with  smart  use  of  information  and personal data enables us to better understand our customers and their needs. As long as our customers continue to have high levels of trust, we can use this technology to develop better, more relevant and more customer-oriented products and services.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  engage  our  customers  and  build  long-term relationships by delivering first-class customer experience across all channels. This requires us to safeguard our customers' rights in accordance with the Personal Data Act.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur  Privacy  Policy  contains  principles  of  digital  trust,  such  as lawful  and  transparent  processing,  purpose  limitation,  data subject's rights, and requirements for data protection by design. We  work  systematically  with  information  security.  Through  an internal  control  system,  we  set  requirements  for,  monitor,  and continuously improve information security in our own operations, customer solutions and in cooperation with our partners.\n\nIf  a  personal data breach occurs, and the risk to our customers is considered medium-high or high, customers will be contacted directly  by  phone or email. In such cases, we inform customers about  what  has  happened,  what  actions  we  have  taken,  and,  if necessary, what measures the customer should take to protect their personal data.\n\nThe CEO of each of the legal entities in the Group is responsible for the processing of personal data, including ensuring that internal control procedures are implemented and reviewed regularly. All\n\nmanagers are responsible for ensuring that employees with access to personal data have the necessary expertise and are qualified to protect our customers' privacy, as well as to follow our procedures and information security policies.\n\nTraining in information security and privacy is mandatory for all employees and is carried out by e-learning and in thematic groups for each department.\n\nThe protection of personal data and information security is well integrated into our internal control systems and risk management processes. We continuously assess the ongoing privacy risks that our customers are exposed to.\n\nWe update our Privacy Policy when changes are made to the use of personal data, and our online customer portal gives the individual customer  a  better  overview  of  his/her  privacy  settings. 12) In addition, on our website we provide advice and recommendations on how our customers can reduce their risk of online fraud.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2020,  a  new  e-learning  course  on  privacy  protection  was established. The course is mandatory for all employees. We also conduct specific training for individual departments.\n\nIn  2020,  41  incidents  related  to  the  processing  of  personal data  were  reported.  We  reported  six  of  these  as  discrepancies (documented  substantiated  complaints)  to  the  Data  Protection Authority,  in  accordance  with  the  EU  General  Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nAll registered cases from 2020 have been handled properly and closed. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority did not issue any fines, warnings, or orders for improvements to Storebrand due to breaches of the GDPR in 2020.\n\nFor the seventh year in a row we conducted the Security Awareness Month in October, with several activities and digital presentations that achieved a high turnout from our employees.",

Appendix\n\nSTOREBRAND ANNUAL REPORT 2019\n\n## Countering corruption\n\nWhy\n\nCorruption is one of the major causes of poverty in many parts of the world, and work targeting this form of crime is highly relevant in Scandinavia as well. Corruption is prohibited in all countries where Storebrand operates.   Corruption is a criminal offence both for the person on the giving end, and on the receiving end. Corporations can be penalised for not taken sufficient measures to avoid corruption. Corruption can result in reduced trust in Storebrand as a company, and to the financial and insurance industry in general. Corruption is detrimental to healthy competition in all industries.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nAt Storebrand, we have a zero tolerance for corruption and other economic misconduct. We work methodically to identify areas with increased risk and have taken measures to prevent exploitation. Furthermore,  we  work  systematically  with  our  suppliers  and partners.\n\nAll employees and board members shall complete the Group's anticorruption program. Exceptions are made for employees on leave or long-term sick leave. The goal is that 100 per cent of our employees will complete the program each year. Consultants who have been assigned for more than six months shall also carry out the program but are not included in the results for this year's measurement.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur  expectations  of  employees,  temporary  staff  and  consultants are  stipulated  in  our  ethical  guidelines,  approved  by  the  Board of  Storebrand  ASA  and  the  Boards  of  all  subsidiaries.  We  have additional guidelines specifically addressing anti-corruption, reviewed annually by the compliance team. The group's compliance function  is  responsible  for  updating  and  disseminating  material aimed at increasing anti-corruption competence and awareness.\n\nOur  guidelines  increase  awareness  about  corruption  and  ensure that  each  employee  is  capable  of  identifying  potential  corruption risks  at  an  early  stage.  The  guidelines  also  specify  measures  that should be taken to avoid corruption.\n\nAll  employees  are  responsible  for  familiarizing  themselves  with and acting in accordance with anti-corruption guidelines, including completing mandatory training, and managers shall ensure that this is done. All new employees complete mandatory training as part of their onboarding process.\n\nEmployees shall act with integrity and fully disclose any private business agreements or business-related services they provide to companies, individuals, friends or family members.\n\nWe expect all employees and contractors to act in manner that builds trust for both the individual concerned and for the Storebrand Group. As a general rule, no one shall receive any benefits, including services, gifts and invitations, from Storebrand's business associates. In situations where gifts can be received, our guidelines specify thresholds in the relevant country's currency.\n\nGifts given on behalf of Storebrand are subject to the same threshold. No one must give or receive gifts with an expectation of reciprocity, or to achieve any form of advantage, privately, or for any Storebrand company.\n\nAll  events  held  on  behalf  of  Storebrand  shall  be  consistent  with  our role  in  society,  all  content  shall  be  professionally  relevant,  and  shall otherwise adhere to our guidelines for events.\n\nStorebrand has established both an internal and external notification channel.  Employees  who  suspect  corruption  or  other  financial misconduct shall report this in one of these channels. When reported externally,  the  reporter  (whistle  blower)  can  choose  to  remain anonymous.\n\n## Results\n\n90  per  cent  of  the  group's  employees  completed  the  mandatory course on corruption in 2020. 13) No cases related to corruption were uncovered or reported in 2020. Two cases of internal misconduct were uncovered  with  an  external  partner.  Both  matters  were  handled  as personnel matters with dismissal as a result.",

Appendix\n\n## Anti-money laundering and terror /financing\n\nWhy\n\nWe are a key player in the Nordic financial market. Therefore, we have  a  distinct  responsibility  to  avoid  being  used  in  connection with the financing of terrorism, money laundering or other forms of financial crime. Our stakeholders expect us to handle with our responsibilities in an adequate manner. Routines and management are important for maintaining our reputation.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nStorebrand shall act consistently and in compliance with relevant legislation  related  to  money  laundering,  terror  financing  and financial crime in general.\n\nWe work systematically to ensure that our companies are not used for  money laundering, terror financing or other forms of financial crime.  All employees must carry out compulsory training each year.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe have established policies to avoid money laundering (AML) and terror financing. The guidelines have been reviewed and approved by  the  Board  of  Storebrand  ASA  and  are  based  on  our  code  of conduct. Furthermore, we have implemented measures throughout the Group to avoid money laundering, financial crime, and terror financing.\n\nEach  company  in  the  Group  conducts  an  annual  assessment  of risks related to the possibility of money laundering, financial crime, and  terror  financing.  We  have  established  clear  frameworks  and procedures  for  managing  such  risks.  These  include  procedures related to the establishment of new customer relationships as well as ongoing reviews of customers who are believed to pose a risk. We conduct internal audits and regular spot-checks to identify and report suspicious transactions or behavior.\n\nAny activity that we suspect is in breach of the Norwegian Measures Against  Money  laundering  and  Terror  Financing  Act  (2018)  is reported to the police.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n16.4 We are committed to combating financial crime.\n\n16.5 We are committed to combating corruption and bribery in all their forms.\n\n16.6 We are committed to developing effective, accountable and transparent companies.\n\nAll employees are required to familiarise themselves with our guidelines for  preventing  financial  crime  and  shall  complete  our  mandatory training  program  on  AML  and  terror  financing.  All  new  employees complete mandatory training as part of their onboarding process.\n\nThe training also provides employees with a basic understanding of the regulatory framework concerning financial crime and terror financing, as  well  as  our  requirements  to  employees  and  managers.  Senior managers and board members for the Group, and for each subsidiary also  receive  mandatory  training  in  AML,  financial  crime  and  terror financing.\n\nMeasures  to  prevent  money  laundering,  financial  crime  and  terror financing are described on the Group intranet, along with information on  what  we  expect  from  our  employees  in  terms  of  responsible business conduct. The information applies to all companies in the Group.\n\nStorebrand  is  a  member  of  Finance  Norway's  economic  crime committee. The committee cooperates closely with the authorities in Norway and provides guidance to all member companies.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2020, 46 cases related to suspected financial crime were reported to  the  police's  Norwegian  National  Authority  for  Investigation  and Prosecution  of  Economic  and  Environmental  Crime,  while  29  cases related to suspected fraud were reported directly to the police. The severity  of  the  cases  varied,  from  suspicion  of  money  laundering, terror financing and tax evasion to falsifying documents and attempted insurance fraud.\n\nIn  2020,  92  per  cent  of  our  employees  completed  the  mandatory training  course  in  anti-money  laundering,  financial  crime  and  terror financing. 14)",

Appendix\n\n## Responsible resource use\n\nWhy\n\nAt  Storebrand,  sustainability  is  an  integral  part  of  our  business strategy.  We  express  clear  expectations  to  the  companies  we invest in, our suppliers and partners. At the same time, we want to act as an example to follow. That's why we work to ensure that our own operations are as sustainable as possible.\n\n## Approach\n\nAs  early  as  2008,  Storebrand  became  Norway's  first  'climate neutral' financial group, through  reducing  emissions  and purchasing carbon quotas to compensate for emissions related to our own operations. In 2020 we took  this work further and decided on a new climate policy that applies to the whole group. We will impose strict requirements on ourselves and our suppliers and set specific targets to minimise our carbon footprint.\n\nWe  use  the  precautionary  principle  when  it  comes  to  environmental management. Since 2009, Storebrand has been eco-lighthouse certified, and we report publicly on our environmental impact every year.\n\nA dedicated department oversees energy and water consumption, waste production and levels of waste sorting in the office premises to  ensure  that  we  reach  the  lowest  possible  footprint.  We  buy electricity  from  renewable  energy  sources  through  purchasing guarantees of origin.\n\nWe encourage employees to use video conferencing for meeting activities  to  reduce  the  scope  of  businesstravel.  More  than  half of  all  our  meeting  rooms  are  equipped  with  video  conferencing equipment.  Nevertheless,  corporate  air  travel  increased  in  2019. Therefore,  we  introduced  an  internal  carbon  tax  on  flights  of NOK 1 000 per tonne of CO2 in 2020. The cost is charged to the employee's  department  and  is  followed  up  by  management  in  a newly established system, which ensures increased insight into our travel habits. The funds from the carbon tax are used to buy climate quotas and for other climate-related projects. Due to Covid-19, the number  of  flights  carried  out  by  employees  at  Storebrand  were reduced to a minimum in 2020. However,we updated our policies to encourage employees to assess the need for travel,  and to use public  transport  in  the  event  of  necessary  travel.    In  addition,  we expanded our electric car and electric bike fleet. In 2020, employees were  given  the  opportunity  to  buy  private  electric  bikes  at  a discounted price with an interest-free loan from Storebrand.\n\nIn order to reduce unnecessary waste, we have decided to remove all  disposable cups from our offices. However, the measure was postponed due to Covid-19. The decision means that all employees must bring their own cup.  When using your own cup, you also receive a discount in the coffee shop at head office. In addition, we introduced environmental labelling of the food in the cafeteria in  order  to  raise  awareness  among  employees  on  emissions associated with different types of foods.\n\nEmissions  that  we  are  incapable  of  reducing  from  our  own operations are compensated by purchasing emission quotas.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe  are  committed  to  setting  science-based  targets  for  our emissions,  in  line  with  the  Paris  Agreement.  The  plan  is  to  set science-based  targets  in  line  with  the  1.5-degree  target  for  the entire  business,  including  our  own  operations,  by  2021.  For  our own operations, we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6 15) per cent per annum with 2019 as a baseline year, in line with the 1.5-degree target and the findings of the UN Emissions Gap Report 2019. 16)\n\nWe  are  continuously  working  to  become  more  energy  efficient, reduce waste production, increase the proportion of waste sorted, and  reduce  our  carbon  footprint  in  connection  with  flights  and commuting.\n\n## Results\n\nDue  to  Covid-19,  our  internal  emissions  and  the  number  of business trips were significantly reduced in 2020.  Internal carbon pricing and new travel guidelines were introduced.\n\nCarbon  emissions  from  our  own  operations  were  reduced significantly  in  2020,  compared  to  previous  years.  However,  the reductions are mainly related to restrictions stemming from Covid19 restrictions rather than our environmental efforts.\n\n50 employees used the offer to buy electric bikes for personal use at a discounted rate, with a interest-free loan from Storebrand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.5 We aim to significantly reduce the amount of waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.\n\n12.6 We encourage companies to implement sustainability in their practices.\n\n13.1 We strengthen our ability to withstand and adapt to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in our business and in our investments.\n\n13.2 We incorporate action on climate change into our policies, strategies and plans.",

In order to focus on what we are good at, and make our business as efficient as possible, we have increased the use of outsourcing. This requires proper procedures to monitor working conditions, safeguarding human rights, and managing environmental issues in the value chain.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nA key objective is to avoid the use of suppliers where production processes or products violate international agreements, national legislation  or  internal  guidelines.  Through  our  own  activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  procurement  activities,  we  aim  to  contribute  to  sustainable development, and to ensure that human rights and workers' rights are not infringed.\n\nOur ambition for 2020 was to stabilise the share of environmentally certified  purchasing  volume  of  at  least  55  percent,  following  our overachievement of this target in  2019.  The  target  for  2025 17) was increased to a 60 per cent share of environmentally certified purchasing volume,  to  stimulate  further  improvement  in  the  environmental performance of the supply chain. Even though we achieved a higher purchasing volume from environmentally certified suppliers in 2020, the dynamics of our supply chain and market conditions still make the 60 per cent target challenging. Therefore, our aim is to work on maintaining  a  share  of  purchases  from  environmentally  certified suppliers of over 60%.\n\nIn 2020, we concretised our work on sustainability in the supply chain further,  and  thus  also  our  targets.  We  have  defined  three  specific climate targets for suppliers and partners:\n\n- \u00b7 By 2025, the goal is that all suppliers have set short- and mediumterm verifiable emission reduction targets\n- \u00b7 By 2025, the goal is that all suppliers will be climate neutral 18)\n- \u00b7 By 2030, the goal is that the entire value chain for our deliveries will be climate neutral\n\n## Approach\n\nWe set clear  requirements  to  our  suppliers  and  business  partners, by  Storebrand's  Standard  Annex  for  Sustainability.  This  is  an  annex to all tender requests and supplier contracts. In addition to following our  internal  procurement  guidelines,  a  key  principle  is  that  goods and  services  purchased  shall  support  our  key  objective  of  cost effective,  sustainable  business  operations.  Storebrand  shall  not purchase goods or services from companies  listed  on storebrand Kapitalforvaltning's exclusion list. 19), Our purchasing policy is based on the Group's governing documents and related procedures, which are revised annually. 20)\n\nIn  2020,  we  have  developed  a  new  framework  for  follow-up  and evaluation of suppliers. Our approach focuses on collaboration for continuous  improvement  when  it  comes  to  sustainability,  defined by the questions we ask suppliers and partners. Our approach to sustainable  procurement  follows  the  same  three-folded  strategy  as our work with active ownership towards companies we are invested in.\n\n8.7 Through our procurement practices, we strive to contribute to effective efforts to end modern slavery and eliminate child labour in our value chain.\n\n8.8 We aim to protect workers' rights and promote a safe and secure working environment for all employees, contractors and suppliers.\n\n12.5 We aim to significantly reduce the amount of waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse in the supply chain.\n\n12.6 We encourage companies to introduce sustainable working methods and integrate information about sustainability into their reporting routines.\n\n12.7 We promote sustainable procurement practices.\n\n13.2 We incorporate action on climate change into our policies, strategies and plans.\n\n20)  Among the governing documents are 'Guidelines for outsourced activities', 'Guidelines for the award of powers of attorney', 'Rules for ethics', 'Guidelines for combating corruption', 'Guidelines for anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and financial crime measures', 'Guidelines for handling conflicts of interest', 'Guidelines for events', 'Information Security Management Document', and 'Governing Document for the Processing of Personal Data'.",

Appendix\n\nWe select Sustainability is weighted at least at least 20% in our tender processes. Through the supplier mapping and evaluation, we give an advantage to suppliers that perform well on sustainability.\n\nWe  work  actively  to  influence  We  use  our  position  as  a major  buyer  to  influence  suppliers  and  business  partners  for improvement.  We  do  this  both  when  we  consider  entering  into new agreements and evaluating existing ones.\n\nWe exclude Storebrand shall not choose vendors, products or services that are in violation of international agreements, national regulations or internal policies. This is described in our sourcing principles.\n\nTo get an overview of how good our suppliers are when it comes to  sustainability,  we  are  now  mapping  all  suppliers  with  annual sales volume to Storebrand of more than 1 million NOK, through a questionnaire divided into the following main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 How sustainability is integrated into suppliers' strategies\n- \u00b7 Environmental performance over time and targets\n- \u00b7 Diversity performance over time and targets\n- \u00b7 Environmental, quality and management systems\n\nTo  measure  progress,  annual  reporting  on  sustainability  will  be effective from 2020. An extended set of questions is also used to evaluate suppliers in purchasing processes.\n\nOur  most  important  and  largest  purchases  include  contracting IT  and  business  processes,  healthcare,  damage  settlement  in insurance and management of direct real estate investments. The areas with the greatest risk and impact on sustainability are, in our judgment,  outsourcing  (including  offshoring),  damage  settlement (car and property), and property management in general.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2020, contracts worth more than 1 million NOK totaled around 3,2 billion NOK.  This accounts for more than 87 per cent of our total  purchasing  volume  and  includes  the  management  and development of direct real estate investments. Of this volume, 62 per cent are with suppliers that are environmentally certified in accordance with our purchasing policy. This volume is divided into 290 suppliers, of which 62 (21 percent) are certified according to a recognised environmental management standard.\n\nOur first survey of suppliers with over NOK 1 million in turnover was answered by 45 suppliers. Our total purchasing volume from these suppliers was 625 million NOK  in 2020,  almost 20  per cent of our total purchase volume for the year. We will continue to work on mapping our suppliers' sustainability work and aim to provide further information on this in the annual report for 2021.",

Appendix\n\n## Social responsibility\n\nWhy\n\nAs a leading financial institution in Norway and Sweden, we have an important social responsibility. The sustainability work means that  we  actively  engage  with  the  society  in  which  we  operate, beyond delivering financial services.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe will take social responsibility by providing financial support and knowledge in the area of sustainability. We also want to enable more employees to spend time on activities related to corporate social responsibility.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe prioritise activities in three areas in terms of corporate social responsibility:    Collaboration,  financial  support  and  voluntary efforts among employees. These activities will promote and raise awareness  of  sustainability  and  demonstrate  the  connection between sustainability and profitability.\n\nYoung  Entrepreneurship  (UE)  is  a  nonprofit  organisation  that encourages  young  students  to  establish  and  run  their  own businesses.  We  have  helped  create  a  sustainability  award  to encourage students to learn more about how to run a sustainable business. In 2020, we continued the popular mentoring scheme where  young  students  can  discuss  issues  related  to  the establishment of their companies with employees in Storebrand. The Catalysts mentoring program: For the fourth year in a row, ten employees were given the opportunity to mentor a student from a minority background. Through monthly meetings at Storebrand, students  gained  insight  into  Norwegian  working  life,  help  to develop themselves, and advice on school and working life. The program is a collaboration between Storebrand and the nonprofit Catalysts.    The  aim  is  to  prevent  dropouts  in  upper  secondary school.\n\nWe're rooting for: Volunteering is an important part of Norwegian culture, and there is a large amount of work to be done annually, including sports and leisure activities. Through our 'We're rooting for' competition, we provide financial support for various socially useful projects at home and abroad.\n\n## Results\n\n353  Young  entrepreneurship  start-ups  competed  in  the sustainability  award  category.  In  2020,  CleanAir  UB  won  the awardfor  the  developmentof  DustBuster,  a  product  that  allows large vehicles to collect particulate matter from the roads where they operate. The youth company had thought about sustainability throughout the entire value chain.\n\nIn  2020,  NOK  500  000  was  awarded  to  17  'We're  rooting  for' projects  around  Norway,  and  250  000  SEK  were  awarded  to similar projects in Sweden. All the projects somehow contribute to a future to look forward to.",

Score and percentile as expressed in the indicator can therefore not be directly compared with the target expressed here.\n\n25) We have stopped reporting the average number of flights per FTE, as this is not a relevant indicator. The impact of air travel on the environment depends on how far you travel. This indicator is therefore replaced by kg\n\nCO2equivalents per FTE related to flights will be replaced from 2019. Emissions from flights have been recalculated for 2017-2019 as a result of updates to the emission factors in our travel agencies' systems.\n\n26) From 2019, we started reporting for each course separately. Historical data for 2017 and 2018 is therefore not available. Data for 2019 shows the share of all permanent employees throughout the year. The deviation from\n\nthe 100%  target is mainly due to turnover and new hires.\n\n27) The figures apply to our Norwegian enterprises, as these are complaints dealt with in the Financial Complaints Commission.

Our goal is to deliver sustainable solutions tailored to the customer's individual needs, so that customers can receive the best possible pension in a more sustainable world. This is how we create value for customers, shareholders, and society.\n\nStorebrand follows a two-fold strategy that provides an attractive combination of self-funded growth within what we call the 'Future Storebrand',  and  capital  release  from  the  guaranteed  pensions business which is in run-off.\n\n## Storebrand aims to\n\n(A) be the leading provider of occupational pensions in both Norway and Sweden\n\n(B) continue a strategy of building a Nordic powerhouse in asset management\n\n(C) ensure  rapid  growth  as  a  challenger  in  the  Norwegian  retail market for financial services.\n\nThe interaction between our business areas provides synergies in the form of capital, economies of scale, and value creation based on customer insight. As announced on the capital markets day in December 2020, our ambition is to deliver a group profit (before amortisation and tax) of approximately NOK 4 billion in 2023.\n\nWe believe the only way to secure a better future is to take part in creating it. We seek to actively use our position to lead the way in  sustainable  value  creation  and  to  differentiate  ourselves  from competitors.\n\nStorebrand  offers  financial  products,  services,  and  customer experiences.  Based  on  an  increasingly  advanced  technology platform, we offer a fully digital  business  and  distribution  model. Our position as a digital frontrunner will be a critical success factor in strengthening our competitiveness in the years to come.\n\nWe aim to both grow the ordinary dividend from our earnings and to  ensure  capital-efficient  management  of  older  products  with interest rate guarantees. Our goal is to release an estimated NOK 10 billion of capital by 2030.",

Appendix\n\n## Strategic highlights 2020\n\nDespite  the  outbreak  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  Storebrand  has been  close  to  fully  operational  in  2020.  Thanks  to  well  defined contingency plans and adaptable staff, we executed on our strategic initiatives according to plan, despite it being an extraordinary year. We quickly adapted to new ways of working with digital processes and home offices for most of the year. Our first priority was to secure Storebrand's critical operations and to support our customers when they needed our services most. During 2020, we helped a record number of customers with their travel insurance claims, refinanced mortgages,  and  adjusted  repayment  schedules.  We  also  provided extensive  business  and  investment  advice  for  companies  and individuals.\n\nWe entered the year with a solid solvency and buffer capital position. This contributed to our resilience towards the market shocks that occurred as the global crisis unfolded. Despite market volatility and\n\ndeclining  interest  rates,  financial  risks  were  therefore  mitigated through measures within our normal risk management framework.\n\nStrong growth in our core business throughout the year contributed to  an  increase  in  the  group's  operating  profit.  However,  turbulent financial  markets  in  the  first  quarter  led  to  significant  unrealised investment  losses  in  the  beginning  of  the  year.  Throughout  the remaining  quarters,  financial  markets  rebounded  and  the  group ended the year with a positive financial result.\n\nThe  main  impact  of  Covid-19  on  Storebrand  was  the  increased risk of lower employment and a subsequent rise in disability in the society.  Reserves  for  insurance  products  with  disability  coverage were therefore strengthened in the first quarter, and these were still assessed to be adequate by the end of the year.\n\n## References to Covid-19 and related information in notes\n\n| Note                                                                                                              | Theme                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Note 2:  Key accounting estimates and discretionary assessments                                                   | Covid-19 and the effects on key accounting estimates and discretionary assessments.                                                                                     |\n| Note 2:                                                                                                           | Description of effect on insurance obligations.                                                                                                                         |\n| Key accounting estimates and discretionary assessments                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Note 7:  Insurance risk                                                                                           | Discusses insurance risks and shows sensitivities associated with insurance incidents.                                                                                  |\n| Note 2:  Key accounting estimates and discretionary assessments                                                   | Description of effect on valuation of financial instruments.                                                                                                            |\n| Note 8:  Financial market risk                                                                                    | Discusses market risk and effects on the profit to shareholders due to deviations  from expectations in financial market prices or volatility.

Appendix\n\n## Growth in capital-light business areas in the front book\n\nThe core of Storebrand's strategy is to gather and manage savings from pension and institutional customers in Norway and Sweden, as  well  as  retail  customers  in  Norway.  By  the  end  of  2020,  we managed  NOK  962  billion  of  assets.  This  is  our  main  revenue driver. In addition, we will build on existing savings and pension relationships  by  offering  related  products  and  solutions  within insurance and banking in Norway.\n\nOver  the  past  eight  years,  Storebrand  has  succeeded  in transforming  the  business  from  capital-intensive  products  with guaranteed  returns,  to  fast-growing  and  self-funding  capitallight products. Total assets under management have more than doubled since 2012. At the end of the year, 71 per cent of the assets under management were related to capital-light business in the front book.\n\n## Leading provider of occupational pensions in Norway and Sweden\n\nThe growth within Storebrand's core product, defined contribution pensions, continued in 2020. Storebrand maintained its leading market position in Norway with a market share of 29 per cent 28) . The average policyholder is about 50 years old, which means that premium payments received exceed pension payments made. Corporate  customers  in  Norway  also  paid  an  excess  of  NOK  2 billion in insurance premiums in 2020.\n\nIn  Sweden,  where  the  defined  contribution  pension  market is  more mature, SPP increased its market share to 18 per cent from 16 per cent last year, becoming the second largest provider within non-unionised pensions 29) .  New digital sales tools and a successful strategy to encourage customers to transfer previously earned pension assets to SPP were main drivers for the growth.\n\nTo further strengthen our market position and growth, Storebrand re-entered the Norwegian market for public occupational pensions in 2020. In the first year, we won contracts worth NOK 9 billion in total assets - funds that will be transferred to Storebrand in 2021. Recent pension reforms have effectively re-opened the market for competition after having been dominated by a municipality-owned monopolist  over  the  last  years.  Storebrand  has  a  strong  value proposition and is the only challenger in the market. Storebrand is also the only provider with a complete product offering within occupational pensions. The market is estimated at more than NOK 450 billion in total assets and NOK 35 billion in annual premiums, thus a larger market than the Norwegian private market.\n\n## Nordic Powerhouse in Asset Management\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand's total assets under management increased to NOK 962 billion, and 43 per cent are now external customers' funds.  We  affirmed  our  position  as  Norway's  largest  and  the Nordic's  fifth  largest  private  asset  manager.  A  growing  share of  external  customers  drive  earnings  growth,  and  the  ability  to co-invest with our internal pension business provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\n45\n\nStorebrand  Asset  Management  is  a  world  leader  in  sustainable investments and currently manages NOK 379 billion of fossil-free investments and NOK 93 billion in what we call 'solution companies'. These  are  companies  that  are  particularly  well  positioned  to contribute  to  realising  the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals. During 2020, Storebrand Asset management took a leading role in efforts to reduce deforestation and natural destruction. We also launched a new climate strategy for investments with innovative anti-lobbying  criteria,  and  we  committed  to  a  new  climate  and infrastructure fund in cooperation with Danish fund managers.\n\nStorebrand has developed into a Nordic multi-boutique manager with several brands. SPP Fonder is currently the fifth largest mutual fund company in Sweden. SKAGEN, which was acquired in 2017, has  provided  Storebrand  Asset  Management  with  a  common modern technological platform. SKAGEN has also been a catalyst for international  expansion  and  strengthened  Storebrand's position in the retail market for mutual fund savings. With the 2019 acquisition of Cubera, we have also strengthened our capabilities within alternative asset classes, in particular private equity. During 2020, Cubera successfully raised NOK 9 billion in capital.\n\n## Growing challenger in the Norwegian retail market\n\nThrough our corporate pensions and asset management offering, we  leverage  both  systems  and  solutions  to  deliver  savings  and insurance products in the retail market. Together with our retail bank,  Storebrand  offers  a  digital  one-stop-shop  with  integrated value propositions and cross-selling opportunities.\n\nWith  250  years  of  history,  the  Storebrand  brand  name  stands strong  in  society.  In  Norway,  1.3  million  people  are  customers of Storebrand through their pension savings. They are our main target group for additional financial services that enable them to achieve financial freedom and security.\n\nGrowing  our  distribution  capacity  in  the  retail  market  was a  main  priority  in  2020.  During  the  year,  written  insurance premiums increased by 18 per cent. We entered new distribution partnerships  with  the  Norwegian  Homeowners  Association  and Coop, while also exploring new business opportunities with fintech companies such as Dreams, Aprilla Bank, and Finn.no. Storebrand also entered into an agreement with Insr to acquire the right and obligation to renew policies from Insr's customer portfolios over the coming year.\n\n## Leadership in sustainability\n\nFor  the  past  25  years,  Storebrand  has  pioneered  sustainable investments  to  increase  value  creation.  We  strive  to  create value beyond financial returns. Our sustainable investments and enhanced  sustainability  funds  grew  substantially  in  2020.  We believe that our leading position in sustainable value creation will increase value for our customers and create positive ripple effects for society. We are committed to the Paris Agreement throughout our value chain. Storebrand is determined to lead and develop the sustainability agenda within the financial industry in the years to come.",

Storebrand was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, recognised among the top 10 per cent most sustainable companies in the world. Corporate Knights also rated Storebrand as the world's most sustainable insurance company in its Global 100  ranking  for  a  second  consecutive  year.  Our  employee satisfaction surveys show that Storebrand employees are proud to be a part of the company, and that our work on sustainability makes their job more meaningful. Our position on sustainability also attracts an increasing number of international talents.\n\nMore information about our sustainability work is discussed in the  section  below  A  Driving  Force  for  Sustainable  Investments and in the chapter Keeping our house in order.\n\n## Digital frontrunner\n\nThe  use  of  technology  makes  it  possible  to  combine  growth initiatives  and  measures  for  increased  competitiveness,  while at the same time realising cost reductions and efficiency gains. Smart use of data paves the way for new business opportunities and efficiency gains, both through digitalisation and automation. Storebrand is adopting modern cloud solutions, enabling faster time-to-market  and  better  access  to  new  digital  capabilities. Digital sales have increased 25 per cent annually over the past three years. The duration of handling disability claims has seen a reduction of up to 75 per cent, while fraud detection increased 85 per cent.\n\nDigital customer experiences will be a high priority going forward. More information about our digital initiatives is described in the chapter Customer Relations under the section Digital Innovator in the Financial Sector.\n\n## Management of capital and balance sheet\n\nStorebrand is a blend of fast-growing capital-light business that deliver  high  returns  on  equity,  and  capital-intensive  run-off business  with  low  returns  on  equity.  The  run-off  business  of guaranteed  pensions  ties  up  more  than  three-quarters  of  the group's  equity  and  yielded  a  return  on  equity  of  3  per  cent  in 2020. The growth business, on the other hand, yielded a return on equity of 54 per cent 30) . The group's overall return on equity 31) was 8.6 per cent for 2020.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, Storebrand's Board of Directors initially announced an ordinary dividend  of  NOK  3.25  per  share  to  be paid  for  the  financial  year  of  2019.  The  outbreak  of  the  Covid19  pandemic  led  to  clearly  communicated  guidelines  from the  Norwegian  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Norwegian  Financial Supervisory Authority and EIOPA to suspend dividend payments until the great uncertainty regarding the economic development was reduced. Based on this, the Board of Storebrand ASA decided to withdraw the proposed dividend for the financial year 2019. However, throughout the year, the Board of Directors maintained that the company's liquidity, solvency position, and result prognosis supported an ordinary dividend for 2019. The proposed dividend for 2020 is discussed below in separate section.\n\nThe  solvency  margin  including  transitional  rules  was  178  per cent  at  the  end  of  2020  -  an  increase  of  2  percentage  points from  last  year's  176  per  cent,  despite  occasionally  challenging financial markets throughout the year. Without transitional rules, the  solvency  margin  was  166  per  cent.  This  corresponds  to  a decrease of 8 percentage points from last year's 174 per cent. The reduction is mainly due to a lower interest rates at the end of 2020. However, this is to a large extent compensated for with transitional  rules.  Regulatory  assumptions  in  the  calculation  of solvency ratio, such as reduced volatility adjustment and a lower ultimate  forward  rate,  contributed  negatively  to  the  solvency ratio as well. Nevertheless, we were able to improve our solvency position  through  actions.  A  dynamic  pricing  model  for  interest rate  guarantees  was  introduced,  and  the  result  in  2020  also helped  to  strengthen  the  solvency  ratio  by  approximately  10 percentage points.\n\n## Financial targets\n\nStorebrand has the following financial targets:\n\n| Key performance indicators                | Goal    | Status  2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Return on equity  31)                     | > 10 %  | 8.6 %          |\n| Future Storebrand                         |         | 54 %           |\n| (Savings and Insurance)                   |         |                |\n| Run-off business (Guaranteed and Other)   |         | 3 %            |\n| Dividend pay-out ratio  32)               | > 50 %  | 65 %           |\n| Solvency 2 ratio 33)   (Storebrand Group) | > 150 % | 178 %          |",

The  Board  of  Storebrand  ASA  confirms  that  we  meet  the conditions  for  preparing  financial  statements  on  the  basis  of  a going concern, pursuant to Norwegian accounting legislation. No significant incidents have occurred after the balance sheet date.\n\nOur financial result is reported by the following business segment: Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pension and Other, as well as on a consolidated Group level.\n\n## Group results\n\n| NOK million                                        | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income                      | 5,676  | 5,308  |\n| Insurance result                                   | 825    | 1 005  |\n| Operational cost                                   | -4,068 | -4,015 |\n| Operating profit                                   | 2,433  | 2,298  |\n| Financial items and risk result life               | 278    | 739    |\n| Profit before amortisation                         | 2,711  | 3,037  |\n| Amortisation and write-downs of intangible  assets | -492   | -444   |\n| Profit before tax                                  | 2,219  | 2,593  |\n| Tax                                                | 136    | -511   |\n| Profit after tax                                   | 2,355  | 2,082  |\n\nStorebrand achieved a group profit (before amortisation) of NOK 2,711 million (NOK 3,037 million). The figures in parentheses show the corresponding figures for last year.\n\nFee and administration income increased by 7 per cent to NOK 5,676 million (NOK 5,308 million), driven mainly by strong underlying growth in assets under management. Adjusted for a strengthened Swedish krona, the income growth was 3 per cent.\n\nThe insurance result was NOK 825 million (NOK 1,005 million) and resulted in a combined ratio of 97 per cent (91 per cent). Reserve strengthening in products with disability coverage weakened this year's performance, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic with the\n\nuncertain macroeconomic situation that occurred and the risk of increased disability in Norway.\n\nOperating  expenses  amounted  to  NOK  -4,068  million  (-4,015). Adjusted for costs related to acquired business, performance-based results  and  currency  movements,  operating  expenses  were  NOK -3,780 million - in line with the target of keeping costs nominally flat at NOK 3.8 billion from 2018 to 2020.\n\nTotal operating profit was NOK 2,433 million (NOK 2,298 million).\n\nFinancial items and risk result life was NOK 278 million (NOK 739 million).  The  decrease  in  profits  in  2020  is  mainly  due  to  a  weak disability result in the Norwegian Defined Benefit pensions as well as an increased need for Deferred Capital Contributions in SPP due to lower discount rates and wider credit spreads.\n\nAmortisation  of  intangible  assets  amounted  to  NOK  -492  million (NOK -444 million). The increase is mainly due to a strengthened Swedish krona.\n\nProfit before tax was NOK 2,219 million (NOK 2,593 million).\n\nThe Group ended the year with a tax income of NOK 136 million (NOK -511 million). The tax income is the result of new information and interpretation of the transitional rules for 2018. The estimated normal tax rate for the Group is 21-23 per cent, depending on each legal entity's contribution to the group result. For more information on tax and uncertain tax positions, see note 26. Storebrand also has a policy for responsible taxation and publishes a separate tax transparency report on our website.\n\nGroup profit after tax was NOK 2,355 million (NOK 2,082 million).",

Increased  competition contributed to moderate margin pressure for both the Norwegian and  Swedish  Unit  Linked  products.  Excess  returns  in  mutual funds with performance fees contributed NOK 249 million (NOK 203 million) to the income. A lower net interest income margin in the bank, due to declining interest rates during the year, resulted in a marginally lower contribution from the bank.\n\nOperating expenses were NOK 10 million lower in 2020 than in 2019, explained by strong cost control and slightly lower market activity as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nModel-based provisions for loan losses in the bank contributed to a lower Financial items and risk result life of NOK -51 million (-11 million).\n\nProfit before amortisation increased to NOK 1,730 million (NOK 1,364 million) - an increase of 27 per cent in 2020.\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nAssets under management grew significantly in 2020.\n\nUnit Linked reserves grew by 22 per cent to NOK 268 billion driven partly by positive financial market developments, but also by 18 per cent growth in premiums, 46 per cent growth in new sales  (measured  in  APE  -  Annual  Premium  Equivalent),  and  a positive net transfer balance of NOK 5.4 billion (NOK -0.2 billion). Total  growth  in  assets  under  management  within  Storebrand Asset Management was NOK 131 billion (16 per cent), also driven by new mandates from external customers.\n\nThe bank's retail lending balance grew by NOK 1.3 billion (3 per cent) to NOK 49.5 billion.\n\n## Key figures Savings\n\n| NOK million          | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| Unit linked Reserves | 268,331 | 219,793 |\n| Unit linked Premiums | 20,185  | 17,168  |\n| AuM Asset Management | 962,472 | 831,204 |\n| Retail Lending       | 49,474  | 48,161  |",

As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the decline in oil prices, Storebrand  conducted  a  model-based  review  of  the  future development of the economic situation. The review led to reserve strengthening for all products with disability coverage of NOK 247 million in the 1st quarter. The total claims ratio for the year was 81 per cent compared to 74 per cent in 2019.\n\nOperating  expenses  were  kept  nominally  flat  throughout  the year until the 4th quarter when added staff, in connection with the  takeover  of  Insr  customers,  increased  the  cost  base.  Total operating expenses for the year amounted to NOK -712 million (NOK -648 million), resulting in a decrease in the cost ratio to 16 per cent from 17 per cent in 2019.\n\nThe total combined ratio was 97 per cent (91 per cent) and total operating profit was NOK 113 million (NOK 357 million) for the year.\n\nThe  financial  result  was  NOK  91  million  (NOK  83  million).  The insurance  investment  portfolio  amounted  to  NOK  9,0  billion  at the end of 2020 (NOK 8,3 billion) and achieved a return of 3.25 per cent. The investments are primarily in high rated fixed income securities either booked at amortised cost or with short duration. Profit  before  amortisation  amounted  to  NOK  204  million  (NOK 439  million).  The  disability  result  lowered  the  result  within  all reported product segments, except for health insurance.\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nThe  total  growth  in  written  portfolio  premiums  amounted  to 18  per  cent  in  2020.  The  highest  growth  was  within  P&C  and Individual Life (22 per cent), followed by Pension related disability insurance (17 per cent), and Health and Group Life (15 per cent). The written portfolio premiums at the end of the year amounted to NOK 5.6 billion, of which NOK 2.3 billion is in the retail market and NOK 3.2 billion in the corporate market.\n\n## Key figures Insurance\n\n|                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Claims ratio   | 81 %   | 74 %   |\n| Cost ratio     | 16 %   | 17 %   |\n| Combined ratio | 97 %   | 91 %   |",

Income is  expected to gradually decline because the products are in longterm run off and essentially closed for new business. Following the closure of the last major Defined Benefit plan in Norway this year, the income in the product has been reduced while the income from paid-up policies has increased.\n\nOperating  expenses  amounted  to  NOK  -842  million  (NOK  -819 million). The marginal increase is due to the strengthened Swedish krone and costs associated with new initiatives in the public sector. The risk result life & pensions was NOK 17 million (NOK 215 million). The decrease in results is due to low reactivation levels of people in disability within the Norwegian Defined Benefit pensions. To improve the result, price adjustments have been made with effect in 2021.\n\nNet  profit  sharing,  after  further  buffer  capital  strengthening, amounted  to  NOK  144  million  (NOK  157  million),  driven  by  good returns in both Norwegian and Swedish products.\n\nEarnings before amortisation amounted to NOK 775 million (NOK 1,029 million).\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nGuaranteed reserves at the end of the year amounted to NOK 277 billion. This is an increase of NOK 13.5 billion in 2020, but adjusted for currency effects, the change is only NOK 4.7 billion. As a share of total reserves, this corresponds to 50.8 per cent (54.5 per cent) at the end of the year, a decrease of 3.7 percentage points since last year.\n\nStorebrand's strategy is to increase the buffer capital to secure customer  returns  and  protect  shareholder's  equity  under turbulent  market  conditions.  Buffer  capital  for  guaranteed pensions increased to 11.0 per cent (8.6 per cent) of customer reserves in Norway and to 11.4 per cent (10.7 per cent) in Sweden. This corresponds to an overall increase of NOK 5.7 billion since last year.\n\n## Key figures Guaranteed Pension\n\n| NOK million                                         | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Guaranteed reserves                                 | 276 755 | 263 185 |\n| Guaranteed reserves in % of total  reserves         | 50.8 %  | 54.5 %  |\n| Net transfers                                       | 1 427   | -103    |\n| Buffer capital in % of customer reserves  in Norway | 11,0 %  | 8.6 %   |\n| Buffer capital in % customer reserves in  Sweden    | 11.4 %  | 10.7 %  |\n\n## Other\n\n| NOK million                          |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income        |     65 |     51 |\n| Operational cost                     |   -139 |   -143 |\n| Operating profit                     |    -75 |    -91 |\n| Financial items and risk result life |     76 |    296 |\n| Profit before amortisation           |      1 |    205 |\n\nThe  table  above  excludes  eliminations.

The result is primarily based on returns in the company portfolios in Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP, as well as the financial result in Storebrand ASA. Unrealised losses on investments in the portfolios that occurred in the first quarter during  the  market  turmoil  have  been  reversed  throughout  the rest of the year.

Appendix\n\n## Dividend for 2020\n\nStorebrand has established a framework for capital management that links dividends to the solvency margin. The dividend policy intends  to  reflect  the  strong  growth  in  fee-based  earnings,  the more volatile  financial  markets  related  earnings  and  the  future capital release from the guaranteed book. The Board's ambition is to pay a gradually growing ordinary dividend. When the solvency margin  reaches  180%  without  material  use  of  transitional capital,  the  Board  intends  to  initiate  a  share  buyback  program. The purpose of the buyback program is to return excess capital released from the guaranteed liabilities that are in long-term runoff. A review of the solvency level and related share buybacks will be conducted after the full year results for 2021.\n\nThe Board has carefully reviewed the solvency position, liquidity position and result prognosis for the company, in light of the Covid19  pandemic  and  the  resulting  macroeconomic  uncertainties. Based on the review, the Board's assessment is that Storebrand's financial  position  supports  paying  an  ordinary  dividend.  The Board proposes an ordinary dividend of NOK 3.25 per share for 2020, equal to NOK 1,519 million, to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Capital situation\n\nWe adapt the level of equity and debt in the Group continuously and  systematically.  The  level  is  adjusted  for  financial  risk  and capital  requirements.  The  growth  and  composition  of  business segments  are  important  drivers  behind  the  need  for  capital. Capital  management  is  designed  to  ensure  an  efficient  capital structure and maintain an appropriate balance between internal targets and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe target a solvency ratio in accordance with Solvency II of at least 150 per cent, including the use of transitional rules. At the end of 2020, the solvency ratio for the Group was 178 per cent including transitional rules. Without transitional rules, the solvency margin was 166 per cent. Storebrand uses the standard model for the calculation of Solvency II. Prudent risk management and regulatory adjustment mechanisms in the solvency regulation compensate for occasionally challenging financial market conditions.\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring\n\nGroup'ssolidity  capital  consists  of  equity,  subordinated  loan capital,  market  value  adjustment  reserves,  additional  statutory reserves, conditional bonuses and risk equalisation reserves. The solidity capital was strengthened by NOK 10.3 billion in 2020. The\n\n## Storebrand's dividend policy:\n\nStorebrand aims to pay an ordinary dividend of more than 50% of Group result after tax. The Board of Directors' ambition is to pay ordinary dividends per share of at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency margin of above 150%. If the solvency margin is above 180%, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buy backs.\n\nmarket value adjustment reserve increased by NOK 1.7 billion as a result of positive market developments and amounted to NOK 7.2  billion  at  year-end.  Conditional  bonuses  increased  by  NOK 1.5  billion  and  amounted  to  NOK  10.8  billion.  Booked  returns have increased the additional statutory reserves. The additional statutory  reserves  amounted  to  NOK  11.4  billion  at  the  end  of the year, an increase of NOK 2.4 billion for the year. The excess value of bonds and loans that are booked at amortised cost have increased by NOK 4.1 billion during the year and amounted to NOK 8.8 billion at year-end. The excess value of bonds and loans at amortised cost is not included in the financial statements.\n\nStorebrand Bank Group had a pure core capital adequacy ratio of  15.1  per  cent  and  capital  adequacy ratio of 18.7 per cent at the end of 2020. The company has satisfactory capital adequacy and liquidity based on its business activities. The lending portfolio consists primarily of low-risk home mortgages with an average LTV (loan-to-value) of 56 per cent.\n\nStorebrand ASA (holding) held liquid assets of NOK 5.0 billion at the end of the year. Liquid assets consist mainly of short-term fixed income securities with high credit ratings. Storebrand ASA's total interest-bearing liabilities were NOK 1.0 billion at the end of the year. The next maturity on bond debt for Storebrand ASA is in  May  2022.  In  addition  to  the  liquidity  portfolio,  the  company has  an  unused  credit  facility  of  EUR  200  million,  which  expires in December 2024, with the option for an extension for another two  years.  Storebrand  ASA  recognised  dividend  and  group contributions  from  subsidiaries  of  NOK  3,148  million  in  2020. The dividend allocated to shareholders amounted to NOK 1,519 million.\n\n## Rating\n\nFour companies in the Storebrand Group issue debt securities. All four companies are rated by the credit rating agency S&P Global. Storebrand  Livsforsikring  AS,  the  main  operating  entity,  aims for at least an A- rating. In July 2020, the A- rating of Storebrand Livsforsikring  AS  and  Storebrand  Bank  ASA  was  affirmed  with  a stable  outlook.  Storebrand  Boligkreditt  AS  is  rated  AAA  and  the holding company Storebrand ASA is rated BBB.",

Appendix\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Market development\n\nFinancial market developments affect both the Group's solvency ratio  and  the  financial  results.  Higher  interest  rates  increase the solvency ratio and make it easier to achieve returns above the  guaranteed  rate.  Defined  Contribution  pensions  and  asset management are largely  exposed  to  the  stock  market.  Market movements will therefore affect income earned on assets under management. Currency movements between the Norwegian and Swedish  krone  affect  the  reported  balance  sheet  and  results in  SPP  at  a  consolidated  level.  There  is  still  uncertainty  about the  consequences  of  Covid-19  and  how  it  will  affect  financial markets going forward. With a solid solvency margin of 178 per cent  and  more  than  11  per  cent  buffer  capital  in  guaranteed products,  Storebrand  is  in  a  good  position  to  navigate  safely through  demanding  markets.  The  company  also  has  a  robust risk management framework, as described in a separate section below. Read more in note 2 about uncertainties related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Regulatory changes\n\nRegulations enacted by the authorities can be of great importance to  Storebrand.  We  describe  the  most  important  changes  and their significance for Storebrand below.\n\n## European regulations\n\nSolvency II revision\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  European  Supervisory  Authority  for Insurance and Occupational Pensions (EIOPA) submitted its final proposal for changes to the standard model under Solvency II to the European Commission. One of several proposals by EIOPA concerns  changes  to  the  interest  rate  risk  module  that  could increase  the  solvency  capital  requirement  for  Norwegian  and Swedish insurance companies.\n\nEIOPA originally planned to submit its final proposals in June 2020, but the timetable was revised due to Covid-19. We expect final conclusions to be drawn by the Commission, the Parliament and the Council in 2022. This will be followed by work on delegated acts and guidelines. Changes are not expected to enter into force before 2026.\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nThe EU Action Plan for Financing Sustainable Growth will, among other  things,  help  meet  the  commitments  set  out  in  the  Paris Agreement  on  reduced  carbon  emissions.  The  regulations  on sustainable finance follow up the action plan and shall contribute to increased investments in sustainable activities and strengthen the financial system's ability to manage climate risk.\n\nThe  Financial  Supervisory  Authority  of  Norway  has  prepared proposals  for  a  new  law  on  sustainability  reporting  that incorporates  the  disclosure  regulation  and  the  classification regulation (taxonomy) in Norwegian law. A consultation period for the proposal was held until 8 January 2021. In Sweden and other EU countries, the disclosure regulation comes into force on 10 March 2021. The taxonomy came into force on 12 July 2020 in the EU, but the requirements will only apply from 2022 to the first two sustainability goals (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation), and from 2023 for the other four (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems).\n\nThe  new  rules  will  establish  standards  for  sustainable  asset management and clarify  reporting  requirements  and  customer information.\n\nWe regard the regulations for sustainable finance to be positive. It will increase the requirements and improve the quality of financial and  non-financial  reporting,  which  in  turn  will  provide  better information to stakeholders and improve comparability within the financial sector.\n\n## Norwegian regulations\n\n## Individual pension accounts\n\nThe Individual Pension Account will be introduced in Norway in 2021.  The  reform  applies  to  Defined  Contribution  pensions  in the private sector. The aim is to give workers a better overview of their pension, and to facilitate more efficient administration and management of pensions.\n\nPension capital certificates accumulated from previous employments  are  automatically  transferred  to  the  Individual Pension Account, which is established at the current employer's pension provider. Transfers are carried out unless the policyholder makes  an  active  choice  to  opt-out  ('negative  acceptance')  and stay with the providers from previous employments. At the same time,  it  introduces  the  opportunity  for  policyholders  to  choose a  provider  of  their  own  choice  rather  than  staying  with  the employer's collective scheme.\n\nWorkers wishing to opt-out can do so between 1 February and 30 April 2021, in a joint portal provided by Norsk Pensjon. It will also be possible to move to the provider of own choice from 1 February.",

Appendix\n\n3\n\nTransfers  of  pension  capital  certificates  that  have  not  optedout  shall  be  carried  out  in  the  period  between  1  May  and  30 December  2021.  Policyholders  who  do  not  want  to  wait  may request that pension capital certificates shall be moved to their Individual Pension Account at once.\n\nTo facilitate an efficient implementation of the reform, the industry has collaborated on the development of a new common digital infrastructure. A separate company, Pensjonskontoregisteret AS, has been established to operate this.\n\nA key aim of the reform is to reduce the costs associated with the administration of pension contributions from previous employers. Regulation stipulates that individuals shall pay the same fee for former  earning  from  pension  capital  certificates  transferred  to the Individual Pension Account as the employer pays for current contributions. This will lead to significantly lower income related to former earnings for the providers. The impact for Storebrand is described in more detail below under financial results.\n\nStorebrand  expects  a  positive  net  transfer  of  pension  capital certificates with the introduction of Individual Pension accounts. At the same time, workers will be able to move the pension funds (both past and present earnings) to providers of their own choice. All  the  major  labour  unions  have  launched  offerings  for  selfselected Individual Pension Accounts for their members.\n\nStorebrand participates in the Ministry of Finance's implementation group for Individual Pension Accounts.\n\n## Guaranteed pension\n\nThe  Norwegian  Financial  Supervisory  Authority's  proposed changes to the regulations for guaranteed pension products have\n\nbeen consulted. The Ministry of Finance is yet to decide which of the proposals for legislative changes are to be submitted to the parliament.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance decided in May 2020 that the Financial Supervisory  Authority's  proposal  to  remove  the  possibility of  booking  bonds  and  loans  at  amortised  costs  will  not  be followed up. Bonds held at amortised costs are a key tool for risk management of paid-up policies, and the clarification provided reassurance that we can continue to make use this tool.\n\nThe other proposals that the Ministry will now consider include:\n\n- \u00b7 The  ability  for  companies  to  build  additional  statutory reserves separately for individual contracts.\n- \u00b7 A new buffer fund model. The Financial Supervisory Authority has primarily proposed merging additional statutory reserves and market value adjustment reserves into a new customerdistributed  buffer  reserve  that  can  also  cover  negative returns.  As  an  alternative,  a  continuation  of  additional statutory  reserves  and  market  value  adjustment  reserves is proposed, but with the possibility for additional statutory reserves to also cover negative returns.\n- \u00b7 The  ability  for  the  company  to  fulfil  annual  interest  rate guarantees with borrowed equity.\n- \u00b7 The ability for customers to choose faster pay-outs for small paid-up policies.\n- \u00b7  The ability for companies to compensate customers who convert to paid up policies with investment choice.\n\nWe  expect  the  proposed  legislation  to  be  presented  in  early 2021.",

Storebrand  will  also implement IFRS 9 for financial instruments at the same time. The new standards will lead to changes in the valuation of insurance contracts and how profits are recognised. Estimated effects for Storebrand will be presented closer to the implementation date.\n\n## Swedish regulations\n\nPremium pensions (PPM) of the national retirement pension system The report on the Swedish premium pension system (PPM) is still being discussed in the Swedish parliament's pension group. This will  present the final requirements for a procured fund market, before  for  further  processing.  The  inquiry  period  has  been extended until 31 August 2021 so that the authorities can begin their work with the fund market on 1 September 2021. Today's fund market is expected to be replaced by a procured market based on new criteria for fees, sustainability and quality.\n\nIn 2020, it was decided that a body under the Swedish Pension Authority  shall  be  responsible  for  managing  the  new  fund market and for qualifying funds. The Pension Authority shall also be  responsible  for  dissolving  the  current  fund  market  and  for deciding how pension funds shall be transferred to funds on the new fund market.\n\nThe PPM fund market is a major distribution channel for SPP's funds.  We  anticipate  that  the  new  fund  market  will  offer  fewer funds at a lower price, but it is too early to say anything about the consequences.\n\n## New transfer market regulation\n\nA new regulation with the purpose of increasing the transferability of pensions policies came into force in January 2020. The new rules limit the amount of fees that can be charged upon transferring pensions  rights  to  competing  providers.  In  accordance  with the  new  regulation,  SPP  adjusted  its  transfer  fees.  SPP  favours increased transfer rights and welcomes the new regulation.\n\nThe Swedish government has been asked by the parliament to draw up further proposals for adjustments to the transfer fees for Unit Linked accounts (including deposit insurance). Proposed regulations  were  presented  in  October  2020.  The  new  rules, which introduce an upper limit on fees, will come into force on 1 April 2021 and apply to policies dated back to 1 July 2007. An inquiry for policies established before 1 July will be conducted and proposed regulations are expected in September 2021.\n\nSPP  supports  a  more  transparent  and  clearer  framework  for transfers of pensions and hopes full transfer rights will apply to policies established even before 2007. Today, this is voluntary for insurance companies, and something the SPP already allows. We believe that the ability for employees to choose a provider of their own choice should not be affected by how many years they have saved for their pension.\n\n## Financial results\n\nIn Norway, the market for private sector occupational pensions has experienced increased competition over the last years in anticipation of  the  new  Individual  Pension  Accounts  (IPA),  described  under regulatory changes above. As individuals' contracts are merged into one  account,  fees  will  be  reduced.  The  resulting  economic  effect is  expected to be moderate in 2021 and slightly more negative in 2022, before recovering in 2023 through strong underlying growth as well as measures to increase profitability. The market has grown structurally over the past years. High single-digit growth in premiums and double-digit growth in assets under management are expected during the next years. We aim to defend Storebrand's market leader position,  while  also  focusing  on  cost  leadership  and  improved customer experience through end-to-end digitalisation.\n\nAs  a  leading  occupational  pension  provider  in  the  private  sector, Storebrand  also  has  a  competitive  offering  to  the  public  sector market. The public sector pension market is fast growing and larger the  private  sector,  thus  representing  a  potential  additional  source of revenue generation for Storebrand. The ambition is to gain 1 per cent market share annually, or approximately NOK 5 billion in annual net inflow.\n\nIn  the  coming  years,  Storebrand  is  looking  to  leverage  customer, product and capital synergies by expanding our insurance offering to corporate clients within P&C. The gradual transfer of contracts from the  newly  acquired  Insr  portfolios  is  expected  to  support  growth within this area in 2021.\n\nIn  Sweden, SPP has become a significant result contributor to the Storebrand Group, driven by earnings growth and ongoing capital release. Growth is expected to continue, driven by an edge in digital and  ESG-enhanced  solutions,  and  a  strong  market  position.  The market is expected to grow about 8 per cent annually, supported by increasing transfer volumes. Going forward, SPP expects to grow 14-16 per cent annually - twice the overall market growth - through capturing the largest share of transfers.\n\nOverall  reserves  for  guaranteed  pensions  are  expected  to  start decreasing in the coming years. Guaranteed reserves represent a declining share of the Group's total pension reserves and were 50.8 per cent at the end of the year, 3.7 percentage points lower than last year. Storebrand's strategy is to secure customer returns and shield shareholder's equity under turbulent market conditions by building customer buffers. Customer buffers make up more than 11 per cent of  customer  reserves  in  both  Norway  and  Sweden.  The  levels  will grow with an expected positive spread over the guaranteed rate on the policies.\n\nStorebrand  Asset  Management  is  growing  its  external  mandates from  institutional  and  retail  investors,  both  in  the  Nordics  and across  Europe,  in  addition  to  managing  internal  pension  funds. Storebrand  has  a  full  product  range  including  index,  factor,  and active  management.  We  are  also  one  of  the  strongest  providers",

Appendix\n\nalternative  assets  in  the  Nordic  region,  asset  classes  offering prospects  of  higher  margins.  In  combination  with  a  strong  track record  with  ESG-enhanced  mutual  funds,  Storebrand  is  aiming  to capitalise on these two trends. The overall ambition is to grow assets under management by NOK 250 billion in the coming three years, while maintaining a stable fee margin.\n\nThe  retail  market  has  evolved  into  and  increasingly  larger  part  of Storebrand  and  accounted  for  21  per  cent  of  the  group's  profits in  2020.  The  individualisation  of  the  pension  and  savings  market is  expected  to  increase  further  and  may  be  reinforced  by  the introduction  of  Individual  Pension  Accounts  in  Norway.  Non-life insurance, particularly P&C insurance, is an important growth area, and the acquisition of insurance customers from Insr will contribute positively in 2021. The ambition is to grow more than 10 per cent annually within savings, mortgage lending and insurance.\n\nOur ambition is to report a Group profit (before amortisation and tax) of NOK 4 billion in 2023. Strong cost discipline will be a critical success factor. Adjusted for acquisitions, currency effects and performance related costs in funds with performance fees, the Group has reported flat  nominal  costs  since  2012.  Storebrand  will  continue  to  reduce underlying  costs,  but  it  will  also  be  necessary  to  make  selective investments to facilitate growth. The acquisition of the Insr portfolio, as well as accelerated digital investments, are expected to increase costs in 2021 by NOK 400m.\n\n## Capital management\n\nStorebrand aims to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 150 per cent. At the end of 2020 it was 178 per cent. On an annual basis, a net capital generation of about 6-7 percentage points of solvency is expected over the next few years. Of this, approximately 10 percentage points are generated in the business, 3 additional percentage points are expected as a result of the guaranteed business being in run-off, and around 5-6 per cent are expected to pe paid out as dividend from  the  annual  results.  Financial  market  volatility,  especially  the development  in  long  interest  rates,  and  regulatory  changes,  may lead to short term volatility in the solvency ratio.\n\nThe  Board's  ambition  is  to  pay  a  gradually  increasing  ordinary dividend.  When  the  solvency  ratio  exceeds  180  per  cent  without material use of transitional capital, the Board's intention is to begin a share buy-back programme. The purpose of the buy-back program will be to return excess capital from the guaranteed business which is  in  long-term  run-off.  Under normal circumstances, the solvency ratio  can  be  expected  to  reach  180  per  cent  in  2023.  During  the same period, it is expected that the transitional capital will be phased out as a result of the change in business mix from guaranteed to non-guaranteed  business.  We  expect  that  approximately  NOK 10 billion  in  capital  will  be  released  by  2030.  In  combination  with increased earnings from capital light growth, the business mix shift will also lead to positive developments in return on equity over time. We expect to deliver a return on equity (adjusted for amortisation) of more than 10 per cent by the end of 2023 on a sustainable basis.",

Appendix\n\n## A driving force for sustainable investments\n\nHaving a long-term perspective is important for Storebrand, as we manage customers' savings over decades. We fundamentally believe that investments in companies that are well positioned to  deliver  on  the  UN  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) will provide  better  risk-adjusted  returns  for  our  customers  over time.  Companies  that  rank  highly  on  sustainability  indicators have a better understanding of global developments, and how to navigate risks and opportunities, than other businesses. According to  international  studies,  the  most  sustainable  companies  on the  world's  stock  exchanges  tend  to  outperform  their  peers financially  over  time.  We  therefore  believe  such  companies  will be the winners of tomorrow and provide better returns for our customers.\n\nIn  order  to  clarify  and  measure  sustainability,  we  have  defined sustainability as measurable subpoints under the Envionmental, Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  categories  -  environmental  and social conditions, and corporate governance. Storebrand is both a significant asset owner and asset manager. With investments in over 4,500 companies    worldwide, we are exposed a wide array of ESG risks. We work actively to reduce the risk of our portfolio having a negative impact on the environment and in societies. More specifically, we work to reduce the risk of our investments having\n\nindirectly  contributed  to  environmental  degradation,  violations  of international  conventions  on  human  rights  and  international  law, suppression  of  children's  rights,  corruption  or  economic  crime. From a financial perspective, it is also crucial for us to reduce ESG risk to avoid negative effects on the value of our investments.\n\nIn  the  past  few  years,  the  debate  on  sustainability  has  mainly considered  the  importance  of  reducing  the  world's  greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. The climate crisis remains a central issue today, but in the environmental and climatic areas there is  an  increasing  focus  on  the  importance  of  avoiding  largescale losses of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe  Covid-19  pandemic  affected  us  all  in  2020,  but  the  impacts were  unevenly  distributed.  Just  like  the  impact  of  climate  change will  challenge  societies  differently.  In  our  work  on  responsible investments, we see that the pandemic has had major consequences for  supply  chains  in  developing  countries  and  has  consequently resulted in millions of people losing their livelihoods. The World Bank estimates that for the first time in 20 years the number of extremely poor increased, and it is estimated that around 100 million people have been driven into extreme poverty in 2020. 34)",

Shareholder matters\n- 7. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 8. Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nWe see a growing demand for sustainable investment products, especially products with a focus on climate solutions. In Sweden, our  customers  want  to  reduce  the  exposure  to  carbon-related activities in their portfolios. In this market, one-third of our total assets of NOK 962 billion are invested in fossil-free products that exclude  companies  in  coal,  oil  and  gas.  In  2020  assets  under management  in  fossil  free  products  increased  by  more  than NOK  130  billion.  Our  efforts  to  reduce  CO2emissions  among companies in our portfolio are driven by customer expectations, as well as our responsibility to manage financial risk on behalf of our customers and investors.\n\nOur  exposure  to  companies  actively  working  to  achieve  the SDGs  increased  significantly  in  2020.  These  businesses  are called  'solution  companies'  in  Storebrand.  Our  investments  in solution companies accounted for 13 per cent of our total equity investments in 2020, up from 8 per cent in 2019.\n\n## We contribute in the debate on sustainable investments and develop methods and frameworks.\n\nIn  2019,  we  were  one  of  the  founders  of  the  UN-backed  NetZero  Asset  Owner  Alliance  (NZAOA). 35) The  aim  of  the  alliance is to harness the role as active owners to reduce emissions in investment portfolios.  Members of the alliance  report  openly  on progress towards intermediate targets, in line with Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement.\n\nBy cooperating with portfolio companies, members are committed to ensure that the portfolio companies succeed in their transition to production methods and energy use from sources that diminish their  CO2emissions  over  time.  In  2020,  Storebrand  chaired  the working group of NZAOA and developed a document suggesting methods for how investors can set climate targets in line with the Paris  Agreement's  1.5\u00b0C  target.  The  framework  includes  active ownership, portfolio targets, sector targets and solutions. Investors must set targets every five years on their path to a carbon-neutral investment portfolio by 2050.\n\nIn line with the scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we aim to reduce emissions by 32 per cent for investments in equities, bonds and real estate by 2025, with a baseline year in 2018. We intend to do this through real-world changes, rather than excluding companies with high emissions. Therefore, we are actively working with the 20 largest emitters in our portfolio to reduce their emissions. In 2021, we will set specific targets for the sectors that account for most of the emissions in our portfolio.\n\nIn  2020,  we  launched  a  new  comprehensive  climate  policy  for Storebrand's  investments.  The  work  included  a  comprehensive analysis  to  uncover  deforestation  risks,  and  direct  dialogue  on deforestation  with  Brazilian  and  Indonesian  authorities.  We  also decided  not  to  invest  in  companies  that  engage  in  deliberate  and systematic lobbying to counter the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nOver  time,  we  have  had  dialogue  with  the  International  Energy Agency  (IEA),  along  with  over  60  other  international  companies, organisations and academic researchers. We have urged the IEA to provide  governments,  investors  and  companies  with  better  tools to align policies, investments and business strategies with the Paris Agreement's  goal  of  reducing  global  warming.  In  the  '2020  World Energy Outlook,' the IEA included a renewable energy scenario for the  first  time,  with  net  zero  emissions  by  2050.  This  is  a  positive development that shows that international cooperation works.  We will continue to put pressure on the IEA to include a comprehensive 1.5-degree scenario in the World Energy Outlook report in 2021.\n\nThroughout 2020, Storebrand' s CEO continued to engage in several initiatives  to  promote  sustainable  business  practices  and  share knowledge  and  experience  with  other  companies.  The  Norwegian climate  initiative  Skift,  and  the  Nordic  initiative  Nordic  CEOs  for  a Sustainable Future, are two examples.  In both working groups, we led work-streams on climate that resulted in all members committing to set targets in line with the Paris Agreement and report public and transparent climate data.\n\nIn 2020, we also assisted The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in the development of a methodology to adapt lending and investment portfolios to the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, by providing input on their Temperature Alignment Tool. In addition, we road tested the SBTi methodology to set goals for property investments, contributing to a report where we shared our target and experiences using the framework.\n\nAs  these  examples  indicate,  we  expanded  our  sustainability  work through cooperation with different types of stakeholders, as well as strengthening  direct  dialogue  with  the  companies  in  which  we  are invested throughout the year.",

Appendix\n\n## Our work on sustainable investments\n\nWe  aim  to  be  a  driving  force  for  lasting  change  in  the  way companies  are  managed,  while  ensuring  good  returns  for  our owners and customers. We put capital into action to fund socially purposeful, sustainable solutions and reduce exposure to activities that  adversely  affect  society  and  the  environment.  Our  work  on sustainable  investments  consists  mainly  of  three  instruments; solutions, active ownership and exclusions\n\nThese three instruments enable us to be an active, driving force for sustainable investments that contributes to positive change and development, and to reduce financial risk.\n\n## Solutions\n\nPart of our investment strategy is to move capital to what we call solution companies. These are companies that actively work to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and do not substantially  hinder  achievement  of  other  sustainability  goals, or  the  Paris  Agreement.  Our  whitelist  of  solution  companies  is updated continuously, used in investment decisions and is part of Storebrand' s ranking of companies based on sustainability criteria. Below  we  describe  how  the  investment  strategy  for  solution companies contributes directly to realising different sustainability goals.\n\nIn  order  to  integrate  assessments  of  companies'  ESG  risks  and opportunities  into  the  investment  process,  proper  tools  are essential.  Since  2012,  Storebrand  has  developed  and  integrated a  sustainability  score  providing  a  foundation  for  investment decisions, by ranking the companies on operations, products, and services.  In  this  way,  we  can  effectively  identify  companies  that have the potential to deliver good returns, while helping to solve sustainability challenges. We calculate the sustainability scores of over 4 500 companies and base it on a 0-100 scale. We increase investments  in  companies  that  achieve  high  scores,  an  reduce investments in companies with low scores. Our target is that 15 per cent of our investments will be invested in solution by 2025, up from 9.6 per cent in 2020.\n\nWe also invest in green bonds. These secure access to capital for new  and  existing  projects  with  environmental  benefits.  By  yearend  in  2020,  we  had  invested  NOK  22.2  billion  in  green  bonds, accounting for 5 per cent of our total bond investments, up from 2 per cent in 2019. Green bonds are part of what we call solutions, and are included in the total target of 15 per cent described above The table below shows how our strategy for increasing investments in solutions contributes positively to the UN  Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n## Alternative investment opportunities\n\nBy diversifying our investments, Storebrand sees great opportunities in reducing risks while at the same time contributing to sustainable development. For instance, by diversifying investments in alternative asset classes such as real estate, private equity and infrastructure.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nIn  2020  Storebrand  teamed  up  with  two  of  Denmark's  largest pension funds, PKA and PenSam, to establish a new climate and infrastructure fund. Together, we are committed to investing a total of up to NOK 45 billion, making the fund one of the largest of its kind  in  the  Nordic  region.  This  marked  the  start  of  Storebrand'  s investments in infrastructure and will further enhance our ability to contribute to the transition to a low-carbon society.\n\n## Real estate investments\n\nStorebrand is a significant player in direct real estate investments with property investments of NOK 49 billion, which accounts for 5 per centof our assets under management. Our experience is that the integration of sustainability aspects int real estate has a positive effect both for society and our tenants, while providing higher returns on property investments. We integrate sustainability throughout our property portfolio and aim to be the Nordic region's leading player in sustainable management of real estate investments.\n\nWe  increased  the  share  of  environmentally  certified  buildings  from 41 per cent in 2019 to 43 per cent in 2020. In addition, we reduced emissions from our real estate investments from 9.1 kg CO2e per m2 in 2019 to  7.9  in 2020. This is affected by reduced activity in a number of our properties due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our target for next year is therefore somewhat higher than the result for 2020. As a result of  our  long-term  and  systematic  sustainability  work,  four  out  of  five funds with direct real estate investments have achieved a 5-star rating from the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB).\n\n## Active ownership\n\nActive ownership is a vital tool in Storebrand' s approach to sustainable investments. The main objectives of reducing risk, and safeguarding and creating value on behalf of shareholders, are closely related to ESG risks. The aim of our engagements with the various companies is that we will influence them to move in a more sustainable direction. Therefore, we prioritise active ownership with companies where we see the greatest potential to foster change through our engagement efforts. We get involved in companies with a long-term perspective for  change  and  collaborate  with  other  investors  to  exert  greater influence. We concentrate our resources on activities that can raise the standards for entire industries, rather than focusing on individual initiatives for each company in our portfolio.",

Annual Accounts and Notes\n\n8. Governance\n\n9. Sustainability assurance\n\n10. Appendix\n\nWe  exercise  active  ownership  towards  the  companies  we  are invested in, mainly through investor cooperation, direct dialogue with the  management and board of directors, and by voting at general meetings,  including  by  proxy  voting.  We  prioritise  direct  dialogue when  we  believe  this  is  the  most  effective  way  to  influence  ESGrelated  decisions.  We  have  experienced  that  we  have  the  greatest impact when working with other investors. This is one of the reasons why we participate in investor cooperation through the UN-backed Principles  for  Responsible  Investment  (PRI)  network,  and  Climate Action 100+ to achieve dialogue with companies on climate change and deforestation, among other things.\n\nIn our active ownership, we prioritised four topics in 2020:\n\n## Decarbonization of companies\n\nOur climate  change  policy  aims  to  reduce  investment  exposure  to climate risk. We are part of several global collaborations where we have a leading role in engaging with companies that are top carbon emitters. With the decision to phase out investments in coal by 2026, we are engaging with investee  entities  on  reducing  their  exposure to  coal  production,  distribution  and  consumption.  We  will  also co-file shareholder proposals on two-degree scenario planning and methane emission reduction targets.\n\n## Conflict areas\n\nDuring  2020,  Storebrand  has  carried  out  a  screening  to  identify companies  with  operations  in  occupied  Palestinian  territories  and occupied  Western  Sahara.  These  companies  may  contribute  and profit  from  the  occupation  by  supplying  security  and  surveillance services and equipment. They may also profit from the maintenance, development and expansion of settlements by providing construction materials  and  services  or  directly  financing  the  construction  of settlements  or  by  being  involved  in  the  exploitation  of  natural resources without the consent of the occupied people.  According to  reports  from  the  UN  and  several  Human  Right  organisations, the occupying powers in these territories continue expanding their occupation which in turn results in continuing violations of  human rights.  In  addition,  attention  to  these  issues  by  companies  and investors continues to be low. Therefore, we decided to make conflict areas  one  of  our  top  engagement  priorities.  During  the  year  we faced several dilemmas that highlighted the importance of thinking holistically  about  sustainability.  Among  other  things,  we  chose  to exclude  companies  with  business  activity  in  occupied  territories, despite their business contributing to green restructuring.\n\n## Money laundering\n\nTrust in the financial system is at the very core of our modern society. If banks and other financial institutions are used as tools to legitimate criminal  activity  through  money  laundering  this  trust  will  quickly erode. In recent years major banks all over the world, including major Scandinavian  banks,  have  been  implicated  in  money  laundering scandals.  We  expect  all  financial  institutions  to  follow  international rules  and  the  recommendations  from  the  Financial  Action  Task Force on Anti-Money Laundering (AML). We will cooperate with other investors, to improve the AML systems in banks we are invested.\n\n## Deforestation and biodiversity\n\nProtecting  and  restoring  forests  and  other  natural  ecosystems can contribute as much as a third of what is needed to prevent irreversible  climate  change.  Deforestation  is  driven  by  demand for  agricultural  land  and  natural  resources.  Raw  materials  and products associated with deforestation are part of thousands of  global  value  chains.  As  one  of  the  world's  first  investors, Storebrand launched in 2019 a  separate policy on deforestation, committing  to  deforestation-free  investment  portfolios  by 2025. Therefore, Storebrand has stepped up its work on active ownership and been in dialogue with companies with activities that pose a high risk of deforestation.\n\nIn  collaboration  with  the  Rainforest  Foundation  and  KLP,  we produced a report  that  maps  the  types  of  data  sources,  tools and methods investors can use to work systematically and factbased with deforestation.  Based on the findings of the report, Storebrand  conducted  a  comprehensive  risk  analysis  and identified  companies  and  sectors  with  high  deforestation  risk. Further work in this area will be one of our priorities in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, Storebrand also initiated an investor coalition on deforestation,  the  Investors  Policy  Dialogue  on  Deforestation (IPDD).  The  coalition  consists  of  43  investors  who  manage approximately  USD  6,000  billion  and  will  work  systematically towards  governments  in  countries  where  deforestation  is  a problem. Storebrand and BlueBay Asset Management share the leadership responsibility for this work. Initially, the coalition focused on Brazil,  where  we  led  the  dialogue  with  Brazilian  authorities. The  work  gained  great  international  recognition,  and  received massive media coverage in Brazil and internationally, giving us a solid starting point for our work to combat deforestation.\n\nLoss  of  biodiversity  is  a  priority  for  Storebrand.  The  value  of natural goods is estimated to be over NOK 100,000 billion globally, and  loss  of  nature  can  have  major  financial  consequences  for companies. For us, it is important to establish nature-related risk as a concept, in the same way as climate risk is. Internationally, we have been invited to work with governments, companies and other financial institutions to establish the Task Force on Naturerelated  Financial  Disclosures  with  accompanying  standards  for better company reporting for biodiversity.\n\n## Exclusions\n\nAll  companies  in  our  investment  portfolio  must  satisfy  the Storebrand  Standard.  This  stipulates  minimum  requirements to human rights and international law, corruption and financial crime, climate  and  environmental  damage,  controversial weapons and tobacco. It applies to all funds and pension assets in the Storebrand Group and ensures that customers' money is invested in companies that comply with international norms and conventions. In case of serious violations of the Storebrand Standard, we use our role as owner to suggest improvements in dialogue with the company. If our engagement is not successful, the company is excluded from our investment portfolio.",

In 2020, we had dialogue with other important stakeholders,  including  the  authorities  in Brazil,  on  measures  to  reduce  biodiversity loss and to prevent deforestation.\n\nWe  engage  with  companies  in  the  world that  emit  the  most  greenhouse  gases,  to reduce emissions, strengthen climaterelated financial reporting  and  improve climate management. In 2020, we worked to ensure that the companies we are invested in will set climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement  and  report  on  climate  risks  in accordance with the TCFD recommendations.\n\nWe engage with companies to reduce water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in  intensive  livestock  production.  We  raise environmental  standards  in  key  sectors, such  as  palm  oil,  soy,  cattle  and  timber.  In 2020, we analyzed companies with increased deforestation risk, that employ irresponsible production methods.\n\n- 36)  A company can be excluded on several criteria, therefore the total is less than the sum of the individual exclusions\n- 37) https://www.storebrand.no/asset-management/barekraftige-investeringer/aktivt-eierskap/konfliktomrader\n- 38) https://www.storebrand.no/asset-management/barekraftige-investeringer/aktivt-eierskap/storebrand-committed-to-act-in-support-of-the-investor-statement-on-coronavirus-response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe want to raise awareness of international employer rights,especially in high-risk sectors.  We  seek  to  improve  guidelines and contribute to both better relationships between  management  and  employees and working conditions in supplier chains.

Appendix\n\n## Case: New ecosystem-based climate strategy for investments\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand launched a new climate strategy as an addition to the Group's sustainable investment guidelines. The strategy aims to ensure that we are a driving force for a just transition to a low-carbon society, while helping to reduce climate risk in our investments.\n\nThe strategy is divided into four main areas:\n\n## 1 Make  investment  decisions  in  line  with  scientific consensus\n\nUsing   climate scenarios based on the climate models of the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC) and  limiting global  warming  to 1.5\u00b0C with no or with limited overshoot.\n\n## 2.  Reorient capital flows towards low-carbon, climateresilient and transition companies\n\nUsing  the  EU    taxonomy  for  sustainable  activities  and establishing  methods  for  measuring,  monitoring  and reporting on climate-related risks and identify investment opportunities.\n\nWe will  use  the  following  metrics  to  measure,  monitor and report climate-related risks and identify investment opportunities:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate risk assessment and monitoring: All portfolio managers are responsible for assessing and reporting on the climate risk profile of their portfolios. In addition, we have established a methodology aimed at high emission sectors.\n- \u00b7 Ranking and research: Use data to assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Carbon footprint: Measure the carbon footprint of our portfolios and compare these with relevant indexes to map reduction targets. Use best available reporting practices.\n- \u00b7 Adaptation metrics: Assess the preparedness of investee companies and entities to the physical impact risks associated with climate change. In addition, we will consider adaptation plans for companies that are particularly exposed to climate change.\n\n## 3.    Avoid investments that contribute greatly to climate change\n\nStorebrand will no longer invest in companies such as:\n\n- \u00b7 receive more than 5 per cent of its revenues from coal or  oil sands-based activities\n- \u00b7 is involved in severe and/or systematically unsustainable production of palm oil, soy, cattle and timber. This can reduce deforestation risk in portfolios, in line with our deforestation policy.\n- \u00b7 deliberately and systematically work against the goals and targets enshrined in the Paris Agreement., for example through lobbying. Two of the world's largest energy companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron were excluded from all Storebrand's funds in 2020 due to this criterion.\n\nExceptions  from  divestment  limits  may  be  made  in cases where companies can demonstrate a clear and rapid transition pathway.\n\n## 4.  Use  ownership  position  to  stimulate  ambitious climate practices at portfolio companies\n\nWe will seek to build positive dialogue with companies, aiming  to  support  their  transition  to  low  carbon  and climate-resilient  activities.  This  will  be  done  both through individual dialogue, but also through investor initiatives such as the PRI and Climate Action 100+.",

Appendix\n\n## Risk\n\nOur  risk  management  framework  is  designed  to  ensure  that  we take  the  appropriate  risk  for  delivering  returns  to  customers and  owners,  while  protecting  them,  our  employees  and  other stakeholders  from  adverse  events  and  losses.  The  framework covers all risks Storebrand may be exposed to. The main risks are business risk, financial market risk, insurance risk, counterparty risk, operational risk, climate risk and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA and the directors of the subsidiaries adopt a risk appetite and risk strategy at least once per year. Risktaking  shall  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  our  strategic  and commercial  goals,  including  customers  receiving  a  competitive return  on  their  pension  funds,  and  that  Storebrand  receives adequate payment for taking on risk.  Risk  appetite  is  defined  as the overall risk level and what types of risk are deemed acceptable. The guidelines from the risk appetite are incorporated in our risk strategy, which sets the targets and frameworks. Based on these, more detailed strategies are compiled for different risk categories. Storebrand publishes an annual Solvency and Financial Condition Report  (SFCR)  which  helps  customers  and  other  stakeholders understand the risks in the business and how these are managed.\n\nOverall, we saw a positive development in the number of reported incidents in 2020. Fewer customer and process-related incidents were  reported  compared  to  2019.  The  number  of  'high-risk incidents' was also fewer than the year before, but their share of total is about the same as last year.\n\nCovid-19  had  limited  impact  on  Storebrand's  operations,  but  it caused major fluctuations in the financial markets. The first phase was handled as an emergency situation. Home office and digital meeting  places  were  adopted  to  prevent  the  risk  for  contagion. Work  processes  were  successfully  restructured  without  any significant  negative  events.  Our  customer  service  and  deliveries were affected to a small extent.\n\nThe pandemic and the economic consequences of lock downs to  limit  contagion  both  in  Norway  and  internationally  resulted  in large  stock  market  declines,  wider  credit  spreads,  falling  interest rates  and  a  lower  turnover  for  many  financial  assets  during  the first part of 2020. The unrest, in combination with falling oil prices, resulted in a significant depreciation of the Norwegian krone. In the subsequent three quarters of the year, most markets recovered. Financial markets stabilised, helped by extensive rescue packages from governments. At the beginning of 2021, the interest rate level was still significantly lower than a year earlier, however. The financial market turmoil was handled within our normal framework for risk management in the Group. The persistent need for measures to limit contagion means that the risk is still higher than normally.\n\nCovid-19  also  affects  our  insurance  risk.  The  greatest  risk  is associated with rising unemployment as a result of a weak economy, which  has  historically  led  to  an  increase  in  disability.  Storebrand has strengthened the disability reserves to address the increased uncertainty.\n\nPlease also read note 2 for more information related to uncertainties arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe risk picture differs between business units. The main risks are described per business unit below.\n\nInsurance\n\nInsurance consists of risk products and property and casualty insurance. The price can normally be adjusted on an annual basis if the risk changes.\n\nThe greatest risk is disability risk. More people than expected may become  disabled  and/or  fewer  disabled  people  will  be  able  to work again. Some policies provide a pay-out in the event of death, but Storebrand's risk from this is limited.\n\nIn property and casualty insurance, most of the risk is linked to developments in claims payments from car and home insurance. Climate change is one factor which may affect future claims.\n\n## Savings\n\nSavings  consists  of  unit-linked  insurance  and  other  nonguaranteed pensions, the asset management business and the banking business.\n\nFor unit-linked insurance, the customer bears the financial market risk. The disbursements are generally time limited, and Storebrand bears  low  risk  from  increased  life  expectancy.  For  Storebrand, the risk from unit-linked insurance is primarily changes in future income  or  cost.  Managing  customer's  assets  in  a  professional and sustainable way, which at that at the same time ensures a good risk-adjusted  return,  is  however  important  to  attract  new customers and create growth.\n\nThe  asset  management  business  offers  active  and  passive management, as well as management of fund-in-fund structures. Operational  risks,  including  regulatory  compliance,  are  the greatest risks.\n\nThe  greatest  risks  for  the  banking  business  are  credit  risk  and liquidity  risk.  Virtually  the  entire  loan  portfolio  is  secured  by mortgages, limiting our credit risk.",

The  greatest  risks  are  financial market risk and longevity risk.\n\nA common feature of the products is that Storebrand guarantees a minimum return. In Norway, the return must exceed the guarantee in each year, while in Sweden it is enough to achieve the guaranteed return on average over time.\n\nThe  guaranteed  insurance  liabilities  are  sensitive  to  changes in  interest  rates,  where  lower  rates  will  increase  the  value  of  the liabilities and make it harder to achieve the guaranteed rate. We aim to control the risk through the investments, but there is a residual risk from lower interest rates.\n\nThe traditional guaranteed products are closed for new business, but there is a large back-book of reserves. New premiums are mainly in  Defined  Contribution  pensions  (unit  linked)  or  hybrid  schemes with zero per cent guarantee.\n\nStorebrand wants to grow in the  guaranteed  public  occupational pension  market  and  received  new  customers  in  2020.    Public pension products differ from guaranteed pension products in the private  sector  because  in  the  public  sector,  the  employer  pays for  the  interest  rate  guarantee, even for resigned employees and pensioners.\n\nOther\n\nThe  Other  unit  encompasses  the  holding  company  Storebrand ASA, as well as the company portfolios and smaller subsidiaries of Storebrand Life Insurance and SPP. The assets in Storebrand ASA and  the  company  portfolios  are  invested  at  low  risk,  primarily  in investment grade short-term interest-bearing securities.\n\nTax\n\nChanges have been made to the Norwegian tax legislation for the insurance industry in recent years. Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration have interpreted some of the legislation changes and  the  associated  transitional  rules  differently.  Consequently, Storebrand has three significant uncertain tax positions with regards to recognised tax expenses. These are described in more detail in note 8. Should Storebrand's interpretation be accepted in all three cases,  an  estimated  positive  tax  result  of  up  to  NOK  2.8  billion may be recognised. Should all the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretations be the final verdict, a tax expense of NOK 1.8 billion could be recognised. The Norwegian Tax Administration is expected to  come  with  their  decision  on  whether  to  retroactively  change Storebrand's tax bill in early 2021. However, the timeline for settling the  process  with  the  Norwegian  Tax  Administration  might  take several  years.  If  necessary,  Storebrand  will  seek  clarification  from the court of law on the matter.",

Appendix\n\n## Climate risks and opportunities\n\n## Why\n\nClimate change and the transition to a low-carbon society can have a significant impact on our business. This may be further exacerbated by changes in the Norwegian economy, which is vulnerable to falling oil prices and lower activity in the oil and gas industry. In developing our climate strategy, we looked at how Storebrand' s activities affect climate  change,  how  climate  change  and  climate  policy  can  affect our business, and how we can adapt to avoid or mitigate potential negative impacts.  In addition, we identified opportunities as a result of  a  changing climate and the transition to a low-carbon economy, what these entail for us and how we can capitalise on them in the best possible way. This is described in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments on page 57.\n\nThe effects on investments and liabilities may be sudden in the form of market unrest, or they may unfold gradually through lower average return and persistently low interest rates. A disorderly transition also poses a risk, for instance if policy initiatives are too strong relative to technology development and investment opportunities. Vulnerability from  a  lower  oil  price  and  activity  in  the  oil  and  gas-sector  is  a particular risk for Norway. A potential trigger is if the policy is abruptly strengthened to achieve Norway's goals based on the Paris agreement. A potential effect is a country-specific fall in interest rate. As part of our efforts to reduce risk, in 2020 we mapped Storebrand's exposure to the fossil sector, analyzing revenues from pension premiums, and disability coverage related to the sector and underlying industries.\n\nWe have used the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  as  a  framework 44) for  our disclosure  on  climate-related  financial  risks.  The  reporting  on  the impact our business has on climate is reported elsewhere in this report, mainly in the chapter, Keeping our house in order on page 32, and in the chapter A driving for sustainable investments on page 57  and  59.Vi  have  established  a  TCFD  index,  which  summarises where the information recommended through the TCFD framework is presented in this report. The index is located as an attachment on page 199.\n\n## Our approach\n\nStorebrand  assesses  climate  risk  through  the  same  framework  as other  risks.  The  overall  risk,  including  climate  risk,  is  summarised in  the  Board's risk review. Risk assessments are broad and include reputational risks associated with Storebrand's sustainability position.  In  the  Group's  Own  Risk  and  Solvency  report  (ORSA),  the main objective is to assess climate risks for investments, insurance obligations and solvency margins in different scenarios.\n\nClimate risk differs significantly from other risks, especially along two dimensions. Climate risk, especially the physical risk, is very long-term.\n\nTherefore,  the  risk  is  assessed  in  a  longer  time  frame.  In  addition, historical events have limited relevance. Different scenarios are used as the basis for the assessment.\n\nStorebrand  has  defined  three  scenarios  based  on  the  framework developed by Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The network is established by central banks and supervisory authorities. The aim is to develop a framework for assessing and managing climate risk  and  encouraging  the  financial  sector  to  support  the  transition to a low-carbon economy. The scenarios will be further developed, including  quantitative  stress  tests,  as  the  basis  for  the  supervision process and analyses of financial stability.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\ntransition risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe scenarios are based on two dimensions that affect the risk.\n\n- \u00b7 How serious will the impact of global warming be? (physical risk)\n- \u00b7 Is the transition controlled or disorderly? (transition risk)\n\nStorebrand has committed to the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees and will work for a controlled transition, similar to scenario A.",

Appendix\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nStorebrand has used the NGFS framework and associated scenarios to assess climate risk. The scenarios used can be simplified as follows:\n\n## 1) Controlled:\n\nClimate  policy  is  restructured  swiftly  and  with  force  with  the  aim of  reaching zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5  degrees.  The  restructuring  is  facilitated  by  the  fact  that  carbon capture becomes technically and economically viable to some extent.\n\n## 2) Delayed:\n\nVarying  degrees  of  climate  crisis  understanding,  complex  decisionmaking  and  limited  technology  developments  delay  a  coordinated restructuring  of  climate  policy  in  relation  to  the  goals  of  the  Paris Agreement.  From  about  2025,  clearer  signs  of  negative  climate change are increasing acceptance of costs of severe austerity. Overall, the restructuring will be large enough for global warming to remain below 2 degrees.\n\n## 3) Warm world:\n\nGreenhouse emissions continue to grow, based on continuance of already  existing  emission-reduction  measures.  Low  sense  of  crisis, lack of coordination and short-term policy priorities mean that already adopted future restrictions are implemented to a lesser extent. By 2050, emissions are higher than present levels and global warming will be above 3 degrees.\n\nThe economic implications of the potentially catastrophic climatic changes  of  scenario  3  cannot  be  quantified  in  a  meaningful  way. Therefore, we have based our assessment on the consequences of the scenarios controlled (1.5 \u00b0C) and delayed (> 2 \u00b0C). Based on these two scenarios, we have identified potential risks and assessed them in short (1-3 years) and long term (3-10 years). 45)\n\nOverall findings\n\n## Physical climate risk\n\nPhysical  climate  change  lead  to  lower  returns,  both  for  equities, bonds and property investments. The risk is  mainly  long-term  and most prevalent if climate change is dramatic, expressed in scenario 3. Insurance obligations can also be negatively affected. Storebrand exposure  to  climate  change  through  direct  insurance  is  very  low. Yet,  limited  economic  growth  can  cause  interest  rates  to  remain lower than they would otherwise. This has a negative impact on our guaranteed obligations. The combination of lower returns on assets, and higher insurance liabilities  could  negatively  affect  our  solvency margin. The effect can hit abruptly in the form of market turmoil, or over time in the form of lower average returns and persistently low interest rates.\n\nIn  practice,  climate  effects  on  returns  and  interest  rates  are  very difficult to isolate from other effects. The risk is therefore considered to  be  covered  by  the  capital  requirements  for  market  risk.  The scenarios  for  negative  development  in  the  financial  market  and\n\npersistently low interest rates are also relevant to climate risk, where climate  change  and  climate  policy  could  be  affected  by  potentially contributing underlying causes.\n\n## Transition risk\n\nTransition  risk  can  affect  investment  returns,  even  in  the  short  and medium  term.  Given  a  rapid  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy, exemplified in scenario 1, there is a risk that the oil and gas sector will be  particularly  affected.  Storebrand  has  adapted  its  investments  to reduce its climate footprint, and a large part of our investments are in fossil-free funds. A large proportion of our real estate investments have  green  certificates.  This  contributes  to  reduced  climate  risk.  On the other hand, there is a risk that future returns for investments in solution companies are overvalued. The risk is greatest if the transition to a low-carbon society is delayed, as expressed in scenario 2. There may be a risk of overvalued valuations also in scenario 1, for example, if  powerful  government  initiatives  and  restrictions  are  implemented faster than technology development and investment opportunities.\n\nTransition  risks  can  also  lead  to  reduced  economic  growth,  lower investment returns and increased insurance liabilities as a result of lower interest rates. The Norwegian economy is particularly vulnerable to developments in oil prices and activity in the oil and oil services sector. Overall, the transition risk is greatest with a delayed, but more restrictive  approach,  as  expressed  in  scenario  2.  In  the  short  term, we  find  the  swift  and  forceful  climate  policy  restructures  needed  in scenario 1 to pose the greatest risk.\n\nStorebrand is particularly exposed to developments in the Norwegian economy  because  higher  levels  of  unemployment  normally  lead  to increased levels of disability. Limited economic growth over time also poses a risk to Storebrand, given that it results in reduced growth in wages and employment, and thus lower growth in pension premiums. The fossil sector poses a particular risk. A review of the customer base shows that Storebrand has a significant exposure, both against disability coverage and pension savings premiums related to employees associated with companies in the fossil sectors.\n\n## Asset management\n\nOur asset management's largest climate-related financial risks and opportunities are believed to lie in the transition to a low-emission society.  Climate  policy  and  regulations,  more  rigorous  emission requirements, a changed cost structure and market preferences may affect  our  investments.  Our  most  important  initiatives  to  mitigate these risks and capitalise on potential opportunities are listed below and, in the chapter driving force for sustainable investments.\n\nThrough  Storebrand'  s  climate  strategy  for  investments,  and  our commitments through Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, our target is to ensure that our investment portfolio shall be climate neutral by 2050. Part of the commitment is for Storebrand to set intermediate targets for emission reductions and report on target achievement.\n\n45) Since climate risk is integrated into our structured framework for risk assessment that only operates with these two time horizons, we have not included risk that could be felt in the even longer term, ie. in ten years or more",

Appendix\n\nWe have established a framework with the following targets for 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 Emission  targets  for  equity,  corporate  bonds,  and  real estate investments: In    line  with the IPCC's 1.5\u00b0C scenarios and  commitments  communicated  through  Storebrand's climate  strategy  and  the  Net  Zero  Asset  Owner  Alliance (NZAOA),  we  aim  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint 46) in  the Storebrand Group's total equities,  corporate  bond,  and  real estate investments by at least 32 per cent by 2025 with the base year in 2018. 47)\n- \u00b7 Climate  reduction  objectives  for  high  emission  sectors: Storebrand will set targets for emissions reductions for highemission sectors during the first half of 2021 48) .  See our equity exposure to high emission sectors below.\n- \u00b7 Be  an  active  owner  and  driving  force: Storebrand  Asset Management  (SAM)  leads  Storebrand's  work  with  active ownership.  In line with SAM's strategy for active ownership, particular focus will be placed on our active ownership and engagements  with  the  20  companies  where  we  own  the largest  emissions. 49) This will mainly be done in cooperation with other investors in initiatives such as Climate  Action 100+.\n- \u00b7 Reorient capital towards solution companies: Storebrand's target  is  that  15%  of  our  total  investments  will  be  invested in  what  we  define  as  solutions  by  2025.  It  includes  equity investments  in  solution  companies, 50) green  bonds,  certified green property and investments in green infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Engage  customers  and  offer  solutions: Storebrand  aims to  engage  customers  and  offer  products  and  solutions  that ensure more capital in invested in solutions and less capital is invested in high-emission companies and sectors.\n\n## Targets and metrics\n\n- \u00b7 Carbon footprint in equity investments: 12  tonnes CO2equivalents per NOK/SEK 1 million in sales income (compared to  18  index) 51)\n- \u00b7 Carbon footprint in bond investments: 9  tonnes CO2equivalents per NOK/SEK 1 million in sales income (compared to  16  index) 51)\n- \u00b7 Carbon intensity in real estate investments: 7.9 tonnes CO2equivalents per m 2\n- \u00b7 Exposure to high emission sectors NOK 32.2 billion  / 8 per cent of total assets\n- \u00b7 Number of active  company  engagements  related  to  climate  and environmental-related risks and opportunities: 433\n- \u00b7 Number of companies that have been excluded due to severe climate and environmental damage: 139\n\nIn 2020 we launched a new climate strategy. This entails, among other things, that Storebrand will no longer invest in companies that receive more  than  5  per  cent  of  their  revenues  from  coal,  oil  sands-based activities,  are  involved  in  severe  and/or  systematically  unsustainable production  of  palm  oil,  soy,  cattle  and  timber.  This  can  reduce deforestation  risk  in  portfolios,  in  line  with  our  deforestation  policy, or in companies that deliberately and systematically work against the goals  and  targets  enshrined  in  the  Paris  Agreement 52) ,  for  example through lobbying. In addition, by 2025 our investment portfolio shall be completely free from companies that contribute to illegal deforestation. We  currently  survey  all  companies  at  high  risk  of  contributing  to deforestation and will report annually on this process from 2021.\n\nAdditional measurement parameters and measurements can be found in the chapter a driving force for sustainable investments.\n\n## Sector-specified exposure to high emission sectors\n\n| Sector  53)            | 2018  (Bn NOK )   | 2019  (Bn NOK )   | 2020  (Bn NOK )   | Change 2018-2020  (Bn NOK )   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Aluminum               | 1,2               | 1,2               | 1,5               | 0,2                           |\n| Aviation               | 3,1               | 3,6               | 3,3               | 0,1                           |\n| Cement                 | 0,3               | 0,4               | 0,6               | 0,3                           |\n| Chemicals              | 6,8               | 8,0               | 9,8               | 3,0                           |\n| Energy                 | 15,8              | 12,2              | 7,0               | -8,8                          |\n| Heavy duty automobiles | 0,6               | 0,9               | 1,1               | 0,5                           |\n| Light duty automobiles | 3,7               | 3,8               | 4,3               | 0,6                           |\n| Shipping               | 0,9               | 0,6               | 0,7               | -0,2                          |\n| Steel                  | 0,8               | 1,1               | 1,4               | 0,7                           |\n| Utilities              | 4,6               | 2,9               | 2,5               | -2,1                          |\n| Total                  | 37,7              | 34,6              | 32,2              | -5,5                          |\n\n- 46) Calculated as Weighted Average Carbon Intensity.See calculation methodology in Definitions from page 225.\n- 47) This means relative emission reductions.

Physical risk is largely related to the effects of extreme weather on physical assets.\n\nTransitional  risks  are  linked  to  uncertainty  about  long-term changes. We expect the real estate sector to be subject to new requirements related to energy efficiency and climate impact. Our ability to adapt to these requirements is essential for us to manage risk and capitalise on market opportunities. In 2020, Storebrand's property subsidiary, in collaboration with the The Science Based Targets  Initiative    (SBTi),  tested  their  methodology  for  setting science-based  targets in line with the1.5 degree target of the Paris Agreement. The aim of the pilot project was to establish a target, and  an  associated  emission  pathway  to  2050.  The  pilot  project was part of a report published in connection with SBTi launching its methodology to set science-based emission targets for financial institutions.  The  pilot  project  and  the  associated  target  includes intermediate  targets  on  the  road  to  carbon  neutrality  in  2050, and is a management tool that will be used in our further work on transition risk in the property portfolio.\n\nRisk-reducing measures that we have already implemented include property  certification  and  rating  through  the  Global  Real  Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). 54)\n\nThrough 2020, we have been working on a project to develop a tool for climate accounting and forecasting for real estate, which is due to be completed in 2021. SPP Fastigheter, Storebrand' s Swedish subsidiary  in  real  estate  investments,  conducted  an  assessment in 2020 of its exposure to physical climate risk, mainly increased rainfall and flooding for all its properties. The analysis indicates that a couple of properties in the portfolio are at medium flooding risk, and work is underway to assess potential adaptation measures at these properties\n\n## Targets and metrics\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term  target  of  100  per  cent  environmentally  certified property. The share of direct real estate investments that had green  certificates  in  2020  was  43  per  cent.  The  target  is  to increase this to 74 per cent by 2025.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability  rating  of  all  real  estate:  Our  direct  real  estate investments  are  rated  by  GRESB  in  four  different  portfolios, and the portfolios are among the best in the Nordic region. The score increased almost 4 per cent in 2020 from 82 in 2019, to an average of 85 out of 100. With that, three out of four portfolios are ranked in the top 20 per cent globally, and awarded the maximum 5 stars.\n- \u00b7 Commitment to energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions: Continuous  improvements  in  energy  efficiency  are  achieved through  several  measures  to  optimise  operations.  The  total carbon  emissions  in  direct  real  estate  investments  continued to  decrease,  ending  at  8  456  tons  of  CO2equivalents  in  2020,  or 7.9kg CO2e/m2. The goal for 2025 is to reduce this to 6.5kg CO2e/m 2 .\n\nAdditional  measurement  parameters  and  targets  relevant  to climate-related  risks  related  to  real  estate  investments  can  be found on pages 59  and  65.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe  direct  impact  of  climate  change  on  Storebrand's  insurance obligations  is  limited  because  our  business  is  largely  based  on reassurance  where  the  terms  of  the  agreement  are  adjusted annually.  As  a  responsible  insurance  company,  we  still  have  a responsibility to assist our customers in securing themselves and their  assets  against  potential  climate  risks.  The  biggest  climaterelated  financial  risk  to  our  property  and  non-life  insurance business  is  increased  insurance  settlements  related  to  climaterelated damage. In the long term, rising sea levels and changes in weather patterns can also have an impact. Risks associated with changing  customer  behaviour,  technological  developments  and new regulations will also affect the property and non-life insurance market.\n\nOur main measures to reduce climate risk are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk assessment and pricing: Climate  factors  are  included in  risk  assessment  and  pricing  in  the  underwriting  process.\n- \u00b7 Exposure mapping and reinsurance: We reinsure assets in areas with high exposure to physical risk associated with climate change.\n- \u00b7 Diversified  risk  through  national  plan: Participation  in Norwegian natural perils pool is statutory and provides joint reinsurance protection linked to property insurance for real estate and housing.\n- \u00b7 Pilot project under the auspices of UNEP FI: As one of 18 insurance  companies,  we  have  participated  in  a  project  for further development of standardised reporting for insurance providers  in  accordance  with  TCFD.  We  participated  in the  working  group  which  analysed  physical  risk  related  to increased rainfall and flooding.  The work resulted in a report launched in January 2021. 55)\n- \u00b7 Rewarding  damage  prevention :  We  actively  communicate with our customers, encouraging damage  prevention measures, such as securing property during periods prone to flooding\n\n## Measurements and measurement parameters\n\n- \u00b7 Share of insurance premiums from electric car insurance: 18,8 per cent in 2020\n- \u00b7 Our suppliers should have set targets for emissions cuts in the short and long term by 2025\n- \u00b7 All suppliers must be climate neutral by 2025\n\n71",

Absence due to illness was 2.3 per cent in Norway and  1.8  per  cent  in  the  Swedish  business.  Storebrand  has  been an 'inclusive workplace' (IA) company since 2002, and the Group's managers have over the years built up routines for the follow-up of employees who are ill. All managers with Norwegian employees must  complete  a  mandatory  HSE  course,  in  which  following  up illness is part of the training.\n\nThere were no (zero) injuries to a staff member in 2020. No damage to property was reported, and no accidents were otherwise reported in the Storebrand Group in 2020.\n\nStorebrand's work on gender equality, human  resources management,  working  environment  and  ethical  regulations  is described in more detail in the chapters People and Keeping our house in order.

In 2020,  each  employee  was  given  the  opportunity  to  buy  shares in  Storebrand  and  almost  half  of  the  Storebrand's  employees purchased a total of 384,670 shares.\n\n## Foreign ownership\n\nAs  at  31  December  2020,  foreign  ownership  totalled  56.6  per cent, compared to 56.2 per cent at the end of the 2019.\n\n## Trading volume for shares in Storebrand In 2020, 585\n\nmillion shares were traded, compared to 335 million shares in 2019. The trading volume in monetary terms was NOK 30,552 million in 2020, up from NOK 21,348 million in 2019. In relation to the average number of shares, the turnover rate for shares in Storebrand was 125 per cent.\n\n## Share price performance\n\nShares  in  Storebrand  yielded  a  total  return  of  -7.0  per  cent in  2020.  In  the  same  period,  the  Oslo  Stock  Exchange's  OSEBX Index  ended  at  4.6  per  cent,  whereas  the  European  Insurance Index  Beinsur  yielded  a  total  return  of  -7.9  per  cent  for  the corresponding period, measured in NOK.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nStorebrand's  dividend  policy  sates  that  the  aim  is  to  pay  an ordinary dividend of more than 50 per cent of the group result after tax and at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends will be paid at a solvency margin of more than 150 per cent. If the solvency margin is above 180 per cent, the  Board  intends  to  propose  special  dividends  or  share  buy backs.\n\n## Capital gains taxation\n\nDividends  are  subject  to  tax  for  personal  shareholders.  The shareholder  model  entails  that  share  dividends  after  the deduction for risk-free return shall be multiplied by an adjustment factor of 1.44. This amount is taxed at the capital income tax rate (22 per cent), which gives an effective tax rate of 31.68 per cent on dividends. Deduction for risk-free return in the individual year is the share's input value (plus any previously unused deduction) multiplied by a risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate will  be  set  by  the  Directorate of Taxes in January the year after the income year. Only when a dividend that exceeds the total deduction for risk-free return will the dividend be subject to tax.\n\n## Storebrand share\n\n|                                                   | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2016    | 2015    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Highest closing price (NOK)                       | 74.24   | 73.98   | 75.20   | 70.45   | 47.1    | 35.98   |\n| Highest closing price (NOK)                       | 34.73   | 50.86   | 59.48   | 46.97   | 28.45   | 23.21   |\n| Closing price on 31/12 (NOK)                      | 64.20   | 69.02   | 61.64   | 66.9    | 45.92   | 34.95   |\n| Market cap 31/12 (NOK million)                    | 30,034  | 32,289  | 28,836  | 31,296  | 20,660  | 15,724  |\n| Annual turnover (1000s of shares)                 | 585,004 | 335,202 | 445,614 | 427,632 | 589,322 | 707,870 |\n| Average daily turnover (1000s of shares)          | 2,321   | 1,346   | 3,094   | 2,450   | 2,780   | 2,820   |\n| Annual turnover (NOK million                      | 30,552  | 21,348  | 30,477  | 25,359  | 21,249  | 20,907  |\n| Rate of turnover (%)                              | 125.1   | 71.7    | 95.3    | 94.9    | 131     | 157.3   |\n| Number of ordinary shares 31/12 (1000s of shares) | 467,814 | 467,814 | 467,814 | 467,814 | 449,910 | 449,910 |\n| Earnings per ordinary share (NOK)                 | 5.02    | 4.43    | 7.89    | 5.28    | 4.73    | 2.63    |\n| Dividend per ordinary share (NOK)                 | 3.25    | 0       | 3.0     | 2.1     | 1.55    | 0       |\n| Total return (%)                                  | -7.0    | 16.8    | -4.7    | 49.1    | 31.4    | 19.7    |",

The cash flows show the overall change in means of payment over the year.\n\n## Operating activities\n\nA substantial part of the activities in a financial group will be classified as operating. All receipts and payments from insurance activities are included from the insurance companies, and these cash flows are invested in financial assets that are also defined as operating activities. One subtotal is generated in the statement that shows the net cash flow from operations before financial assets and banking customers, and one subtotal that shows the cash flows from financial assets and banking customers. This shows that the composition of net cash flows from operational activities for a financial group includes cash flows from both operations and investments in financial assets. The life insurance companies' balance sheets include substantial items linked to the insurance customers that are included on the individual lines in the cash flow analysis. Since the cash flow analysis is intended to show the change in cash flow for the company, the change in bank deposits for insurance customers is included on its own lines in operating activities to neutralise the cash flows associated with the customer portfolio in life insurance.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nIncludes cash flows for holdings in group companies and tangible fixed assets.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nFinancing activities include cash flows for equity, subordinated loans and other borrowing that helps fund the Group's activities. Payments of interest on borrowing and payments of share dividends to shareholders are financial activities.\n\n## Cash/cash equivalents\n\nCash/cash equivalents are defined as claims on central banks and loans to and claims from financial institutions. The amount does not include claims on financial institutions linked to the insurance customers portfolio, since these are liquid assets that are not available for use by the Group.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 1: Company information and accounting policies\n\n## 1. Company information\n\nStorebrand ASA is a Norwegian public limited company that is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements for 2020 were approved by the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA on 9 February 2021.\n\nThe Storebrand Group offers a comprehensive range of insurance and asset management services, as well as securities, banking and investment services, to private individuals, companies, municipalities, and the public sector. The Storebrand Group consists of the business areas Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pensions and Other. The Group's head office is located at Professor Kohts vei 9, in Lysaker, Norway.\n\n## 2. Basis for preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are described below.  The policies are applied consistently to similar transactions and to other events involving similar circumstances. There is no required use of uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and this exemption is applied for insurance contracts in the consolidated financial statements. This is discussed in section 14.\n\nStorebrand ASA's consolidated financial statements are presented using EU-approved International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related interpretations, as well as other Norwegian disclosure requirements laid down in legislation and regulations.\n\n## Use of estimates when preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the management to make judgements, estimates and as assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, the notes to the financial statements and information on potential liabilities. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 for further information.\n\n## 3. Summary of significant accounting policies for material items on the balance sheet\n\nFor the most part, the asset side of the Group's balance sheet comprises financial instruments and investment properties and a differentiation is made between assets in the company portfolio (shareholders) and assets belonging to the customer portfolio. This split is due to the fact that the Group has a significant life insurance business in which customer assets must be kept separate from the company's assets.\n\n## Financial instruments - IFRS 9\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39, and was generally applicable from 1 January 2018. However, for insurance-dominated groups and companies, IFRS 4 allows for the implementation of IFRS 9 to be deferred until implementation of IFRS 17. The Storebrand Group qualifies for temporary deferral of IFRS 9 because over 90 per cent of the Group's total liabilities as at 31 December 2015 were linked to the insurance businesses. For the Storebrand Group, IFRS 9 will be implemented together with IFRS 17, which is expected to be applicable from 1 January 2023.\n\nThe Storebrand Group has conducted a provisional analysis of the classification and measurement of financial instruments in accordance with the present IAS 39 for the transition to IFRS9, based on the current business model for the individual instruments. For debt instruments that are expected to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through total comprehensive income upon transition to IFRS9, a SPPI ('Solely payment of principal and interest') test is carried out. This is a provisional categorisation under IFRS9, based on the present asset allocation. No assessments have been made of any changes in classification and measurement of financial assets under IFRS9 in connection with the transition to IFRS17.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nA large majority of the financial assets are measured at fair value (the fair value option is used), whilst other financial instruments that are included in the categories Loans and receivables and Held to maturity are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are largely related to Norwegian pension liabilities with annual interest rate guarantee.\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value.\n\nIntangible assets comprise excess value relating to insurance contracts and customer relations acquired in connection with a business combination and acquired and self-developed IT solutions. This excess value is measured at acquisition cost less annual amortisation and write-downs.\n\nFor the most part, the liabilities side of the Group's balance sheet comprises financial instruments (liabilities) and provisions relating to future pension and insurance payments (insurance liabilities). With the exception of derivatives, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\n\nInsurance liabilities must be adequate and cover liabilities relating to issued insurance contracts. Various methods and principles are used in the Group when assessing the reserves for different insurance contracts. A considerable part of the insurance liabilities relate to insurance contracts with interest guarantees. The recognised liabilities related to Norwegian insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates are discounted by the basic interest rate (which corresponds to the guaranteed return/interest rate) for the respective insurance contracts.\n\nThe recognised liabilities related to the Swedish insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates in the subsidiary SPP are discounted by an observable market interest rate and by an estimated market interest rate for terms to maturity when no observable interest rate is available and corresponds essentially to the same interest rate that is used in the solvency calculations.\n\nIn the case of unit-linked insurance contracts, reserves for the savings element in the contracts will correspond to the value of related asset portfolios.\n\nDue to the fact that the customers' assets in the life insurance business (guaranteed pension) have historically yielded a return that has exceeded the increased value in guaranteed insurance liabilities, the excess amount has been set aside as customer buffers (liabilities), including in the form of additional reserves, value adjustment reserve and conditional bonus.\n\nInsurance liabilities include Incurred But Not Settled (IBNS) reserves, which consist of amounts reserved for claims either incurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet settled (Incurred But Not Reported 'IBNR' and Reported But Not Settled 'RBNS'). IBNS reserves are included in the premium reserve.\n\nIBNS reserves are measured using actuarial models based on historical information about the portfolio.\n\n## 4. Changes in accounting policies\n\nNew accounting standards that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements have not been implemented in 2020. For changes in estimates, see Note 2 for further information.\n\n## 5. New IFRS that have not entered into force\n\nNew standards and changes in standards that have not come into effect:\n\n## IFRS 17\n\nIFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and introduces new requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of issued insurance contracts. The standard has not been approved by the EU, but is expected to be applicable from 1 January 2023. The purpose of the new standard is to establish uniform practices for the accounting treatment of insurance contracts.\n\nIFRS 17 is a comprehensive and complex standard, with fundamental differences to the present standard for measuring liabilities and recognising earnings. Insurance contracts must be recognised at the risk-adjusted present value of future cash flows, with the addition of unearned profit in a group of contracts (Contractual Service Margin = CSM). Loss-making contracts must be recognised immediately.\n\nAs a starting point, IFRS 17 must be retrospectively applied, but modified retrospective transition method or application is permitted or application based on the fair value on the transition date if retrospective application is impracticable.\n\nThe implementation date is 1 January 2023, with a requirement that comparable figures are stated.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nStorebrand is working on preparing for implementation of IFRS17, including assessing the effects implementation of IFRS17 will have for Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere are no other new or changed accounting standards that have not entered into force that are expected to have a significant effect on Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 6. Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Storebrand ASA and companies controlled by Storebrand ASA. Minority interests are included in the Group's equity, unless there are options or other conditions that entail that minority interests are classified as liabilities.\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS, Storebrand Asset Management AS, Storebrand Bank ASA and Storebrand Forsikring AS are significant subsidiaries owned directly by Storebrand ASA. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS also owns the Swedish holding company Storebrand Holding AB, which in turn owns SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (publ). On acquiring the Swedish operations in 2007, the authorities instructed Storebrand to make an application to maintain a group structure by the end of 2009. Storebrand has filed an application to maintain the existing group structure. A controlling interest in Skagen AS was acquired in 2017 and is owned by Storebrand Asset Management AS. The Norwegian authorities have granted Storebrand an exemption from the requirement to organise equivalent businesses in the same company. This exemption expires in 2022.\n\nInvestments in associated companies (normally investments of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the company's equity) in which the Group exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures are recognised in accordance with the equity method. Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are initially recognised at acquisition cost.\n\nStorebrand consolidates certain funds in the Group's balance sheet when the requirement for control has been met. This encompasses funds in which Storebrand has an ownership interest of approximately 40 per cent or more, which are managed by companies in the Storebrand Group. In the Group's accounts, such funds are consolidated fully in the balance sheet, and the non-controlling interests are shown on a line for assets and on a corresponding line for liabilities. The non-controlling interests can demand redemption of their ownership interests and, as a result of this, they are classified as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements of Storebrand.\n\n## Currencies and translation of foreign companies' accounts\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is Norwegian kroner. Foreign companies that are part of the Group and have different functional currencies are converted to Norwegian kroner. Translation differences are included in the total comprehensive income.\n\n## Elimination of internal transactions\n\nInternal receivables and payables, internal gains and losses, interest, dividends and similar between companies in the Group are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the customer portfolios and the company portfolio in the life insurance business and between the customer portfolios in the life insurance business and other companies in the Group will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The reason for this is that the result in the customer portfolio is assigned to the customers each financial year and must not influence the result and equity of the company. Pursuant to the life insurance regulations, transactions with customer portfolios are carried out at fair value.\n\n## 7. Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method is applied when accounting for acquisition of businesses. The consideration is measured at fair value. The direct acquisition expenses are expensed when they arise, with the exception of expenses related to raising debt or equity (new issues).\n\nWhen making investments in subsidiaries, including purchasing investment properties, a decision is made as to whether the purchase constitutes acquisition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3. When such acquisitions are not regarded as an acquisition of a business, the acquisition method pursuant to IFRS 3 is not applied. Among other things, this does not entail provisions for deferred tax such as for business combinations.\n\n## 8. Segment information\n\nThe segment information is based on the internal financial reporting structure of the most senior decision-maker. At Storebrand, the executive management is responsible for following-up and evaluating the results of the segments and is defined as the most senior decision-maker. Four segments are reported for:\n\n- \u00b7 Savings\n- \u00b7 Insurance\n- \u00b7 Guaranteed Pension\n- \u00b7 Other",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThere are some differences between the result lines used in the income statement and the segment results. The Group's income statement includes gross income and costs linked to both the insurance customers and owners (shareholders). The segment results only include result elements relating to owners (shareholders) which are the result elements that the Group has performance measures and follow-up for.\n\nFinancial services provided between segments are priced at market terms. Services provided from joint functions and staff are charged to the different segments based on supply agreements and distribution keys.\n\n## 9. Income recognition\n\n## Premium income\n\nNet premium income includes the year's premiums written (including savings elements, administration premium, fees for issuing Norwegian interest rate guarantees and profit element risk), premium reserves transferred and ceded reinsurance. Annual premiums are generally accrued on a straight-line basis over the coverage period.\n\n## Income from properties and financial assets\n\nIncome from properties and financial assets are described in Sections 12 and 13.\n\n## Other income\n\nFees are recognised when the income can be measured reliably and is earned. Return-based revenues and performance fees are recognised when the uncertainty associated with the income is no longer present. Fixed fees are recognised as income in line with delivery of the service.\n\n## 10. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAdded value when acquiring a business that cannot be directly attributable to assets or liabilities on the date of the acquisition is classified as goodwill on the balance sheet. Goodwill is measured at acquisition cost on the date of the acquisition and classified as an intangible asset.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised, instead it is tested for impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually when assessing the recoverable amount or if there are indications that impairment has occurred. Goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition so that it can subsequently be tested for impairment. If the discounted cash flow for the cash-generating unit(s) that goodwill is allocated to is lower than the recognised value, goodwill will be written down. Reversal of an impairment loss for goodwill is prohibited even if information later comes to light showing that there is no longer a need for the write-down or the impairment loss has been reduced.\n\nIntangible assets with limited useful economic lives are measured at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and any write downs. The useful life and amortisation method are measured each year. With initial recognition of intangible assets in the balance sheet, it must be demonstrated that probable future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group. The acquisition cost of the asset must also be reliably estimated. The value of an intangible asset is tested for impairment when there are indications that its value has been impaired, normally by the related cash-generating unit(s) being tested Intangible assets are otherwise subject to write-downs and reversals of write-downs in the same manner as described for tangible fixed assets.\n\n## 11. Adequacy test for insurance liabilities and related excess values\n\nA liability adequacy test must be conducted of the insurance liability pursuant to IFRS 4 each time the financial statements are presented. The test conducted in Storebrand's consolidated financial statements is based on the Group's calculation of capital.\n\n## 12. Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between well-informed, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Income from investment properties consists of both changes in fair value and rental income.\n\nInvestment properties primarily consist of centrally located office buildings, shopping centres and logistics buildings. Investment properties are properties leased to tenants outside the Group. In the case of properties partly occupied by the Group for its own use and partly let to tenants, the identifiable tenanted portion is treated as an investment property. All properties are measured at fair value and the changes in value are allocated to the customer portfolios.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 13. Financial instruments\n\n## 13-1. General policies and definitions\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet from such time Storebrand becomes party to the instrument's contractual terms and conditions. General purchases and sales of financial instruments are recorded on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is initially recognised in the financial statements, it is valued at fair value. Initial recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the date of acquisition or issue of the financial asset/liability if the financial asset/liability is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flow from the financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised in the balance sheet when they cease to exist, i.e. once the contractual liability has been fulfilled, cancelled or has expired.\n\nMeasurement of impairment and doubtful financial assets\n\nFor financial assets carried at amortised cost, an assessment is made on each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets have incurred losses.\n\nIf there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not occurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate calculated at initial recognition). The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nLosses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.\n\n## 13-2. Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified into one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets held for trading\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option (FVO)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets held to maturity\n- \u00b7 Financial assets, loans and receivables\n\n## Held for trading\n\nA financial asset is classified as held for trading if:\n\n- \u00b7 it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the short term,\n- \u00b7 is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking, or\n- \u00b7 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.\n\nWith the exception of derivatives, only a limited proportion of Storebrand's financial assets fall into this category.\n\nFinancial assets held for trading are measured at fair value at the reporting date, Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.\n\nAt fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option (FVO).\n\nA significant proportion of Storebrand's financial instruments are classified in the category of fair value through profit or loss because:\n\n- \u00b7 such classification reduces the mismatch in the measurement or recognition that would otherwise arise as a result of the different rules for measuring assets and liabilities, or\n- \u00b7 the financial assets form part of a portfolio that is managed and reported on a fair value basis\n\nThe accounting is equivalent to that of the held for trading category (the instruments are measured at fair value and changes in value are recognised in the income statement).",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Investments held to maturity\n\nHeld to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity and that a company has the intention and ability to hold to maturity, with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 assets that are designated upon initial recognition as assets at fair value through profit or loss, or\n- \u00b7 assets that are defined as loans and receivables.\n\nAssets held to maturity are recognised at amortised costs using the effective interest method. The category is used in the Norwegian life insurance business for assets linked to insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees.\n\n## Loans and receivables\n\npayments that are not quoted in an active market, with the exception of assets that the company intends to sell immediately or in the near term that are classified as held for trading and those that the company upon initial recognition designates at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nLoans and receivables are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The category is used in the Norwegian life insurance business linked to insurance contracts with a guaranteed interest rate, and in the banking business.\n\nLoans and receivables that are designated as hedged items are subject to measurement under the hedge accounting requirements.\n\n## 13-3. Derivatives\n\n## Accounting treatment of derivatives that are not hedging\n\nDerivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are recognised as financial instruments held for trading. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe majority of the derivatives used routinely for asset management fall into this category.\n\nSome of the Group's insurance contracts contain embedded derivatives such as interest rate guarantees. These insurance contracts do not follow the accounting standard IAS 39 Financial Instruments, but instead follow the accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and the embedded derivatives are not continually measured at fair value.\n\n## 13-4. Hedge accounting\n\n## Fair value hedging\n\nStorebrand uses fair value hedging for the interest rate risk. The items hedged are financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Cash flow hedging\n\nSome borrowing in foreign currency is hedged by means of hedging instruments (derivatives). Storebrand uses cash flow hedging of the foreign exchange risk on the principal amount and foreign exchange risk for the credit margin. The net ongoing changes in value in the hedging instrument that is considered effective hedging are recognised in total comprehensive income and the non-effective share is recognised through profit or loss.\n\nStorebrand has selected early implementation of 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform-Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7' (IBOR Reform) that was issued in September 2019. In accordance with the transitional rules, the amendments have been subsequently applied to hedging arrangements that existed at the start of the reporting period or were identified thereafter and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve on that date. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific requirements for hedge accounting of hedging arrangements that are directly affected by the IBOR reform. This has the effect that the IBOR reform will not generally result in the conclusion of hedge accounting. However, all hedge ineffectiveness will still be recognised in the income statement. The stipulated amendments also determine when the relaxation of the rules shall no longer apply, which includes the uncertainty resulting from the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform no longer existing. See the discussion in Note 41.\n\n## Hedging of net investments\n\nHedging of net investments in foreign businesses is recognised in the accounts in the same way as cash flow hedging. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument that relate to the effective part of the hedging are recognised through total comprehensive income, while gains",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nand losses that relate to the ineffective part are recognised in the income statement. The total loss or gain in equity is recognised in the income statement when the foreign business is sold or wound up.\n\n## 13-5. Financial liabilities\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities that are not derivatives are primarily measured at amortised cost using an effective interest method.\n\n## 14. Insurance liabilities\n\nThe accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts addresses the accounting treatment of insurance contracts. Storebrand's insurance contracts fall within the scope of this standard. IFRS 4 is a temporary standard until IFRS 17 is to be used. IFRS 4 allows the use of non-uniform principles for the treatment of insurance contracts in consolidated financial statements. In the consolidated financial statements, the insurance liabilities in the respective subsidiaries are included as these are calculated on the basis of the laws of the individual countries. This also applies to insurance contracts acquired via business combinations. In such cases, positive excess values are capitalised as assets.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 4, provisions for insurance liabilities must be adequate. When assessing the adequacy associated with recognised acquired insurance contracts, reference must also be made to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and Solvency II calculations.\n\nAn explanation of the accounting policies for the most important insurance liabilities can be found below.\n\n## 14-1. General - life insurance\n\n## Claims for own account\n\nClaims for own account comprise claims settlements paid out, less reinsurance received, premium reserves transferred to other companies, and reinsurance ceded.\n\n## Changes in insurance liabilities\n\nChanges in insurance liabilities comprise premium savings that are taken to income under premium income and payments, as well as changes in provisions for future claims This item also includes added guaranteed returns on the premium reserve and the premium fund, as well as returns to customers beyond the guaranteed returns.\n\n## Insurance liabilities (premium reserve)\n\nThe premium reserve represents the present value of the company's total expected insurance liabilities, including future administration costs in accordance with the individual insurance contracts, after deducting the present value of agreed future premiums. In the case of individual account policies with flexible premium payments, the total policy value is included in the premium reserve. The premium reserve is equivalent to 100 per cent of the guaranteed surrender or transfer value of insurance contracts prior to any fees for early surrender or transfer and the policies' share of the market value adjustment reserve.\n\nThe premium reserve is calculated using the same assumptions  as those used to calculate premiums for the individual insurance contracts, i.e. assumptions  about mortality and disability rates, interest rates and costs. Premium tariffs are based on the observed level of mortality and disability in the population with the addition of security margins that include expected future developments in this respect.\n\nThe premium reserve includes reserve amounts for future administration costs for all lines of insurance including settlement costs (administration reserve). In the case of paid-up contracts, the present value of all future administration costs is allocated in full to the premium reserve. In the case of contracts with future premium payments, a deduction is made for the cash value of the proportion of future administration costs expected to be financed by future premium receipts.\n\nA substantial proportion of the Norwegian insurance contracts have a one-year interest rate guarantee, meaning that the guaranteed return must be achieved every year. In the Swedish business, there are no contracts with an annual interest rate guarantee, but there are insurance contracts with a terminal value guarantee.\n\n## Insurance liabilities, special investments portfolio\n\nInsurance liabilities associated with the value of the special investments portfolio must always equal the value of the investments portfolio assigned to the contract. The proportion of profit in the risk result is included. The company is not exposed to investment risk on customer assets, since the customers are not guaranteed a minimum return. The only exception is in the event of death, when the beneficiaries are repaid the amount originally paid in for annuity insurance and for guaranteed account (Garantikonto).",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## IBNS reserves\n\nIncluded in the premium reserve for insurance risk are provisions for claims either occurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet settled. IBNR are reserves for potential future payments when Storebrand has yet to be informed about whether an instance of disability, death or other instance entailing compensation has occurred. Since Storebrand is neither aware of the frequency nor the amount payable, IBNR is estimated using actuarial models based on historical information about the portfolio. Correspondingly, RBNS is a provision for potential future payments when Storebrand has knowledge of the incident, but has not settled the claim. Actuarial models based on historical information are also used to estimate the reserves.\n\n## Transfers of premium reserves, etc. (transfers)\n\nTransfers of premium reserves resulting from transfers of policies between insurance companies are recorded in the profit and loss account as net premiums for own account in the case of reserves received and claims for own account in the case of reserves paid out. The recognition of costs and income takes place on the date the insured risk is ceded. The premium reserve in the insurance liabilities is reduced/increased on the same date. The premium reserve transferred includes the policy's share of additional statutory reserves, the market value adjustment reserve, conditional bonus and the profit for the year. Transferred additional reserves are not shown as part of premium income, but are reported separately as changes in insurance liabilities. Transferred amounts are classified as current receivables or liabilities until the transfer takes place.\n\n## Selling costs\n\nAll selling costs in the Norwegian life insurance business are expensed, whilst in the Swedish subsidiaries, parts of the selling costs are recorded in the balance sheet and amortised over the expected duration of the contract.\n\n## 14-2. Life insurance - Norway\n\n## Additional statutory reserves\n\nThe company is allowed to make allocations to the additional statutory reserves to ensure the solvency of its life insurance business. These additional reserves are divided among the contracts and can be used to cover a negative interest result up to the interest rate guarantee. In the event that the company does not achieve a return that equals the interest rate guarantee in any given year, the allocation can be reversed from the contract to enable the company to meet the interest rate guarantee. This will result in a reduction in the additional statutory reserves and a corresponding increase in the premium reserve for the contract. For allocated annuities, the additional statutory reserves are paid in instalments over the disbursement period.\n\nThe additional statutory reserves cannot exceed 12 per cent of the premium reserve. If the limit is exceeded, the excess amount is assigned to the contract as surplus.\n\n## Premium fund, deposit reserve and pensioners' surplus fund\n\nThe premium fund contains premiums prepaid by policyholders as a result of taxation regulations for individual and group pension insurance and allocated profit shares. The contribution fund contains payments and deposits for employees who have been members for less than 12 months. Credits and withdrawals are not recognised through the income statement but are taken directly to the balance sheet.\n\nThe pensioners' surplus fund comprises surplus assigned to the premium reserve in respect of pensions in group payments. The fund is applied each year as a single premium payment to secure additional benefits for pensioners.\n\n## Market value adjustment reserve\n\nThe current year's net unrealised gains/losses on financial assets at fair value in the group portfolio are allocated to or reversed from the market value adjustment reserve in the balance sheet asTotaling the portfolio has a net unrealised excess value. The portion of the current year's net unrealised gains/losses on financial current assets denominated in foreign currencies that can be attributed to fluctuations in exchange rates is not transferred to the market value adjustment reserve. The foreign exchange fluctuations associated with investments denominated in foreign currencies are largely hedged through foreign exchange contracts on a portfolio basis. Similarly, the change in the value of the hedging instrument is not transferred to the market value adjustment reserve, but is charged directly to the profit and loss account. Pursuant to accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS 4) the market value adjustment reserve is shown as a liability.\n\n## Risk equalisation reserve\n\nUp to 50 per cent of the positive risk result for group pensions and paid-up policies can be allocated to the risk equalisation fund to cover",

The risk equalisation reserve is not considered to be a liability according to IFRS and is included as part of the equity (undistributable equity).\n\n## 14-3. Life insurance Sweden\n\n## Life insurance liabilities\n\nThe life insurance liabilities are estimated as the present value of the expected future guaranteed payments, administrative expenses and taxes, discounted by the current risk-free interest rate. Insurance reserves with guaranteed interest rates in SPP use a marked-based yield curve. A real discount curve is used for risk insurance within the defined-contribution portfolio. For endowment insurance within the defined-benefit and defined-contribution portfolios, as well as sickness insurance in the defined-benefit portfolio, the provisions are discounted using the nominal yield curve. As a starting point, the applicable discount rate is determined based on the methods used for the discount rate in Solvency II.\n\nWhen calculating the life insurance liabilities, the estimated future administrative expenses that may reasonably be expected to arise and can be attributed to the existing insurance contracts are taken into account. The expenses are estimated according to the company's own cost analyses and are based on the actual operating costs during the most recent year. Projection of the expected future costs follow the same principles on which Solvency II is based. Any future cost-rationalisation measures are not taken into account.\n\n## Conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution\n\nThe conditional bonus arises when the value of customer assets is higher than the present value of the liabilities, and thus covers the portion of the insurance capital that is not guaranteed. In the case of contracts where customer assets are lower than liabilities, the owners' result is charged via deferred capital contribution allocations. The conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution are recognised on the same line in the balance sheet as part of the buffer capital.\n\n## 14-4. P&C insurance\n\nCosts related to insurance claims are recognised when the claims occur. The following allocations have been made:\n\nReserve for unearned premium for own account concerns on-going policies that are in force at the time the financial statements were closed and is intended to cover the contracts' remaining risk period.\n\nThe claims reserve is a reserve for expected claims that have been reported, but not settled (RBNS). The reserve also covers expected claims for losses that have been incurred, but have not been reported (IBNR) at the expiry of the accounting period. In addition, claims reserves shall include a separate provision for future claims on losses that have not been settled.\n\n## 15. Pension liabilities for own employees\n\nStorebrand has country-specific pension schemes for its employees. The schemes are recognised in the accounts in accordance with IAS 19. In Norway, Storebrand has a defined-contribution pension. Storebrand is a member of the Norwegian contractual early retirement (AFP) pension scheme. The Norwegian AFP scheme is regarded as a defined-benefit scheme, but there is insufficient quantitative information to be able to estimate reliable accounting obligations and costs.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP has agreed, in accordance with the Finance Companies' Service Pension Plan (BTP Plan), to collective, defined-benefit pension plans for its employees. A group defined-benefit pension implies that an employee is guaranteed a certain pension based on the pay scale at the time of retirement on termination of the employment.\n\n## 15-1. Defined-benefit scheme\n\nPension costs and pension obligations for defined-benefit pension schemes are determined using a linear accrual formula and expected final salary as the basis for the entitlements, based on assumptions  about the discount rate, future salary increases, pensions and National Insurance benefits, future returns on pension plan assets as well as actuarial estimates of mortality, disability and voluntary early leavers. The net pension cost for the period comprises the total of the accrued future pension entitlements during the period, the interest cost on the calculated pension liability and the calculated return on pension plan assets.\n\nActuarial gains and losses and the impact of changes in assumptions  are recognised in total comprehensive income during the period in which they arise. Employees who resign before reaching retirement age or leave the scheme will be issued ordinary paid-up policies.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 15-2. Defined-contribution scheme\n\nA defined-contribution pension scheme involves the Group in paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The Group does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. Defined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the financial statements.\n\n## 16. Tangible fixed assets and intangible assets\n\nThe Group's tangible fixed assets comprise equipment, fixtures and fittings, IT systems and properties used by the Group for its own activities.\n\nEquipment, inventory and IT systems are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and any write-downs.\n\nProperties used for the Group's own activities are measured at appreciated value less accumulated depreciation and write-downs. The fair value of these properties is tested annually in the same way as described for investment properties. The increase in value for buildings used by the Group for its own activities is recognised through total comprehensive income. Any write-down of the value of such a property is recognised first in the revaluation reserve for increases in the value of the property in question. If the write-down exceeds the revaluation reserve for the property in question, the excess is expensed over the profit and loss account.\n\nThe write-down period and method are reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period being used both correspond to the useful economic life of the asset. The disposal value is similarly reviewed. Properties are split into components if different parts have different useful economic lives. The depreciation period and method of depreciation are measured then separately for each component.\n\nThe value of a tangible fixed asset is tested when there are indications that its value has been impaired. The impairment test is carried out for each asset if the asset primarily has independent, inward cash flows, or possibly a larger cash-generating unit. Any impairment losses are charged to the income statement as the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs of sale and the value in use.  On each reporting date it is determined as to whether there is a basis for reversing previous impairment losses on non-financial assets.\n\n## 17. Tax\n\nThe Group's tax liabilities are valued in accordance with IAS 12 and clarifications in IFRIC 23.\n\nThe tax cost in the income statement consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in total comprehensive income. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on the basis of the Group's tax loss carryforward, deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences.\n\nAny deferred tax assets shall be recognised if it is considered probable that the tax asset will be recovered. Assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax are recognised as a net amount when there is a legal right to offset assets and liabilities for tax payable and the Group has the ability and intention to settle net tax payable.\n\nChanges in assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax that are due to changes in the tax rate are generally recognised in the income statement.\n\nReference is made to Note 26 - Tax for further information.\n\n## 18. Provision for dividends\n\nThe proposed dividend is classified as equity until approved by the general meeting and presented as liabilities after this date. The proposed dividend is not included in the calculation of the solvency capital.\n\n## 19. Leases\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet. The present value of the combined lease payments shall be recognised on the balance sheet as debt and an asset that reflects the right of use of the asset during the lease period. Storebrand has chosen to classify the right to use",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nthe asset as tangible fixed assets and the lease liability as other debt. The recognised asset is amortised over the lease period and the depreciation expense is recognised as an operating expense on an ongoing basis. The interest expense on the lease liability is recognised as a financial expense. Leases with a duration of less than 12 months and leases that include assets valued at less than approximately NOK 50,000 will not be recognised in the balance sheet, but rental amounts will be recognised as an operating expense over the lease period.\n\n## 20. Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared using the direct method and shows cash flows grouped by sources and use. Cash is defined as cash, receivables from central banks and receivables from credit institutions with no agreed period of notice.\n\n## 21. Biological assets\n\nPursuant to IAS 41, investments in forestry are measures as biological assets. Biological assets are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. Changes in the value of biological assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. Ownership rights to biological assets are recognised on the date of transfer pursuant to the purchase agreement. Annual income and expenses for forestry and uncultivated land are recognised.\n\n## Note 2: Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements the management are required to apply estimates, make discretionary assessments and apply assumptions  for uncertain amounts. The estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and expectations of future events and represent the management's best judgement at the time the financial statements were prepared.\n\nA description of the most important elements and assessments in which discretion is used and which may influence recognised amounts or key figures is provided below and in Note 13 for Solvency II and in Note 26 for Tax.\n\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of higher than expected payments and/or unfavourable changes in the value of an insurance liability due to the actual development differing from what was expected when premiums or provisions were calculated.\n\nIn the consolidated accounts, insurance liabilities with a guaranteed interest rate are included, but using different principles in the Norwegian and the Swedish activities. An immaterial asset (value of business in-force - VIF) linked to the insurance contracts in the Swedish activities is also included. This asset originated from Storebrand's purchase of the insurance business. There are several factors that may have an impact on the size of the insurance liabilities including VIF, such as biometric factors relating to higher life expectancy, future returns and invalidity, as well as the development of future costs and legal aspects, such as amendments to legislation and judgments handed down in court cases, etc.\n\nIn the long term, a low interest rate will represent a challenge for insurance contracts with a guaranteed interest rate and, together with a reduced customer buffer, may have an impact on the amount recorded that is linked to the insurance contracts. The Norwegian insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates are discounted at the premium calculation rate (around 3.2 per cent). The Swedish insurance liabilities with guaranteed interest rates have been discounted by a yield curve that coincides with the Solvency II yield curve.\n\nIn the Norwegian business, a significant share of the insurance contracts have annual interest rate guarantees. Changes in estimates and valuations may entail a change in the return on the customer portfolios. Depending on the size of any impairment in value, such impairment may be offset by a reduction in the market value adjustment reserve and additional statutory reserves, so that the effect on the owner's result may be limited. Correspondingly, increases in values could, to a large extent, increase the size of such funds.\n\nIn the Swedish business, there are no contracts with an annual interest rate guarantee, but there are insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees which enable them to receive a guaranteed terminal value. These contracts are discounted by a market-based calculated interest rate where parts of the yield curve used are not liquid. Changes in the discount rate may have a significant impact on the size of the insurance liabilities and impact the result. If the associated customer assets have a higher value than the recognised value of these insurance liabilities, then the difference will represent a conditional customer allocated fund - conditional bonus (buffer capital).

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nin the assumptions  for future cost, mortality and other biometric assumptions  may also have a significant impact on the recognised insurance liabilities. Changes in estimates and valuations may entail a change in the return on the customer portfolios. Depending on the size of any impairment in value, such impairment may be offset by a reduction in the conditional bonus, so that the effect on the owner's result may be limited. If the value of the individual insurance contract is higher than the associated customer assets, the owner will have to cover the deficient capital.\n\nFurther information about insurance liabilities is provided in Notes 7, 38 and 39.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. The commercial real estate market in Norway and Sweden is not particularly liquid, nor is it transparent. Uncertainty will be linked to the valuations, and they require exercise of professional judgement, especially in periods with turbulent finance markets.\n\nKey elements included in valuations that require exercising judgement are:\n\n- \u00b7 Market rent and vacancy trends\n- \u00b7 Quality and duration of rental income\n- \u00b7 Owners' costs\n- \u00b7 Technical standard and any need for upgrading\n- \u00b7 Discount rates for both certain and uncertain cash flows, as well as residual value\n\nExternal valuations are also obtained for parts of the portfolio every quarter. All properties must have a minimum of one external valuation during a 3 year period.\n\nReference is also made to Note 12 in which the valuation of investment properties at fair value is described in more detail.\n\n## Financial instruments at fair value\n\nThere will be some uncertainty associated with the pricing of financial instruments, particularly instruments that are not priced in an active market. This is particularly true for the types of securities priced on the basis of non-observable assumptions , and for these investments various valuation techniques are applied in order to fix fair value. These include private equity investments, investments in foreign properties, and other financial instruments where theoretical models are used in pricing. Any changes to the assumptions  could affect recognised amounts. The majority of such financial instruments are included in the customer portfolio.\n\nThere is uncertainty linked to the valuation of fixed-rate loans recorded at fair value, due to variation in the interest rate terms offered by banks and since individual borrowers often have different credit risks.\n\nReference is also made to Note 12, in which the valuation of financial instruments at fair value is described in more detail.\n\n## Covid-19\n\n2020 has been influenced by developments relating to the spread of the Coronavirus. From the latter part of February and throughout March, the pandemic and the consequences of shutdowns in both Norway and globally, resulted to financial turmoil, with falling share prices, increased credit spreads, reduced interest rates and lower earnings for many financial assets. Together with lower oil prices, these conditions also resulted in a significant weakening of the Norwegian krone. Increased unemployment has had a negative impact on the disability insurance results and necessitated the strengthening of reserves. It is uncertain as to how the present situation will develop going forward. Assisted by political measures, the financial market, and particularly the stock market, strengthened in the second half of the year. The final months of the year were characterised by both another wave of infections in a number of countries, but there has also been positive news regarding the testing of potential vaccines. Storebrand has a risk management system which, through principles that have been adopted, manages and mitigates the impact of volatile financial markets.\n\nStorebrand increased its insurance liabilities in the first quarter of 2020 based on the expected impact of the Covid-19 virus. The situation was closely monitored in the following three quarters of 2020, and no significant impact on the reserves due to Covid-19 was observed. The development of insurance liabilities will depend on future scenarios and is currently more uncertain than usual. Storebrand will continue to monitor the development of Covid-19 and its effects on the economy. A long-term situation with high unemployment may result in higher levels of disability and increased liabilities. However, the current insurance liabilities represent Storebrand's best estimate of the insurance liabilities.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nCovid-19 and the uncertain macroeconomic situation mean that there is greater uncertainty relating to several estimates at the end of 2020 than was the situation prior to the start of the pandemic. There is still major uncertainty about the spread of Covid-19 and the consequences for society. There is thus also increased uncertainty regarding cash flows associated with financial instruments and investment properties that are priced based on level 3 calculations, as well as estimated expected losses on lending.\n\n## Deferred tax and uncertain tax positions\n\nCalculation of deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and the income tax expense is based on the interpretation of rules and estimates.\n\nThe Group's business activities may give rise to disputes, etc. related to tax positions with an uncertain outcome. The Group makes provisions for uncertain and disputed tax positions with best estimates of expected amounts, subject to decisions by the tax authorities in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. The provisions are reversed if the disputed tax position is decided to the benefit of the Group and can no longer be appealed.\n\nReference is made to further information in Note 26.\n\n## Note 3: Acquisitions\n\nOn 14 August 2020, Storebrand Forsikring AS entered into an agreement with Insr Insurance Group ASA (Insr) to acquire customer portfolios from Insr. Storebrand Forsikring AS acquired the right and obligation to renew insurance agreements from Insr's portfolios.\n\nThe transition process for customers from Insr to Storebrand will take place gradually over a 12-month period from the renewal date for the customers, starting on 1 December 2020. Storebrand will pay consideration to Insr of 20-30% of renewed premiums, and has pledged to pay a minimum of NOK 70 million no later than six months after the end of the renewal period.\n\nThis transaction will be recognised under intangible assets in the balance sheet as the purchase of customer lists in line with the gradual transfer, and will not be recognised as a business combination.\n\n## Note 4: Pro/fit by segments\n\nStorebrand's operation includes the segments Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pension and Other.\n\n## Savings\n\nThe savings segment includes products for retirement savings with no interest rate guarantees. The segment consists of defined contribution pensions in Norway and Sweden, asset management and retail banking products. In addition, certain other subsidiaries in Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP are included in Savings.\n\n## Insurance\n\nInsurance has responsibility for the Group's risk products in Norway and Sweden. The unit provides health insurance in the Norwegian and Swedish corporate and retail markets, P&C insurance and personal risk products in the Norwegian and Swedish retail markets and employee-related and pension-related insurance in the Norwegian and Swedish corporate markets.\n\n## Guaranteed pension\n\nThe guaranteed Pension segment includes long-term pension saving products which provide customers a guaranteed rate of return. The area includes defined benefit pensions in Norway and Sweden, paid-up policies and individual capital and pension insurances.",

Appendix\n\n## Other\n\nThe result for the holding company Storebrand ASA is reported under Other, as well as the result for the company portfolios and small subsidiaries of Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP. In addition, this business is included in Euroben and the minority of the securities fund. The elimination of intra-group transactions that have been included in the other segments has also been included.\n\n## Reconciliation between the profit and loss statement and alternative statement of the result (segment)\n\nThe results in the segments are reconciled against the Group result before amortisation and write-downs of intangible assets. The Group's income statement includes gross income and costs linked to both the insurance customers and owners (shareholders). The alternative statement of the result only includes result elements relating to owners (shareholders) which are the result elements that the Group has performance measures and follow-up for. The result lines that are used in segment reporting will therefore not be identical with the result lines in the corporate profit and loss account. Below is an overall description of the most important differences.\n\nFee and administration income consists of fees and fixed administrative income.  In the Group's income statement, the item is classified as premium income, net interest income from bank or other income depending on the type of activity. The Group's income statement also includes savings elements for insurance contracts and possibly transferred reserve.\n\n## Price of return guarantee and profit risk (fee incomes)  - Storebrand Livsforsikring AS\n\nThe return guarantees in group pension insurance with a return guarantee must be priced upfront. The level of the return guarantee, the size of the buffer capital (additional statutory reserves and unrealised gains), and the investment risk of the portfolio in which the pensions assets are invested determine the price that the customer pays for his or her return guarantee. Return guarantees are priced on the basis of the risk to which the equity is exposed. The insurance company bears all the downside risk and must carry reserves against the policy if the buffer reserves are insufficient or unavailable.\n\nThe insurance result consists of insurance premiums and claims\n\nInsurance premiums consist of premium income relating to risk products (insurance segment) that are classified as premium income in the Group's income statement.\n\nClaims consist of paid-out claims and changes in provisions for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims reported but not settled (RBNS) relating to risk products that are classified as claims in the Group's income statement.\n\nAdministration costs consist of the Group's operating costs in the Group's income statement minus operating costs allocated to traditional individual products with profit sharing.\n\nFinancial items and risk result life and pensions include risk result life and pensions and financial result includes net profit sharing and Loan Losses.\n\nRisk result life and pensions consists of the difference between risk premium and claims for products relating to defined-contribution pension, unit linked insurance contracts (savings segment) and defined-benefit pension (guaranteed pension segment). Risk premium is classified as premium income in the Group's income statement.\n\nThe financial result consists of the return for the company portfolios of Storebrand ASA, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (Other segment), while returns for the other company portfolios in the Group are a financial result within the segment which the business is associated with.   Returns on company portfolios are classified as net income from financial assets and property for companies in the Group's income statement. The financial result also includes returns on customer assets relating to products within the insurance segment, and in the Group's income statement this item will be entered under net income from financial assets and property for customers. In the alternative income statement, the result before tax of certain unimportant subsidiaries is included in the financial result, while in the Group's income statement, this is shown as other income, operating costs and other costs.",

Appendix\n\n## Net profit sharing - Storebrand Livsforsikring AS\n\nA modified profit-sharing regime was introduced for old and new individual contracts that have left group pension insurance policies (paid-up policies), which allows the company to retain up to 20 per cent of the profit from returns after any allocations to additional statutory reserves. The modified profit-sharing model means that any negative risk result can be deducted from the customers' interest profit before sharing, if it is not covered by the risk equalisation fund.\n\nIndividual endowment insurance and pensions written by the Group prior to 1 January 2008 will continue to apply the profit rules effective prior to 2008. New contracts may not be established in this portfolio. The Group can retain up to 35 per cent of the total result after allocations to additional statutory reserves.\n\nAny negative returns on customer portfolios and returns lower than the interest guarantee that cannot be covered by additional statutory reserves must be covered by the company's equity and will be included in the net profit-sharing and losses line.\n\n## SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB\n\nFor premiums paid from and including 2016, previous profit sharing is replaced by a guarantee fee for premium-determined insurance (IF portfolio). The guarantee fee is annual and is calculated as 0.2 per cent of the capital. This goes to the company.\n\nFor contributions agreed to prior to 2016, the profit sharing is maintained, i.e. that if the total return on assets in one calendar year for a premium-determined insurance (IF portfolio) exceeds the guaranteed interest, profit sharing will be triggered. When profit sharing is triggered, 90 per cent of the total return on assets passes to the policyholder and 10 per cent to the company. The company's share of the total return on assets is included in the financial result.\n\nIn the case of defined-benefit contracts (KF portfolio), the company is entitled to charge an indexing fee if the group profit allows the indexing of the insurance. Indexing is allowed up to a maximum equalling the change in the conTotaler price index (CPI) between the previous two Septembers. Pensions that are paid out are indexed if the consolidated figures on 30 September exceed 107 per cent, and half of the fee is charged. The whole fee is charged if the consolidated figures on 30 September exceed 120 per cent, in which case paid-up policies can also be included. The total fee equals 0.8 per cent of the insurance capital.\n\nThe guaranteed liability is continuously monitored. If the guaranteed liability is higher than the value of the assets, a provision must be made in the form of a deferred capital contribution. If the assets are lower than the guaranteed liability when the insurance payments start, the company supplies capital up to the guaranteed liability in the form of a realised capital contribution. Changes in the deferred capital contribution are included in the financial result.\n\n## Loan losses:\n\nLoan losses consist of individual and group write-downs on lending activities that are on the balance sheet of Storebrand Bank Group. In the Group's income statement, the item is classified under loan losses. With regard to loan losses that are on the balance sheet of the Storebrand Livsforsikring Group, these will not be included on this line in either the alternative income statement or in the Group's income statement, but in the Group's income statement will be included in the item, net income from financial assets and property for customers.\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets includes depreciation and possible write-downs of intangible assets established through acquisitions of enterprises.",

Governance\n\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n\n10. Appendix\n\n## Note 5: Risk management and internal control\n\nStorebrand's income and performance are dependent on external factors that are associated with uncertainty. The most important external risk factors are the developments in the financial markets and changes in life expectancy in the Norwegian and Swedish populations. Certain internal operational factors can also result in losses, e.g. errors linked to the management of the customers' assets or payment of pension.\n\nContinuous monitoring and active risk management are core areas of the Group's activities and organisation. At the Storebrand Group, responsibility for risk management and internal control is an integral part of management responsibility.\n\n## Organisation of risk management\n\nThe Group's organisation of the responsibility for risk management follows a model based on three lines of defence. The objective of the model is to safeguard the responsibility for risk management at both company and Group level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Boards of directors of both Storebrand ASA and the group companies have the overall responsibility for limiting and following up the risks associated with the activities. The Boards set annual limits and guidelines for risk-taking in the company, receive reports on the actual risk levels, and perform a forward-looking assessment of the risk situation.\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA has established a Risk Committee consisting of 3 Board members. The main task of the Risk Committee is to prepare matters to be considered by the Board in the area of risk, with a special focus on the Group's appetite for risk, risk strategy and investment strategy. The Committee should contribute forward-looking, decision-making support related to the Board's discussion of risk taking, financial forecasts and the treatment of risk reporting.\n\nManagers at all levels in the company are responsible for risk management within their own area of responsibility.  Good risk management requires targeted work on objectives, strategies and action plans, identification and assessment of risks, documentation of processes and routines, prioritisation and implementation of improvement measures, and good communication, information and reporting.\n\n## Independent control functions\n\nIndependent control functions have been established for risk management for the business (Risk Management Function/Chief Risk Officer), for compliance with the regulations (Compliance Function), for ensuring the insurance liabilities are calculated correctly (Actuary Function), for data protection (Data Protection Officer), for money laundering (Anti Money Laundering) and for the bank's lending. Relevant functions have been established for both the Storebrand Group (the Group) and all of the companies requiring a licence. The independent control functions are organised directly under the companies' managing directors and report to the respective company's board.\n\nIn terms of function, the independent control functions are affiliated with Group Risk & Compliance (GRC), which is organised directly under the CEO and reports to the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA. GRC's task is to ensure that all significant risks are identified, measured and appropriately reported. The GRC function shall be actively involved in the development of the Group's risk strategy and maintain a holistic view of the company's risk exposure. This includes responsibility for ensuring compliance with the relevant regulations for risk management and the consolidated companies' operations.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThe internal audit function is organised directly under the Board and shall provide the Boards of the relevant consolidated companies with confirmation concerning the appropriateness and effectiveness of the company's risk management, including how well the various lines of defence are working.\n\n## Note 6: Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss due to inadequate or failing internal processes or systems, human error or external events. The definition includes the risk of loss or public sanctions as a result of non-compliance with external or internal rules.\n\nThe Group seeks to reduce operational risk through an effective system for internal control. Risks are followed up through the management's risk reviews, with documentation of risks, measures and the follow-up of incidents. In addition, Internal Audit carries out independent checks through audit projects adopted by the Board.\n\nContingency and continuity plans have been prepared to deal with serious incidents in business-critical processes.\n\nStorebrand's IT systems are vital for operations and reliable financial reporting. Errors and disruptions may have consequences for commercial operations and can impact on the trust the Group has from both customers and shareholders. In the worst case, abnormal situations can result in penalties from the supervisory authorities. Storebrand's IT platform is characterised by complexity and integration between different specialist systems and joint systems. The operation of the IT systems has largely been outsourced to different service providers. A management model has been established with close follow-up of providers and internal control activities in order to reduce the risk associated with the development, administration and operation of the IT systems, as well as information security. Storebrand is facing a major technological shift with the transition to cloud-based infrastructure. Risks increase in connection with the actual transformation, and the consequence of errors can be greater when services are provided online. At the same time, cloud-based services and infrastructure reduce the risk associated with self-developed systems and, in the long term, outdated infrastructure.   The asset management business has a modern and standardised core system, combined with self-developed applications. The bank platform and insurance platform are based on purchased standard systems that are operated and monitored through outsourcing agreements. There is a greater degree of own development for the life insurance activities, while parts of the operation of this have also been outsourced. The unit administration within defined-contribution occupational pension and unit linked products is managed in a purchased system solution.\n\n## Note 7: Insurance risk\n\nStorebrand offers traditional life and pension insurance as both group and individual contracts. Contracts are also offered in which the customer has the choice of investment.\n\nThe insurance risk in Norway is largely standardised for contracts within the same product category as a result of detailed regulation from the authorities. In Sweden, the framework conditions for insurance contracts entail major differences between the contracts within the same product category.\n\nThe insurance risk associated with an increase in life expectancy and thereby an increase in future pension payments (longevity) is the greatest risk for the Group. Other risks include disability risk and mortality risk. The life insurance risks are:\n\n- 1.  Long life expectancy - The risk of erroneously estimating life expectancy and future pension payments. Historical developments have shown that an increasing number of people attain retirement age and live longer as pensioners than was previously the case. There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding future mortality development. In the event of longer life expectancy beyond that assumed in the premium tariffs, there is also an increased risk of the owner's result having to be charged in order to cover necessary statutory provisions.\n- 2.  Disability - The risk of erroneous estimation of future illness and disability. There will be uncertainty associated with the future development of disability, including disability pensioners who are returned to the workforce.\n- 3.  Death - The risk of erroneous estimation of mortality or erroneous estimation of payment to surviving relatives. Over the last few years, a decrease in mortality and fewer young surviving relatives have been registered, compared with earlier years.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIn the Guaranteed Pensions segment, the Group has a significant insurance risk relating to estimation of life expectancy and future pension payments for group and individual insurance agreements. In addition, there is an insurance risk associated with estimates of disability and pensions left to spouses and/or children. The disability coverage in Guaranteed Pensions is primarily sold together with a retirement pension. The risk of mortality is low in Guaranteed Pensions when viewed in relation to other risks. In SPP it is possible to change the future premiums for the IF portfolio, reducing the risk significantly. In Norway it is also possible to change the future premiums of group policies, but only for new accumulation, entailing reduced risk. Occupational pension agreements (hybrid) are reported in the Guaranteed Pension segment when a customer has an agreement without a choice for investment of the pension assets. This is a small portfolio with limited insurance risk.\n\nIn the Savings segment the Group has a low insurance risk. The insurance risk is largely associated with death, with some long-life risk for paid-up policies with investment options. Occupational pension agreements (hybrid) are reported in the Guaranteed Pension segment when a customer has an agreement with a choice for investment of the pension assets. This is a small portfolio with limited insurance risk.\n\nIn the Insurance segment, the Group has an insurance risk associated with disability and death. In addition, there are insurance risks associated with occupational injury, critical illness, cancer insurance, child insurance, accident insurance and health insurance. For occupational injury, the risk is first and foremost potential errors in the assessment of the level of provisions, because the number of claim years can be up to 25 years. The insurance risk within critical illness, cancer, accident and health insurance is considered to be limited based on the volume and underlying volatility of the products. Within P&C insurance, the risk of house fire and personal injury for motor vehicle insurance constitute the main risks.\n\nThe Other segment also includes the insurance risk at Euroben, which offers pension products to Nordic companies, and the insurance risk is limited.\n\n## Description of products\n\n## Risk premiums and tariffs\n\nGuaranteed Pension\n\nGroup pension insurance schemes in Norway follow the premiums for traditional retirement and survivor coverage in the industry tariff K2013. The premiums for disability pensions are based on the company's own experience. Expense premiums are determined annually with a view to securing full cover for the next year's expected costs.\n\nFor individual insurance in Norway, the premiums for death risk and long life expectancy risk are based on tariffs produced by insurance companies on the basis of their shared experience. This applies to both endowment and pension insurance. Disability premiums are based on the company's own experience.\n\nThe risk premium for group insurance in Sweden is calculated as an equalised premium within the insurance group, based on the group distribution of age and gender, as well as the requirement for coverage of next of kin. The risk premium for individual insurance is determined individually and is based on age and gender.\n\nSPP's mortality assumptions  are based on the general mortality tariff DUS14, adjusted for the company's own observations.\n\nThe new public service occupational pension entered into force from 2020 and includes retirement pensions in the public sector. The new scheme is a premium pension and is a net pension that is known from the private sector. Premium pension means that the pension is accrued each year based on the employee's salary. This is as opposed to the previous schemes whereby the pension was calculated based on the final salary. The premium pension ensures a life-long retirement pension, and the retirement pension can be fully or partly withdrawn from and including the age of 62 until and including the age of 75. Payment of the pension will start at the age of 75 regardless. Members who are not entitled to an AFP are given a conditional occupational pension as a supplement to the retirement pension.\n\n## Insurance\n\nTariffs for group life insurance and certain risk insurances within group pensions also depend on the industry or occupation, in addition to age and gender. Group life insurance also applies tariffs based on claims experience. The company's tariff for group life insurance, both for life and disability cover, is based on the company's own experience.",

The tariffs for all individual endowment policies are based on the company's own experiences.\n\nFor P&C insurance (occupational injury, property and motor vehicle) the tariffs are based on the company's own experiences.\n\n## Management of insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk is monitored separately for every line of insurance in the current insurance portfolio. The development of the risk results is followed throughout the year. For each type of risk, the ordinary risk result for a period represents the difference between the risk premiums the company has collected for the period and the Total of provisions and payments that must be made for insured events that occur in the period. The risk result takes into account insured events that have not yet been reported, but which the company, on the basis of experience, asTotales have occurred.\n\nWhen writing individual risk cover, the customer is subject to a health check. The result of the health check is reflected in the level of premium quoted. When arranging group policies with risk cover, all employees of small companies are subject to a health check, while for companies with many employees a declaration of fitness for work is required. In the assessment of risk, the company's business category, sector and sickness record are also taken into account.\n\nLarge claims or special events constitute a major risk for all products. The largest claims will typically be in the group life, occupational injury and personal injury (motor vehicle accidents) segments.\n\nThe company manages its insurance risk through a variety of reinsurance programmes. Through catastrophe reinsurance (excess of loss), the company covers losses (single claims and reserves provisions) where a single event causes more than two deaths or disability cases. This cover is also subject to an upper limit. A reinsurance agreement for life policies covers death and disability risk that exceeds the maximum risk amount for own account the company practises.  The company's maximum risk amount for own account is relatively high, and the risk reinsured is therefore relatively modest.\n\nThe company also manages its insurance risk through international pooling. This implies that multinational corporate customers can equalise the results between the various units internationally. Pooling is offered for group life and risk cover within group pensions.\n\n## Risk result\n\nThe risk result consists of premiums the company charges to cover insurance risks less the actual costs in the form of insurance reserves and payments for insured events such as death, pensions, disability and accidents.\n\nThe table below specifies the risk result for the largest entities in the Group and also states the effect of reinsurance and pooling on the result. The risk result in the table shows the total risk result for distribution to customers and owner (the insurance company).\n\n## SPECIFICATION OF RISK RESULT\n\n|                   |   Storebrand Livsforsikring AS |   Storebrand Livsforsikring AS | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB   |   SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| NOK million       |                           2020 |                           2019 | 2020                          |                          2019 |\n| Survival result   |                              7 |                            -58 | 54                            |                           -39 |\n| Death result      |                            243 |                            416 | 23                            |                            19 |\n| Disability result |                            -26 |                            443 | 134                           |                            92 |\n| Reinsurance       |                              5 |                              2 |                               |                            -1 |\n| Pooling           |                            -44 |                             22 | -26                           |                           -14 |\n| Other             |                            -33 |                           -101 | 1                             |                            -4 |\n| Total risk result |                            153 |                            724 | 186                           |                            53 |",

Appendix\n\n## Adequacy test\n\nIn accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, the insurance liabilities that are included shall be adequate and a liability adequacy test shall be performed. Storebrand satisfies the adequacy tests for 2020, and these therefore had no impact on the results in the financial statements for 2020.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nThe volatility of the risk results depends on the development in disability and mortality relative to expectations. The different contracts at Storebrand come with different risks, however when calculating volatility, the starting point is the same changes since the development in, for example, disability, is assumed to be the same across the contracts. To indicate the sensitivity of the annual result, an expected 5% increase in claims for disability and mortality respectively is used as a basis, where mortality consists of the risks of death and longevity.\n\n## STOREBRAND LIVSFORSIKRING AS\n\n|             | Guaranteed pension        | Guaranteed pension      | Guaranteed pension   | Guaranteed pension    | Guaranteed pension   | Insurance         | Insurance           | Insurance   | Insurance   | Insurance   |\n|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| NOK million | Defined  benefit  pension | Occupa- tional  pension | Paid-up  policies    | Individual  insurance | Total                | Group  disability | Non-life  insurance | Group life  | Total       | Total       |\n| Death       | 4                         | 1                       | 49                   | 5                     | 59                   | -1                | -2                  | -19         | -22         | 37          |\n| Disability  | -4                        |                         | -14                  | -4                    | -22                  | -40               | -4                  | -26         | -70         | -92         |\n\nThe net effect of increased claims for disability will result in a reduction in the disability risk result of NOK 14 million for paid-up policies and NOK 40 million for group disability pensions. Correspondingly, an increase in mortality claims will reduce the death risk result for group life by NOK 19 million, and for paid-up policies, the risk result for mortality will be improved by NOK 49 million.\n\nIt varies as to how the gross effects above are recognised in the company's income statement. The business rules define buffer capital and other factors which entail that a negative risk result for the pension products may be covered by the risk equalisation fund, provided that this is sufficient. Equivalently, up to 50% of the positive risk result will be added to the risk equalisation fund, while other positive risk results will pass to the customers. For group disability pensions, group life and personal risk, the risk results pass in their entirety to Storebrand, while the risk result for individual insurance policies are included in the profit sharing between the customers and Storebrand.\n\n## SPP PENSION & F\u00d6RS\u00c4KRING AB\n\n| SEK million   |   Defined   contribution | Defined       benefit   |   Total |\n|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| Death         |                        8 | 17                      |      25 |\n| Disability    |                        2 |                         |       2 |\n\nPart of the change in disability and waiver of premiums is covered by pooling and reinsurance, and SPP's effect on result is expected to be approximately 95 per cent. The change in increased longevity and mortality have their full impact in SPP's result.\n\n## Note 8: Financial market risk\n\nMarket risk means changes in the value of assets as a result of unexpected volatility or changes in prices on the financial markets. It also refers to the risk that the value of the insurance liability develops differently to that of the assets as a result of changes in interest rates.\n\nThe most significant market risks for Storebrand are interest rate risk, share market risk, property price risk, credit risk, and exchange rate risk.",

Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nFor the life insurance companies, the financial assets are invested in a variety of sub-portfolios. Market risk affects Storebrand's income and profit differently in the different sub-portfolios. There are three main types of sub-portfolio: company portfolios, customer portfolios without a guarantee (unit linked insurance) and customer portfolios with a guarantee.\n\nThe market risk in the company portfolios has a direct impact on the profit.\n\nThe market risk in unit linked insurance is at the customers' risk, meaning Storebrand is not directly affected by changes in value. Nevertheless, changes in value do affect Storebrand's profit indirectly. Income is based largely on the size of the reserves, while the costs tend to be fixed. Lower than expected returns in the financial market will therefore have a negative effect on Storebrand's future income and profit.\n\nFor customer portfolios with a guarantee, the net risk for Storebrand will be lower than the gross market risk. The extent of measures to reduce risk depends on several factors, the most important being the size and flexibility of the customer buffers and level and duration of the return guarantee. If the investment return is not sufficient to meet the guaranteed interest rate, the shortfall may be met by using customer buffers built up from previous years' surpluses.\n\nFor guaranteed customer portfolios, the risk is affected by changes in the interest rate level. Falling interest rates are positive for the investment return in the short term due to price appreciation for bonds and interest rate swaps, but negative in the long term because it reduces the probability of achieving a return higher than the guarantee. Both short and long-term money market rates fell significantly in Norway in 2020. Long-term rates have fallen in Sweden, while short-term money market rates have remained stable at close to zero.\n\nThe composition of the assets within each sub-portfolio is determined by the company's investment strategy. The investment strategy also establishes guidelines and limits for the company's risk management, credit exposure, counterparty exposure, currency risk, use of derivatives, and requirements regarding liquidity.\n\n## ASSET ALLOCATION\n\n|                          | Customer portfolios  with guarantee   | Customer portfolios  without guarantee   | Company  portfolios   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Properties at fair value | 11%                                   | 2%                                       |                       |\n| Bonds at amortised cost  | 36%                                   |                                          | 26%                   |\n| Money market             | 3%                                    | 4%                                       | 13%                   |\n| Bonds at fair value      | 24%                                   | 14%                                      | 59%                   |\n| Equities at fair value   | 10%                                   | 79%                                      |                       |\n| Loans at amortised cost  | 16%                                   | 1%                                       | 2%                    |\n| Other                    |                                       |                                          | 1%                    |\n| Total                    | 100%                                  | 100%                                     | 100%                  |\n\nStorebrand aims to take low financial risk for the company portfolios, and most of the funds are invested in short and medium-term fixed income securities with low credit risk.\n\nThe financial risk related to customer portfolios without a guarantee is borne by the insured person, and the insured person can choose the risk profile. Storebrand's role is to offer a good, broad range of funds, to assemble profiles adapted to different risk profiles, and to offer systematic reduction of risk towards retirement age. The most significant market risks are share market risk and exchange rate risk.\n\nThe most significant market risks facing guaranteed customer portfolios are linked to equity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and property price risk. Risk management during the turmoil in the financial markets in the first quarter resulted in a decrease in equity exposure. This has since increased, which means that the investment allocation at the end of 2020 had not changed significantly from the start of the year. In Norway, most of the credit risk is linked to securities, which are carried at amortised cost. This significantly reduces the risk to the company's result because the result is not normally influenced by market fluctuations. The exception is if there is a loss event.",

For customers who have large customer buffers, investments are made with higher market risk that give increased expected returns. Equity risk is also managed by means of dynamic risk management, the objectives of which are to maintain good risk-bearing capacity and to adjust the financial risk to the buffer situation and the company's financial strength. By exercising this type of risk management, Storebrand expects to create good returns both for individual years and over time.\n\nFor company portfolios and guaranteed customer portfolios, most of the assets that are in currencies other than the domestic currency are hedged. This limits the currency risk from the investment portfolios.\n\nForeign exchange risk primarily arises as a result of investments in international securities, including as a result of ownership in SPP.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the value of assets and results from the Swedish operations are affected by changes in the value of the Swedish krone. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS has hedged parts of the value of SPP through forward foreign exchange contracts and borrowings in Swedish kroner.\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES\n\n|                                   | Balance sheet items exclu- ding currency derivatives   | Forwad contracts   | Net position     |             |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| NOK million DKK                   | Net in balance sheet 200                               | Net sales -325     | in currency -127 | in NOK -176 |\n| CHF                               | 93                                                     | -134               | -41              | -398        |\n| HKD                               | 210                                                    | -931               | -721             | -797        |\n| CAD                               | 174                                                    | -279               | -105             | -703        |\n| EUR                               | 1,082                                                  | -1,221             | -147             | -1,454      |\n| GBP                               | 106                                                    | -203               | -98              | -1,139      |\n| JPY                               | 296                                                    | -413               | -117             | -969        |\n| SEK                               | 234,093                                                | -9,559             | 224,301          | 234,084     |\n| USD                               | 4,135                                                  | -5,184             | -1,070           | -9,161      |\n| NOK 1)                            | 39,005                                                 | -1,487             | 37,518           | 37,518      |\n| Other currency types              |                                                        |                    |                  | -144        |\n| Insurance liabilities in SEK      | -224,197                                               |                    | -224,197         | -233,735    |\n| Total net currency positions 2020 |                                                        |                    |                  | 22,927      |\n| Total net currency positions 2019 |                                                        |                    |                  | 7,080       |\n\n1) Equity and bond funds denominated in NOK with foreign currency exposurein i.a.

The currency exposure is primarily related to investments in the Norwegian and Swedish insurance business.\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring:\n\nThe company hedges most of the foreign exchange risk in the customer portfolios on an ongoing basis. Foreign exchange risk exists primarily as a result of investments in international securities, as well as subordinated loans in a foreign currency to a certain extent. Hedging is performed by means of forward foreign exchange contracts at the portfolio level, and the currency positions are monitored continuously against a total limit. Negative currency positions are closed out no later than the day after they arose. In addition, separate limits have been defined so that active currency positions can be taken.\n\n## SPP:\n\nSPP uses currency hedging for its investments to a certain degree. Currency exposure may be between 0 and 30 per cent in accordance with the investment strategy",

New premiums were taken in with a basic interest rate of 2.0 per cent, and pensions were adjusted upwards with a basic interest rate of 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe percentage distribution of the insurance reserves by the various basic annual interest rates as at 31 December is as follows:\n\n| Interest rate   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| 6 %             | 0.3 %  | 0.3 %  |\n| 5%              | 0.3 %  | 0.3 %  |\n| 4%              | 42.9 % | 44.4 % |\n| 3.4 %           | 0.3 %  | 0.3 %  |\n| 3%              | 28.8 % | 29.0 % |\n| 2.75 %          | 1.8 %  | 1.8 %  |\n| 2.50 %          | 10.9 % | 11.0 % |\n| 2.00 %          | 12.2 % | 11.2 % |\n| 1.50 %          | 0.1 %  |        |\n| 0.50 %          | 1.6 %  | 1.3 %  |\n| 0%              | 0.9 %  | 0.5 %  |\n\nThe table includes premium reserve excluding IBNS\n\n| Average interest rate guarantee in per cent   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Individual endowment insurance                | 2.6 %  | 2.6 %  |\n| Individual pension insurance                  | 3.8 %  | 3.8 %  |\n| Group pension insurance                       | 2.4 %  | 2.5 %  |\n| Paid-up policy                                | 3.3 %  | 3.3 %  |\n| Group life insurance                          | 0.2 %  | 0.1 %  |\n| Total                                         | 3.1 %  | 3.2 %  |\n\nThe table includes premium reserve including IBNS\n\nThere is a 0 per cent interest rate guarantee for premium funds, defined-contribution funds, pensioners' surplus funds and additional statutory reserves.\n\nThe interest rate guarantee must be fulfilled on an annual basis. If the company's investment return in any given year is lower than the guaranteed interest rate, the equivalent of up to one year's guaranteed return for the individual policy can be covered by transfers from the policy's additional statutory reserves.\n\nTo achieve adequate returns with the present interest rates, it is necessary to take an investment risk. This is primarily done by investing in shares, property and corporate bonds.\n\nInterest rate risk is in a special position because changes in interest rates also affect the fair value of the insurance liability for the solvency calculation. Since pension disbursements may be many years in the future, the insurance liability is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the Norwegian business, greater interest rate sensitivity from the investments will entail increased risk that the return is below the guaranteed level. The risk management must therefore balance the risk of the profit for the year (interest rate increase) with the reinvestment risk if interest rates fall below the guarantee in the future. Bonds at amortised cost are an important risk management tool.",

Appendix\n\n## SPP Pension & Insurance\n\nThe guaranteed interest rate is determined by the insurance company and is used when calculating the premium and the guaranteed benefit. The guaranteed interest rate does not entail that there is an annual minimum guarantee for the return as is the case in Norway.\n\nNew premiums in individual defined-contribution pensions (IF) have a guarantee of 1.25% for 85% of the premium. Group defined-benefit pension (KF) is closed to new members.\n\nSPP bears the risk of achieving a return equal to the guaranteed interest on the policyholders' assets over time and that the level of the contracts' assets is greater than the present value of the insurance liabilities. For IF, profit sharing becomes relevant in SPP if the return exceeds the guaranteed yield. The contracts' buffer capital must be intact in order for profit sharing to represent a net income for SPP. In the case of KF, a certain degree of consolidation, i.e. that the assets are greater than the present value of the liabilities by a certain percentage, is required in order for the owner to receive profit-sharing income (indexing fee).\n\nIf the assets in an insurance contract in the company are less than the market value of the liability, an equity contribution is allocated that reflects this value shortfall. This is termed a deferred capital contribution (DCC), and changes in DCC are recognised in the profit and loss account as they occur. When the contracts' assets exceed the present value of the liabilities, a buffer, which is termed the conditional bonus, is established. Changes in this customer buffer are not recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n| Interest rate   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| 5.20 %          | 12.1 % | 12.7 % |\n| 4,5%-5,2%       | 0.4 %  | 0.4 %  |\n| 4.00 %          | 4.5 %  | 3.7 %  |\n| 3.00 %          | 47.4 % | 48.8 % |\n| 2,75%-4,0%      | 5.0 %  | 5.4 %  |\n| 2.70 %          | 0.1 %  | 0.1 %  |\n| 2.50 %          | 5.9 %  | 6.2 %  |\n| 1.60 %          | 0.0 %  | 0.0 %  |\n| 1.50 %          | 1.9 %  | 2.6 %  |\n| 1.25 %          | 4.2 %  | 4.1 %  |\n| 1,25% *         | 9.7 %  | 7.6 %  |\n| 0,5%-2,5%       | 3.5 %  | 4.0 %  |\n| 0.00 %          | 5.4 %  | 4.1 %  |\n\n- * 1,25 per cent on 85 per cent of the premium\n\n| Average interest rate guarantee in per cent   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Individual pension insurance                  | 3.0 %  | 3.1 %  |\n| Group pension insurance                       | 2.6 %  | 2.6 %  |\n| Individual occupational pension insurance     | 3.1 %  | 3.1 %  |\n| Total                                         | 3.0 %  | 2.9 %  |\n\nIn the Swedish operations management of interest rate risk is based on the principle that the interest rate risk from assets shall approximately correspond to the interest rate risk from the insurance liabilities.",

Appendix\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nThe tables show the fall in value for Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP's investment portfolios as a result of immediate changes in value related to financial market risk. The calculation is model-based and the result is dependent on the choice of stress level for each category of asset. The stresses have been applied to the company portfolio and guaranteed customer portfolios as at 31 December 2020. The effect of each stress changes the return in each profile.\n\nUnit linked insurance without a guaranteed annual return is not included in the analysis. For these products, the customers bear the market risk and the effect of a falling market will not directly affect the result or buffer capital.\n\nThe amount of stress is the same that is used for the company's risk management.  Two stress tests have been defined. Stress test 1 is a fall in the value of shares, corporate bonds and property in combination with lower interest rates. Stress test 2 is a somewhat smaller fall in the value of shares, corporate bonds and property in combination with higher interest rates.\n\n## Level of stress\n\n|                                      | Stresstest 1   | Stresstest 2   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Interest level (parallel shiftt)     | -100bp         | +100bp         |\n| Equity                               | -20 %          | - 12 %         |\n| Property                             | - 12 %         | - 7 %          |\n| Credit spread (share of Solvency II) | 50 %           | 30 %           |\n\nBecause it is the immediate market changes that are calculated, dynamic risk management will not affect the outcome. If it is assumed that the market changes occur over a period of time, then dynamic risk management would reduce the effect of the negative outcomes and reinforce the positive to some extent.\n\nAs a result of customer buffers, the effect of the stresses on the result will be lower than the combined change in value in the table. As at 31 December 2020, the customer buffers were of such a size that the effects on the result were significantly lower.\n\n## Stresstest 1\n\n|                    | Storebrand Livsforsikring   | Storebrand Livsforsikring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Sensitivity        | NOK million                 | Share of portfolio          | NOK million                | Share of portfolio         |\n| Interest rate risk | 4,275                       | 2.0 %                       | -150                       | -0.2 %                     |\n| Equtiy risk        | -2,447                      | -1.1 %                      | -2,162                     | -2.3 %                     |\n| Property risk      | -2,585                      | -1.2 %                      | -1,224                     | -1.3 %                     |\n| Credit risk        | -1,007                      | -0.5 %                      | -857                       | -0.9 %                     |\n| Total              | -1,764                      | -0.8 %                      | -4,392                     | -4.7 %                     |\n\n## Stresstest 2\n\n|                    | Storebrand Livsforsikring   | Storebrand Livsforsikring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Sensitivity        | NOK million                 | Share of portfolio          | NOK million                | Share of portfolio         |\n| Interest rate risk | -4,274                      | -2.0 %                      | 150                        | 0.2 %                      |\n| Equtiy risk        | -1,466                      | -0.7 %                      | -1,297                     | -1.4 %                     |\n| Property risk      | -1,506                      | -0.7 %                      | -714                       | -0.8 %                     |\n| Credit risk        | -603                        | -0.3 %                      | -514                       | -0.5 %                     |\n| Total              | -7,849                      | -3.7 %                      | -2,376                     | -2.5 %                     |",

Appendix\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring\n\nFor Storebrand Livsforsikring it is stress test 2, which includes an increase in interest rates, that makes the greatest impact. The overall market risk is NOK 7.8 billion, which is equivalent to 3.7 per cent of the investment portfolio.\n\nIf the stress causes the return to fall below the guarantee, it will have a negative impact on the result if the customer buffer is not adequate. Other negative effects on the result are a lower return from the company portfolio and that there is no profit sharing from paid-up policies and individual contracts.\n\n## SPP Pension & Insurance\n\nFor SPP it is stress test 1, which includes a fall in interest rates, that creates the greatest impact. The overall market risk is SEK 4.4 billion, which is equivalent to 4.7 per cent of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe buffer situation for the individual contracts will determine if all or portions of the fall in value will affect the financial result. Only the portion of the fall in value that cannot be settled against the customer buffer will be charged to the result. In addition, the reduced profit sharing or loss of the indexing fees may affect the financial result.\n\n## Other operations\n\nThe other companies in the Storebrand Group are not included in the sensitivity analysis, as there is little market risk in these areas. The equity of these companies is invested with little or no allocation to high-risk assets, and the products do not entail a direct risk for the company as a result of price fluctuations in the financial market.\n\n## Note 9: Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the company is unable to fulfil its obligations without incurring substantial additional expenses in the form of reduced prices for assets that must be realised, or in the form of especially expensive financing.\n\nFor the insurance companies, the life insurance companies in particular, the insurance liabilities are long-term and the cash flows are generally known long before they fall due. In addition, liquidity is required to handle payments related to operations, and there are liquidity needs related to derivative contracts. The liquidity risk is handled by liquidity forecasts and the fact that portions of the investments are in very liquid securities, such as government bonds. The liquidity risk is considered low based on these measures.\n\nLiquidity risk is one of the largest risk factors for the banking business, and the regulations stipulate requirements for liquidity management and liquidity indicators. The guidelines for liquidity risk specify principles for liquidity management, and limits stipulated by the Board for different minimum liquidity and financing indicators. In addition to this, an annual funding strategy and funding plan are being drawn up that set out the overall limits for the bank's funding activities.\n\nSeparate liquidity strategies have also been drawn up for other subsidiaries in accordance with the statutory requirements. These strategies specify limits and measures for ensuring good liquidity and a minimum allocation to assets that can be sold at short notice. The strategies define limits for allocations to various asset types and mean the companies have money market investments, bonds, equities and other liquid investments that can be disposed of as required.\n\nIn addition to clear strategies and the risk management of liquidity reserves in each subsidiary, the Group's holding company has established a liquidity buffer. The development of the liquid holdings is continuously monitored at the Group level in relation to internal limits. A particular risk is the fact that during certain periods the financial markets can be closed for new borrowing. Measures for minimising the liquidity risk are to maintain a regular maturity structure for the loans, low costs, an adequate liquidity buffer and credit agreements with banks which the company can draw on if necessary.",

This risk also includes losses on lending and losses related to the failure of counterparties to fulfil their financial derivative contracts.\n\nThe maximum limits for credit exposure to individual counterparties and for overall credit exposure to rating categories are set by the Boards of the individual companies in the Group. Particular attention is paid to ensuring diversification of credit exposure in order to avoid concentrating credit exposure on any particular debtors or sectors. Changes in the credit standing of debtors are monitored and followed up. Thus far, the Group has used published credit ratings wherever possible, supplemented by the company's own credit evaluation.\n\nUnderlying investments in funds managed by Storebrand are included in the tables.\n\n## CREDIT RISK BY COUNTERPARTY\n\n## BONDS AND OTHER FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE\n\n| Category by issuer  or guarantor NOK million            | AAA Fair value   | AA Fair value   | A Fair value   | BBB Fair value   | NIG Fair value   | Not rated Fair value   | Total Fair value   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Government and  government  guaranteed bonds            | 26,568           | 12,787          | 236            | 13               | 18               |                        | 39,622             |\n| Corporate bonds                                         | 22,782           | 6,127           | 31,945         | 39,723           | 5,650            | 1                      | 106,228            |\n| Structured notes                                        |                  |                 |                | 29               | 6                |                        | 35                 |\n| Collateralised securities                               | 7,639            | 233             |                | 12               |                  |                        | 7,883              |\n| Total interest bearing  securities stated by  rating    | 56,989           | 19,147          | 32,182         | 39,776           | 5,675            | 1                      | 153,769            |\n| Bond funds not managed by Storebrand                    |                  |                 |                |                  |                  |                        | 20,847             |\n| Non-interest bearing  securities managed by  Storebrand |                  |                 |                |                  |                  |                        | 2,379              |\n| Total 2020                                              | 56,989           | 19,147          | 32,182         | 39,776           | 5,675            | 1                      | 176,995            |\n| Total 2019                                              | 47,403           | 22,073          | 25,805         | 27,505           | 734              | 5,832                  | 156,639            |\n\n## INTEREST BEARING SECURITIES AT AMORTISED COST\n\n| Category of issuer or  guarantor  NOK million   | AAA Fair value   | AA Fair value   | A Fair value   | BBB Fair value   | NIG Fair value   | Not rated Fair value   | Total Fair value   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Government and govern- ment guaranteed bonds    | 11,327           | 14,637          | 3,092          |                  |                  |                        | 29,056             |\n| Corporate bonds                                 | 17,552           | 11,750          | 21,855         | 19,441           | 15,130           |                        | 85,728             |\n| Structured notes                                |                  | 172             |                |                  | 9,005            |                        | 9,177              |\n| Collateralised securities                       | 1,602            |                 |                |                  |                  |                        | 1,602              |\n| Total 2020                                      | 30,481           | 26,559          | 24,947         | 19,441           | 24,135           |                        | 125,562            |\n| Total 2019                                      | 37,016           | 24,952          | 44,411         | 12,905           |                  | 3,028                  | 122,312            |",

The home loans are approved and administered by Storebrand Bank, but a significant share of the loans have been transferred to Storebrand Livsforsikring as a part of the investment portfolio. Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP also have loans to companies as part of the investment portfolio. Storebrand Bank's corporate market segment has largely been discontinued.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, Storebrand had loans to customers totalling NOK 63.2 billion net after provisions for losses of NOK 0.1 billion. Of this, NOK 13.9 billion was to the corporate market and NOK 49.4 billion to the retail market.\n\nThe corporate market portfolio consists of income generating properties and development properties with few customers and low level of default that are primarily secured by mortgages in commercial property.\n\nIn the retail market, most of the loans are secured by means of home mortgages. Customers are evaluated according to their capacity and intent to repay the loan. In addition to their capacity to service debt, checks are conducted of customers in relation to policy rules and they are given a credit rating.\n\nThe weighted average loan-to-value ratio for home loans is approximately 57 per cent. Over 97 per cent of home loans have a loan to value ratio within 85 per cent and approximately 99.2 per cent are within a 100 per cent loan to value ratio. Approximately 56 per cent of the home loans are within a 60 per cent LVR. The portfolio is considered to have a low credit risk.\n\n## TOTAL COMMITTMENTS BY REMAINING TERM\n\n|                          | 2020                                        | 2020       | 2020                | 2020                 | 2019                                        | 2019       | 2019                | 2019                 |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| NOK million              | Loans to  and receiva- bles from  customers | Guarantees | Unused  credit line | Total  commit- ments | Loans to  and receiva- bles from  customers | Guarantees | Unused  credit line | Total  commit- ments |\n| Up to one month          | 9                                           |            | 2                   | 12                   | 20                                          |            | 5                   | 25                   |\n| 1 - 3 months             | 553                                         |            | 32                  | 586                  | 259                                         |            | 23                  | 282                  |\n| 4 months - 1 year        | 2,060                                       |            | 172                 | 2,232                | 806                                         |            | 121                 | 928                  |\n| 2 -5 years               | 10,267                                      |            | 609                 | 10,876               | 10,639                                      |            | 758                 | 11,397               |\n| More than 5 years        | 50,423                                      |            | 2,311               | 52,734               | 48,995                                      |            | 2,248               | 51,243               |\n| Total gross  commitments | 63,312                                      |            | 3,128               | 66,440               | 60,719                                      | 1          | 3,155               | 63,875               |\n\nCommitments are regarded as non-performing and loss exposed when a credit facility has been overdrawn for more than 90 days and when an instalment loan has arrears older than 90 days and the amount is at least NOK 2000.\n\n## CREDIT RISKS BY CUSTOMER GROUPS\n\n| NOK million                       |   Gross non-  performing  commitments |   Individual   write-downs |   Net non-  performing  commit-ments | Total recognised  value changes  during the period   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sale and operation of real estate |                                    22 |                          9 |                                   13 |                                                      |\n| Wage-earners and others           |                                    98 |                          8 |                                   90 | -3                                                   |\n| Others                            |                                     1 |                        -21 |                                    1 |                                                      |\n| Total 2020                        |                                   121 |                         -4 |                                  104 | -3                                                   |\n| Total 2019                        |                                   125 |                         11 |                                  105 | -1                                                   |\n\nIn the case of default, Storebrand Bank ASA will sell the securities or repossess the properties if this is most suitable.",

These risks are consolidated in the Storebrand Livsforsikring Group, which includes Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Livf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB. Other companies directly owned by Storebrand ASA that are exposed to significant risks are Storebrand Forsikring AS, Storebrand Helseforsikring AS, Storebrand Asset Management Group and Storebrand Bank Group.\n\nFor the life insurance businesses, the greatest risks are largely the same in Norway and Sweden. The financial market risk will depend significantly on global circumstances that influence the investment portfolios in all businesses. The insurance risk may be different for the various companies, and long life risk in particular can be influenced by universal trends.\n\nBoth the insurance business and the banking business are exposed to credit risk. The insurance business primarily has a credit risk relating to bonds with significant geographical and industry-related diversification, while the bank is mostly exposed to direct loans for residential property in Norway. There is no significant concentration risk across bonds and loans.\n\nThe financial market and investment risks are largely related to the customer portfolios in the life insurance business. The risk associated with a negative outcome in the financial market is described and quantified in Note 8, financial market risk. The banking business has little direct exposure to types of risk other than credit.\n\nIn the short term, an interest rate increase will negatively impact on the returns for the life insurance companies. An interest rate increase can also result in bank customers having lower debt-servicing capacity and increased losses for the banking business.\n\nThe risk from the P&C insurance and health insurance risk in Storebrand Skadeforsikring AS and Storebrand Helseforsikring AS has a low correlation with the risk from the rest of the businesses in the Group.\n\nIn the asset management business, the principal risk is operational risk in the form of behaviour that can trigger claims and/or impact on reputation. Since the asset management business is the principal manager of the insurance businesses, errors in asset management could result in errors in the insurance businesses.\n\nStorebrand has climate risks associated with investments and insurance liabilities. Both physical climate change and risks from the transition to low emissions can have an impact, but the transition risk is greatest in the short and medium terms. Storebrand may be adversely affected if the Norwegian economy and the oil sector weaken, however the risk is somewhat offset by underweighted investments in the fossil fuel sector and overweighted investments in solution companies. For investments, the effect of climate risk is difficult to differentiate from other factors that influence financial market developments.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 12: Valuation of /financial instruments and properties\n\nThe Group conducts a comprehensive process to ensure that financial instruments are valued as closely as possible to their market value. Publicly listed financial instruments are valued on the basis of the official closing price on stock exchanges, supplied by Reuters and Bloomberg. Fund units are generally valued at the updated official NAV prices when such prices exist. Bonds are generally valued based on prices collected from Nordic bond pricing and Bloomberg. Bonds that are not regularly quoted will normally be valued using recognised theoretical models. This principally applies to bonds denominated in Norwegian kroner. Discount rates composed of the swap rates plus a credit premium are used as a basis for these types of valuations. The credit premium will most often be specific to the issuer.\n\nUnlisted derivatives, such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, are also valued theoretically. Money market rates, swap rates and exchange rates that form the basis for valuations are supplied by Reuters and Bloomberg. The valuations of currency options and swaptions are provided by Markit.\n\nThe Group carries out continual checks to safeguard the quality of market data that has been collected from external sources. This involves controlling and assessing the likelihood of unusual changes.\n\nThe Group categorises financial instruments valued at fair value on three different levels, which are described in more detail below. The levels express the differing degrees of liquidity and different measurement methods used. The company has established valuation models to gather information from a wide range of well-informed sources with a view to minimising the uncertainty of valuations.\n\n## Level 1: Financial instruments valued on the basis of quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\n\nThis category encompasses listed equities that over the previous three months have experienced average daily trading equivalent to approximately NOK 20 million or more. Based on this, the equities are regarded as sufficiently liquid to be included at this level. Bonds, certificates or equivalent instruments issued by national governments in local currencies are generally classified as level 1. When it comes to derivatives, standardised stock index futures and interest rate futures will also be included at this level.\n\n## Level 2: Financial instruments valued on the basis of observable market information not covered by level 1\n\nThis category encompasses financial instruments that are valued on the basis of market information that can be directly observable or indirectly observable. Market information that is indirectly observable means that the prices can be derived from observable related markets. Level 2 includes shares or equivalent equity instruments for which market prices are available, but where the volume of transactions is too limited to fulfil the criteria in level 1. Shares in this level will normally have been traded during the last month. Bonds and equivalent instruments are generally classified in this level. Moreover, interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, as well as non-standardised interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are classified as level 2. Fund investments, including hedge funds but excluding other alternative investment funds, are generally classified as level 2.\n\n## Level 3: Financial instruments valued on the basis of information that is not observable in accordance with level 2\n\nEquities classified as level 3 are primarily investments in unlisted/private companies as well as funds consisting of these. These include investments in forestry, microfinance, infrastructure and property. Private equity is generally classified at this level through direct investments or investments in funds. Private customer loans and funds consisting of these are also at level 3.\n\nThe types of mutual funds classified as level 3 are discussed in more detail below with a reference to the type of mutual fund and the valuation method. Storebrand is of the opinion that the valuation method used represents a best estimate of the mutual fund's market value.\n\n## Equities\n\nForestry represents most of the value of the level 3 shares. An external valuation was carried out as at 31 December which forms the basis for the valuation of the company's investments. The valuation is based on models that include non-observable assumptions.\n\nFor alternative investments organised as limited liability companies, equity investments are valued based on the value-adjusted equity reported by external sources when available.\n\nIn the case of private equity investments, the valuation is normally based on either the most recent transaction or a model in which a company that is in continuous operation is assessed by comparing the key figures with groups of equivalent listed companies.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Units\n\nOf the fund units, it is private equity investments that represent the majority at level 3. Moreover, there are also some other types of funds, such as infrastructure funds and microfinance funds, loan funds and property funds here. The majority of Storebrand's private equity investments are investments in private equity funds. These fund investments are valued based on the value reported by the funds. Most of the funds report on a quarterly basis, while a few report less often. Reporting typically takes place with a few months' delay. The most recently received valuations are used as a basis, adjusted for cash flows and market effects in the period from the most recent valuation until the reporting date. For private equity, the market effect is calculated based on the development in value in the relevant index, multiplied by the estimated beta in relation to this index.\n\n## Loans to customers\n\nThe value of fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting the agreed cash flows over the remaining maturity by the current discount rate adjusted for market spread. The discount rate that is used is based on a swap interest rate (mid swap) with a maturity that corresponds to the remaining lock-in period for the underlying loans. The market spread that is used on the balance sheet date is determined by assessing the market conditions, market price and the associated swap interest rate. However, the fair value of loans to corporate customers with margin loans is lower than the amortised cost because certain loans run with lower margins than they would have done if they had been taken up as of the end of 2019. The value shortfall is calculated by discounting the difference between the agreed margin and the current market price over the remaining duration.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nBonds are normally not priced at level 3, but if the loan is in default and a payment is expected, these are priced based on the expected payment. As at 31 December 2020, this was not a significant amount for Storebrand's financial statements.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe investment properties primarily consist of office buildings located in Oslo and Stockholm and shopping centres in Southern Norway.\n\nOffice properties and shopping centres in Norway:\n\nThe required rate of return is of greatest importance when calculating the fair value for investment properties.\n\nAn individual required rate of return is determined for each property. The required rate of return is viewed in connection with the related cash flow for the property. The knowledge available about the market's required rate of return, including transactions and appraisals, is used when determining the cash flow.\n\nThe required rate of return is divided into the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk-free interest\n- \u00b7 Risk premium, adjusted for:\n- \u00b7 Type of property\n- \u00b7 Location\n- \u00b7 Structural standard\n- \u00b7 Environmental standard\n- \u00b7 Duration of the contract\n- \u00b7 Quality of tenant\n- \u00b7 Other factors such as transactions and perception in the market, vacancy and general knowledge about the market and the individual property.\n\nWhen calculating fair value, Storebrand uses internal cash flow models. Net cash flows for the individual property are discounted by an individual required rate of return. A future income and expense picture for the first 10 years has been estimated for the office properties and a final value has been calculated for the end of the 10th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property. A future income and expense picture for the first 6 years has been estimated for the shopping centre properties and a final value has been calculated for the end of the 6th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property.  In both models, the net income stream has been taken into consideration for existing and future loss of income due to vacancy, necessary investments and an assessment of the future development in the market rent. The majority of new contracts that are entered into have a duration of five or ten years for offices (three to five years for trading). The cash flows from the lease agreements (contractual rent) are included in the valuations. To estimate the long-term, future non-contractual rental incomes, a forecasting model has been developed. The office model is based on the rental price overview from areastatistics, as well as data and observations from brokers.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nA long-term, time-weighted average of the annual observations is calculated in which the oldest observations are weighted with the lowest importance. For non-contractual rent in the short-term, the current rental prices and market situation are used. For trading, the forecast is based on the development of the shopping centre.\n\n## External valuation:\n\nFor properties in the Norwegian business, a methodical approach is taken to a selection of properties that are to be externally valued each quarter so that all properties have had an external valuation at least every three years. In 2020, external valuations were obtained for properties worth NOK 18.3 billion (85 per cent of the portfolio's value as at 31 December 2020).\n\nFor quality control and updating of the internal model, external valuations shall be obtained each quarter from reputable appraisers to verify the value that appears when using the internal model. When obtaining such valuations, the individual appraiser's routines for valuations, including collection of information, inspections etc., shall apply. External valuations shall be rotated in such a way that all segments are regularly appraised. The task of valuing investment properties shall be rotated between reputable appraisers within a reasonable time interval, and knowledge of the property must be taken into consideration. In the event of a discrepancy between the valuation and value obtained using the internal model, the model shall be used as long as the discrepancy is within what is discretionarily considered to be best practice in the market. If there is a discrepancy of more than 5% between the internal and external valuation, the discrepancy shall be reported and the grounds for this provided in the valuation memorandum/valuation item memorandum that is presented to the Board of Storebrand Livsforsikring AS.\n\nExternal valuations are obtained for properties in the Swedish business.

Forestry investments are characterised by, among other things, very long cash flow periods. There can be some uncertainty associated with future cash flows due to future income and costs growth, even though these assumptions are based on recognised sources. Nonetheless, valuations of forestry investments will be particularly sensitive to the discount rate used in the estimate. The company bases its valuation on external valuations. These utilise an estimated market-related required rate of return.\n\n| NOK million                       |   Change in value at change in discount rate    Increase + 25 bp |   Decrease - 25 bp |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.20 |                                                              -12 |                 11 |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.19 |                                                              -19 |                 21 |\n\n## Fund units\n\nLarge portions of the portfolio are private equity funds invested in companies priced against comparable listed companies. The valuation of the private equity portfolio will thus be sensitive to fluctuations in global equity markets. The private equity portfolio has an estimated Beta relative to the MSCI World (Net - currency hedged to NOK) of around 0.54.",

A change of 0.25 per cent in the required rate of return where everything else remains unchanged will result in a change in the value of Storebrand's property portfolio of approximately 5.0 per cent. In the order of 25 per cent of the property's cash flow is linked to lease agreements entered into. This means that the changes in the uncertain parts of the cash flow by 1 per cent will result in a change in value of 0.75 per cent.\n\n|                                   | Endring i avkastningskrav   |         |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|\n| NOK million                       | 0,25 %                      | -0,25 % |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.20 | -1,827                      | 2,041   |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.19 | -1,560                      | 1,699   |",

Appendix\n\n## Note 13: Solidity and capital management\n\nThe Storebrand Group is an insurance-dominated, cross-sectoral financial group with capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II. Storebrand calculates Solvency II according to the standard method as defined in the Solvency II Regulations.\n\nConsolidation is carried out in accordance with Section 18-2 of the Norwegian Act relating to Financial Undertakings and Financial Groups. The solvency capital requirement and minimum capital requirement for the group are calculated in accordance with Section 46 (1)-(3) of the Solvency II Regulations using the standard method.\n\n## Capital management\n\nStorebrand places particular emphasis on continually and systematically adapting the levels of equity in the Group. The level is adapted to the financial risk and capital requirements in the business, where growth and the composition of segments are important motivating factors for the need for capital. The purpose of capital management is to ensure an efficient capital structure and provide for an appropriate balance between in-house goals and regulatory and rating company requirements. If there is a need for new capital, this is raised by the holding company Storebrand ASA, which is listed on the stock exchange and is the ultimate parent company.\n\nThe Storebrand companies are subject to various capital requirements depending on the type of business. In addition to the capital requirements for the Storebrand Group and insurance companies, the banking and asset management businesses have capital requirements in accordance with CRD IV. The companies in the group governed by CRD IV are included in the group's solvency capital and solvency capital requirements with their respective primary capital and capital requirements.\n\nStorebrand has the goal of paying a dividend of more than 50% of the Group profit after tax. The Board has the ambition of ordinary dividends per share being, at a minimum, at the same nominal level as the previous year. The normal dividend is paid with a sustainable solvency margin of more than 150%. If there is a solvency margin of more than 180%, the Board's intention is to propose extraordinary dividends or share buy-backs. In general, equity in the Group can be controlled without material limitations if the capital requirement is met and the respective legal entities have sufficient solvency.\n\n## SOLVENCY CAPITAL\n\n| NOK million                                                                | Total   | Group 1  unlimited   | 31.12.20 Group 1  limited   | Group  2   | Group  3   | 31.12.19 Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------------|\n| Share capital                                                              | 2,339   | 2,339                |                             |            |            | 2,339            |\n| Share premium                                                              | 10,521  | 10,521               |                             |            |            | 10,521           |\n| Reconciliation reserve                                                     | 31,851  | 31,851               |                             |            |            | 27,169           |\n| Including the effect of the transitional arrangement                       | 4,815   | 4,815                |                             |            |            |                  |\n| Subordinated loans                                                         | 8,734   |                      | 1,131                       | 7,602      |            | 7,651            |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                        | 247     |                      |                             |            | 247        | 268              |\n| Risk equalisation reserve                                                  | 438     |                      |                             | 438        |            | 466              |\n| Minority interests                                                         |         |                      |                             |            |            | 57               |\n| Unavailable minority interests                                             |         |                      |                             |            |            | -41              |\n| Deductions for CRD IV subsidiaries                                         | -3,006  | -3,006               |                             |            |            | -2,970           |\n| Expected dividend 2020                                                     | -1,519  | -1,519               |                             |            |            | -1,517           |\n| Total basic solvency capital                                               | 49,605  | 40,186               | 1,131                       | 8,040      | 247        | 43,943           |\n| Subordinated capital for subsidiaries regulated in  accordance with CRD IV | 3,006   |                      |                             |            |            | 2,970            |\n| Total solvency capital                                                     | 52,611  |                      |                             |            |            | 46,913           |\n| Total solvency capital available to cover the  minimum capital requirement | 43,533  | 40,186               | 1,131                       | 2,215      |            | 38,614           |",

In a multi-sectoral financial group, all the capital requirements of the CRD IV companies are calculated based on their respective applicable requirements, including buffer requirement for the largest company in the Group (Storebrand Bank). This increases the total requirement from the CRD IV companies in relation to what is included in the Solvency II calculation. As at 31 December 2020, the difference amounted to NOK 173 million.",

In a defined-contribution scheme, the company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the defined-contribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the defined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the defined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- - Saving starts from the first krone of salary.\n- - Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 101,351 at 31 December 2020)\n- - In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved.\n- - Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent.\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of financial position. The scheme is financed by means of an annual premium that is defined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.5 % in 2020. Storebrand employees in Norway who were born before 1 January 1956 can choose between drawing an AFP scheme pension or retiring at the age of 65 and receiving a direct pension from the company until they reach the age of 67. Employees can choose to receive benefits from the AFP scheme from the age of 62 and still continue to work.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nEmployees who were on sick leave and partiality disabled during the transition to the defined-contribution pension, remain in the defined-benefit pension scheme. There are also pension liabilities for the defined-benefit scheme related to direct pensions for certain former employees and former board members.\n\nThe pension plan for employees at SPP in Sweden follows the plan for bank employees in Sweden (BTP).\n\nSPP has a defined-contribution occupational pension known as BTP1. All new employees were enrolled in this pension agreement from and including 1 January 2014. In BTP1, the employer pays a premium for pension savings that is calculated based on pensionable salary up to 30 times the 'basic income amount' (inkomstbasbelopp). The insurance includes retirement pension with or without mortality inheritance, disability pension and children's pension. The premium is calculated independently of age and is calculated primarily based on the monthly salary. The premium is paid monthly in two parts, a fixed part that is 2.5 per cent of the pensionable salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount'. The optional part of the premium is 2 per cent of salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' and 30 per cent of salary between 7.5 and 30 times the 'basic income amount'.\n\nThe pension in the BTP2 agreement (defined-benefit occupational pension that is a closed scheme) amounts to 10 per cent of the annual salary up to 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' (which was SEK 66,800 in 2020 and will be SEK 68.200 in 2021), 65 per cent of salary in the interval from 7.5 to 20, and 32.5 per cent in the interval from 20 to 30. No retirement pension is paid for the portion of salary in excess of 30 times the 'basic income amount'. Full pension entitlement is reached after 30 years of membership in the pension scheme. In addition to the defined-benefit part, the BTP plan has a smaller defined-contribution component. Here the employees can decide themselves how assets are to be invested (traditional insurance or unit-linked insurance). The defined-contribution part is 2 per cent of the annual salary.\n\nThe retirement age for SPP's CEO is 65 years. The CEO is covered by BTP1. In addition, the CEO has a defined-contribution based additional pension with SPP. The premium for this insurance is 20 per cent of salary that exceeds 30 times the 'basic income amount'.\n\n## RECONCILIATION OF PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n| NOK million                                                           | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Present value of insured pension liabilities                          | 1,237  | 1,062  |\n| Fair value of pension assets                                          | -1,082 | -994   |\n| Net pension liabilities/assets insured scheme                         | 155    | 68     |\n| Present value of unsecured liabilities                                | 196    | 196    |\n| Net pension liabilities recognised in statement of financial position | 351    | 264    |\n\n## BOOKED IN STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n| NOK million         | 2020   |   2019 |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Pension assets      |        |      2 |\n| Pension liabilities | 351    |    266 |\n\n## CHANGES IN THE NET DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION LIABILITIES IN THE PERIOD\n\n| NOK million                                                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net pension liabilities 01.01                                    | 1,259  | 1,231  |\n| Pensions earned in the period                                    | 15     | 13     |\n| Pension cost recognised in period                                | 21     | 25     |\n| Estimate deviations                                              | 79     | 84     |\n| Gain/loss on insurance reductions                                | -1     | 2      |\n| Pensions paid                                                    | -51    | -53    |\n| Changes to pension scheme                                        |        | -4     |\n| Pension liabilities additions/disposals and currency adjustments | 111    | -37    |\n| Net pension liabilities 31.12                                    | 1,433  | 1,259  |",

Long-term assumptions such as future inflation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpecific company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the financial assumptions.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions:\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway. With effect from 2014 a new mortality basis, K2013, has been introduced for group pension insurance in life insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions in Sweden follow the industry's mutual mortality table DUS14 adjusted for corporate differences. The average employee turnover rate is estimated to be 4 per cent p.a.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis pension calculations\n\nStorebrand's risk associated with the pension scheme relates to the changes in the financial and actuarial assumptions that must be used in the calculations and the actual return on the pension funds. The pension liabilities are particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate. A reduction of the discount rate will in isolation entail an increase in pension liabilities.\n\nFor the Norwegian companies that have converted to defined contribution pensions as of 1 January 2015, the sensitivity has not been calculated, and the figures below illustrate the sensitivity for the Swedish companies.\n\nThe following estimates are based on facts and circumstances as of 31 December 2020 and are calculated for each individual when all other assumptions are kept constant.",

Appendix\n\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTOR'S GUIDELINES FOR THE FIXING OF SALARIES AND OTHER REMUNERATION TO EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL AND STATEMENT ON THE EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION POLICY DURING THE PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR ETC.\n\nFor the 2021 Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA will present new Guidelines for the fixing of salaries and other remuneration of executive personnel in accordance with the new provision in Section 6-16a of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act. Pursuant to the new provision in Section 6-16b of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, a report on salaries and other remuneration to executive personnel will first be presented at the annual general meeting in 2022. The guidelines and salaries report will replace the executive remuneration statement which was stipulated in the previous provision in Section 6-16a.\n\nSince no salaries report for 2020 will be presented at the 2021 general meeting, the Board of Directors has issued a limited statement on the implementation of the executive employee remuneration policy that was carried out during the previous financial year, as well as a statement on the effect of agreements for share-based remuneration.\n\nThe statement is as follows:\n\n## 1. STATEMENT ON THE EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION POLICY DURING THE PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nThe executive employee remuneration policy adopted for 2020 has been observed. The annual independent assessment of the guidelines and the practice of these guidelines in connection with bonuses to be paid in 2021 will be carried out by the end of 2021.\n\n## 2. STATEMENT ON THE EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED REMUNERATION AGREEMENTS ON THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS\n\nA proportion of the executive management's fixed salary is linked to the purchase of physical Storebrand shares, with a lock-in period of three years. The purchase of shares will take place once a year. In the opinion of the Board of Directors, this has a positive effect on the company and the shareholders, given the structure of the scheme and the size of each individual's portfolio of shares in Storebrand ASA.\n\nThe Board of Directors presents the following guidelines for the approval of the general meeting:\n\n## GUIDELINES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT ETC.\n\nThese guidelines were stipulated by the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA on 9 February 2021 in accordance with Section 6-16 (a) of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act.\n\n## 1. Who the guidelines apply to\n\nThe guidelines apply to the executive management (CEO and executive vice presidents) and employees who are members of the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA.\n\n## 2. The guidelines' connection to the Group's business strategy, long-term interests and financial sustainability\n\nStorebrand's business strategy is to offer the most sustainable products and services within pension, savings, insurance and banking products to private individuals, businesses and public enterprises. Customers must be assured that their needs are assigned first priority when recommending our solutions.\n\nIn a labour market characterised by strong competition for the most qualified employees, Storebrand shall have competitive, transparent and motivating salary principles that help attract, develop and retain employees.\n\nStorebrand's guidelines for financial remuneration are adapted to the company's business strategy. In order to best safeguard the interests of customers and shareholders, Storebrand considers that the correct course of action is to focus primarily on a fixed salary as a means of overall financial compensation, and utilise variable remuneration to a limited extent. Executive management are only paid a fixed salary. To ensure that the Group's executive management team has incentive schemes that coincide with the long-term interests of the owners, a significant proportion of the gross fixed salary is linked to the purchase of physical Storebrand shares, with a lock-in period of three years.\n\nThe salaries of executive management are determined based on the position's responsibilities and level of complexity. Regular comparisons with equivalent roles in other companies are made in order to ensure that the salary level is competitive.\n\nRemuneration of executive management is governed by laws and regulations relating to remuneration schemes and does not include variable remuneration. This ensures a high level of predictability and also ensures that total remuneration is financially sustainable for the Group.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 3. Remuneration to executive management\n\n## Fixed salary with equity share\n\nExecutive management's equity share of the fixed salary involves the purchase of physical Storebrand shares at a fixed point in time once a year. The shares have a three year lock-in period and the Board of Directors encourages executive management to also retain the shares after the lock-period expires after three years. In the opinion of the Board of Directors, this scheme has a positive effect on the company and the shareholders, given the structure of the scheme and the size of each individual's portfolio of shares in Storebrand ASA.\n\nThe normative level of the desired equity exposure in relation to gross salary is a minimum of 200% for the CEO, 150% for the Chief Financial Officer and for executive vice presidents who are responsible for the profit & loss units, and 100% for other executive vice presidents. The share salary scheme was introduced in 2015. Until each member of executive management reaches the normative level, salary increases will primarily be given for the share part. When the normative level has been reached, following an individual assessment, a salary increase can also be given for the cash part.\n\nAs is the case with other Storebrand employees, executive management have the option to purchase a limited number of shares in Storebrand ASA at a discount in accordance with the share programme for employees.\n\nLike other employees at the company, certain members of the Group's executive management team receive benefits in kind in the form of car allowances and smaller fixed amounts as contributions to cover expenses for newspapers, electronic communication etc. These schemes are linked to employment contracts entered into in the past and are not part of the new contracts.\n\n## Pension scheme and insurance\n\nThe Group arranges and pays for an ordinary group pension scheme for all employees, which takes effect from the moment employment commences, and in accordance with the pension agreement in force at any given time. All employees are also enrolled in group insurance schemes that provide cover in the event of illness, disability or death. Since 2015, the Company has had defined-contribution pension schemes for all employees. Executive management are included in the general pension and insurance schemes.\n\nThe following defined-contribution pension scheme applied as of February 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Saving starts from the first krone of salary.\n- \u00b7 Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (G = National Insurance basic amount).\n- \u00b7 In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved.\n- \u00b7 The total savings rate between 7.1 and 12 G is therefore 20 per cent.\n- \u00b7 Savings rate of 20% (taxed as salary) for salary above 12 G.\n\n## 4. The duration of agreements and schemes for executive management\n\nEveryone in the Group's executive management team has a six month period of notice.\n\nThe Group has a retirement age of 70 years. In accordance with the general rules, employees can access a pension from the age of 62. There are no fixed schemes for early retirement pensions at the Group, nor for executive management.\n\nExecutive management are entitled to severance pay if their contracts are terminated by the company. The right to severance pay also applies if the employee decides to leave the Company due to substantial changes in the organisation, or equivalent circumstances, which result in the individual being unable to naturally continue in his/her position. The CEO is entitled to severance pay up to 24 months after the end of the notice period. Other members of the Group's executive management team have equivalent severance pay agreements for up to 12 to 18 months from their agreed resignation. New agreements entered into for executive vice presidents will have a severance pay agreement for up to 12 months. The severance pay corresponds to the pensionable salary at the end of employment, excluding any bonus schemes. The amount of any severance pay will be subject to assessment in accordance with the individual agreement and the relevant remuneration regulations.\n\n## 5. Comparison with remuneration of other employees\n\nStorebrand's overarching guidelines for financial remuneration for all employees are considered and approved by the Group's Board of Directors each year. Remuneration is principally based on a fixed salary and the salary level for the different roles is based on assessments of the requirements for the various roles in terms of formal qualifications, experience, responsibility and complexity. The salary levels for all roles in the Group, including the Group's executive management, are calibrated in relation to the compensation for equivalent positions in the market. Storebrand's pension and insurance schemes are also the same for all employees at the company, and the Group's executive management team has no separate pension and insurance arrangements.\n\nThe difference in remuneration between the Group's executive management team and other employees is primarily due to the significant responsibility held by executive management and the complexity that comes with these roles.

Appendix\n\nexecutive management's gross salary is used for share purchases with a lock-in period of three years to ensure that their interests coincide with the interests of the shareholders.\n\nRemuneration of other roles in the Group is also assessed in relation to responsibility, complexity and market conditions, based on a reputable and systematic system for evaluation. It is the responsibility of the individual managers to recommend financial remuneration for their employees within the framework of the principles and guidelines adopted by the Board of Directors and the company's management. The People Departments assists the line with these decisions and approves recommendations. The People Department consults the executive vice president of the relevant area when required.\n\nEach year there is a local salary process for all Storebrand employees, where salary adjustments are proposed by an employee's immediate superior and are sent to the superior's manager for assessment. Each area of the Group is calibrated before the CEO approves the changes for the entire Group based on the recommendations from the Executive Vice President for People.\n\nThe company' strategy and objectives are of importance to the assessment of each individual's total remuneration. Sustainability is an important part of Storebrand's business strategy. The goals each area of the Group has set for sustainability will therefore also be an important part of the overall salary assessment.\n\n## 6. Decision-making process for establishing, revising and implementing the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA has had a dedicated Compensation Committee since 2000.\n\nThe Board of Directors determines remuneration to the CEO following a proposal from the Compensation Committee. The CEO determines the compensation for other members of executive management based on a process with the Compensation Committee as the advisory body.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for keeping itself informed about and proposing guidelines for the determination of remuneration of executive employees in the Group, including these guidelines, which are then adopted by the Board. The Compensation Committee also acts as an advisory body to the Chief Executive Officer with regard to remuneration schemes that encompass all employees of the Storebrand Group, including Storebrand's bonus and pension schemes. The Compensation Committee satisfies the follow-up requirements stipulated in regulations relating to remuneration schemes.\n\nRemuneration to executive management is subject to an independent process through the Compensation Committee, following the recommendation of the CEO. Remuneration for the CEO is subject to consideration by the Compensation Committee and is then approved by the Board. Market comparisons are used in the annual salary assessments. This prevents any conflict of interest.\n\n## 7. Employees who are board members\n\nEmployee-elected board members shall receive remuneration as board members that is determined by the general meeting in accordance with a proposal from Storebrand ASA's nomination committee.\n\n## 8. Consideration at the general meeting\n\nThese guidelines shall be presented to the general meeting for consideration and approval in the event of any significant changes and at least every fourth year.\n\n## Note 23: Remuneration paid to auditors\n\n| NOK million                    | 2020   |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Statutory audit                | -11    |    -11 |\n| Other reporting duties         | -2     |     -2 |\n| Tax advice                     |        |     -1 |\n| Other non-audit services       | -1     |     -1 |\n| Total remuneration to auditors | -15    |    -15 |",

Appendix\n\n1) Provisions are made for deferred tax on the increase in value during the ownership of real estate in SPP Fastigheter AB in accordance with IAS 12 and guiding principles for consolidation. The real estate investments are made on behalf of the customer assets. Each real estate is owned by a separate investment company, and a sale of real estate itself would entail a tax expense that will reduce the return on the customer assets and will not affect the income tax for SPP / Storebrand. The deferred tax is in the consolidated financial reporting recognised as a claim on the customer funds and will not affect the income tax expense for SPP / Storebrand. Deferred tax relating to real estate investments in the customer assets is not netted against other temporary differences in the balance sheet.\n\n2) Based on new information and an interpretation of transitional rules from 2018, taxable accounting income of NOK 356 million was recognised for 2020.\n\n3) The effective tax rate is influenced by the fact that the Group has operations in countries with tax rates that are different from Norway. The income tax expense is also influenced by tax effects relating to previous years. The tax rate for companies in Norway is 22 per cent. For companies subject to financial tax is the tax rate 25 per cent. The Storebrand Group includes companies that are both subject to and not subject to the financial tax. Therefore, when capitalising deferred tax/deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements, the company tax rate that applies for the individual companies is used (22 or 25 per cent). The tax rate for companies in Sweden is 21.4 per cent.\n\n## TAX EXPENSES ON OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ELEMENTS\n\n| NOK million                                                                      |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Tax on other comprehensive income elements not to be reclassified to profit/loss |     15 |     12 |\n| Total tax expenses on other comprehensive income elements                        |     15 |     12 |\n\n## CALCULATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX ON TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND LOSSES CARRIED FORWARD\n\n| NOK million                                                         | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Tax-increasing temporary differences                                |        |        |\n| Securities                                                          | 178    | 283    |\n| Properties  1)                                                      | 2,696  | 2,126  |\n| Fixed assets                                                        | 24     | 8      |\n| Gains/losses account                                                | 62     | 78     |\n| Other                                                               | 1,212  | 1,377  |\n| Total tax-increasing temporary differences                          | 4,173  | 3,872  |\n| Tax-reducing temporary differences                                  |        |        |\n| Securities                                                          | -27    | -7     |\n| Fixed assets                                                        | -24    | -22    |\n| Provisions                                                          | -36    | -30    |\n| Accrued pension liabilities                                         | -171   | -166   |\n| Other                                                               |        | 753    |\n| Total tax-reducing temporary differences                            | -259   | 527    |\n| Carryforward losses                                                 | -6,530 | -6,685 |\n| Net basis for deferred tax and tax assets                           | -2,616 | -2,287 |\n| Net deferred tax assets/liabilities in balance sheet 1), 2), 3), 4) | -931   | -663   |\n| Recognised in balance sheet                                         |        |        |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                 | 1,780  | 1,430  |\n| Deferred tax                                                        | 849    | 768    |\n\nThe tax rules for the insurance industry have undergone changes in recent years. In some cases, Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration have had different interpretations of the tax rules and associated transitional rules. As a result of this, uncertain tax positions arise in connection with the recognised tax expenses. Whether or not the uncertain tax positions have to be recognised in the financial statements is assessed in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. Uncertain tax positions will only be recognised in the financial statements if the company considers it to be preponderance that the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation will be accepted in a court of law. Significant uncertain tax positions are described below.\n\nA. In 2015, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS discontinued the Norwegian subsidiary, Storebrand Eiendom Holding AS, with a tax loss of approximately NOK 6.5 billion and a corresponding increase in the tax loss carryforward. In January 2018, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS received notice of an adjustment to the tax returns for 2015 which claimed that the calculated loss was excessive but provided no further quantification. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS disagrees with the arguments that were put forward and submitted its response to the Norwegian Tax Administration on 2 March 2018. The notice was unclear, but based on the notice, a provision was made in the 2017 annual financial statements for an uncertain tax position of approximately NOK 1.6 billion",

Appendix\n\nrelated to the former booked tax loss (appears as a reduction in the loss carryforward and, in isolation, gave an associated increased tax expense for 2017 of approximately NOK 0.4 billion). In May 2019, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS received a draft decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration claiming changes in the tax return from 2015.  Storebrand disagrees with the notice from the Norwegian Tax Administration and submitted its response in October 2019. The company considers it to be preponderance that Storebrand's understanding of the tax legislation will be accepted by a court of law and thus, no uncertain tax position has been recognised in the financial statements based on the recieved draft decision. If the Norwegian Tax Administration's position is accepted, Storebrand estimates that a tax expense for the company of approximately NOK 1.2 billion will arise. There will also be negative effects for returns on customer assets after tax. The effects are based on best estimates and following a review with external expertise.\n\nB. New tax rules for life insurance and pension companies were introduced for the 2018 financial year. These rules contained transitional rules for how the companies should revalue/ write-down the tax values as at 31 December 2018. In December 2018, the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes published an interpretive statement that Storebrand does not consider to be in accordance with the wording of the relevant act. When presenting the national budget for 2020 in October 2019, the Ministry of Finance proposed a clarification of the wording of the transitional rules in line with the interpretive statement from the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes. The clarification was approved by the Norwegian Parliament in December 2019. Storebrand considers there to be uncertainty regarding the value such subsequent work on a legal rule has as a source of law, and which in this instance only applies for a previous financial year. In the tax return for 2018, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS applied the wording in the original transitional rule, but in October 2019 received a notice of adjustment of tax assessment in line with the interpretive statement from the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes and the clarification from the Ministry of Finance. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS disagrees with the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation but considers it uncertain as to whether the company's interpretation will be accepted if the case is decided by a court of law. The uncertain tax position has therefore been recognised in the financial statements. Based on our revised best estimate, the difference between Storebrand's interpretation and the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation is approximately NOK 6.4 billion in an uncertain tax position. If Storebrand's interpretation is accepted, a deferred tax expense of approximately NOK 1.6 billion will be derecognised from the financial statements.\n\nThe timeline for the continued process with the Norwegian Tax Administration is unclear, but if necessary, Storebrand will seek clarification from the court of law for the aforementioned uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Note 27: Intangible assets and fair value adjustments on purchased insurance contracts\n\n|                                    | Intangible asset   | Intangible asset   | Intangible asset           |          |         |        |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------|---------|--------|\n| NOK million                        | IT systems         | VIF  1)            | Other   intangible  assets | Goodwill | 2020    | 2019   |\n| Acquisition cost 01.01,            | 1,133              | 9,574              | 1,727                      | 2,467    | 14,901  | 14,604 |\n| Additions in the period            |                    |                    |                            |          |         |        |\n| - Developed internally             | 105                |                    |                            |          | 105     | 124    |\n| - Purchased separately             | 200                |                    |                            |          | 200     | 92     |\n| - Purchased via acquistion/merger  |                    |                    | 14                         |          | 14      | 590    |\n| Disposals in the period            | -10                |                    |                            |          | -10     | -69    |\n| Currency differences on converting |                    |                    |                            |          |         |        |\n| foreign units                      | 25                 | 1,028              | 71                         | 85       | 1,209   | -440   |\n| Acquisition cost 31.12             | 1,454              | 10,602             | 1,811                      | 2,552    | 16,419  | 14,901 |\n| Accumulated depreciation and wri-  |                    |                    |                            |          |         |        |\n| te-downs 01.01                     | -590               | -6,827             | -959                       | -305     | -8,681  | -8,498 |\n| Write-downs in the period          | -22                |                    |                            |          | -22     | -35    |\n| Amortisation in the period  2)     | -100               | -372               | -120                       |          | -592    | -502   |\n| Disposals in the period            | 7                  |                    |                            |          | 7       | 69     |\n| Currency adjustment on converting  |                    |                    |                            |          |         |        |\n| foreign units                      | -2                 | -756               | -70                        |          | -828    | 284    |\n| Acc. depreciation and write-downs  |                    |                    |                            |          |         |        |\n| 31.12                              | -708               | -7,954             | -1,149                     | -305     | -10,116 | -8,681 |\n| Book value 31.12                   | 746                | 2,648              | 662                        | 2,247    | 6,303   | 6,220  |\n\n1) Value of business-in-force, the difference between market value and book value of the insurance liabilities in SPP and Silver",

The majority of the intangible assets linked to the acquisition of SPP include the value of business in force (VIF), for which liability adequacy tests are conducted in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 4. To determine whether goodwill and other intangible assets linked to SPP have declined in value, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount by calculating the entity specific value of the business. SPP is considered to be a separate cash flow generating unit.",

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIn calculating the utility value, the management have made use of budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years (2021-2023). The management has made assessments for the period from 2024 to 2030, and the annual growth for each element in the income statement has been estimated. When calculating the terminal value, a growth rate equivalent to observed inflation of 0.5 per cent is used. This is lower than Riksbanken's inflation target of 2.0 per cent, but is consistent with the risk-free interest rate used in the required rate of return. The primary drivers of improved long-term results will be the return on total assets, underlying inflation and wage growth in the market (which drive premium growth). In addition to cash flows from the forecasted result, the change in expected regulatory tying-up of capital is also used in the valuation. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 7.0 per cent. The required rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added to a premium that reflects the risk of the business.\n\nCalculations related to the future are uncertain. The value will be impacted by various growth parameters, expected return and the required rate of return used as a basis, etc. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the recoverable amount, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulation using reasonable assumptions indicates a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the banking business\n\nWhen calculating the utility value for the banking business, a cash flow based assessment of value has been made using the expected profit after taxes. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years (2021 to 2023) are used as the basis for the valuation.\n\nThe cash flow is based on two elements, profit/loss to equity and change in expected regulatory tying-up of capital. It is also assumed that all capital in addition to regulatory tied-up capital, can be withdrawn at the end of each period. The management has made assessments for the period from 2024 to 2030, and the annual growth has been determined in the income statement. A growth rate of 1.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is lower than Norges Bank's inflation target, but consistent with the riskfree interest rate used in the required rate of return. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 4.5 per cent. The required rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added to a premium that reflects the risk of the business.\n\nThere will be uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be affected by the assumptions for the interest rate margin, expected losses on lending, growth parameters and capital requirements, as well as what required rate of return is assumed, etc. It is noted that the aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the utility value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Skagen\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Skagen AS in 2017. The intangible assets linked to Skagen are customer lists, branded products, technology and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years (2021 to 2023) are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2024 to 2025, a growth rate in line with the equity market for the income and a constant ratio between income and expenses were used as a basis. A growth rate of 1.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is lower than Norges Bank's inflation target, but consistent with the risk-free interest rate used in the required rate of return. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 10 per cent.\n\nThere are uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be influenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the discount rate. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the entity specific value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Cubera Private Equity\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Cubera Private Equity AS in 2019. The intangible assets linked to Cubera are customer lists, customer relations and database over the private equity market. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years (2021 to 2023) are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2024 to 2025, a projected forecast has been used that is based on the expected development in the private equity market. A growth rate of 1.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is lower than Norges Bank's inflation target, but consistent with the risk-free interest rate used in the required rate",

The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 10 per cent.\n\nThere are uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be influenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the required rate of return that is used as the discount rate. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the entity specific value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Silver\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS acquired Silver Pensjonsforsikring AS (Silver) in 2018 and the company was merged with Storebrand Livsforsikring AS the same year. The intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Silver include the value of business in force (VIF), which is included in Storebrand Livsforsikring's liability adequacy test in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 4. To determine whether intangible assets linked to Silver have declined in value, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount for the contracts in the acquired business. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the entity specific value of the business. Silver has been integrated into Storebrand Livsforsikring's business and is predominantly part of the savings segment. The assessment of the intangible assets is done by estimating the value of the contracts that were purchased, despite these not being a separate cash-generating unit. The assets under management and income margins are forecasted based on observable developments since the acquisition and expected natural negative growth in the portfolio.\n\nThere are uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be influenced by the assumptions regarding expected returns in the financial markets, costs, transfers, income development and the discount rate. The aim of the estimation is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the entity specific value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Note 28: Tangible /fixed assets and lease agreements\n\n| NOK million      |   Vehicles/ equipment | Real estate   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Book value 01.01 |                    48 | 1             |     49 |     43 |\n| Additions        |                    19 | 1             |     20 |     12 |\n| Disposals        |                    -2 |               |     -2 |     -1 |\n| Depreciation     |                    -7 |               |     -7 |     -6 |\n| Book value 31.12 |                    59 | 2             |     60 |     49 |\n\nFor specifiaction of write-downs and depreciation, see note 20.\n\n| Depreciation plan and financial lifetime:   | Straight line   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Vehicles/equipment                          | 3-10 years      |\n| Fixtures & fittings                         | 3-8 years       |\n| Properties                                  | 15 years        |",

The Group has decided not to recognise leases when the underlying asset has a low value and therefore does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for any of these leases. Instead, the lease payments are expensed as they are incurred. The Group also does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases of less than 12 months.",

Control exists when the investor has power over the investment object and possesses the right to variable yields from the investment object and simultaneously possesses the power and possibility to steer activities in the investment object that affect the yield.\n\nIn the Group's financial statements, securities funds in which Storebrand has an ownership percentage of around 40 per cent or more, and which are also managed by management companies within the Storebrand Group, are consolidated 100 per cent on the balance sheet. Minority ownership interests in consolidated securities funds are shown on one line for assets and correspondingly on one line for liabilities. In consequence of other investors in the funds being able to request redemption of their ownership interests from the respective funds, such are deemed to be minority interests that are classified as liabilities in Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.",

For fixed income securities with no observed market prices the effective interest rate is calculated on the basis of of the fixed interest rate period and classification of the individual security with respect to liquidity and credit risk. Calculated effective yields are weighted to give an average effective yield on the basis of each security's share of the total interest rate sensitivity.",

In order to quantify the scope of the derivatives, reference is made to amounts described as the underlying nominal principal, nominal volume, etc. Nominal volume is arrived at differently for different classes of derivatives, and provides some indication of the size of the position and risk the derivative presents.\n\nGross nominal volume principally indicates the size of the exposure, while net nominal volume provides some indication of the risk exposure. However , nominal volume is not a measure which necessarily provides a comparison of the risk represented by different types of derivatives. Unlike gross nominal volume, the calculation of net nominal volume also takes into account which direction of market risk exposure the instrument represents by differentiating between long (asset) positions and short (liability) positions.\n\nA long position in an equity derivative produces a gain in value if the share price increases.  For interest rate derivatives, a long position produces a gain if interest rates fall, as is the case for bonds. For currency derivatives, a long position results in a positive change in value if the relevant exchange rate strengthens against the NOK. Average gross nominal volume are based on daily calculations of gross nominal volume.\n\n| NOK million                                 | Gross nominal  volume 1)   | Gross booked value  fin. assets   | Gross booked value  fin. liabilities   | Net amount   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Interest derivatives                        | 246,363                    | 6,364                             | 705                                    | 5,659        |\n| Currency derivatives                        | 189,359                    | 3,613                             | 260                                    | 3,353        |\n| Total derivater 31.12.20                    |                            | 9,977                             | 964                                    | 9,012        |\n| Total derivater 31.12.19                    |                            | 5,313                             | 994                                    | 4,319        |\n| Distribution between company and customers: |                            |                                   |                                        |              |\n| Derivatives - company                       |                            |                                   |                                        | 1,275        |\n| Derivatives - customers with guarantee      |                            |                                   |                                        | 5,753        |\n| Derivatives - customers without guarantee   |                            |                                   |                                        | 1,984        |\n| Total                                       |                            |                                   |                                        | 9,012        |\n\n1) Values 31.12.\n\n## Note 38: Technical insurance reserves - life insurance\n\n## SPECIFICATION OF BUFFER CAPITAL ITEMS CONSERNING LIFE INSURANCE\n\n| NOK million                     | Guaranteed  pension   | Savings   | Insurance  *)   | Euroben  (other)   | Total Store- brand Group  2020   | Total Store- brand Group  2019   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Additional statutory reserves   | 11,380                |           |                 |                    | 11,380                           | 9,023                            |\n| Conditional bonus               | 9,266                 |           |                 | 1,503              | 10,769                           | 9,302                            |\n| Market value adjustment reserve | 6,987                 |           | 183             |                    | 7,170                            | 5,500                            |\n| Total buffer capital            | 27,633                |           | 183             | 1,503              | 29,319                           | 23,825                           |",

Appendix\n\n## Note 41 Hedge accounting\n\n## Fair value hedging of interest rate risk and cash flow hedging of foreign exchange risk\n\nStorebrand uses fair value hedging for the interest rate risk. The hedged items are financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through profit or loss.\n\nHedge effectiveness is monitored at an individual security level.\n\nStorebrand uses cash flow hedging for the credit margin. The hedged items are liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value. The proportion of the profit or loss on the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective hedging is recognised in total comprehensive income. The proportion is subsequently reclassified to profit or loss in step with the hedged item's effect on earnings. Hedge effectiveness is 94 per cent  per 31.12.20.\n\n## HEDGING INSTRUMENT/HEDGED ITEM\n\n|                                             | 2020                     | 2020                | 2020           | 2020   | 2020                                     | 2019                    | 2019                | 2019           | 2019   | 2019                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------|\n| NOK million                                 | Contract/ nominal  value | Book value   Assets | 1) Liabilities | Booked | Recog- nised of  compre- hensive  income | Conract/ nominal  value | Book value   Assets | 1) Liabilities | Booked | Recog- nised of  compre- hensive  income |\n| Interest rate swaps                         | 2,557                    | 1,101               |                | 8      | 141                                      | 2,773                   | 1,070               |                | -9     | -55                                      |\n| Subordinated loans                          | -2,238                   |                     | 3,420          | -2     | -173                                     | -2,238                  |                     | 3,243          | -5     | 19                                       |\n| Debt raised through  issuance of securities | -284                     |                     | 284            | -7     |                                          | -500                    |                     | 493            | 15     |                                          |\n\n## Hedging of net investment in Storebrand Holding AB\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand used cash flow hedging of the foreign exchange risk linked to Storebrand's net investment in Storebrand Holding AB. Three-month rolling currency derivatives were used, and the spot element of these was used as a hedging instrument. The effective share of the hedging instruments is recognised in total comprehensive income. There is partial hedging of the net investment in Storebrand Holding AS and it is therefore expected that the hedge effectiveness in the future will be about 100 per cent. Expenses of NOK 868 million were recognised in total comprehensive income in connection with the hedging of Storebrand Holding AB, compared with income of NOK 322 million in 2019.\n\n## HEDGING INSTRUMENT/HEDGED ITEM\n\n|                                 | 2020                    | 2020           | 2020           | 2019                   | 2019            | 2019            |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                 |                         | Book value  1) | Book value  1) |                        | Book value   1) | Book value   1) |\n| NOK million                     | Contract/ nominal value | Assets         | Liabilities    | Conract/ nominal value | Assets          | Liabilities     |\n| Currency derivatives            | -4,700                  |                | 27             | -4,700                 |                 | 27              |\n| Loan used as hedging instrument | -3,650                  |                | 3,815          | -3,650                 |                 | 3,426           |\n| Underlying items                |                         | 10,045         |                |                        | 9,045           |                 |",

Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nStorebrand hedges an exposure in the reference interest rate EURIBOR 3M.\n\nStorebrand hedges an exposure of EUR 300 million nominal value in EURIBOR 3M. Storebrand follows market developments relating to the discontinuation of reference interest rates. New reference interest rates will influence the management of customer portfolios, but the scope and efficiency will particularly depend on the future for NIBOR and STIBOR\n\nLIBOR for different currencies will be available until the end of 2021, but the transition to new 'overnight interest rates' appears to be progressing faster than first assumed. This may result in some of the 'Panel banks' not providing data to maintain the LIBOR interest rates until the end of 2021. This could make the LIBOR interest rates less attractive to use and the transition to new 'overnight' reference interest rates' before the end of 2021 may be in all of the parties' interests. The transition to new reference interest rates and specification of 'fallbacks' will be calculated by ISDA and published by Bloomberg. To ensure the wording of the agreements between the market players, ISDA will release a 'Protocol' at the end of Q1 2020 and it is expected that most market players will accede to the 'Protocol'. Storebrand Asset Management has the ambition of acceding to the 'Protocol' on behalf of the life insurance companies in the Group. NIBOR and STIBOR will not be immediately affected, and the administrator of these reference interest rates has an ambition of also continuing these beyond 2021. GBP LIBOR is expected to be replaced by SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average). USD LIBOR is expected to be replaced by SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), and EUR LIBOR will be replaced by EUR ESTER. The transfer to 'overnight interest rates' for the major currencies may also influence the continuation of NIBOR. NIBOR will then be able to be replaced with NOWA (Norwegian Overnight Weighted Average).\n\nThe derivative that hedges the EURIBOR 3M risk is a cross currency swap of EUR 300 million nominal value.\n\n## Note 42: Collateral\n\n| NOK million                                                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Collateral for Derivatives trading                         | 3,380  | 904    |\n| Collateral received in connection with Derivatives trading | -8,828 | -3,939 |\n| Total received and pledged collateral                      | -5,448 | -3,035 |\n\nThe CSA agreements entered into with 13 counterparties regulate the security that can be used by the parties in OTC contracts that have been entered into. Most of the agreements have a minimum transfer amount of EUR 500,000. All agreements stipulate that cash in EUR and NOK can be used as security. In some of the agreements, government bonds are also defined as approved security. Interest is calculated based on the NOWA and EONIA rates respectively.\n\nSecurity provided for futures and options is adjusted daily on the basis of a daily margin settlement for each contract.\n\nSecurity is received and provided in the form of both cash and securities.

Appendix\n\nF-loan in Norges Bank as per 31.12.2020.\n\nOf total loans of NOK 31.5 billion, NOK 21,1 billion has been mortgaged in connection with the issuing of covered bonds (covered bond rate) in Storebrand Boligkreditt AS.Loans in Storebrand Boligkreditt AS are security for covered bonds in the company, and these assets have therefore been mortgaged through the bondholders' pre-emptive rights to the security in the company.\n\nStorebrand Boligkreditt AS has over-collateralisation (OC) of 16 per cent. The company must maintain the applicable OC that the rating agency requires if the company wishes to retain the current AAA rating. This requirement was 9.13 per cent at the end of 2020. The statutory OC is 2 per cent. Through commitments from previous prospectuses for covered bond issues, the company is obligated to maintain OC of up to 9.5% until these securities mature. Storebrand Boligkreditt AS has security that is NOK 1.3 billion more than what the present rating requires. Storebrand Bank ASA therefore considers the security to be adequate.\n\n## Note 43: Contingent liabilities\n\n| NOK million                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Guarantees                                           |        | 1      |\n| Unused credit limit lending                          | 3,063  | 3,072  |\n| Uncalled residual liabilities re limited partnership | 8,251  | 7,297  |\n| Loan commitment retail market                        | 2,962  | 1,466  |\n| Total contingent liabilities                         | 14,276 | 11,837 |\n\nGuarantees principally concern payment guarantees and contract guarantees.\n\nUnused credit facilities concern granted and unused overdrafts and credit cards, as well as unused facility for credit loans secured by property.\n\nStorebrand Group companies are engaged in extensive activities in Norway and abroad, and are subject for client complaints and may become a party in legal disputes.\n\n## Note 44: Securities lending and buy-back agreements\n\n## COVERED BONDS  - STOREBRAND BANK GROUP\n\n| NOK million                                                               | 2020   |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Transferred bonds still recognised on the statement of financial position |        |    403 |\n| Liabilities related to the assets                                         |        |    403 |\n\nTransferred bonds that are included in buyback agreements (repos) are not derecognised, since all risk and return on the securities are retained by Storebrand Bank ASA.\n\n## Note 45: Information related parties\n\nCompanies in the Storebrand Group have transactions with related parties who are shareholders in Storebrand ASA and senior employees.

Governance\n- 9. Sustainability assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 1: Accounting policies\n\nStorebrand ASA is the holding company of the Storebrand Group. The Storebrand Group is engaged in life and P&C insurance, banking and asset management, with insurance being the primary business. The financial statements of Storebrand ASA have accordingly been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act, generally accepted accounting policies in Norway, and the Norwegian Regulations relating to annual accounts for nonlife insurance companies. Storebrand ASA has used the simplified IFRS provisions in the regulations for recognition and measurement.\n\n## Use of estimates and discretionary assumptions\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, Storebrand has made assumptions  and used estimates that affect the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, as well as the information provided on contingent liabilities. Future events may cause these estimates to change. Such changes will be recognised in the financial statements when there is a sufficient basis for using new estimates. The most important estimates and assessments are related to the valuation of the company's subsidiaries and the assumptions  used for pension calculations.\n\n## Classification and valuation policies\n\nAssets intended for permanent ownership and use are classified as fixed assets, and assets and receivables due for payment within one year are classified as current assets. Equivalent policies have been applied to liability items.\n\n## Profit and loss account and statement of financial position\n\nStorebrand ASA is a holding company with subsidiaries in the fields of insurance, banking and asset management. The layout plan in the Regulations relating to annual financial statements for nonlife insurance companies has not been used, a custom layout plan has been used.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries, dividends and group contributions\n\nIn the company's accounts, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are valued at the acquisition cost less any writedowns. The need to write down is assessed at the end of each accounting period. Storebrand ASA's primary income is the return on capital invested in subsidiaries. Group contributions and dividends received in respect of these investments are therefore recorded as ordinary operating income. Proposed and approved dividends and group contributions from subsidiaries at the end of the year are recognised in the financial statements of Storebrand ASA as income in that financial year.\n\nA prerequisite for recognition is that this is earned equity by a subsidiary. Otherwise, this is recognised as an equity transaction, which means that the ownership interest in the subsidiary is reduced by dividends or group contributions.\n\n## Tangible fixed assets\n\nTangible fixed assets for own use are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Write-downs are made if the book value exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\n## Pension liabilities for company's own employees\n\nStorebrand ASA have defined-contribution pension, but have some pension obligation that are recorded as defined-benefit pension. The defined-contribution pension scheme involves the company paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The company does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. Defined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the financial statements.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax cost in the profit and loss account consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded on the balance sheet to the extent it is considered likely that the company will have sufficient taxable profit in the future to make use of the tax asset. Deferred tax is applied directly against equity to the extent that it relates to items that are themselves directly applied against equity.",

Shares held as fixed assets are translated at the exchange rate on the date of acquisition.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nEquities and units\n\nEquities and units are valued at fair value. For securities listed on an exchange or other regulated market, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day immediately prior to or on the balance sheet date.\n\nAny repurchase of own shares is dealt with as an equity transaction, and own shares (treasury stock) are presented as a reduction in equity.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed income securities\n\nBonds and other fixed income securities are included i the statement of financial position from such time the company becomes party to the instrument's contractual terms and conditions. Ordinary purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is initially recognised in the financial statements, it is valued at fair value. Initial recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset/liability.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed income securities are recognised at fair value.\n\nFair value is the amount for which an asset could be sold for, or a liability settled with, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. For financial assets that are listed on an exchange or other regulated market place, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day up to and including the balance sheet date, and in the case of an asset that is to be acquired or a liability that is held, the offer price.\n\n## Financial derivatives\n\nFinancial derivatives are recognised at fair value. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Bond funding\n\nBond loans are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The amortised cost includes the transaction costs on the date of issue.\n\n## Note 2:  Income from investments in subsidiaries\n\n| NOK million                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Storebrand Livsforsikring AS   | 2,222  | 2,200  |\n| Storebrand Bank ASA            | 80     | 244    |\n| Storebrand Asset Management AS | 620    | 568    |\n| Storebrand Forsikring AS       | 105    | 153    |\n| Storebrand Facilities AS       | 1      |        |\n| Storebrand Helseforsikring AS  |        | 65     |\n| Total                          | 3,028  | 3,230  |\n\nGroup contribution from Storebrand ASA, see note 8",

In a defined-contribution scheme, the company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the defined-contribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the defined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the defined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- - Saving starts from the first krone of salary\n- - Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 101,351 as at 31 December 2020)\n- - In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved\n- - Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of financial position. The scheme is financed by means of an annual premium that is defined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.5 % in 2020. Storebrand employees in Norway who were born before 1 January 1956 can choose between drawing an AFP scheme pension or retiring at the age of 65 and receiving a direct pension from the company until they reach the age of 67. Employees can choose to receive benefits from the AFP scheme from the age of 62 and still continue to work.",

Long-term assumptions  such as future inflation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpecific company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the financial assumptions\n\n.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions :\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions  on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway. With effect from 2014 a new mortality basis, K2013, has been introduced for group pension insurance in life insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2020.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe group's activities are largely unchanged compared to last year. We have not identified regulatory changes, transactions or other material events that qualified as new key audit matters for our audit of the 2020 financial statements.\n\nKey Audit Matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Valuation of life insurance liabilities\n\nWe focused on the valuation of the insurance liabilities because it is significant estimates in the financial statements. The estimates involves complex assessment concerning the probability that insured events occurs, and uncertainty related to whether the provisions are sufficient to cover the total liabilities to the policyholders. Small adjustments of the assumptions may have significant impact on the estimates.\n\nThe calculation of the insurance liabilities will to a large extent depend on good quality of data in the insurance system and use of assumptions that are in accordance with regulatory requirements and appropriate industry standards.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2, 7 and 38 in the financial statements where management further describes the insurance liabilities, assumptions and uncertainty of the estimates.\n\nIn our audit we have considered and tested the design and effectiveness of established controls for review of used assumptions and calculation methods, including the company's internal recalculations of the insurance liabilities. We also examined whether management had established effective controls that ensured good data quality for the calculation of the insurance liabilities. This included controls related to data collection, data processing, reconciliation of the insurance systems and IT General Controls relevant for financial reporting. Those controls we elected to base our audit on, was working efficiently.\n\nWe also performed independent calculations for a selection of insurance obligations using our internal actuarial models and compared these with the company's calculations. We used our internal actuaries for this work. The comparison did not indicate any deviations of significance.\n\nWe considered and challenged management's use of key assumptions that the estimated insurance liabilities are based on. We did the same for the method and the models the management used. We used our own internal actuaries for parts of this work. Our findings are that assumptions, methods and models were in accordance with industry standards, regulatory requirements, and that they were used consistently.\n\nWe also considered and found that the information regarding the insurance liabilities in notes to the financial statements is sufficient and adequate.",

We have focused on investment property because it represents an estimate and a substantial part of the assets in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\nThese properties are measured at fair value and classified in level 3 according to IFRS 13. Valuation of the properties involves use of assumptions which are subject to management judgement. Important assumptions for the value of individual properties are primarily expected future cash flows and discount rate.\n\nThe basis for management's estimate is an internal valuation model and external valuations. Management obtain observations of market data from various market participants. Management considers reasonableness of their own estimates through obtaining valuations from external valuers for a sample of properties on a continuing basis. The valuers were engaged by management.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2, 12 and 33 in the financial statements for management's further description of investment properties, the methods used and the assumptions the valuations are based on.\n\nThrough our audit we have assessed and tested design and effectiveness of established controls for review of applied assumptions and calculation methods, including the company's internal valuation of investment properties. We particularly examined whether management had established controls to ensure assessment of market rent and discount rate. We found that routines to ensure that these elements regularly were checked against both external valuations and marked data was established. Those controls that we elected to base our audit on, was in our view working efficiently.\n\nWe obtained, read through and understood the internal valuation model. We concluded that the model contains the elements required by the financial reporting framework and therefore is appropriate as a basis for determining fair value on the Group's investment properties. We tested whether, and concluded that the model made mathematically correct calculations.\n\nIn our assessment of the valuation, we challenged the assumptions for expected future cash flows and discount rate by comparing a sample of properties against information from relevant external sources. Substantial changes in value from previous periods was subject to discussions with management. We concluded that assumptions were consistent with information from relevant sources and that explanations regarding substantial changes in value were based on changes in the information from relevant sources.\n\nWe also assessed the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the external valuers. We reviewed the engagement letters with the valuers to assess whether there were any clauses or fee provisions that may have affected their objectivity or in any other way limited their engagement. We did not find any indications of such circumstances.\n\nWe compared the internal valuations against the valuers estimates on values for a sample of properties. We challenged management on substantial deviations and obtained explanations on deviations. We assessed management's explanations as reasonable.\n\nWe also assessed and came to the conclusion that the information about investment properties in the notes to the financial statements were in accordance with the accounting principles and provides an adequate",

Management applied significant judgment in their assessment of whether the uncertain tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements and have therefore been a focus area.\n\nWe have reviewed and challenged management assessment of the uncertain tax positions. Management obtained external legal opinions as a basis for their conclusions. We evaluated the competence, integrity and objectivity of the external legal advisors. We evaluated the external legal opinions, and whether the arguments used by the legal advisors are reasonable and that the considerations were neutral.\n\nWe also assessed the information regarding the uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. We found that the information meets the requirements in the accounting standards.",

The other information comprises information in the annual report, except the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director (Management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including a true and fair view of the financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation and true and fair view of the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the Company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The consolidated financial statements of the Group use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.

We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGood  corporate  governance  is  important  to  ensure  that  an enterprise can achieve its defined goals, including best possible utilisation of resources and good value creation. The Storebrand Group (hereinafter referred to as Storebrand) works continuously on improving both the overall decision-making processes and the day-to-day management of the company.\n\nStorebrand's corporate governance principles have been laid down in accordance with the Norwegian Corporate Governance Board's (NUES)  Code  of  Practice.  The  Board  of  Directors  of  Storebrand ASA  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  board)  and  management  an annual review of Storebrand's corporate governance policies and compliance  therewith.  Storebrand  reports  in  accordance  with section 3-3b of the Norwegian Accounting Act and the NUES Code of Practice.\n\nStorebrand  publishes  an  integrated  annual  report  presenting financial,  social,  environmental  and  governance  issues  that  are material  for  Storebrand  and  our  stakeholders.  The  materiality analysis is can be found on page 16-17 above.\n\n## Statement in line with the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (NUES) of 17 October 2018\n\n## 1. Implementation and reporting on corporate governance (no deviations from the code of practice).\n\nThe Board has decided that the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate  Governance  shall  be  followed.  Compliance  with  the Code of Practice is discussed in the Directors' Report. Storebrand complies  with  the  Code  of  Practice  without  any  significant exceptions. One minor deviation has been accounted for below under section 3.\n\n## 2. Business (no deviations from the code of practice).\n\nStorebrand ASA is the parent company in a financial group, and its statutory object is to manage its equity interests in Storebrand's subsidiaries in compliance with the current legislation. Storebrand's main business areas encompass pensions and savings, insurance and  banking.  The  Articles  of  Association  are  available  in  their entirety on the Storebrand's website www.storebrand.no.\n\nThe market is kept updated on Storebrand's goals, strategies and creation  of  value  through  quarterly  performance  presentations and  other  thematic  presentations.  Read  more  about  the Company's  goals  and  main  strategies  in  the  Directors'  Report under the heading Strategy.\n\nStorebrand aims to be a world-class savings group that delivers better pensions - simple and sustainable. Storebrand's strategy\n\nand corporate values are described in the framework 'Our driving force' which represents a common direction for how Storebrand will deliver attractive results to customers and owners.\n\nStorebrand's  strategy  is  to  deliver  profitable  growth  within established focus areas through simple and sustainable solutions. The  Board  conducts  ongoing  evaluations  of  the  goals,  strategy and risk profile. More information about 'Our driving force' and focus areas can be found in the section this is Storebrand in the annual report.\n\nSince  1995  Storebrand  has  been  focussed  on  sustainable investments, taking an active position on how both the customers and  their  own  funds  are  invested.  Storebrand  believes  that companies that integrate environmental, social and governance considerations  in  their  business  activities  reduce  risk  and create new opportunities for the business activities and capital owners.  Our  work  with  sustainable  investing  is  described  in detail in the chapter a driving force for sustainable investments in the directors report above. This includes our principles for sustainable investments, which are approved by the group board and integrated throughout the group's operations.\n\nStorebrand's sustainability principles summarise how the work is an integral part of the Group's overall objectives and governance and control processes. The principles were updated in 2018 and include all parts of the business, including investments, product development,  procurement,  employee  follow-up  and  house operations.\n\n## These principles are:\n\n- \u00b7 We  base  our  business  activities  on  the  UN  Sustainable Development Goals.\n- \u00b7 We help our customers to live more sustainably. We do this by managing our customers' money in a sustainable manner, in addition to providing sustainable financing and insurance.\n- \u00b7 We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7 Our  processes  and  decisions  are  based  on  sustainability outcomes  -  from  the  board  and  management,  who  have the  ultimate  responsibility,  to  each  employee  who  promotes sustainability in their respective business area.\n- \u00b7 We use the precautionary principle when it comes to mitigating social and environmental risk.\n- \u00b7 We  are  transparent  about  our  work  and  our  sustainability results.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  adopts  Storebrand'  s  overall  goals  for the work on sustainability, which is in line with these principles. The group management is responsible for realizing the strategic goals.  An  overall  strategic  goal  in  2020  has  been  to  strengthen",

This goal has underlying targets  related  to  our  own  operations,  our  products  and  our external communications. The targets are reviewed by the group management three times a year and twice a year by the board.\n\nThrough  our  materiality  analysis,  we  have  defined  the  group's focus areas. These are financial capital and investment universe, customer  relations,  our  employees  and  keeping  our  house  in order. In our integrated report, page 24, 31, 41, 65 and 73, detailed targets and results are presented for all these areas.\n\nStorebrand  believes  that  diversity  reinforces  the  company's relative  capacity  for  value  creation.  Increased  diversity  is  an important  aspect  of  Storebrand  recruitment  policy.  Storebrand works  to  maintain  and  further  develop  an  organization  with equality  and  diversity.  For  more  information  see  the  chapter people in the annual report\n\nStorebrand has its own ethical rules. In addition, guidelines have been  established  for  events,  whistleblowing  and  combating corruption, among others. See our sustainability library for a full list of sustainability guidelines.\n\nhttps://www.storebrand.no/en/sustainability/sustainability-library\n\n## 3. Equity and and dividends (deviations from the code of practice).\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA continuously monitors Storebrand's capital adequacy in light of its goals, strategy and risk profile. Read more under the heading 'Capital situation, rating and risk' in the Directors' Report.\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted and made known a dividend policy whereby Storebrand aims to pay a dividend of over 50 per cent of the group profit after tax. The ambition of the Board is to pay an ordinary dividend per share of at least the same nominal level as in the previous year. Normally, dividends are paid when there is a sustainable solvency margin of more than 150 per cent. With a solvency margin above 180 per cent, the Board's intention is to propose extraordinary dividends or the buyback of shares.\n\nThe  dividend  is  adopted  by  the  General  Meeting,  based  on  a proposal put forward by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe General Meeting may, by simple majority, authorise the Board of  Directors  to  distribute  a  dividend  pursuant  to  Section  8-1, second paragraph of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. This shall be based on the annual financial statements adopted by the General Meeting. This authorisation may not be granted for a  period  longer  than  until  the  next  Annual  General  Meeting.  In addition, the authorisation shall be based on the adopted dividend policy. The General Meeting was not requested to provide such\n\nauthorisation  in  2020.  Read  more  about  Storebrands  dividend policy on page 51.\n\nStorebrand ASA would like to have various tools available for its efforts to maintain an optimal capital structure for Storebrand to contribute to good shareholder returns and financial resilience. At  the  2020  Annual  General  Meeting,  the  Board  was  granted authorization to increase the share capital through issuing new shares  for  a  total  maximum  value  of  NOK  233,906,991.  This authorization  may  be  used  for  the  acquisition  of  businesses  in consideration for new shares or for increasing the share capital by other means. The Board of Directors may decide to waive the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for new shares in accordance  with  the  authorization.  This  authorization  may  be used for one or more new issues. This authorization is valid until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nAt  the  same  General  Meeting,  the  Board  of  Directors  was authorised to buy back shares for a maximum value of NOK 233,906,991. The total holdings of treasury shares must, however, never exceed 10 per cent of the share capital. The buyback of treasury shares may be a tool for the distribution of surplus capital to  shareholders in addition to dividends. In addition, each year Storebrand ASA sells shares to employees from its own holdings in  connection  with  the  share  purchase  scheme  and  long-term incentive  schemes  for  employees  of  Storebrand.  Accordingly,  it is appropriate to authorise the Board of Directors to buy shares in the market to cover the aforementioned needs or any other needs. This authorisation is valid until the next Annual General Meeting. Otherwise, there are no provisions in Storebrand ASA's Articles  of  Association that regulate the buyback or issuance of shares\n\nApart  from  this,  there  are  no  provisions  in  Storebrand  ASA's Articles  of  Association that regulate the buyback or issuance of shares.\n\nDeviation from the Code of Practice: The Board's authorizations to increase the share capital and buy back shares are limited to  defined  purposes.  However,  no  provision  was  made  for  the General Meeting to vote on each individual purpose to be covered by the authorizations.\n\n## 4. Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associatess (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\nStorebrand ASA has only one class of shares. There are no special ownership and voting restrictions beyond the restrictions imposed by  the  Act  on  Financial  Undertakings  and  Financial  Groups Through their work, the board and management of Storebrand place great emphasis on equal treatment of the shareholders.",

Appendix\n\nThe general competence rules for board members and executive personnel may be found in the rules of procedure for the Board of Storebrand ASA, rules of procedure for the boards of subsidiaries, instructions for the CEO, guidelines for conflicts of interest and Storebrand's  code  of  ethics.  Board  members  must  inform  the company if they have direct or indirect material interests in an agreement concluded by one of the companies in the Storebrand Group. The Board shall ensure that an independent third party assesses  the  value  of  transactions  that  are  not  insubstantial in  nature.  Furthermore,  the  rules  of  procedure  for  the  Board stipulate that no board member may participate in discussions or a decision concerning matters that are of such material importance to them or a close associate that the member must be regarded as having a conspicuous personal or special financial interest in the matter. Each board member has a responsibility to continuously assess whether or not such a situation exists. Transactions with close  associates  involving  Storebrand's  employees  and  other officers of the Group are regulated by Storebrand's code of ethics. Employees shall on their own initiative immediately report conflicts of interest that may arise to their immediate superior as soon as they become aware of such a situation. In general, an employee is defined as disqualified if circumstances exist that could result in others questioning the person's impartiality in relation to matters other than Storebrand's interests. In the event of capital increases in accordance with the authorisation set out in Item 3 above, the Board may decide that the shareholders' preferential rights shall be waived.\n\nFor a complete account of shareholder matters, see section 6.\n\n## 5. Freely negotiable shares (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\nShares  in  Storebrand  ASA  are  listed  on  Oslo  B\u00f8rs  (Oslo  Stock Exchange). The shares are freely negotiable, and the Articles of Association  do  thus  not  contain  any  restrictions  with  regard  to the negotiability of the shares. All the shares carry equal rights, cf. point 4 above.\n\n## 6. General Meeting (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association, Storebrand ASA's General Meeting shall be held by the end of June each year. The General Meeting  was  held  on  10th  April  2020.  All  shareholders  with  a known address will receive notice of the General Meeting, which will be sent out no later than 21 days prior to the General Meeting. Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the deadline for giving notice of attendance shall be set at no later than five calendar days prior to the General Meeting. In accordance with Storebrand's Articles of  Association,  the  opportunity  to  make  other  agenda  papers available on the Storebrand website is exercised, cf. Section 5-11a of  the  Norwegian  Public  Limited  Companies  Act.  A  shareholder may nevertheless demand to receive agenda papers by post\n\nAll shareholders  may  participate  at  the  General  Meeting. Storebrand' s Articles of Association allow shareholders to vote in advance by means of electronic communication, cf. section 5-8b of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act.\n\nIt  is  also  possible  to  vote  by  proxy. Provisions have been made so that the proxy form is linked to each individual item to be considered. We will seek whenever possible to design the form so that it also allows voting for candidates who are to be elected. Further information about voting in advance, use of proxies and the shareholders' rights to have matters discussed at the General Meeting is available both in the notice of the General Meeting and on Storebrand' s website.\n\nThe  access  to  electronic  voting  and  the  use  of  proxy  allows shareholders  to  cast  their  votes  without  even  attending  the general meeting. All shareholders are thus given an opportunity to exert influence on Storebrand through the use of the right to vote.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, at least one representative from the Nomination  Committee  and  the  external  auditor  must  attend the  General  Meeting.  The  board  members  of  Storebrand  ASA are  not  obligated  to  attend  but  are  encouraged  to  attend.  The Group Chief Executive Officer, executive management team and the Group Legal Director participate from the management. The minutes  of  the  General  Meeting  are  available  on  Storebrand's website in both Norwegian and English. The General Meeting is opened by  the  Chairman.  The  Board  of  Directors  endorses  an independent meeting chairman elected by the General Meeting.\n\n## The General Meeting shall:\n\n- \u00b7 consider  the  annual  accounts,  consisting  of  the  income statement, the balance sheet and the annual report,\n- \u00b7 including the consolidated income statement and balance sheet, and the auditor's report,\n- \u00b7 decide upon adoption of the income statement and balance sheet,\n- \u00b7 decide upon adoption of the consolidated income statement and balance sheet,\n- \u00b7 decide upon the allocation of profit or manner of covering losses in accordance with the adopted balance sheet, and upon the distribution of dividends,\n- \u00b7 elect the auditor,\n- \u00b7 appoint members to the Nomination Committee, and this should include  the  Chairman  of  the  Nomination  Commit-  tee,  elect members to the Board of Directors, and this should include the Chairman of the Board Directors,\n- \u00b7  consider  the  Board's  statement  on  the  fixing  of  salaries  and other  remuneration  to  executive  personnel,  \u00b7  adopt  the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and board committees,\n- \u00b7 adopt the remuneration of the members of the Nomination Committee,\n- \u00b7 adopt the remuneration of the auditor,\n- \u00b7 and transact any other business listed on the agenda.",

Appendix\n\nDecisions  are  generally  made  on  the  basis  of  an  ordinary majority. Pursuant to Norwegian law, however, a special majority is required for certain decisions, including decisions about setting aside  pre-emptive  rights  in  connection  with  any  share  issues, mergers,  spin-offs,  amendments  to  the  Articles  of  Association, or authorizations to increase or reduce the share capital. Such decisions require approval by at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the share capital represented at the General Meeting.\n\n## 7. Nomination Committee (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\nStorebrand ASA's Articles of Association regulate the Nomination Committee,  which  consists  of  four  or  five  members  and  an observer  elected  by  the  employees.  For  2020-2021  election period, the Nomination Committee has four members.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Nomination  Committee  and  the  other members  are  elected  annually  by  the  General  Meeting.  The employees' representative will participate as a permanent member of the Committee in discussions and nominations concerning the election of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, as well as in other contexts where this would be natural, in accordance with an invitation from the Chairman of the Committee. The majority of the Nomination Committee is independent of the Board of Directors and the management. The Nomination Committee is composed with  a  view  to  safeguarding  the  interests  of  the  community  of shareholders.  In  the  General  Meeting's  rules  of  procedure  for the Nomination Committee, there are provisions concerning the rotation of members of the Nomination Committee.\n\nThe  Articles  of  Association  stipulate  that  the  Nomination Committee  should  work  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of procedure  adopted  by  the  General  Meeting.  The  Nomination Committee's rules of procedure were adopted at the 2020 Annual General  Meeting.  In  accordance  with  the  rules  of  procedure, the Nomination Committee shall, for example, give attention to the  following  when  preparing  nominations  for  representatives for  the  companies' governing and controlling bodies: expertise, experience, capacity, gender distribution, independence and the interests  of  the  community  of  shareholders.  More  information about the members has been published on Storebrand's website. The  Nomination  Committee  annually  writes  to  the  Company's 30 largest shareholders with an invitation to suggest candidates for  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Nomination  Committee.  A corresponding request to the shareholders is published on the company's website.\n\nThe  nomination  committee's  mandate  in  accordance  with  the company statutes is to propose candidates and remuneration for the Board of Directors and Nomination Committee, through recommendations to the General Meeting\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the nomination committee has is in line with the nature of the work and the time spent in the committee work. The Nomination Committee held [14] meetings in 2020.\n\n## 8.  The  composition  and  independence  of  the  Board  of directors (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe Articles of Association stipulate that between five and seven Board members shall be elected by the General Meeting based on  nominations  from  the  Nomination  Committee.  The  Board Chairman shall be elected by the General Meeting. Two members, or three members if the General Meeting elects six or seven board members, shall be elected by and from among the employees. The board members are elected for one year at a time. The dayto-day management is not represented on the Board of Directors. At the end of 2020, the board consisted of 10 members (six men and four women).\n\nNone  of  the  members  elected  by  the  General  Meeting  have any  employment,  professional  or  consultancy  relationship  with Storebrand beyond their appointment to the Board of Directors. The backgrounds of the individual board members are described in the annual report and on Storebrand's website. The composition of the Board of Directors satisfies the independence requirements set  forth  in  the  Code  of  Practice.  There  are  few  instances  of disqualification during the consideration of matters by the Board (none in 2020). An assessment of the individual board members' independence  is  noted  in  the  list  of  governing  and  controlling bodies under the heading 'Members of Storebrand ASA's Board of  Directors  and  Committees'.  An  overview  of  the  number  of shares  in  Storebrand  ASA  owned  by  members  of  governing bodies as at 31 December 2020 is included in the notes to the financial statements for Storebrand ASA (Information on related parties). None of the board members have held office for more than ten years.\n\n## 9. Work of the Board of Directors (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\n## Duties of the board of directors\n\nIn 2020, 15 board meetings were held, one of which was held at the  subsidiary  SPP  in  Stockholm.  Storebrand'  s  future  strategy is  discussed  at  the  Board's  annual  strategy  meeting,  which establishes guidelines for the management's preparation of plans and budgets in connection with the annual financial plan, which must be approved by the Board.\n\nThe  Board  shall  stay  informed  about  Storebrand'  s  financial position and development, and it shall ensure that the Company's value  creation  and  profitability  are  safeguarded  in  the  best possible manner on behalf of the owners. The Board shall also ensure that the activities are subjected to adequate control and ensure that Storebrand has adequate capital based on the scope of, and risks associated with, its activities.\n\nThe Board has established guidelines that give board members and senior employees a duty to familiarise Storebrand with the essential  interests  they  may  have  in  matters  that  the  Board is to consider. This also applies to interests that do not imply disqualification, but which may be necessary to take into account when matters are considered. Reference is made to Item 4 above.",

Appendix\n\nThe work of the Board is regulated by special rules of procedure for  the  Board,  which  are  reviewed  annually.  In  order  to  ensure sound and well-considered decisions, importance is attached to ensuring that meetings of the Board are well prepared so that all the members can participate in the decision-making process. The Board prepares an annual schedule for its meetings and the topics it will consider. The agenda for the next board meeting is normally presented to the Board based on the approved schedule for the year and a list of matters carried forward from previous meetings. The final agenda is fixed in consultation with the Chairman of the Board. Time is set aside at each board meeting to evaluate the meeting without the management present. The Board is entitled to appoint external advisers to help it with its work whenever it deems this necessary. The Board has also drawn up instructions for the CEO.\n\nThe  Board  conducts  an  annual  evaluation  of  its  work  and methods, which provides a basis for changes and measures. The report from the Board's evaluation, or relevant excerpts, will be made available to the Nomination Committee, which will use the evaluation in its work.\n\n## Board committee\n\nThe Board has established three subcommittees in the form of the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Risk Committee. The  composition  helps  ensure  a  thorough  and  independent consideration of matters that concern internal control, financial reporting,  risk  assessment  and  remuneration  of  executive personnel. The committees are preparatory and advisory working committees and assist the Board with the preparation of items for consideration. Decisions are made, however, by the full Board. The committees are able to hold meetings and consider matters at their own initiative and without the participation of company management.\n\nThe  Compensation  Committee  assists  the  Board  with  all matters  concerning  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  remuneration. The  Committee  monitors  the  remuneration  of  Storebrand's executive personnel and proposes guidelines for fixing executive personnel remuneration and the Board's statement on the fixing of executive personnel remuneration, which is presented to the General Meeting annually. In addition, the Committee safeguards the areas required by the Compensation Regulations in Norway and Sweden. The Compensation Committee held three meetings in 2020.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board by reviewing, evaluating and,  where  necessary,  proposing  appropriate  measures  with respect to the Group's overall controls, financial and operational reporting,  risk  management/control,  and  internal  and  external auditing.  The  Audit  Committee  held  nine  meetings  in  2020,\n\nincluding a joint meeting with the Risk Committee. The external and internal auditors participate in the meetings. The majority of the Committee members are independent of the company. The  main  task  of  the  Risk  Committee  is  to  prepare  matters  to be considered by the Group's Board of Directors in the area of risk,  with  a  special  focus  on  Storebrand's  risk  appetite  and  risk strategy,  including  the  investment  strategy.  The  Committee should  contribute  forward-looking  decision-making  support related to the Board's discussion of risk taking, financial forecasts and  the  treatment  of  risk  reporting.  The  Risk  Committee  held seven meetings in 2020, including a joint meeting with the Audit Committee\n\nThe main task of the strategy committee is to prepare the board management in the strategy area, with particular attention to the Group's work on strategy, including mergers and acquisitions. The Committee shall provide forward-looking decision support related to the board's discussion of the company's strategic choices and targets. The strategy committee was established in August 2020 and held one meeting during the year.\n\n10. Risk management and internal control (No deviation\n\nfrom the recommendation)\n\n## Overall management and control\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  drawn  up  general  policies  and guidelines  for  management  and  control.  These  policies  deal with  the  Board's  responsibility  for  determining  Storebrand's appetite for risk and risk profile, approval of the organisation of the business, assignment of areas of responsibility and authority, requirements concerning reporting lines and information, and risk management and internal control requirements. The Board's and Chief Executive Officer's areas of responsibility are defined in the rules of procedure for the Board and the instructions for the Chief Executive Officer, respectively. The Board of Directors has drawn up instructions for Storebrand's subsidiaries that are to ensure that they implement and comply with Storebrand's management and control policies and guidelines.\n\nThe  Investor  Relations  guidelines  ensure  reliable,  timely  and identical information to investors, lenders and other stakeholders in the securities market.\n\nAs  an  extension  of  the  general  policies  and  guidelines,  a  code of ethics has been drawn up that applies to all employees and representatives  of  Storebrand,  in  addition  to  corporate  rules for  areas  such  as  risk  management,  internal  control,  financial reporting,  handling  inside  information  and  share  trading  by primary insiders. Guidelines and information about information security, contingency plans, measures against money laundering and  other  financial  criminality  have  also  been  drawn  up. Storebrand  is  subject  to  statutory  supervision  in  the  countries",

Appendix\n\nwhere  it  has  operations  that  require  a  licence,  including  the Financial  Supervisory  Authority  of  Norway,  as  well  as  its  own supervisory bodies and external auditor.\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe  assessment  and  management  of  risk  are  integrated  into Storebrand's  corporate  governance.  This  management  system shall ensure that there is a correlation between goals and actions at all levels of Storebrand and the overall policy of creating value for Storebrand's shareholders.\n\nStorebrand's financial and operational goals are defined annually in a board-approved business plan. The business plan builds on separate  decisions  on  risk  strategy  and  investment  strategies, and includes three-year financial forecasts, budgets and action plans.  The  Board  of  Directors  receives  ongoing  reports  on  the status of the strategy implementation.\n\nStorebrand  Compass  is  the  company's  monitoring  tool.  It provides comprehensive reports for management and the Board concerning  financial  and  operational  targets.  In  addition,  the Board of Directors receives risk reports from the risk management function, which monitors the development of key figures for risk and solidity.\n\nRisk assessment forms part of the managerial responsibilities in the organisation. Its purpose is to identify, assess and manage risks that can hinder a unit's ability to achieve its goals. The process covers  both  the  risk  of  incurring  losses  and  failing  profitability linked to economic downturns, changes in the general conditions, changed customer behaviour, etc., and the risk of incurring losses due to inadequate or failing internal processes, systems, human error or external events. Developments in the financial markets are  important  risk  factors  in  relation  to  Storebrand's  earnings and  solvency  position.  In  addition  to  assessing  the  effects  of sudden shifts in the equity markets or interest rate levels (stress tests), scenario analysis is used to estimate the effect of various sequences  of  events  in  the  financial  markets  on  Storebrand's financial  performance  and  solvency.  This  provides  important premises for the Board's general discussion of risk appetite, risk allocation and capital adequacy.\n\nThe  responsibility  for  Storebrand's  control  functions  for  risk management  and  internal  control  lies  with  the  Chief  Risk Officer function under the management of the Group Chief Risk Officer. The Group Chief Risk Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Office. The Chief Risk Officer function is responsible for supporting the Board and group management team with respect to  the  establishment  of  a  risk  strategy  and  operationalisation of  the  setting  of  limits  and  monitoring  of  risk  raking  across Storebrand's business areas.\n\nStorebrand has a common internal audit function, which conducts an  independent  review  of  the  robustness  of  the  management model.  The  internal  audit  function's  instructions  and  annual plan  are  determined  by  the  Board  pursuant  to  the  current legislation, regulations and international standards. The internal audit function produces quarterly reports for the boards of the respective Storebrand companies.\n\nThe  appraisal  of  all  Storebrand  employees  is  integrated  into corporate governance and is designed to ensure that the adopted strategies are implemented. The policies for earning and paying any variable remuneration to Storebrand's risk managers comply with the regulations relating to remuneration in financial institutions, cf.  Section 12 below. The Chief Risk Officer and employees with control functions related to risk management, internal control and compliance only have fixed salaries.\n\n## Financial information and Storebrand's accounting process\n\nStorebrand  publishes  four  interim  financial  statements,  in addition to the ordinary annual financial statements. The financial statements must satisfy legal and regulatory requirements and be prepared in accordance with the adopted accounting policies and be published according to the schedule adopted by the Board of Storebrand ASA.\n\nStorebrand's consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Consolidated Accounts Unit, which reports to the Group Chief Financial  Officer.  Key  managers  in  the  Consolidated  Accounts Unit  have  fixed  annual  compensation  that  is  not  influenced  by Storebrand' s accounting results. The division of work involved in the preparation of the financial statements is organised in such a  way  that  the  Consolidated  Accounts  Unit  does  not  carry  out valuations of investment assets. Instead it exercises a control function  in  relation  to  the  accounting  processes  of  the  group companies.\n\nA series of risk assessment and control measures have been established  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  the  financial statements.

Remuneration to the Board of Directors (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe General Meeting determines fixes the Board's remuneration annually on the basis of the recommendations of the Nomination Committee. The fees paid to the members of the Board are not linked  to  earnings,  option  schemes  or  similar  arrangements. Members  of  the  Board  and  Board  Committees  do  not  receive incentive-based  remuneration;  instead  they  receive  a  fixed annual compensation, either per year or per meeting the member attends, or a combination of such remuneration. The shareholderelected members of the Board do not participate in Storebrand's pension  schemes.  None  of  the  shareholder-elected  members of  the  Board  carry  out  any  duties  for  Storebrand  beyond  their appointment  to  the  Board.  More  detailed  information  on  the remuneration, loans and shareholdings of board members can be found in Note 23 (Group) and Notes 6 and 17 (ASA). Board members are encouraged to hold shares in the company\n\n## 12.  Remuneration  to  senior  management  (No  deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe Board of Directors decides the structure of the remuneration for  senior  executives  in  Storebrand,  and  guidelines  on  the remuneration (previously the executive remuneration statement) are presented to the general meeting. The remuneration consists of fixed salary, variable remuneration, pension scheme and other personnel benefits that are common for a financial group. The remuneration  shall  motivate  good  efforts  for  long-term  value creation  and  resource  utilization  in  the  company.  The  board's stance is that the total remuneration should be competitive, but not leading within the industry.\n\nThe  salary  of  the  group  management  is  determined  based  on the  level  of  responsibility  and  complexity  of  the  position.  An annual assessment is carried out based on external market data to ensure remuneration is adequate in relation to equivalent positions in the market..\n\nStorebrand shall have an incentive model that supports Company strategy,  with  emphasis  on  the  customer's  interests  and  longterm perspective and an ambitious model of cooperation, as well as transparency that enhances the Storebrand's reputation. The Group's  executive  management  only  receive  fixed  salaries  and use  a  percentage  of  their  fixed  salaries  to  purchase  shares  in Storebrand with a lock-in period of three years. This is to clarify that the Storebrand's top management acts in accordance with the long-term interests of the owners.\n\nStorebrand's  strategy  and  operational  objectives  are  based on  annual  individual  assessments  of  the  remuneration  of employees.  This  further  strengthens  the  compliance  between owners and the administration. Sustainable solutions are a key\n\npart of Storebrand's business strategy and will also be part of the assessment of employees.\n\nMore detailed information about the remuneration of executive personnel may be found in Note 23 (Group) and Notes 6 and 17 (ASA), and in the Board's statement on the fixing of salaries and other  remuneration  to  executive  personnel,  which  is  included in  the  notice  of  the  General  Meeting  and  available  at  www. storebrand.no.  Executive  personnel  are  encouraged  to  hold shares in Storebrand ASA, even beyond the lock-in period.\n\n## 13. Information and communication (No deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe Board has issued guidelines for the company's reporting of financial and other information and for contact with shareholders other than through the General Meeting. Storebrand's reporting with regard to sustainable investments goes beyond the statutory requirements. Storebrand's financial calendar is published on the Internet and in the company's annual report. Financial information is  published  in  the  quarterly  and  annual  reports,  as  described under  Item  10  above  -  Financial  information  and  Storebrand's accounting process. Documentation that is published is available on Storebrand's website. All reporting is based on the principle of transparency and takes into account the need for the equal treatment of all participants in the securities markets and the rules concerning good stock exchange practices. Storebrand has its own guidelines for handling insider information, see also Item 10 - Management and control, above.\n\n## 14. Corporate takeover (No deviation from the recommendation)\n\nThe Board of Directors has prepared guidelines for how to act in the event of a possible takeover bid for the company. These guidelines  are  based  on  the  Board  of  Directors  ensuring  the transparency of the process and that all the shareholders are treated equally and given an opportunity to evaluate the bid that has  been  made.  It  follows  from  the  guidelines  that  the  Board of Directors will evaluate the bid and issue a statement on the Board's  opinion  of  the  bid,  in  addition  to  obtaining  a  valuation from an independent expert. In addition, the Board of Directors will,  in  the  event  of  any  takeover  bid,  seek  whenever  possible to  maximise the shareholders' assets. The guidelines cover the situation before and after a bid is made.\n\n## 15. Auditor (No deviation from the recommendation)\n\nThe  external  auditor  is  elected  by  the  General  Meeting  of Storebrand ASA and is responsible for the financial auditing. The external auditor issues an auditor's report in connection with the annual  financial  statements  and  conducts  limited  audits  of  the interim financial statements. The external auditor attends board",

The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including assessments of the risks that the sustainability reporting as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the preparation of the subject matter. Therefore, we design procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. Our control also includes an assessment of whether the applied criteria are appropriate and an assessment of the overall presentation of the subject matter.\n\nOur controls include meetings with representatives from Storebrand ASA that are responsible for the key areas covered by the sustainability reporting, including responsible for investing, HR and those responsible  for  the  sustainability  reporting  for  Storebrand  ASA's  own  operations  and  real  estate portfolios;  evaluating internal controls and procedures for reporting key performance indicators for sustainability; collecting and reviewing relevant information that supports the presentation of key performance indicators; evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the key performance indicators; and controlling the calculations of key performance indicators based on an assessment of the risk that the key performance indicators contain information that is incorrect.\n\nIn our opinion, sufficient evidence has been obtained and we consider that our work provides an appropriate basis to form our conclusion.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn our opinion\n\nGRI Index 2020 is, in all material respects, developed and presented in accordance with the requirements of the Standards published by The Global Reporting Initiative; and\n\nKey performance indicators for sustainability are, in all material aspects, developed, measured and reported in accordance with the definitions and explanations provided in relation to each table containing key performance indicators.\n\nOslo, 9 February 2021 PricewaterhouseCoopers AS\n\nThomas Steffensen State authorized public accountant\n\n(This translation from Norwegian has been made for information purposes only)",
