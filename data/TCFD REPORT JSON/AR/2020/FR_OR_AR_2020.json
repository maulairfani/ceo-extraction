L'Or\u00e9al was able to navigate this year in the best possible condition and has even grown stronger. The pandemic that disrupted the world led to an unprecedented crisis of supply. No one could have ever imagined that, one day, we would see seven million salons and nearly all perfumeries shut at the same time. As a result, the Beauty market decreased for the first time in history, by around -8% (3) !\n\nThroughout the year, the health and safety of our employees was our absolute priority. We also immediately mobilised alongside our partners to help them cope with the crisis, and we provided support to caregivers around the world. On the business front, L'Or\u00e9al's performance in 2020 was the result of the exceptional commitment and the unfailing fighting spirit of our teams. I would like to recognize their enduring dedication which enabled the Group to continue to provide the beauty and care products that people need more than ever in times of crisis. We got back to sales growth in Q3, and accelerated in Q4. The Group made historic market-share gains. Three of our four Divisions significantly reinforced their positions and we outperformed in most regions worldwide.\n\nDespite this exceptional year, we were able to preserve our operating margin at the same record level as 2019, and net earnings per share decreased by only -5.7%. Considering these solid results, we decided to propose a dividend of four euros at the next Shareholder Meeting, an increase of +3.9% compared to last year. We also posted exemplary extra-financial results. The Group achieved almost all the ambitious goals of its first sustainability programme, Sharing Beauty With All (4) . Independent experts have recognised our e/fforts, with L'Or\u00e9al topping key ESG rankings.\n\nIn such a challenging context, L'Or\u00e9al starts 2021 stronger than ever. The crisis has accelerated the transformations we have carried out over the last few years, which have equipped us to weather the challenges of 2020 and remain a step ahead. We solidified trust with our partners, retailers and suppliers. Our market-share gains are a tremendous advantage, as many new consumers are likely to stay loyal to our brands in the future. Our leadership in China, the second-largest beauty market in the world, has further increased this year. Our digital prowess gives us a cutting edge, as we make beauty even more personalised and connected. Our leadership in e-commerce is more powerful than ever, with online sales reaching more than a quarter of our total sales.\n\nWe are strengthening our positions in skincare, the biggest and the fastest-growing category in the beauty market.  Our Research & Innovation is sharper than ever and focused on the most promising fields of science and technology. Our organisation has become more agile and our extraordinary adaptability enables us to respond to major shi/f\\_ts and market volatility at lightning speed. Our results are more virtuous than ever because we have optimised costs and rebalanced our investments.\n\n'2020 was a year like no other. L'Or\u00e9al was able to navigate this year in the best possible condition and has even grown stronger'\n\nJean-Paul Agon\n\nChairman and Chief Executive O/fficer of L'Or\u00e9al (1)\n\nLastly, we took a bold step forward in Sustainability and Responsibility with our new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, which aims to address the planet's most pressing challenges. Launched in the spring, it is one of the most ambitious programmes in the world and will lead the way to an inclusive and sustainable tomorrow.\n\nAs I prepare to pass the baton to Nicolas Hieronimus, I am absolutely thrilled and totally serene: because we have a unique business model that has proven both its ability to win market share and create value in usual times, as well its capacity to resist exceptionally well in times of crisis, as we saw last year; because we have anticipated all fundamental shi/f\\_ts to win in the 21st century; and because I have total confidence in L'Or\u00e9al's teams. The next chapter starts with Nicolas, who is the best person to chart the course that will steer our company to new successes and stay true to our strategy and values while also reinventing the Group and adapting it to the major challenges that lie ahead.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThank/uni00A0y Jean-Paul, for your kind words. I would like to begin by paying tribute to your for ou, midable track record, both financial\n\nand non-financial. On behalf of everyone at L'Or\u00e9al, thank you for bringing the Group to this level of performance. My vision for the years ahead is shaped around three keywords: Continuity, Confidence and Ambition..\n\nThe first word, continuity, applies to this transition. I have been a member of the Executive Committee for the past 13 years, and have been involved in each of the Group's transformational decisions. Together, we have built a close relationship that will only grow stronger, on di/fferent terms but in the same spirit of proximity.\n\nThe second keyword is confidence. Confidence in the power of the L'Or\u00e9al model; confidence in L'Or\u00e9al's outstanding employees; and, last but not least, confidence in the beauty market. This year has proven the resilience and power of the unique L'Or\u00e9al model, a model that empowered us to achieve our best performance of the past 15 years in 2019 and enabled a solid result despite upheaval around the globe in 2020. This model has constantly evolved over the years but has always remained true to its roots. I am thinking of beauty, a market in which we are a pure player; innovation, which has proven to be a winning wager and a unique competitive advantage; and marketing creativity, through which we transform our R&I discoveries to meet the needs and aspirations of consumers.\n\nIn the coming years, growth in the beauty market will be driven by solid trends that we have anticipated: the rise of the middle and upper classes; youth, who are consuming younger and younger; seniors with increasingly busy social lives; men who are using more beauty products, especially in Asia; and urbanisation. However, post-Covid beauty will be di/fferent because the crisis has brought some very powerful trends that will durably impact the beauty market. Most of these trends existed pre-Covid but were accelerated by the pandemic. On all these trends, L'Or\u00e9al was ahead of the curve.\n\nDigitalisation and data, allowing more personalisation in a world where online and o/ffline will be seamlessly intertwined. The need for sustainability, which is key to the L'Oreal for the Future programme, to ensure we work within the planet's boundaries. Health and transparency as we enter a new 'health first' era where ingredients are questioned, and transparency expected. Consumer safety has always been at the heart of L'Or\u00e9al values. The importance of company's and brands' values and purpose. In 2020, the Group published its Sense of Purpose: Create beauty that moves the world. I am committed to this mission. I believe in L'Or\u00e9al's duty and capacity to make the world a better place and improve people's lives. Lastly, the return of science and technology, central to finding solutions to the world's most pressing issues.\n\nThe third word is Ambition. Ambition for L'Or\u00e9al for the next decade. First, top-line growth and beating the market will always be my priorities. We are the market leader yet our global market share is still only around 13%, which shows how much potential we have to grow. I believe the relevance of our universalization strategy will be key to achieving this objective. We roll out global brands, which we adapt to local requirements.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, my three regional priorities will be: pursuing the Chinese momentum; boosting growth in the USA; and accelerating in emerging markets, where rapid digitalisation and the rise of e commerce will give us easier access to this pool of consumers who are keen to obtain the best beauty products.\n\nThe second driver of my ambition is our category strategy. Our top priority will be skincare, the biggest and most dynamic beauty category at the crossroads of all market trends. We will continue to grow and promote hair care & colour both in the professional and mass markets. Our global leadership in fragrance puts us in the best position to benefit from this category's acceleration in China.\n\nI also believe makeup will make a comeback, and we will lead the resurgence. The Group's multiple facets allow us to satisfy all consumers, at all price points, and to seize all trends.\n\nThe third driver of my ambition is e-commerce, which could represent 50% of our business in the near future. We need to be ready. Finally, I would like to express my ambition to deliver regular improvements in profitability, through top-line growth and ever more virtuous P&L. For the next decade, we will continue the unique L'Or\u00e9al adventure. This adventure will take us to new heights, to explore new business models and new territories from Green Sciences (5) to Beauty Tech (6) .\n\nThis adventure will make L'Or\u00e9al a company of the future-a global leader with strong values, committed to sustainability and helping beauty play its role towards humanity: a role of inclusion, a role of harmony and of respect. With the strength and passion of the L'Or\u00e9al teams, I want to Create the Beauty that Moves the World.\n\n- (1)   Chairman as of 1 May 2021, by decision of the Board of Directors at the 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n- (2)   CEO as of 1 May 2021, by decision of the Board of Directors at the 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n- (3)   Source: L'Or\u00e9al estimate for the global cosmetics market based on manufacturer's net prices.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT The L'Or\u00e9al Group: the fundamentals\n\nAs  the  fifth  edition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Integrated  Report,  this  chapter  aims  to  present  the well-balanced business model of the L'Or\u00e9al Group, its strategic orientations, its 2020 results, its  non-financial  performance,  and  its  relationships  with  its  stakeholders,  particularly  in  the context  of  its  two  programmes  representing  its  commitments  to  sustainable  development: Sharing Beauty with All (2013 - 2020) and L'Or\u00e9al for the Future (2021-2030) (1) .\n\n## 1.1. THE L'OR\u00c9AL GROUP: THE FUNDAMENTALS\n\n## 1.1.1. Our Sense of Purpose (raison d'\u00eatre)\n\nThe desire for beauty has existed since the beginning of humanity. It's a universal aspiration which crosses time, countries, and cultures.\n\n## Beauty is a powerful force that moves us.\n\nWe know that beauty is more than just looking good.\n\nBeauty gives us confidence in who we are, in who we want to be, and in our relationships with others.\n\nFor over a century we have been dedicated to one sole vocation: creating beauty. We remain true to the pioneering spirit of our founder and are grateful for the unwavering support of his family, who have backed our development since the beginning.\n\n## Our goal is to offer each and every person around the world the best of beauty\n\nin terms of quality, efficiency, safety, honesty and responsibility\n\nto meet all needs and desires for beauty in their infinite diversity.\n\n## Because beauty is a permanent quest ,\n\nwe harness the power of our innovation to continually enhance the performance of our products and services.\n\n## Because we value diversity ,\n\nwe leverage each of our brands to celebrate all expressions of beauty.\n\n## Because we strive to be exemplary with a long-term vision ,\n\nwe anchor our actions in our strong values and demanding ethical principles.\n\nAnd because we are the global leader in beauty, we are aware that everything we do can have a meaningful impact\n\n.\n\nTherefore:\n\n## We act to shape the future of beauty\n\nby leveraging the best of science and technology, increasingly inspired by nature.\n\n## We act to drive social innovation\n\nby offering the best working conditions, training and social protection for our employees.\n\n## We act to build an enterprise with inclusivity at its heart\n\nby ensuring we are as diverse as the consumers we serve.\n\n## We act to nurture lasting partnerships with our clients and suppliers ,\n\nbased on mutual trust and collaboration.\n\n## We act to create value for all our shareholders ,\n\nby sustaining a robust business model.\n\nWe act to champion the cause of women and to strengthen the communities with which we engage.\n\n## We act to protect the beauty of the planet\n\nby fighting climate change, respecting biodiversity and preserving natural resources.\n\nAt L'Or\u00e9al, we share a common purpose to\n\n## Create the beauty that moves the world.",

        "page_content": "L'Or\u00e9al's  purpose (raison  d'\u00eatre )  is  a  core  principle  for  the Group,  to  see  ourselves  as  a  high-performing,  committed, responsible,  inclusive  company  showing  solidarity  in  decades to  come.  L'Or\u00e9al's raison  d'\u00eatre is  included  in  the  strategies defined by its Board of Directors and its business model.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's raison d'\u00eatre was  developed  following  work implemented over almost two years, initiated and brought to the Group's highest level within a small committee composed of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Divisions and several members of  the  Executive  Committee.  L'Or\u00e9al's raison  d'\u00eatre was therefore the result of dialogue with Group employees in three of its key countries (France, the United States and China) and many external stakeholders, including consumers. The progress made  was  discussed several times in the Executive Committee. For L'Or\u00e9al, the aim was to collect and formalise the  vision  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Business,  its  mission  (Beauty  for  All),  its values and its commitments in one sentence.\n\nThis raison d'\u00eatre was approved by the Board of Directors on 6 February 2020 who decided to include it in its management report provided to L'Or\u00e9al's shareholders at its Annual General Meeting  of  30  June  2020 (1) .  Jean-Paul  Agon,  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer,  presented  L'Or\u00e9al's raison  d'\u00eatre at the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  30  June  2020,  the  recorded broadcast of which is available online at loreal-finance.com.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's raison  d'\u00eatre can  be  summed  up  in  one  sentence: 'Create  the  beauty  that  moves  the  world.'  It  is  defined  in concrete  actions  made  to  consumers,  employees,  clients, suppliers,  shareholders,  service  providers  and  communities. L'Or\u00e9al is committed to fighting climate change, by  respecting  biodiversity  and  preserving  natural  resources, and to championing the cause of women.\n\n## 1.1.2. A clear mission and strategy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has defined a clear vision that is broken down into two points:  its raison  d'\u00eatre ,  which  is  detailed  above,  and  an exhilarating mission with Beauty for All. The mission that L'Or\u00e9al has  set  itself,  which  inspires  and  drives  its  teams,  is  to  offer women and men around the world the best  in  cosmetics  in terms of quality, effectiveness, safety, sincerity and responsibility  in  order  to  meet  all  their  needs  and  all  their beauty  wishes  in  their  infinite  diversity.  More  than  ever,  the mission and purpose of L'Or\u00e9al take on their full meaning and represent strong anchors in this increasingly unpredictable and complex environment.\n\n## PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Group: the fundamentals\n\nIn its management report, L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors reports on  the  implementation  of  the  commitments  included  in  its raison d'\u00eatre , and on the progress towards the goals set:\n\n- \u25cf for  L'Or\u00e9al,  economic  performance  is  inseparable  from  its corporate  social  responsibility  performance.  The  results  of the Group's non-financial performance, which are reviewed  by  external  auditors  along  with  its  financial performance,  reflect  the  achievements  of  L'Or\u00e9al  arising from its raison d'\u00eatre . Chapter 4 of this document, 'L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate  Social  Responsibility,'  reports  on  the  social, environmental and societal policies and progress, inclusion and  ethics  within  the Sharing  Beauty  with  All programme covering the Group's commitments to sustainable development over the 2013-2020 period, which is succeeded  by  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  in 2021-2030;\n- \u25cf L'Or\u00e9al also presents its progress and achievements in nonfinancial areas in its Sharing Beauty with All Progress Report and  through  its  annual  reporting  made  to  the  United Nations Global Compact;\n- \u25cf this chapter also reports on the Group's financial performance,  particularly  through  its  business  model  (see section  1.2.  'Business  model:  economic  and  corporate excellence to create lasting value for all' in this chapter); and\n- \u25cf the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is one of  the  factors  considered  in  determining  the  variable portion of the remuneration of L'Or\u00e9al's executive corporate officers and the L'Or\u00e9al Group's senior managers (see Section 2.4. 'Remuneration of directors and corporate officers' in this document).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  is  Universalisation,  meaning  globalisation with  a  detailed  understanding  and  respect  for  differences. The  goal  is  to  offer  beauty  by  responding  to  the  specific aspirations  of  consumers  in  every  region  of  the  world. In  contrast to standardisation, it is based on careful attention to consumers and a deep respect for their differences (2) .\n\n## 1.1.3. The dual goal: economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  economic  and  financial  performance  is  not sufficient. Because there will be no economic growth without sustainability  in  the  future,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  a  dual  goal  for economic and corporate excellence. It will be the condition for  its  success  and  its  long-term  existence.  Because L'Or\u00e9al is the  global  leader  in  beauty,  the  Group  has  the  duty  to\n\ncontribute to the beauty of the planet and be the champion in corporate social responsibility. And it is because L'Or\u00e9al is an environmental,  social  and  ethical  leader  that  the  Group  will achieve  greater  performance  in  the  future. The two performances go hand in hand and mutually enhance each other, as L'Or\u00e9al has demonstrated to date.\n\n1",

Stable governance\n\nThe stability of the Group's governance in a changing world makes it possible to work towards long-term objectives and to ensure regular growth.\n\n## Loyal shareholders, stable capital structure\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- At 31 December 2020, the Company held none of its own shares.\n- (1) Consisting of Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, Mr Jean-Pierre Meyers, Mr JeanVictor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers, along with T\u00e9thys SAS.\n- (2) Concerns  the  current  and  former  employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al.  Pursuant  to  law no.  2015-990  of  6  August  2015,  since  2016,  the  percentage  also  includes  the performance  shares  granted  in  accordance  with  Article  L.  225-197-1  of  the French  Commercial  Code.  Including  0.90%  as  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Employee Savings  Plan  and  employee  investment  fund  as  defined  by  Article  L.  225-102 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## A balanced and committed Board of Directors, which fully plays its role of reflection and strategic impetus\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  defines  the  strategic  orientations  of L'Or\u00e9al and monitors its implementation, in accordance with its  corporate  interest,  taking  the  social  and  environmental challenges of its business activity into consideration. It oversees the  management  of  both  the  financial  and  non-financial aspects,  and  ensures  the  quality  of  the  information  provided to shareholders and to the market.\n\nThe  composition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  makes  it  possible  to  take into  account  the  specific  nature  of  its  shareholding  structure while guaranteeing the interests of all its stakeholders.\n\nAt  31  December  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  comprised 14 members:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Jean -Paul Agon;\n- \u00b7 three Directors (one of whom is the Board's Vice-Chairman) from  the  Bettencourt  Meyers  family,  which  owns  33.17% of  the  share  capital  -  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers, Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers;\n\n- \u00b7 two Directors (one of whom is the Board's Vice-Chairman) from  Nestl\u00e9,  which  owns  23.20%  of  the  share  capital  Mr Paul Bulcke and Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch;\n- \u00b7 six  independent  Directors:  Ms  Sophie  Bellon,  Ms  Fabienne Dulac, Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo, Ms Ilham Kadri, Ms Virginie Morgon and Mr Patrice Caine. 50% of the Directors are independent (6  out  of  12  excluding  the  Directors  representing  the employees); and\n- \u00b7 two Directors representing the employees: Ms Ana Sofia Amaral and Mr Georges Liarokapis.\n\nThe  Board  takes  steps  to  ensure  that  the  Directors  come  from different  backgrounds,  and  most  of  them  have  international experience  acquired  in  groups  with  a  global  dimension  and complementary  skills:  entrepreneurial,  financial,  non-financial (including  human  resources  and  sustainable  development), manufacturing, digital, etc. The diversity of skills and expertise on the  Board  (see  section  2.2.1.2.  'Diversity  Policy  applied  to  the Board of Directors: experienced Directors who complement one another')  means  that  the  Board  understands  rapidly  and  in detail the development challenges with which L'Or\u00e9al is faced, the leader in a highly competitive globalised cosmetics market, in a rapidly changing world.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  attentive  to  compliance  with  the  principle  of balanced  gender  representation  on  the  Board:  58%  of  its members  are  women  (excluding  Directors  representing employees),  and  three  Board  Committees  out  of  four  are chaired by women.\n\n## Ethics, at the heart of the Group's governance and commitments\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  built  its  business  on  the  basis  of  strong  ethical principles  that  guide  its  development  and  contribute  to establishing  its  reputation:  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and Transparency.  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  acting  ethically  and responsibly  is  summarised  in  a  document  titled  'The  L'Or\u00e9al Spirit', accessible to everyone.\n\nThese  principles  underpin  the  Group's  culture  and  business model and our compliance, responsible innovation, environment,  corporate  social  responsibility  and  philanthropy policies. L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics is available in 45 languages. It is distributed  to  all  employees.  Country  Managers  (or  for Corporate or Zone staff, the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report) are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code.",

The global cosmetics market is worth over \u20ac213 billion (1) .  It  is  a  particularly robust market that has shown a certain resilience in the current crisis. The cosmetics consumer always looks for quality and novelty value, and puts a premium on leading-edge technology, trends and new ideas.\n\n## GLOBAL COSMETICS MARKET IN 2020 (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, the beauty market declined by around -8%.\n\nA large number of points of sale and hair salons were closed during  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  severely  limiting  consumer access to products. The impact was particularly harsh during the  first  half  of  the  year.  The  market  slowly  recovered  in  the second half of the year, as a result of the gradual reopening of  the  points  of  sales  and  the  growth  in  online  sales.  The different  distribution  universes  of  the  beauty  market  suffered contrasting effects.\n\nIn  effect,  general  public  products,  offered  in  mass-market retail  channels,  were  relatively  spared,  while  luxury  products were  more  heavily  impacted  by  the  closing  of  department stores  and  other  selective  channels.  Similarly,  Travel  Retail suffered greatly from the drastic drop in air traffic. Professional products  declined  sharply  in  volume  due  to  salon  closures; they also recorded a significant catch-up effect afterwards.\n\nThe  Dermocosmetics  category  stood  out  significantly,  as  it continued to grow over the year, driven by the strong demand for health-related products prescribed by dermatologists.\n\nThe  impact  of  lockdown  measures  was  comparable  in  the different  regions  of  the  world,  with  variations  over  time depending  on  the  different  waves  of  the  pandemic,  and  in line with the effectiveness of local measures.\n\n- \u00b7 Western  Europe  was  the  most  heavily  impacted  by  the crisis, to a lesser extent in the countries of Northern Europe.\n- \u00b7 In  Asia-Pacific,  some  countries,  like  China,  that  contained the epidemic more rapidly, saw the market recover in the second  half  of  the  year  in  tune  with  the  restart  of  their economy.  Other  countries,  however,  followed  the  global trend.\n- \u00b7 The US market, after a sharp decline in the first half of the year, recovered fairly rapidly in the second half of the year.\n- \u00b7 Other markets (Eastern Europe, South America, Africa and the  Middle  East)  were  relatively  aligned  with  the  global market.\n\nThe  most  visible  phenomenon  in  2020  was  the  exponential acceleration  of  digitalisation,  whether  in  online  sales  or communication and sales via social media.\n\nIn terms of product categories, 2020 confirmed positive trends for skin care; this category remains the leading contributor to the  growth  of  the  beauty  market.  Haircare  also  recorded  a strong performance this year, as demand held up during the global crisis.\n\n1",

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nBusiness model: economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\n## MAIN WORLDWIDE PLAYERS\n\n2019 sales in billions of US $ (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A solid market carried by major socio-demographic changes\n\nEstimated  at  more  than  \u20ac213  billion (2) ,  the  global  cosmetics market has grown at a steady pace over the long term, driven by several fundamental trends:\n\n- \u00b7 the first and probably most important factor is the insatiable desire for beauty across all countries and cultures: beauty is synonymous  with  well-being,  pleasure,  confidence  and self-esteem,  at  every  stage  in  life.  This  phenomenon  was stronger in 2020 with a consolidation between health/wellbeing and beauty;\n- \u00b7 secondly, global digitalisation, because beauty and digital are a  perfect  match.  Discovering  beauty  and  buying products  online  has  never  been  easier.  Digital  is  a tremendous  booster  for  the  beauty  market,  a  trend  that intensified in 2020;\n- \u00b7 thirdly,  premiumisation:  consumers  are  ready  to  pay  more and  trade  up  for  products  with  new  benefits,  better performance and superior quality;\n- \u00b7 finally,  increased penetration of beauty all over the world. First, because of e-commerce, which is extending our reach far beyond the limits of traditional distribution, especially in emerging economies. Also because of the many areas that remain to be explored in terms of categories and countries. And  finally,  because  there  are  always  new  consumer targets, with the expansion of the middle classes related to urbanisation, an ageing population, male consumers, etc.\n\n## 1.2.4. Meeting the global demand for beauty\n\nWith \u20ac27.99 billion in net sales and 85,392 employees in 2020, L'Or\u00e9al is the world leader in beauty.\n\nBuilding  on  a  long-term  vision,  with  a  clear  strategy,  L'Or\u00e9al continues its development by relying on its fundamental assets and  transforming  itself  to  respond  to  the  new  aspirations  of consumers,  employees  and  society.  Because  the  beauty market  is  a  growing  market  with  a  focus  on  the  future,  the Group  is,  now  more  than  ever,  in  a  position  to  seize  all opportunities, strengthen its leadership and ensure tomorrow's success.\n\n## Focus on a single, unique business: beauty, nothing but beauty and all beauty\n\nFor  over  a  century,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  carried  out  a  single  business: creating beauty.\n\nCosmetics  are  rich  in  meaning.  They  allow  each  person  to boost their self-confidence, express their personality and open up to others.\n\nFocusing  on  a  single  business  represents,  more  than  ever,  a major competitive advantage for L'Or\u00e9al. In effect, the Group boasts  more  than  one  hundred  years  of  cosmetic  expertise, talented specialists and an in-depth knowledge of consumers, built  on  a  detailed  knowledge  of  beauty  cultures,  needs, desires  and aspirations in their infinite  diversity.  By  focusing  its energy on a single business, along with an obsession for seizing 'what  is  new  and  fresh',  L'Or\u00e9al  is  able  to  identify  new consumer trends very quickly and respond rapidly.",

Cosmetics is an offer  business:  beauty  is  an  ideal  and  an  ongoing  quest. Consumers  always  want  to  try  new  products,  and  they  are willing to pay  more  for  innovations  that  offer  superb performance, quality and benefits. Because L'Or\u00e9al records a significant share of its sales with new products every year, the Group  has  a  duty  to  be  the  champion  of  cosmetics innovation.\n\nGiven  the  acceleration  of  scientific  and  technological progress, the growing requirements of consumers, L'Or\u00e9al has the  capacity  to  innovate  and  be  the  leader  in  all  areas: formulation, packaging, products, services, experience at the point  of  sale  and  on  line,  personalisation,  brand  image  and reputation,  etc.  Because  the  future  of  beauty  is  limitless,  it  is the  Group's  responsibility  to  offer  maximum  creativity  and inventiveness  through  all  its  brands  to  surprise  and  satisfy consumers.\n\n## A unique development strategy: universalisation\n\nL'Or\u00e9al relies on a single strategy - Universalisation - meaning globalisation  with  detailed  understanding  and  respect  for differences. The goal of the universalisation strategy is to offer bespoke beauty by responding  to  the  specific  aspirations  of consumers  in  every  region  of  the  world.  In  contrast  to standardisation, it is based on careful attention to consumers and a deep respect for the differences in their needs, lifestyles, desires and traditions.\n\nTo  give  full  power  to  Universalisation,  the  strategic  heart of  the  innovation is  based in France, and each major region of the world has its own centre of expertise, which combines the  Research  and  Marketing  operations  and  its  network  of plants and distribution centres to be even more attentive and close to consumers.\n\n## Priority to digital and Beauty Tech\n\nTechnology,  particularly  Beauty  Tech,  is  the  future  of  beauty because  of  the  phenomenal  breakthroughs  in  artificial intelligence,  robotics,  the  Internet  of  Things,  3D  printing, nanotechnology,  biotechnology,  etc.,  which  create  new consumer  expectations  to  live  an  experience  beyond  the products.\n\nToday,  digital  is  fully  integrated  in  the  business,  brands  and jobs,  in  all  countries,  and  relies  on  a  solid  network  of  digital experts  and  close  to  50,000  employees  trained  since  2015. Digital has boosted L'Or\u00e9al's strengths tenfold and represents a  tremendous  booster  of  opportunities  and  growth.  It enhances  the  power  of  brands  and  products,  enriches  the connection  with  consumers  and  creates  experiences,  new services and personalisation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al,  which  is  already  a  digital-first  company,  decided  to be the pioneer, champion and leader of Beauty Tech, in all its areas of application.\n\nBeauty Tech will ensure that beauty for all evolves into beauty for  each  person.  To  achieve  this,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  a  unique strength:  being  the  only  company  that  can  combine  more than  110  years  of  scientific  beauty  expertise  and  knowledge of our consumers with cutting-edge digital excellence.\n\n## Digital technologies are accelerating marketing models for brands, products, services and customer experience.\n\nThe cosmetics market is increasingly digitized and even more competitive  with  the  arrival  of  new  players.  In  this  context, the superior marketing of the Group's brands and products is a key and differentiating factor. The creation and development of  major  brands  prized  by  consumers  around  the  world, the launch of new or innovative franchises, the design of new products  and  services,  will  all  be  essential  and  fundamental assets for the next decade.\n\n## The battle of the New Markets with the goal of conquering one billion new consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set a goal to attract one billion new consumers in the next decade, particularly in the New Markets. Asia Pacific will  be  the  key  area  in  the  battle  for  global  leadership  in a region that could represent a major portion of growth in the beauty market. Although L'Or\u00e9al is already No. 1 in this region, the  potential  here  is  still  enormous,  since  the  Group's  market share is still limited. At the same time, L'Or\u00e9al will also have to accelerate  its  presence  in  Africa,  which  is  the  'next  barrier' for  the  Group  and  pursue  its  growth  in  other  regions  of  the world, where the aim is for market share to catch up with its share in Western Europe.\n\n1",

A portfolio of diverse and complementary brands\n\nTo  meet  the  beauty  expectations  of  consumers  all  over  the world,  the  Group  has  the  richest,  most  varied  and  most powerful  brand  portfolio  in  the  cosmetics  industry.  Moreover, its  brands  are  constantly  being  reinvented  so  that  they  are always a perfect match with local consumer demand.\n\nNew acquisitions  also  regularly  provide  valuable  additions  to this unique portfolio to respond to consumer trends.\n\nSome  of  these  acquisitions  are  global  brands,  such  as  the CeraVe  skincare  brand  in  the  Active  Cosmetics  Division portfolio,  the  Italian  Prada  and  Valentino  brands,  as  well  as\n\nMugler and Azzaro perfumes for L'Or\u00e9al Luxe, Logocos with its vegan  and  organic  concept  for  the  Consumer  Products Division;  and  Pulp  Riot,  which  expands  the  growth  potential of Professional Products.\n\nOther acquisitions aim to extend the Group's geographic scope: the  makeup  brand  Vogue  in  Colombia,  Interbeauty  in  Kenya, Niely Cosmeticos in Brazil, and Stylenanda in South Korea.\n\nThese  acquired  companies,  through  their  integration  and deployment, are helping to accelerate the Group's penetration of their markets and drive organic growth going forward.\n\n## 1.2.6. The bet on research, safety and innovation\n\nInnovation  is  the  key  in  beauty,  because  beauty  is  an  ideal, an  ongoing  quest.  Consumers  always  want  to  try  new products. L'Or\u00e9al's success today and in the future is fed by its permanent  obsession  for  innovation,  which  feeds  into  its performance in all its forms.\n\nWith  3,995  researchers  and  a  budget  of  approximately  3.4% of  sales,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  the  top  Research  and  Innovation  (R&I) force in the cosmetics industry. It is a powerful organisation, in which  the  level  of  expertise  and  wealth  of  scientific  and\n\ntechnical  data  represent  a  significant  asset.  The  Group's laboratories  are  intransigent  about  the  absolute  safety  of  its ingredients,  superior  quality  and  the  effectiveness  of  the formulas, and the sincerity of its claims.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  invests  in  all  areas,  from  Advanced  Research  to formulation and from France to regional centres anchored in the major markets around the world. The Group holds a total of 21 research centres and 13 assessment centres.\n\n## R&I: A VAST ECOSYSTEM OPEN TO THE WORLD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninstitutions\n\n## Global research\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  today  has  a  powerful  Research  and  Innovation  (R&I) model with a level of expertise and a wealth of scientific and technical  data,  which  represent  a  true  asset.  Advanced Research  teams  create,  develop  and  source  raw  materials, drawing on their knowledge of skin and hair from around the world;  the  Applied  Research  teams  then  develop  formula architectures that maximise the performance of assets to meet\n\nconsumer  needs,  and  the  Development  laboratories  create innovative  formulas  with  a  proven  superiority  for  each  brand and continuously renew the major successes to maintain their lead. This innovation model is nurtured by a constant dialogue between  the  laboratories  and  marketing  to  respond  to  the expectations  of  consumers,  supporting  them  with  the  latest technological breakthroughs.\n\n1",

The research centres are grouped  into  three  global  centres  in  France  (Advanced Research, Haircare and Cosmetics). The regional hubs (Japan, US,  China,  India,  South  Africa  and  Brazil)  identify  consumer needs and study their cosmetics habits. The R&I teams build on\n\nthis  rich  seam  of  local  scientific  ecosystems  to  develop collaboration  agreements  and  partnerships  of  excellence. The  data  generated  enables  researchers  to  develop  new products,  that  are  perfectly  in  tune  with  market  needs  and local expectations. The innovations produced are also shared in a coordinated way to promote discussion flows.\n\n## RESEARCH FACILITIES AROUND THE WORLD\n\nResearch and Innovation budget\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u20ac millions\n\n|   2018 |   914 |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2019 |   985 |\n|   2020 |   964 |\n\n## Research and Innovation headcount\n\n|   2018 | 3,993   |\n|--------|---------|\n|   2019 | 4,100   |\n|   2020 | 3,995   |\n\n## Rapid development of hand sanitiser gel in solidarity\n\nIn  the  context of the European solidarity plan announced by the  Group  in  March  2020  as  a  result  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic, the laboratories joined forces (in France, Brazil, the United States and South Africa) to rapidly develop formulas for hand  sanitisers  that  complied  with  the  recommendations  of the authorities. Yet the regulation on biocides does not cover cosmetics.  Opening  regulatory  contexts  and  convincing authorities to make exceptions to allow a cosmetics producer\n\nto place hand sanitiser gels on the market to serve the entire public proved to be a true challenge. The laboratories worked on  adapted formulas  to  prevent  the  risks  of  a  breakdown  in the supply of certain crucial raw materials, such as denatured alcohol.  Thanks  to  the  combined  efforts  of  the  teams,  the Group's  brands  provided  hand  sanitiser  gel  to  hospitals, pharmacies,  staff  in  grocery  stores,  and  not  to  forget  all  the local initiatives serving the many key workers who needed it.\n\n## Number of patents filed\n\n|   2018 |   505 |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2019 |   497 |\n|   2020 |   500 |",

        "page_content": "Business model: economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\n## When ethics rhymes with innovation\n\nIn  order  to  meet  essential  tolerance  requirements  for  its products,  research  was  initiated  in  the  1980s  to  develop alternatives  to  animal  testing  to  assess  the  safety  of  its ingredients  and  its  products.  In  40  years  of  international scientific  collaboration,  major  progress  has  been  made  in reconstructing  increasingly  sophisticated  reconstructed  skin models  (simple  epidermis,  epidermis  +  dermis,  etc.).  These methods led to the end of testing finished products on animals in 1989  and  the  development  of  predictive  evaluation strategies to meet European regulations that prohibit any sale of products containing any ingredient that has been tested on animals.  L'Or\u00e9al  supports  international  regulatory  changes  to promote alternative methods to assess safety without animal testing.\n\n## Better predictions of skin reactions\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al's biologists have just crossed a new boundary in developing a skin model even closer to real skin: it contains a  micro  network  of  blood  vessels  that  mimics  real  life conditions  in  which  the  vessels  supply  the  organism  with oxygen  and  nutrients  and  remove  cellular  waste  and  CO2. This advance is the fruit of a collaboration with an expert team in  microfluidics  from  the  University  of  Tokyo.  It  makes  the model a  reliable  predictive  tool  for  skin  and  systemic evaluations. The scientific community made no mistake about it,  since  this  work  was  awarded the Applied Research Award at the last Congress of the International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists (IFSCC).\n\n## Sustainable innovation\n\n## Green Sciences\n\nIn the context of its L'Or\u00e9al For the Future programme, L'Or\u00e9al decided to place its activity within the boundaries that can be supported  by  Earth  to  remain  a  habitat  favourable  for  the development of human life. Researchers are continuing their quest for performance in products that incorporate environmental emergency in a responsible manner. Through a set  of  scientific  disciplines  grouped  together  under  the  term 'Green  Sciences',  our  processes  for  the  preparation  and production of cosmetics will evolve significantly over the next ten years. Major progress in environmental sciences, agronomy and biotechnology allow the launch of producing assets  from  environmentally  friendly  and  high-performance renewable raw materials by drawing on the full power of living organisms to open the way to unprecedented performances. This  transformation  will  be  made  progressively  within  our products  by  firstly combining  ingredients  coming  from traditional chemistry with ingredients born  from  Green Sciences within the same formula. This passage through hybrid products  will  only  be  one  step  while  waiting  to  benefit  from renewable resources for all cosmetics categories.\n\n## Solid shampoo\n\nThis  is  a  shampoo  that  takes  the  form  of  a  bar  of  soap  and fulfils the same functions as a liquid. 100% concentrated, these travel  products  are  praised  by  young  generations  for  their practicality  and  respect  for  the  planet.  Composed  of  a majority  of  plant-based  raw  materials,  they  have  been formulated dry by limiting the volume of water necessary for rinsing: an analysis of the life cycle by an external organisation confirmed that they are more respectful of the environment. The Group's first solid shampoos were sold in 2020, primarily by Garnier under the Ultra-Doux brand.\n\n## The most sustainable research centre in Brazil\n\nLocated  on  the  island  of  Bom  Jesus,  at  the  edge  of  the technology  park  of  the  Federal  University  of  Rio  de  Janeiro, the  Rio  de  Janeiro  Research  and  Innovation  Centre  has received  an  LEED  Platinum  certification,  the  highest  level  of Leadership  in  Energy  and  Environmental  Design,  a  building environmental  label recognised  in over 160 countries. This  international  recognition  takes  into  consideration  the building's  sustainability  in  its  configuration,  use  of  water  and energy,  waste  management,  respect  for  biodiversity  of  the surrounding area and the quality of air and the environment offered by this workplace to its employees.\n\n## Netlock, the cream of sunscreens\n\nSunscreens  are  very  specific  cosmetic  products  since  they address  a  health  challenge,  which  is  to  protect  skin  from  the damage caused by the sun while providing the most pleasant experience possible. Designing a sunscreen involves combining incompatible  elements:  ensuring  high  sun  protection  with  an easy  application  and  offering  good  appearance  on  the  skin while ensuring a comfortable application. The more pleasant a sunscreen  is,  the  more  consumers  will  want  to  use  it  and  the more they will be protected.\n\nAt  the  end  of  three  years  of  research  to  obtain  a  perfectly homogeneous  film  that  is  easily  spread  onto  the  skin,  the laboratories developed a polymer that makes oils into gel and stabilises the emulsions in a wide range of textures (cream, gel, milk,  spray,  etc.).  This  new  technology,  protected  by  nine patents,  offers  a  very  light,  almost  invisible  film,  that  neither sticks nor shines, leaves  no  white  trace,  but  remains homogeneous to ensure high protection. In addition, this film does not come off, and not only is it resistant to water, but also to sweat and sand.\n\n1",

Until  now,  research  has been  particularly  focused  on  a  detailed  inventory  of  the microbial  populations  that  colonise  our  body.  But  with improved  tools,  today  it  is  possible  to  plan  the  study  of  the functions  fulfilled  by  these  populations;  this  is  still  a  relatively unexplored  research  territory,  which  should  contribute  to perfecting our knowledge of this area. Such as, for example, succeeding in connecting the presence of certain bacteria to a  given  skin  disorder,  or  detecting  and  characterising  the molecules  whether  they  are  directly  produced  by  the  skin and  transformed  by  the  microbiome  or  whether  they  are directly produced by the skin microbiome. Being a partner in this  consortium  gives  access  to  an  exchange  of  knowledge, leading-edge tools and research conducted by expert teams with whom dedicated collaborations can be initiated.\n\n## First step in high-tech cosmetics\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  signed a   licensing  agreement  with  Micreos, a start -up  specialised  in  bacterial  biotechnologies  to  use  its endolysin,  a  type  of  active  protein  in  cosmetics,  based  on mechanisms  used  by  bacteriophages,  which  are  specific bacterial predators naturally present on  the  skin. This technology  permits  us,  for  the  first  time,  to  target  only  the undesirable bacteria of the skin flora  that  are  responsible  for various disorders, while sparing those that are desirable. This is a key point in the treatment of eczema, for example.\n\n## Digital\n\n## Apps boosted with Artificial Intelligence\n\nL'Or\u00e9al R&I and  ModiFace  have  introduced  the  first personalised skin diagnostic, based on 15 years of research on skin aging.  Using  deep  learning  methods,  the  artificial intelligence algorithm was trained with 4,500 selfies for different populations  of  women  in  different  lighting  conditions.  The results,  which  were  validated  by  dermatologists,  showed  a high  level  of  precision  obtained  with  photo  conditions  (light, telephone position) similar to those for consumers. Women thus have a reliable diagnosis to better understand the ageing of their skin and, with Vichy SkinConsult AI for example, can find a skincare to suit them.\n\n## Perso, the first personalised device\n\nAt  the  2020  CES  international  Consumer  Electronics  Show  in Las Vegas, L'Or\u00e9al introduced Perso, the new digital product in the service of the beauty of tomorrow, which comes out of the  Research  Tech  Incubator.  Perso  offers  to  produce personalised  skin  care,  lipsticks  or  foundations  directly  at home: thanks to the power of Artificial Intelligence, the level of personalisation  increases  over  time  by  integrating  new  data collected on the skin and the environment (weather, UV index, pollution) and the personal preferences of clients.\n\n## 1.2.7. Operations: expertise and services closer to consumers for lasting performance\n\nThe Operations Division harnesses the most specialised, agile, effective and  connected  technological  expertise,  from packaging  design  and  product  development,  sourcing  and production through to distribution of all the Group's products, in  order  to  enable  the  brands  to  offer  consumers  worldwide the most advanced cosmetic solutions.\n\nThe  Operations  Division  guarantees  consumers  compliance with  strict  standards  of  quality,  safety,  security  and  societal and environmental responsibility all over the world.\n\n## At the forefront of new technologies to better serve consumers with increasing demands\n\nRelying on an approach of operational excellence conducted for  years,  Industry  4.0  is  at  the  core  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Operations Division.  As  a  result,  the  integration  of  new  technologies  all along the value chain responds specifically both to the new challenges of personalisation, agility and traceability expected  by  consumers  and  to  the  new  needs  of  its employees:  simplification,  real-time  access  to  data,  new capacities  related,  for  example,  to  the  use  of  virtual  reality, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, etc.\n\nFor  product  development,  3D  printing  of  prototypes  for products  and/or  functional  packaging  components  reduces development  times  and  therefore  brings  products  to  the market faster.  This  fast  prototyping  ensures  an  agile  response to  consumers'  new  consumer  beauty  expectations  and cosmetic  trends.  In  2020,  32  L'Or\u00e9al  sites  (packaging  design centres, packaging  labs, plants) were  equipped  with 3D  printing  technology.  For  design,  a  total  of  more  than 10,000 packaging prototypes were 3D printed in 2020.\n\nIn  production,  the  combination  of  technologies  such  as 3D printing, artificial intelligence, connected objects (Internet of Things, IoT), cobots (collaborative robots) and virtual reality are new tools to assist operators in production and to develop new, agile and more flexible production lines.\n\nIn traceability and productivity, the IoT and data management (Big Data) open up exciting prospects for improving the supply chain,  creating  smoother  flows  for  the  customer  experience, managing  the  omni-channel  experience  and  increased interaction with consumers.",

        "page_content": "## PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nBusiness model: economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\n## At the centre of design and development is innovation in responsible packaging\n\nThe packaging of a product is the first identifying link between a brand and its consumers. Beyond its technical performance and its  function,  packaging  is  a  key  differentiating  factor  for the  product  and  therefore  for  the  value  perceived  by  the consumer. Every year, the L'Or\u00e9al teams specialised in design, packaging innovation and product development rely on the expertise of the materials and packaging laboratories to offer leading-edge  innovations  on  all  continents.  L'Or\u00e9al  filed 500 patents for packaging and processes in 2020.\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  committed  to  an  eco-design process  for  sustainable  packaging  and  has  very  significantly intensified  its  progress  in  recent  years.  A  six-step  approach: Recycle  using  recycled  or  recyclable  materials;  Reduce packaging volume and weight; Replace high-impact materials with recycled materials or materials from renewable resources; Recharge at home; Refill at points of sale; Reinvent formulas appropriate for packaging.\n\nBy the end of 2020, the social or environmental profile of 96% of new or redesigned products have been improved for all of the  Group's  brands.  By  2025,  100%  of  the  Group's  plastic packaging will be refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable.  By  2030,  100%  of  the  plastics  used  in  L'Or\u00e9al's products' packaging will be either from recycled or bio-based sources.  In  2020,  within  an  innovative  partnership,  L'Or\u00e9al, LanzaTech  and  Total  achieved  a  global  first  with  the production  of  the  first  sustainable  packaging  from  captured and recycled carbon emissions. In addition, L'Or\u00e9al continues to  invest  in  biotechnology  in  the  service  of  plastic  recycling with Carbios in particular.\n\n## A Purchasing programme combining economic, environmental and social value\n\nTo  accompany  the  Group's  growth,  the  Purchasing  teams select the most cost-effective suppliers in accordance with the L'Or\u00e9al  Buy  &  Care  responsible  purchasing  policy.  They manage  their  performance,  with  suppliers,  by  monitoring precise indicators relating to social, environmental and ethical criteria and through their ability to innovate and to meet the Group's  requirements  in  terms  of  quality,  service  and competitiveness.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al builds solid relationships with its suppliers which makes it possible  to  work  with  them  on  their  supply  chains  for responsible  sourcing  and  ensure  the  agility,  reliability  and traceability  of  sourcing.  In  2020,  the  Group  conducted 1,268 social audits, a total of more than 13,600 since 2006.\n\nFurthermore,  by  creating  the  Solidarity  Sourcing  responsible purchasing programme, L'Or\u00e9al chose as from 2010 to enable sourcing  from  suppliers  with  an  inclusive  solidarity  model, in other words, companies  that  offer  employment  to vulnerable  workers  and  people  in  economically  or  socially disadvantaged communities, such as people with a disability, the long-term unemployed or fair trade suppliers (see section 4.3.3.5. 'Measures taken in favour of local communities' of this document).  Today,  81,138  persons  have  benefited  from access to employment within the Solidarity Sourcing programme.\n\nIn 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  earned  an  'A'  classification  from  the  CDP  for Supplier Commitment, for its actions to support its suppliers in  order  to  improve  the  environmental  footprint  of  their activities; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al assisted  its  suppliers  to  facilitate  payment  terms  as part of its European solidarity plan to face the health crisis.\n\n## Manufacturing performance that relies on a global system of operational excellence\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has 40 plants spread all over the world, equipped with the  very  latest  technologies  and  advances  in  automation, in  close  proximity  to  consumers  in  the  major  growth  markets. This  network  of  plants  adapts  constantly  to  incorporate acquisitions and embrace external innovations. It is completed by  production  sub-contracting,  to  meet  temporary  demand peaks in the case of specific technologies (make-up pencils, soaps, etc.) or sometimes for purchases of finished products.\n\nThe  Group's  manufacturing  organisation  is  also  based  on specialisation  by  technology  (haircare,  skincare,  makeup, perfumes,  etc.)  to  maximise  best  practices,  increase  agility, improve productivity, adapt more easily to the specific needs of local clients and consumers, and to optimise investments.\n\n1",

This process  is  based  on  the  close  involvement  of  all employees  in  technical  and  technological  areas  relating  to safety, quality, ergonomics,  environmental  impact  and production capacity, while at the same time controlling costs.\n\n## Product quality and safety: a priority\n\nOffering consumers the highest quality product is an absolute priority.  Over several decades, the Group has set up a single product  quality  and  safety  management  programme  that applies  to  all  its  plants  and  subsidiaries  around  the  world. In 2020, 92% of L'Or\u00e9al plants were ISO 9001 (Quality  Management)  certified  and  100%  were  ISO  22716 (Best cosmetics manufacturing practices) compliant.",

        "page_content": "1.\n\nBusiness model: economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\n## Safety of L'Or\u00e9al's men and women is at the centre of the model\n\nIn  2020,  the  Safety  Management System, which is applied to the Group's teams and to all administrative sites, laboratories, plants,  distribution  centres  and  stores,  was  recognised  by RoSPA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents), which granted  17  awards  to  L'Or\u00e9al,  including  winner  of  the Commercial  and  Business  Services  Sector  award  in  for  the administrative  sites  in  Brazil,  second  place  in  the  Transport, Storage and Distribution category for the Bury (UK) distribution centre,  and  the  Corporate  Health  and  Safety  Team  of  the Year Award.\n\n## At  the  heart  of  production:  environmental protection\n\nThe  Group's  environmental  policy  is  intended  to  roll  out  best practices in sustainable production  to  limit the direct environmental  impact  of  the  Group's  business  activities  and preserve biodiversity and resources: energy efficiency, the use of  renewable  energies,  optimisation  of  water  consumption and  recycling,  preservation  of  biodiversity,  and  reduction  of waste production, and more. The 2020 results were impacted by  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  particularly  because  of  the  6% drop  in  production  from  2019,  a  delay  that  affected  certain projects  and a  change  in  the  categories  of  products manufactured by the sites (fewer makeup products and more skincare,  hair  colours  and  hair  care  products).  In  this  specific context,  L'Or\u00e9al  insisted  on  continuing  and  prioritising,  where possible, the programmes to reduce its environmental footprint (continuation  of  projects  for  the  use  of  renewable  energy everywhere  in  the  world,  start-up  of  new  water  treatment plants in France, for example) with, since 2005, a decline of 81%  in  CO2  emissions  in  absolute  value  (up  3  points  versus 2019), -49% in water consumption per unit of finished product (down  2  points  from  2019,  notably  due  to  changes  in production), and -37% in waste production per unit of finished product (an improvement of 2 points over 2019, favoured by the decline in activity). It should be noted that 96% of residual waste  was  recovered  in  2020,  meaning  that  it  was  reused, recycled or used for energy recovery.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE  PRODUCTION  (PLANT  AND  DISTRIBUTION CENTRES COMPARED WITH 2005)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50 of L'Or\u00e9al's industrial sites (1) were 'carbon neutral' at yearend 2020, an increase of 43% since 2019, including 19 plants (Libramont in  Belgium,  Settimo  in  Italy,  Burgos  and  Alcal\u00e1  de Henares  in Spain, Rambouillet, Ormes,  Gauchy,  Vichy and  La  Roche-Posay,  Tours  in France, Karlsruhe and Salzhemmendorf  in  Germany,  Yichang  and  Suzhou  in  China, Montreal in Canada, Florence, Franklin and Piscataway in the United States, and Funza in Colombia) (see 'Making increased use  of  renewable  energy',  section  4.3.1.3.1.,  A/  Fighting climate change, in this document).\n\nAt  year-end  2020,  there  were  five  Waterloop  Factory  plants (Burgos in Spain, Settimo in Italy, Vorsino in Russia, Libramont in Belgium and Mexico City in Mexico): all the water required by the  utilities  (equipment  cleaning,  steam  production,  etc.) comes from reused water or water recycled in a closed loop on  the  site  (see  'Waterloop  Factory  plant  concept',  section 4.3.1.3.1., B/ Preserving water resources, in this document).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  for  over  25  years  to  environmental leadership was recognised in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, with the best possible rating by the CDP (2) .  L'Or\u00e9al  is  thus  the only company in the world, out of more than 9,600 companies assessed,  to  receive  a  triple  'A'  ranking  for  the  fifth consecutive year, for its commitment and results in each of the key  areas  for  environmental  protection:  the  fight  against climate change, sustainable water management and the fight against deforestation.",

It  is  responsible  for making sure  that  the  products  are  delivered  under  optimum conditions, at the right time and at the best cost. On average, across all channels, L'Or\u00e9al delivers two orders every second around the world and distributes more than 6 billion products.\n\nThis  order  rate  is  heavily  impacted  by  the  acceleration  in e-commerce  sales.  The  supply  chain  and  its  distribution centres  were  particularly  strategic  and  responsive  in  2020 to manage this acceleration in the context of the health crisis to ensure deliveries to consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  unique  in  the  cosmetics  market  in  that  it  serves  a global market through a diverse range of distribution channels (see  below)  with  a  portfolio  of  many  different  beauty  and cosmetic  product  categories.  L'Or\u00e9al  continuously  optimises all information  flows  and  physical  flows  from  suppliers to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe goal is to increase agility to handle market variations on all distribution channels and to adapt to market expectations in real  time.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  therefore  implemented  a  planning strategy for  the  manufacturing, sales and distribution process (S&OP, Sales and Operations Planning) in order to deliver an optimum service to the Group's customers. Digitalisation of the Supply Chain and data management are critical challenges, and represent a real opportunity, especially in the retail sector and in  stores  managed  directly  by  L'Or\u00e9al.  It  can  provide  a comprehensive view of business in a store, as well as improve understanding of the consumer purchase journey.\n\nThe supply chain network composed of 149 distribution centres is a  strategic  lever  to  ensure  agile  coverage  of  market challenges  and  expand  our  service  offer.  To  create  a  more adapted  supply  chain,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  investing  in  its  distribution centres to transform them  progressively into Fulfilment Centres: powered by automation and data, Fulfilment Centres will be able to manage a panel of consumer services, such as\n\npersonalisation,  preparation  of  boxes,  bespoke  delivery  and more. They will  facilitate  the  interoperability  of  inventories  for omni-channel management and increase product traceability for  greater  transparency for consumers. In China, the Suzhou centre has led this transformation into a Fulfilment Centre by investing  in  order  planning,  automation  and  ergonomics  to meet  the  strong  demand  for  e-commerce  in  the  Chinese market.\n\nSustainable  development  is  also  central  to  the  supply  chain strategy. In order to reduce its environmental footprint, L'Or\u00e9al is  co-creating  with  carriers  low-carbon  multimodal  solutions adapted  to  the  specific  features  of  each  geographic  zone (hydrogen engines, green delivery, reduced air freight, etc.). To  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  its  centres,  L'Or\u00e9al  is increasing the use of 100% renewable energies everywhere in the  world  and  is  also  targeting  the  elimination  of  the  use  of single use plastic in its centres.\n\n1",

As  anticipated  and announced,  the  Group  returned  to  growth  in  the  second half,  with  a  fourth  quarter  in  acceleration  at  +4.8% (1) ,  and won significant market shares.\n\nThanks to its strength in digital and e-commerce, which has again increased considerably during the crisis, L'Or\u00e9al has been  able  to  maintain  a  close  relationship  with  all  its consumers  and  compensate  to  a  large  extent  for  the closure  of  points  of  sale.  As  a  result,  sales  achieved  in e-commerce (2) rose  sharply  by  +62% (2) ,  across  all  Divisions and  all  regions,  reaching  the  record  level  of  26.6%  of  the total Group's sales for the year.\n\nThe Active Cosmetics Division had a record year driven by a dynamic skincare market and the remarkable success of its brands,  recommended  by  healthcare  professionals.  The Consumer  Products  Division  returned  to  equilibrium  in  the second half of the year despite the weight of makeup, and increased its market share in the other major categories. The Professional Products Division, significantly impacted by the closure of salons in the first half of the year, bounced back strongly  in  the  second  and  significantly  outperformed  the market over the year as a whole. Lastly, L'Or\u00e9al Luxe, in an extremely  difficult  context,  also  outperformed  the  market and even returned to growth in the last quarter.\n\nBy geographic Zone, performance was contrasted. In Western  Europe  and  North  America,  growth  was impacted by the development of the pandemic and public\n\n## 1.3.1.1. Overview of the results for 2020\n\n- \u00b7 Sales: \u20ac27.99 billion;\n- \u00b7 -4.1% like-for-like (1) ,\n- \u00b7 -3.6% at constant exchange rates,\n- \u00b7 -6.3% based on reported figures;\n\nhealth measures, but L'Or\u00e9al gained market share in many countries.  In  the  New  Markets,  the  Group  saw  a  return  to growth  in  all  Zones  in  the  second  half  of  the  year. The performance of China is spectacular and its contribution to the performance of the Group is important.\n\nAfter  demonstrating  its  resistance  over  the  first  half  of  the year, the  Group  engaged  the  second  half  with  a determined and virtuous dynamic: launching major innovations, reinvesting in business drivers leading to a return to  growth  like-for-like,  with  flexibility  and  rigorous  cost control allowing for an improvement in profitability. Over the year  as  a  whole,  and  in  spite  of  the  crisis,  L'Or\u00e9al maintained an operating margin of 18.6%, and generated strong operating cash flow.\n\nThe Group's non-financial performance  was  equally remarkable.  For  the  fifth  consecutive  year,  L'Or\u00e9al  was recognised  by  the  CDP  as  a  global  leader  in  sustainable development for its actions to fight climate change, protect forests  and  manage  water  sustainably.  In  addition,  the Group was ranked in the top ten among 9,000 companies evaluated by the Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index. L'Or\u00e9al was  also  recognised,  for  the  eleventh  time,  as  one  of  the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. Finally,  in  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme with ambitious new sustainability commitments for 2030.\n\nDriven  by  the  strength  of  its  strategic  choices  and  a determined dynamic across the year, L'Or\u00e9al has adapted to this unprecedented context and terrible pandemic with speed and agility, accelerated all of its transformations and will emerge stronger.\n\nAt the beginning of this new year, which remains marked by uncertainty  regarding  the  evolution  of  the  pandemic,  but also by consumer's appetite for beauty that remains intact across  the  world,  we  are  confident  in  our  capacity  to outperform the market again this year and, subject to the evolution of the sanitary crisis, achieve a year of growth in sales and profits.'\n\n- \u00b7 Operating profit: \u20ac5.20 billion, 18.6% of the sales;\n- \u00b7 Earnings per share (3) : \u20ac7.30 ;\n- \u00b7 Net cash flow (4) : \u20ac5.48 billion, an increase of +8.9% ;\n- \u00b7 Dividend per share (5) : \u20ac4.00, an increase of +3.9%.\n\n1",

The  health crisis has shown more than ever how essential the hairdressing sector  is  and  has  boosted  the  underlying  trends  that  the Division  had  anticipated:  the  digitalisation  of  salons,  the development  of  freelance  stylists,  and  the  explosion  of e-commerce.\n\nAll  geographic  Zones  saw  a  return  to  growth  in  the  second half,  with  record  performance in the United States, driven by the  power  of  the  SalonCentric  distribution  channel.  Europe also  saw a   remarkable  recovery.  The  Division  posted  very strong growth in China, particularly on Tmall.\n\nThe number one category for growth was haircare, led by a particularly dynamic K\u00e9rastase, which saw double-digit growth over the year, driven by Genesis and Blond Absolu, as well as the successful launch of Pro Longer by L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel. In hair  colour,  Shades  EQ  by  Redken  recorded  another  year  of strong  growth.  Steampod  by  L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel  confirmed its success.\n\n## Consumer Products\n\n## The  Consumer  Products  Division  ended  the  year  at  -4.7% like-for-like and -8.2% based on reported figures.\n\nThe Division  saw  a  return  to  equilibrium  in  the  second  half  of the year, driven by Garnier and L'Or\u00e9al Paris. This dynamic was the fruit  of  a  strong  and  successful  innovation  plan,  'Back  to Beauty' initiatives conducted in partnership with retailers, and powerful  media  investments.  In  addition,  the  Division  has further accelerated  in  e-commerce,  particularly  in  the United States.\n\nPublic  health  measures  heavily  impacted  the  makeup  market. Despite its high exposure to this category, the Division grew faster than  the  market  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  and  gained market  share  in  its  other  major  categories.  Hair  colour  saw double-digit  growth.  Haircare  was  driven  by  the  confirmed success of Fructis Hair Food and Elseve Dream Long, and the very strong  start  of  Elseve  Full  Resist  and  Ultra  Doux  shampoo  bars. Skincare  accelerated  thanks  to  the  success  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris serums  and  the  Fast  Bright  range  by  Garnier,  rolled  out  in emerging  countries.  In  makeup,  the  Division  strengthened  its position, thanks in particular to NYX Professional Makeup and 3CE Stylenanda which benefited from their mastery of digital.\n\nThe Division saw a significant improvement in performance in all Zones in the second half of the year, and notably recorded growth in China, Brazil and Germany.\n\n1",

This performance was the result of strategic decisions to accelerate powerfully  in  e-commerce,  particularly  in  direct-to-consumer, to maintain a strong programme of major global launches and to strengthen its leadership in China.\n\nThe  Division  outperformed  the  market  in  its  three  categories, especially  in  skincare,  driven  by  the  power  of  its  brands, notably Lanc\u00f4me which resisted well, and the growth of Kiehl's and  Helena  Rubinstein.  The  latest  fragrance  launches  My Way by Giorgio Armani, Voce Viva by Valentino and Libre by Yves Saint Laurent -also delivered very strong performances  and,  with  the  resilience  of  established  icons, helped to consolidate our global leadership. Makeup remains the most affected category.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  gained  market  share  in  almost  all  geographic Zones.  It  is  important  to  note  the  strong  performance  of  the Asia Pacific Zone, especially mainland China, as well as many Western European countries. Sales in North America recovered progressively, while positions remain solid in Travel Retail.\n\n## Active Cosmetics\n\nFor  the  second  year  running,  the  Active  Cosmetics  Division achieved record growth of +18.9% like-for-like and +13.0%  based  on  reported  figures,  with  sales  exceeding  the 3-billion-euro mark.\n\nIn  a  slightly  positive  market,  the  unique  relationship  that  the brands have forged with healthcare professionals, combined with  the  growing  consumer  preoccupation  with  health, enabled  the  Division,  particularly  present  in  skincare,  to  post record annual growth, with sales accelerating in the second half.  E-commerce remains the main growth driver, supported by a dynamic digital activation strategy. In-store initiatives also drove growth. Sales grew faster than the market in all Zones, with  exceptional  performance  in  North  America  and  Asia. CeraVe, La Roche-Posay and SkinCeuticals, which are aligned with  consumers'  health  aspirations  and  recommended  by medical professionals, recorded very strong growth. CeraVe in particular  is  now  one  of  the  top  five  dermocosmetics  brands and almost  doubled  in  size,  driven  by  exceptional  growth  in North America and a promising outlook for sales globally. Sales of SkinCeuticals and La Roche-Posay grew well ahead of the market in all Zones. The fourth quarter marked  an acceleration, with all Zones and all the major brands posting growth, particularly Vichy which benefited from the launch of the anti-ageing serum Liftactiv Supreme H.A. Epidermic Filler.\n\n## Multi-division summary by geographic zone\n\n## Western Europe\n\nThe  Zone  ended  the  year  at  -10.3%  like-for-like,  and  -9.2% based on reported figures. Due to the health crisis, the market was  impacted  by  government  measures  in  the  countries: lockdowns,  and  the  closure  of  hair  salons,  perfumeries  and department  stores.  The  fall  in  European  air  travel  and  a marked  downturn  in  tourism  over  the  summer  also  had  an impact on consumption. Makeup and sun protection products were hit particularly hard, while other categories fared better. The market declined by around 15% over the year, improving in  the  second  half,  but  remaining  negative.  Against  this backdrop,  L'Or\u00e9al  significantly  outperformed  the  market, thanks to its digital leadership and very strong growth in online sales,  the  launch  of  major  innovations  and  well  supported marketing plans. The Group strengthened its leadership in most countries,  particularly  France,  the  United  Kingdom  and  Italy. It  also  gained  market  share  in  all  its  strategic  categories. Performance  was  especially  noteworthy  in  skincare,  with L'Or\u00e9al  Paris,  La  Roche-Posay  and  CeraVe  performing  well, in fragrance with the continued success of Libre by Yves Saint Laurent, and  in haircare with K\u00e9rastase and  Garnier strengthening their positions.\n\n## North America\n\nThe Zone ended the year at -7.4% like-for-like and -8.8% based on reported figures. Due to its footprint in brick-and-mortar and makeup,  the  Zone  was  heavily  impacted  by  lockdown measures  in  the  second  quarter.  Despite  the  pandemic  and social  and  political  upheavals,  all  Divisions  managed  to accelerate sales in e-commerce, which have almost doubled, and quickly  adapted to shifts  across  channels  of  distribution. The Group was able to seize the trends in skincare and gain market  share,  while  at  the  same  time  increasing  its  already significant share of the hair colour market. After a slowdown in the first half of the year, the Zone returned to positive territory in the second. The Consumer Products Division stabilised in the second half,  thanks  to  strong  growth  in  skincare  and  market share gains in hair colour. L'Or\u00e9al Luxe accelerated with strong fragrance  launches  and  freed  up  resources  to  re-invest  in consumer touchpoints and digital transformation. The Professional  Products  Division  gained  market  share  and achieved a solid performance in the second half of the year, thanks  in  particular  to  SalonCentric.  The  Active  Cosmetics Division  performed  remarkably  well,  notably  with  CeraVe,  La Roche-Posay  and  SkinCeuticals,  significantly  outperforming a dynamic market and winning important market share gains.\n\n## New markets\n\n- \u00b7 Asia Pacific : the Zone grew by +3.5% like-for-like and +1.5% based  on  reported  figures,  with  fourth-quarter  growth  at +16.6%  like-for-like  and  +12.5%  based  on  reported  figures. Mainland China grew +27.0% like-for-like and +24.1% based on  reported  figures.  The  market  recovered  significantly  in the second half, growing around +4% in the year, boosted by  strong  omnichannel  demand  for  selective  brands  and very  dynamic  e-commerce.  Consumers'  quest  for  higher performance  and  superior  product  quality  continued  the premiumisation trend while various festivals and promotional  campaigns  stimulated  growth.  L'Or\u00e9al  China significantly  outperformed  the  market  with  double-digit growth  in  all  Divisions.  The  unique  combination  of  our beauty  expertise,  superior  innovations,  digital  leadership and omnichannel distribution  structure  enables  us  to  offer iconic  brands  that  engage  and  win  Chinese  consumers. During the 11.11 festival, L'Or\u00e9al strengthened its leadership in skincare,  thanks  to  Kiehl's,  Helena  Rubinstein  and",

Our megabrands Lanc\u00f4me and L'Or\u00e9al Paris ended the year as the No.1 selective and mass-market beauty brands respectively on Tmall.\n\nIn the rest of the Asia Pacific Zone, the situation improved in the second half of the year. Sales increased in the countries least affected  by  the  pandemic  such  as  Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam. The makeup market remained depressed,  but  the  marketing  shift  towards  haircare  and skincare led to steady  growth  quarter  on  quarter. E-commerce was a powerful growth driver. In India, after a first half  marked  by  store  closures,  both  haircare  and skincare returned to growth. Hong Kong suffers from a lack of tourism. The L'Or\u00e9al Luxe and Active Cosmetics Divisions achieved  significant  market  share  gains  in  all  the  main markets,  particularly  in  skincare.  The  growth  of  Active Cosmetics  was  driven  by  La  Roche-Posay  and  CeraVe. The  Consumer  Products  Division  saw  an  improvement  in skincare, thanks to the performance of Garnier.\n\n- \u00b7 Latin  America :  the  Zone  is  at  -1.5%  like-for-like  and  -17.1% based on reported figures. The Zone was severely impacted by the pandemic with the widespread closure of points of sale.  Performance  was  very  contrasted  from  one  Division and  quarter  to  another,  with  a  strong  recovery  in  the second half of the year. All Divisions saw a return to growth in the second half, particularly the Active Cosmetics Division which  posted  double-digit  growth.  The  focus  on  digital strengthened consumer engagement and boosted\n\ne-commerce,  which  recorded  triple-digit  growth,  most notably in Brazil and Mexico. Our innovations as well as our flagship  brands  and  products  drove  the  growth,  most notably in haircare and skincare. Brazil recorded exceptional  performance  overall,  growing  each  quarter and winning market share in Latin America's largest beauty market,  a  result  of  the  far-reaching  transformation  of  the business initiated well before the crisis. In Mexico, although challenges remain, the business is stabilising, with the Active Cosmetics  Division  posting  double-digit  growth  over  the year  as  a  whole,  and  the  Consumer  Products  Division seeing a return to growth in the fourth quarter.\n\n- \u00b7 Eastern  Europe : the  Zone  was  at  -4.9%  like-for-like  and - 11.8% based on reported figures. All countries and markets were affected by the pandemic and lockdown measures, with the exception of dermocosmetics which continued to grow.  The  Czech  Republic/Slovakia/Hungary  hub  resisted well,  Romania  and  Ukraine  recorded  growth,  while  Russia and Turkey were hit harder due to the depressed economic context.  The  Active  Cosmetics,  Professional  Products  and L'Or\u00e9al Luxe Divisions gained significant market share, while the  Consumer  Products  Division  maintained  its  positions. E-commerce growth was very dynamic.\n- \u00b7 Africa, Middle East : the Zone was at -3.3% like-for-like and -9.9% based  on  reported  figures,  with  good  performance  in  the second half, despite the lockdown measures implemented in the countries. Growth was driven by Morocco and Egypt, and by the Active Cosmetics Division. All Divisions achieved market share gains.\n\n## 1.3.1.3. 2020 Consolidated results\n\n## OPERATING PROFITABILITY AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n\n|                                              | 2018      | 2018         | 2019      | 2019         | 2020      | 2020         |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|\n|                                              | \u20ac million | % 2018 sales | \u20ac million | % 2019 sales | \u20ac million | % 2020 sales |\n| Net sales                                    | 26,937.4  | 100.0%       | 29,873.6  | 100.0%       | 27,992.1  | 100%         |\n| Cost of sales                                | -7,331.6  | 27.2%        | -8,064.7  | 27.0%        | -7,532.3  | 26.9%        |\n| Gross profit                                 | 19,605.8  | 72.8%        | 21,808.9  | 73.0%        | 20,459.8  | 73.1%        |\n| Research and innovation                      | -914.4    | 3.4%         | -985.3    | 3.3%         | -964.4    | 3.4%         |\n| Advertising and promotion                    | -8,144.7  | 30.2%        | -9,207.8  | 30.8%        | -8,647.9  | 30.9%        |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses | -5,624.7  | 20.9%        | -6,068.3  | 20.3%        | -5,638.5  | 20.1%        |\n| OPERATING PROFIT                             | 4,922.0   | 18.3%        | 5,547.5   | 18.6%        | 5,209.0   | 18.6%        |\n\nGross profit , at 20,459 million euros, came out at 73.1% of sales, compared  with  73.0%  in  2019,  an  improvement  of  10  basis points.\n\nResearch & Innovation expenses increased by 10 basis points, at 3.4% of sales.\n\nAdvertising  and  promotion  expenses increased  by  10  basis points, at 30.9% of sales.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses , at 20.1% of sales, have been reduced by 20 basis points.\n\nOverall, operating  profit decreased  by  6.1%  to  5,209  million euros,  and  amounted  to  18.6%  of  sales,  stable  compared to 2019.\n\n1",

Following the recommendations of the Nominations and Governance  Committee,  the  Board  decided  on  new governance and a succession plan at the head of the Group. As  the  Company's  articles  of  association  do  not  provide  for any  exception  to  the  legal  retirement  age  of  65  years,  Mr Jean-Paul Agon must hand over his duties as Chief Executive Officer before July 2021.

The Board announced its intention  to  renew  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  mandate  as Chairman, a position he has held since 2011, and to appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFurthermore,  in  his  exchanges  with  the  Nominations  and Governance  Committee,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  with  the agreement of the Board of Directors and the full support of Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  wished  to  maintain  the  role  of Deputy CEO, a position held by Mr Nicolas Hieronimus at his side  since  2017.

If  the  Annual  General  Meeting  approves  the proposed  resolutions,  the  Board  of  Directors  will  be composed  of  16  directors,  14  appointed  by  the  Meeting and two directors representing the employees.\n\nAnnual General Meeting to be held on 20 April 2021: in view of  the  extension  of  the  state  of  medical  emergency  until 1 June  2021  and  the  measures  that  could  prevent shareholders  from  being  physically  present,  the  Annual General Meeting usually held at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s in Paris  is  likely  to  be  held  on  a  restricted  attendance basis  under  special  rules  applicable  to  'closed  doors'  ( \u00e0 huis clos )  shareholder meetings, at L'Or\u00e9al's headquarters, 41, rue Martre in Clichy.\n\nFor this reason and in accordance with Order No. 2020-321 of 25  March  2020  as  amended  by  Order  No.  2020-1497 of  2  December 2020, the Board of Directors in its meeting of 11 February 2021 gave full powers to the Chairman and CEO to  hold  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on  such  a  basis  if  the circumstances so require, pursuant to the specific regulations that will be in force at such time.\n\nShareholders  will  be  informed  of  the  arrangements  for  the Annual General Meeting no later than the date of publication in  the  BALO  ( Bulletin  des  Annonces  L\u00e9gales  Obligatoires ) of  the  convening  notice  of  the  Annual  General  Meeting planned for 31 March.

        "page_content": "1. PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 Financial Results and Corporate Social Responsability commitments\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al and the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nIn  the  totally  unexpected  context  of  the  Covid-19  health crisis, the commitment of L'Or\u00e9al's employees proved to be stronger  than  ever.  The  mobilisation  of  teams  enabled  the continuity  of  the  Group's  business  activities,  despite  the lockdown periods.\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  it  was  important  to  act  with  its  stakeholders. Strongly mobilised since the start of the crisis in March 2020, L'Or\u00e9al implemented a large-scale Solidarity Plan.\n\nPriority was  given  to  employees  with  major  initiatives implemented to prevent the risks and ensure the safety of everyone:\n\n- \u00b7 by offering masks and hand sanitisers to everyone;\n- \u00b7 by organising telecommuting for eligible positions, which allowed  around  60,000  employees  to  work  remotely  in 2020; and\n- \u00b7 by  setting  up  support  and  assistance  mechanisms accessible  to  all  with  the  mobilisation  of  occupational physicians and social workers; by adapting its methods to enhance  online  training  practices  for  employees  (see section 4.3.2.3 'Training and development of employees throughout their careers' of this document).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  employees  have  also  personally  taken  part  by giving more than 1,200 hours of their time through L'Or\u00e9al's various citizenship programmes.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  also  taken  action  by  providing  close  to 15  million  units  of  hand  sanitiser  and  more  than  4.3  million units  of  products,  mainly  hand  cream  and  shampoo, produced by 70% of its factories worldwide, to healthcare professionals, distributors, suppliers and NGOs in more than 40  countries.  The  Group  is  also  providing  support  to  its partners:  it  has  frozen  payments  receivable  for  more  than 100,000 clients and shortened the leadtime for payments for close to 9,000 suppliers.\n\nTo support the efforts made by non-profit organisations, the L'Or\u00e9al  Foundation  made  1  million  euros  available  to support  people  in  need.  The  'L'Or\u00e9al  Fund  for  Women' endowment  fund  was  also  created  to  support  non-profit organisations that help women all over the world who are in highly  vulnerable  situations  and  victims  of  the  social  and economic crisis.\n\n## 1.3.1.5. L'Or\u00e9al's investment policy responds to long-term objectives\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  a  growing  manufacturing  company  thanks  largely to two types of investments:\n\n- 1. scientific and  manufacturing  investments,  which  are described in several sections of this document (see sections 1.2.6.  'The  bet  on  research,  safety  and  innovation'  and 1.27. 'Operations, expertise and services closer to consumers for lasting performance' of this document); and\n- 2. marketing  investments,  which  are  made  on  an  ongoing basis  and  are  inherent  to  the  Group's  activities  in  the cosmetics  industry.  Indeed,  winning  new  market  share requires  in-depth  and  situation-specific  studies,  as  well  as advertising and promotional expenses attuned not only to the familiarity of brands and their competitive position, but also  to  constant  changes  in  consumers'  aspirations  something that the subsidiaries' sales and marketing teams monitor  constantly.  Lastly,  investments  in  point-of  sale (POS)  advertising  materials  ensure  optimal  presence  for our brands in points of sale.\n\nFor  reasons  relating  to  strategy  and  competition,  L'Or\u00e9al cannot therefore provide any systematic information on future investments.\n\nIn  2020, the Group's investments totalled \u20ac972 million, or 3.5% of  its  sales.  This  level  reflects  the  Group's  constant  efforts  to improve  manufacturing  efficiency,  research  and  digital development performance and enhance brand value.\n\nInvestment  commitments  in  2020  can  be  broken  down  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 production  and  the  physical  supply  chain  represented approximately 30% of total investments;\n- \u00b7 marketing  investments,  including  moulds,  POS  advertising materials and stores accounted for 34%;\n- \u00b7 IT investments spread over all these categories represented 29% of total investments; and\n- \u00b7 research  and  the  head  offices  in  the  different  countries accounted for the remainder.\n\nSee notes 3.2.2., 7.2. and 13.2. to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for more details on these investments.\n\nDespite their strategic nature, none of these investments taken individually is material enough at Group level to warrant more detailed disclosure.",

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): shared and lasting growth\n\n## Priority to Human Capital\n\nAs  our  founder  Eug\u00e8ne  Schueller  declared  with  conviction: 'a  company  is  not  walls  and  machines  but  people,  people and more people.'\n\nThe  Group's  employees,  who  are  strategic  intangible  assets, are one of the Group's main competitive advantages in the long  term,  alongside  its  portfolio  of  brands,  its  governance, Research  and  Innovation,  data  and technology  with  its transformation to Beauty Tech.\n\nThe  Group's  human  and  social  project  revolves  around  two priorities:  the  first  is  individual  performance  development  of employees  and  future  leaders  and  the  second  is  social performance.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has always targeted constant, sustainable growth.\n\nSince  its  very  beginnings,  the  Group  has  been  committed  to developing its presence in all regions of the world by applying the  fundamental  rules  of  a  good  corporate  citizen.  The products  offered  to  consumers  meet  the  highest  quality standards; the Group's social commitments are the same in all its  subsidiaries;  all  production  centres  comply  with  the  same rules  aimed  at  reducing  their  environmental  footprint.  Social audits  are  conducted  on  the  suppliers  of  the  plants  and distribution centres.\n\nEach subsidiary contributes, in accordance with its resources, to the  L'Or\u00e9al  Foundation's  main  programmes,  notably For Women in Science, Beauty for a Better Life or other Group philanthropy initiatives. Above and beyond its solid long-term economic performances, the Company  seeks  to be exemplary and sets itself demanding standards in order to limit its environmental footprint.\n\nMore  consumers  and  more  growth,  for  L'Or\u00e9al,  necessarily imply  more  responsibilities.  The  Group  intends  to  develop  its activity with the utmost respect for the planet, and to improve its social and economic impact on the life of the people and communities that surround it. It is for this reason that, in 2013, in the context of its Sharing Beauty with All programme, and in 2020  with  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  set itself  ambitious  Sustainable  Development  Goals  that  were formalised and structured at a strategic level.\n\n## Assessment of the first generation of 2013-2020 sustainable development commitments, Sharing Beauty with All, and introducing the new 2021-2030 L'Or\u00e9al for the Future target\n\n2020 marked the end of the Sharing Beauty with All programme initiated  in  2013,  the  first  series  of  Group  commitments  to sustainable  development.  Those  commitments  covered  all impacts of the Group and its value chain, from product design to  distribution,  including  the  production  process  and  even  the sourcing of ingredients:\n\n- \u00b7 innovating  sustainably,  which  aims  at  improving  the environmental  and  social  footprint  of  products  (see section 1.2.6. 'The bet on research, safety and innovation' and Chapter 4 'L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility' of this document);\n- \u00b7 producing  sustainably, to reduce  the  environmental footprint  of  the  Group's  plants  and  distribution  centres,  all over  the  world  (see  section  1.2.7.  'Operations,  expertise and services closer to consumers for lasting performance' and  Chapter  4  'L'Or\u00e9al's  Corporate  Social  Responsibility' of this document);\n- \u00b7 living sustainably, to engage with consumers and offer them the  possibility  to  make  sustainable  consumption  choices; and\n- \u00b7 developing sustainably to share growth with all the Group's stakeholders.\n\nToday,  accelerating  the  environmental  and  social  challenges the  world  is  faced  with  calls  for  a  much  more  radical transformation. Since April 2019, seven groups of internal experts have coordinated independent studies and collaborated with outside  partners  and  civil  society  to  define  the  next  steps  in L'Or\u00e9al's sustainable development transformation.\n\nIn  June  2020,  the  Group  announced  its  new  sustainability programme, L'Or\u00e9al for the Future (see section 4.1. 'Introduction'  of  this  document),  with  a  new  series  of ambitious objectives for 2030 based on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 transform L'Or\u00e9al activities to remain within the 'planetary boundaries' defined by environmental science;\n- \u00b7 associate the Group's ecosystem in its transformation for a more sustainable world; and\n- \u00b7 contribute to meeting the great environmental challenges by creating different funds to promote the regeneration of nature,  the  circular  economy  and  women  in  vulnerable situations.\n\n1",

AN ORGANISATION SERVING THE GROUP'S DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Group's organisation responds to a dual challenge: pursuing the strategy which has enabled  L'Or\u00e9al  to  be  successful  over  the  last  110  years  and  at  the  same  time inventing the new L'Or\u00e9al of the future, perfectly matched to an ever-changing world.\n\n## 1.4.1. L'Or\u00e9al S.A.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  is a   French  company,  with  its  head  office  in France.  It  performs a  sales  activity  that  is  specific  to  France. At  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  also  acts  as  the  holding company  and  provides  strategic,  scientific  and  technical coordination for the L'Or\u00e9al Group throughout the world.\n\nThe subsidiaries  operate  the  Group's  business  activities  in  the country  or  region  in  which  they  are  located.  To  do  so,  they define  the  development  strategy  specific  to  their  market, make the most suitable choices in terms of consumer targets and  distribution  channels,  and  manufacture,  directly  or indirectly,  and  market  the  brands  they  decide  to  sell  on their market.\n\nAlmost all of the subsidiaries are owned by L'Or\u00e9al S.A. which has a holding or control percentage equal or close to 100% (1) . The detailed list of these subsidiaries is set out in the notes to the consolidated and parent company financial statements.\n\n## 1.4.2. Operational Divisions\n\nThe  Group's  business  activities  are  organised  into  four Operational  Divisions.  In  the  markets,  each  of  these  Divisions develops  and  enhances  its  brand  portfolio  with  consumers (see section 1.2.1. 'L'Or\u00e9al Group Profile' of this document).\n\nTravel  Retail  is  a  fast-growing  group  wide  channel  that conveys the Company's image and is expanding in line with the number of travellers. By establishing the multi-division Travel Retail Department, the Group has given itself the resources to grow this segment using a global shopper strategy: a bespoke approach  designed,  at  the  destinations  favoured  by  each nationality,  to  personalise  the  experience  on  the  basis  of  the language, culture and beauty rituals of travellers.\n\n## 1.4.3. Geographic zones (2)\n\nThe  Group's  international  development  has  naturally  meant that L'Or\u00e9al has had to adapt its organisation to the need to coordinate the establishment and development of its brands on every continent. Various geographic zones have therefore been created, each of which has operational responsibility for the  subsidiaries  located  in  their  country  (Western  Europe; Americas; Asia Pacific; Eastern Europe; Africa, Middle East).\n\n## 1.4.4. Support Departments\n\nSeveral specialist corporate departments provide their expertise and  support  to  the  Operational  Divisions,  to subsidiaries in their markets and to the other business activities (see section 1.2.1. 'L'Or\u00e9al Group Profile' of this document).\n\n1",

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  constantly  changing  environment and like any company, L'Or\u00e9al is necessarily exposed to risks which,  if  they  were  to  materialise,  could  have  a  negative impact  on  its  business  activities,  its  financial  position  and  its assets, particularly in terms of reputation and image.\n\nIn order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate and  manage  the  risks  to  which  it  is  exposed  in  its  different areas of activity.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's risk management consists in identifying, assessing and controlling  risks  that  may  affect  the  smooth  running  of  the Company. It also participates in the Group's development by promoting  good  use  of  resources  to  minimise  the  impact  of negative events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.\n\nBy contributing to preventing and managing the risks to which the  Group  is  exposed,  the  purpose  of  the  Internal  Control system is to enable the Group's manufacturing and economic development  to  take  place  in  a  steady  and  sustainable manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group's businesses.\n\nAt  L'Or\u00e9al,  Internal  Control  is  a  system  that  applies  to  the Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  and  aims  at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with the laws and regulations in force and the Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  assets  and  reputation  are  valued  and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nThe control environment, which is critical to the Internal Control system,  good  risk  management  and  the  application  of procedures,  is  based  on  behaviour,  the  organisational structure and employees. At L'Or\u00e9al, it forms part of a culture of rigour and commitment  communicated  by  senior management and in line with the Group's strategic choices.\n\nRisk management and Internal Control is everyone's business, from the governance bodies to all employees.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  system  is  the  subject  of  ongoing supervision in order to verify whether it is relevant and meets the Group's objectives and addresses its issues.\n\nSee also Chapter 3 'Risk factors and control environment' of this document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "This chapter reports the conditions under which the Board of Directors' work is prepared and organised and includes a summary of the principles of organisation that guarantee a balance of powers. It includes the complete text of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors.\n\nAll components of the remuneration of directors and corporate officers are provided, as is the trading  in  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  reported  by  directors  and  corporate  officers  in  2020,  and  the remuneration  policy  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-8  (formerly  L.  225-37-2)  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\n## 2.1. FRAMEWORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES\n\n## 2.1.1. AFEP-MEDEF Code: the reference Code\n\nThe Code of Corporate Governance to which the Company refers  is  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  This  code  may  be  consulted online at the following address: http://www.medef.com/.\n\nIn accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  225-37, paragraph 6  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  this  chapter includes a   specific  section  of  the  Management  Report  on corporate  governance  and  reports  on  the  following,  in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Board's  composition  and  application  of  the  principle of balanced gender representation on the Board;\n- \u00b7 the  ways  in  which  the  Board's  work  is  prepared  and organised;\n- \u00b7 the remuneration policy for directors and corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 information  relating  to  the  remuneration  and  benefits  of any  kind  for  directors  and  corporate  officers  during  the previous  financial  year  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-9 (formerly L. 225-37-3) of the French Commercial Code; and\n- \u00b7 limitations placed by the Board of Directors on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe other information included in the particular section of the Management Report dedicated to corporate governance is published in chapter 7 of this document, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 the table summarising the authorisations in force granted by the  Annual  General  Meeting  (see  section  7.2.2.  'Issued share capital and authorised unissued share capital');\n- \u00b7 the special rules for shareholder participation in the Annual General  Meeting  or  the  provisions  of  the  Articles  of Association  providing  for  these  rules  (see  section  7.1.11. 'Annual General Meeting'); and\n- \u00b7 the  elements  with  the  potential  to  have  an  impact  in  the event of a public offer for the purchase or exchange of the Company's  securities (see section 7.3. 'Shareholder structure').\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code,  this  chapter  identifies,  in  a  summary  table,  those provisions  of  the  Code  which  were  not  applied  and  explains the reasons for that choice (see section 2.5. 'Summary table of the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  which  have not been applied').\n\n## 2.1.2. Combination of the offices of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors at 31 December 2020\n\n## 2.1.2.1. Choice of these procedures for exercising the General Management in the best interest of the Company\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has a method of corporate governance that is suited to its specificities and is part of a constant quest for progress.\n\nThe procedures for conducting the General Management of L'Or\u00e9al have always been decided in the best interest of the Company and with the constant concern that the  mode  of governance  chosen  will  make  it  possible  to  optimise  the Group's financial and economic performances and to create the most favourable conditions for its long-term development.\n\nAfter a  period  of  five  years  (between  2006  and  2011)  during which  the  duties  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors and those of Chief Executive Officer were separated in order to ensure a smooth transition between Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones and  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided in  2011  to  merge  these  positions  and  to  appoint  Mr  Jean-\n\nPaul Agon as Chairman of the Board of Directors responsible for  the  Company's  General  Management  (Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer of L'Or\u00e9al).\n\nIn  this  context,  the  balance of powers is respected thanks to stable,  loyal  shareholders  with  two  major  shareholders  highly committed to the Group's long-term growth.\n\nIn the context of the annual assessment of its modus operandi, the Board  of  Directors confirmed  that  the  mode  of governance  is  well-balanced  and  effective.  The  decisionmaking  processes  are  clear  and  the  balance  of  powers  is properly ensured. As it prefers to have a direct relationship with the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  it  does  not consider the appointment of a Lead Director to be necessary. See also section 2.1.3. 'Announcement of the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer in 2021' of the present document.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.2.2. Key role of the composition of the Board of Directors in the balance of powers\n\ninformed  of  all  aspects  of  the  Company's  affairs  and  its performances.\n\nThe  balance  of  powers  on  the  Board  of  Directors  principally rests on its coherent and harmonious composition and on the qualities of its Directors.\n\nAt  31  December  2020,  serving  alongside  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  are  three  Directors  (one  of  whom  is Vice-Chairman  of  the  Board)  from  the  Bettencourt  Meyers family,  two  Directors  (one  of  whom  is  Vice-Chairman  of  the Board)  from  Nestl\u00e9,  six  independent  Directors  (excluding  the Directors  representing  the  employees),  and  two  Directors representing the employees.\n\nThus  50%  of  the  Board  are  independent  Directors,  who  are highly committed  and  fully  play  their  role  given  their backgrounds and experience. They all hold responsibilities at the  highest  level  in  major  international  groups,  which  allows them to understand all the dimensions of L'Or\u00e9al's operations, clarify Board discussions and interact effectively with General Management.\n\nAll  Board  members  participate  in  the  discussions  and  are  a driving  force  for  ideas  in  terms  of  the  smooth  running  of  the Board.  The  diversity  and  complementarity  of  the  Directors' experience  and  expertise  (entrepreneurial,  financial,  extrafinancial, including human resources and sustainable development, industrial,  digital,  etc.)  enable  them  to  quickly and thoroughly understand the development issues facing the L'Or\u00e9al Group,  the  leader  in the highly competitive, globalised  cosmetics  market  in  which  the  requirement  to innovate and adapt is very high.\n\n## 2.1.2.3. Quality of relationships between the Board and General Management\n\nThe General Management communicates completely transparently  with  all  the  Directors  and  keeps  them  regularly\n\nThe Board has the means enabling it to handle with complete freedom  the  questions  that  concern  it,  notably  when  this involves  determining  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategic  orientations,  ensuring and monitoring the implementation and overseeing the good management thereof. The Board meets the senior managers of L'Or\u00e9al at the time of presentations or sessions dedicated to the strategy. The Board may meet at any time if required by current  events.  It  may  also  decide  to  organise  meetings without the presence of executive corporate officers (executive sessions).\n\nThe Board provides the General Management with invaluable support  for  strategic  decision-making  through  its  reflections and  the  impetus  it  provides.  The  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer conducts the Board's work in order to obtain this  adherence  and  to  ensure  L'Or\u00e9al's  development  with complete confidence and peace of mind. It is naturally in the interest of all the shareholders but also of all the stakeholders for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  to  lead  the debates and encourage discussions on the Board of Directors.\n\nFurthermore,  although  the  General  Management  is  vested with  the  broadest  powers  to  act  in  all  circumstances  in  the name of the Company, transactions for a significant amount or which are outside the Company's normal course of business are  submitted  to  the  Board  of  Directors  (see  section  1.2.2  of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors).\n\n## 2.1.2.4. Attentive prevention of conflicts of interest\n\nThe  Directors  are  required  to  act  in  all  circumstances  in  the interest of the Company and of all its shareholders.\n\nEvery  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  evaluates  the  situation  of Directors with the aim of preventing conflicts of interest.\n\nEach  Director  has  the  formal  obligation  to  report  potential conflicts of interest which could concern him/her and, in any event,  must  abstain  from  participating  in  the  corresponding debates and deliberations.\n\n## 2.1.3. Announcement of the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer in 2021\n\n## 2.1.3.1. Establishment and implementation of the succession plan\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's success has always resided in its pertinent choice of senior  management,  with  only  five  Chief  Executive  Officers since it was founded in 1909.\n\nAs  the  Company's  articles  of  association  do  not  provide  for any  exception  to  the  legal  retirement  age  of  65  years, Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  must  hand  over  his  duties  as  Chief Executive Officer before 6 July 2021. On his recommendation, the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  initiated  the process to appoint the future Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Committee worked for more than eighteen months on the future  governance  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  succession  plan  of Mr Jean-Paul Agon in General Management, in an approach that  was  forward-looking,  objective  and  demanding.  After studying  the  Group's  major  challenges  for  the  coming  years, the  Committee  selected  several  candidates,  both  men  and women,  with  the  skills  and  personal  qualities  to  meet  these challenges successfully.\n\nThe Board of Directors was kept informed of the progress of this selection process, which was conducted with a concern that it  should be exemplary, impartial, discrete and in compliance with the best rules of governance.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  14  October  2020, announced  its  intention  to  dissociate  the  functions  of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to renew Mr Jean-Paul Agon's  mandate  as  Chairman,  a  position  he  has  held  since 2011, and to appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThis new governance will take effect on 1 May 2021, by decision of  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  meeting  held  following  the company's Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2021.\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  joined  L'Or\u00e9al  34  years  ago.  He  held various positions in marketing before being named to General Management  (L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  France,  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  World  and L'Or\u00e9al Mexico). In 2008, Mr Jean-Paul Agon appointed him as General Manager of the L'Or\u00e9al Professional Products Division and welcomed him to the Executive  Committee.  In  January 2011,  he  was  appointed  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  L'Or\u00e9al\n\n2",

In  2013,  he became  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Selective  Divisions (Luxury,  Active  Cosmetics,  Professional  Products).  He  was named Deputy CEO in charge of Divisions in May 2017.\n\nFor the Board of Directors, his great sensitivity to the needs and expectations  of  consumers,  his  perfect  understanding  of  the spirit  of  the  times,  his  marketing  experience  of  beauty  in  all channels, countries and categories, his intimate knowledge of the Group's brands and his ability to unite and engage teams make him the best candidate to lead L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nIn his capacity  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus  will  be  vested  with  the  most  extensive  powers  to act  in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company  in compliance with the limits set by the Board.\n\nFurthermore,  in  his  exchanges  with  the  Nominations  and Governance  Committee,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  with  the agreement  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  full  support  of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, wished to maintain the role of Deputy CEO, a position held by Mr Nicolas Hieronimus at his side since 2017. Ms Barbara Lavernos, who will lead Research, Innovation and  Technology  from  February  2021,  will  be  appointed Deputy CEO on 1 May 2021.\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus will be able to count on the advice of Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  in  the  framework  of  quality  dialogue based on the relationship  of  trust  established  between  them over many years.\n\nThe Board of Directors and Mr Nicolas Hieronimus will benefit from Mr Jean-Paul Agon's successful and  recognised experience  in  both  positions.  The  Board  of  Directors  will  be able  to  count  on  his  expertise  in  matters  of  governance  to meet the growing expectations of the Group's stakeholders.\n\n## 2.1.3.2. Duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board stipulate the following duties of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of Directors:\n\n'The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  organises  and oversees the Board's work and reports thereon to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman is actively involved in defining the Company's growth  strategy  and  encourages  and  strengthens,  inter  alia, links between the Company and the main market players.\n\nThe  Chairman  oversees  the  work  of  the  Company's  bodies responsible for corporate  governance  and  ensures,  in particular,  that  the  Directors  are  able  to  perform  their  duties. He  may  ask  for  the  communication  of  any  document  or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board must use his best efforts to promote the  values  and  image  of  the  Company  at  all  times.  He expresses his views in that capacity.\n\nHe is provided with the material resources required to perform his duties.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  takes  care  to  develop  and maintain a trustful and regular relationship between the Board and  the  General  Management,  in  order  to  guarantee continuous, ongoing implementation by the General Management of the strategies defined by the Board.'\n\nTaking into consideration Mr Jean-Paul Agon's experience and expertise as well as his in-depth knowledge of the Group and the beauty market, the Board decided to expand the duties entrusted  to  the  Chairman.  In  all  these  specific  missions,  the Chairman acts in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer  who  alone  directs  and  manages  the  Company's operations.\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon, as Chairman of the Board of Directors, will provide  his  assistance  and  advice  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer,  particularly  in  the  implementation  of  the  strategic orientations of the Company defined by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 he will  be  informed  and  consulted  by  the  Chief  Executive Officer on all significant issues and events, such as proposed acquisitions or disposals, major  financial  transactions, financial  communication,  the  guidelines  of  the  Human Resources  policy  and  appointments  of  the  Group's principal  executives,  Ethics  and  issues  of  Corporate  Social Responsibility;\n- \u00b7 he will monitor, in collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer, certain equity interests, including L'Or\u00e9al's stake in Sanofi;\n- \u00b7 in  collaboration  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  he  may represent  the  Group  in  its  high-level  relations,  both nationally and internationally, including with public authorities, and L'Or\u00e9al's strategic partners and stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 he will ensure respect for L'Or\u00e9al's values and culture;\n- \u00b7 he  will  be  able  to  hear  the  Statutory  Auditors  for  the preparation of the work of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 he  will  chair  and  lead  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability Committee;\n- \u00b7 he  will  meet  with  the  members  of  the  Board  outside  the presence of the Directors belonging or reporting to General Management.  These  meetings  are,  in  particular,  an opportunity  to  discuss  the  performance  and  remuneration of executive corporate officers; and\n- \u00b7 he  will  report  to  the  Board  on  the  performance  of  his mission.\n\n## 2.1.3.3. Changes in the composition of the Board of Directors in 2021\n\nThe Board of Directors decided to recommend to the Annual General  Meeting  of  20  April  2021  the  election  of  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus, the future Chief Executive Officer, to the Board for a term of four years.\n\nIn  effect,  the  Board  believes  that  the  full  and  complete participation of the Chief Executive Officer as a Director in the Board's discussions is essential.\n\nThe  election  of  a  new  independent  Director,  Mr  Alexandre Ricard,  is  also  submitted  for  a  vote  by  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\nIf the  Annual  General  Meeting  approves  the  resolutions proposed,  the  Board  of  Directors  will  be  composed  of 16  members:  14  directors  elected  by  the  Annual  General Meeting and two directors representing the employees.\n\nThe balances of independence and gender will be:\n\n- \u00b7 7 independent Directors out of 14 Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting, i.e. 50%,\n- \u00b7 7  women  and  7  men  out  of  14  Directors  elected  by  the Annual General Meeting, i.e. a parity of 50%.",

Two Directors representing the employees since July 2014\n\nTwo Directors representing the employees are members of the Board  of  Directors  and  of  two  of  its  Committees.  With a particular  focus  related  to  their  extensive  knowledge  of  the Company, they provide further insight that enriches the quality of  the  Board's  debates  and  decisions  and  those  of  the Committees of which they are members.\n\nMs  Ana  Sofia  Amaral  was  appointed  by  the  Instance Europ\u00e9enne  de  Dialogue  Social/European  Works  Council (IEDS/EWC).  She  holds  the  duties  of  Scientific  and  Technical Affairs Director for L'Or\u00e9al Portugal.\n\nMr  Georges  Liarokapis  was  appointed  by  the  CFE-CGC,  the most representative trade union in L'Or\u00e9al for France. He holds the duties of Coordinator of Sustainability for L'Or\u00e9al Western Europe.\n\nBoth were appointed in 2014 and again in 2018 for a second four-year  term.  They  both  resigned  from  their  duties  as employee representatives before joining the Board of Directors in 2014.\n\nAs  soon  as  they  took  up  their  office,  they  benefited  from  a training programme provided by an external body concerning, in particular, the role and functioning of the Board of  Directors,  the  rights  and  obligations  of  Directors  and  their liability.  Like  any  new  Director,  the  Directors  representing  the employees followed an induction course intended to perfect their knowledge of the Company's organisation and activities, which  included,  in  particular,  individual  interviews  with  the Group's  main  executives.  Since  then,  they  have  been receiving training seminars each year in line with their term of office. In 2020, Ms Ana Sofia Amaral pursued the programme of  courses  initiated  in  2019  to  earn  the  'Company  Director' certification developed  by  the  IFA  (French  Institute  of Directors) and  SciencesPo,  and  Mr  Georges  Liarokapis benefitted from a tailored upskilling programme in the Digital skills area.\n\nMs Ana Sofia Amaral and Mr Georges Liarokapis have been members  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, since 2015.\n\nThey  receive  remuneration  in  respect  of  their  term  of  office according  to  the  same  allocation  rules  as  other  Directors. The components of their remuneration as employees are not published.\n\n## 2.2.1.4. Independent Directors\n\n## All  the  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al  have  freedom of judgment\n\nThe balance of powers on the Board is ensured through a very precise  definition  and  sharing  of  the  tasks  to  be  carried  out by everyone.\n\nAll the Directors receive information on an ongoing basis and have  suitable  means  for  the  performance  of  their  duties. They  all  have  a  duty  of  vigilance  and  participate,  in  total independence, in the decisions  and  work  of  the  Board  and, where applicable, its Committees.\n\nThey  are  all  required  to  comply  with  the  rules  in  force  with regard to conflicts of interest.\n\n## The Directors who qualify as independent under the criteria defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code\n\nA member of the Board is considered independent when he/ she  does  not  maintain  any  relationship  of  any  kind  with the  Company,  its  Group  or  its  Management  which  could interfere with his/her freedom of judgement.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  the  criteria  that  guide  the  Board  in determining  whether  a  member  can  qualify  as  independent are the following criteria specified by the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  be  an  employee  or  executive corporate  officer  of  the  Company,  an  employee  or executive corporate officer or Director of a company that is consolidated  by  the  Company,  an  employee,  executive corporate officer or Director of its parent company or of a company consolidated by that parent company and must not have held any of these positions during the previous five years;\n- \u00b7 the member must not be an executive corporate officer of a  company  in  which  the  Company  directly  or  indirectly holds  the  office  of  Director  or  in  which  an  employee designated as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company (either currently or having performed such duties within the last five years) holds an office as Director;\n- \u00b7 the member must not be a customer, supplier, investment banker, financial banker, or advisor who is important to the Company  or  its  Group,  or  for  whom  the  Company  or  its Group represents a significant proportion of business;\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  have  any  close  family  ties  to a director or corporate officer;\n- \u00b7 the member must not have been the Company's Statutory Auditor over the previous five years; and\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  have  been  a  Director  of  the Company for more than twelve years.",

As to the significance of the business  relationship,  and  in  keeping  with  AMF  recommendations,  the  Board  of  Directors  carried  out  a  quantitative  and qualitative analysis, adopting a wide multi-criteria approach (duration and continuity, importance of the business relationship for L'Or\u00e9al and the Director, and organisation of the relationship). Following this analysis, the Board concluded there was no significant business relationships.\n\nIn summary, on 31 December 2020, 6 members of the Board of Directors  out  of  12  (excluding  the  Directors  representing  the employees)  qualify  as  independent ( i.e. 50%  of  the  Board of Directors):\n\n- \u00b7 Ms Sophie Bellon\n- \u00b7 Mr Patrice Caine\n- \u00b7 Ms Fabienne Dulac\n- \u00b7 Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo\n- \u00b7 Ms Ilham Kadri\n- \u00b7 Ms Virginie Morgon.\n\n## 2.2.1.5. Responsible Directors\n\nWithin the scope of French law and the rights and obligations of the Directors as defined in the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors of L'Or\u00e9al, and in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Directors are subject to compliance with the rules in force  with  regard  to  conflicts  of  interest  and  stock  market ethics.\n\n## Handling of conflicts of interest\n\nConcerning  the  potential  conflicts  between  the  duties  of Directors and their private interests, which are to be reported pursuant  to  Delegated  European  Regulation  No.  2019/980 supplementing  Regulation  No.  2017/1129  and  known  as 'Prospectus 3', all Directors must prepare a declaration each year on any potential conflicts of interest between their duties to L'Or\u00e9al and their private interests or other duties, specifically with regard to their other offices and positions. On the basis of these declarations, the Board has not identified any conflict of interests at the date they were prepared.\n\nWhatever the case, pursuant to the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors of L'Or\u00e9al, 'Directors are obliged to notify the Board of any  situation  that  may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if such conflict is only potential, and must refrain from participating in the corresponding discussions and deliberations '.\n\nFinally, the situation of the Directors in light of the independence  criteria  set  out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  is examined every year by the Board of Directors and described in section 2.2.1.4. 'Independent Directors' of this document.\n\nIt is specified  that  the  following  are  not  considered  to  be independent: Mr Jean-Paul Agon (executive corporate officer); Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers,  Mr  Jean-Victor  Meyers  and Mr Nicolas Meyers (Bettencourt Meyers family holding 33.17% of the  share  capital);  Mr  Paul  Bulcke  and  Ms  B\u00e9atrice  GuillaumeGrabisch (Nestl\u00e9 holding 23.20% of the share capital).\n\nThe information described in Annex 1 of Delegated European Regulation No. 2019/980 set out hereafter contains additional details in this respect.\n\n## Information relating to directors and corporate officers pursuant to Annex 1 of Delegated European Regulation No. 2019/980\n\n## Family  links  existing  between  directors  and  corporate officers (Article12.1 of the Annex)\n\nMs  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers  is  the  mother  of  Mr  JeanVictor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers.\n\n## Absence of any conviction or incrimination on the part of  the  directors  and  corporate  officers  (Article  12.1  of the Annex)\n\nTo  the  Company's  knowledge,  over  the  last  five  years,  the directors and corporate officers and Directors have not been convicted for fraud, associated with a bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation, or the subject of any official public incrimination  or  sanction  imposed  by  statutory  or  regulatory authorities  (including  designated  professional  bodies)  or  a decision  by  a  court  disqualifying  them  from  acting  as  a member  of  an  administrative,  management  or  supervisory body  or  from  acting  in  the  management  or  conduct  of  the business of any issuer.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Potential conflicts of interest between the duties of the directors and corporate officers with regard to L'Or\u00e9al, and their private interests and/or other duties (Articles 12.2 and 16.3 of the Appendix)\n\nThe method of organisation and modus operandi adopted by the  Board  would  allow  it,  where  applicable,  to  prevent  any abusive  exercise  of  their  rights  by  one  or  more  shareholders that  come  to  control  the  Company,  notably  due  to  the presence  of  six  independent  Directors  on  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nRegarding any arrangement or agreement entered into with the  major  shareholders,  customers,  suppliers,  or  others,  under which a Director was selected as a member of the Board of Directors,  an  agreement  between  the  Bettencourt  Meyers family  and  Nestl\u00e9  S.A.,  which  expired  on  21  March  2018, concerned the reciprocal voting commitment in favour of the appointment as Directors of three members proposed by the Bettencourt  Meyers  family  and  two  members  proposed  by Nestl\u00e9  (see  also  section  7.3.5.  'Shareholders'  agreements relating  to  shares  in  the  Company's  share  capital'  of  this document).\n\nThe Company was informed of the participation, amounting to 100  shares,  of  its  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer, Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  in  the  collective  lock-up  agreements signed on 16 December 2016 by T\u00e9thys SAS and members of the Bettencourt Meyers family group under the Dutreil law. The Nominations and Governance  Committee  Meeting  of 6 December  2016  examined  this  arrangement  prior  to signature of the agreement and considered that it could not be  contested  on  the  basis  of  the  Company's  interests,  nor could it lead to consequences for the Company's governance, and informed the Board of Directors accordingly.\n\n## Information on service contracts with members of the administrative bodies (Article 12.2 of the Appendix)\n\nNo corporate officers or directors have a service contract with L'Or\u00e9al  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  providing  for  the  granting  of benefits upon termination of such contract.\n\n## Stock market ethics\n\nThe  Board  noted  the  rules  to  be  applied  to  prevent  insider trading, in particular those resulting from European Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on Market Abuse which became applicable on  3  July  2016,  and  the  recommendations  of  the  French financial  markets  authority  (AMF),  in  particular  regarding  the periods  during  which  it  is  prohibited  from  trading  in  shares.  It decided to amend its Internal Rules accordingly.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  legal  provisions,  regulations  and  market recommendations,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Stock  Market  Code  of  Ethics points out that inside information must only be passed on and used for professional purposes.\n\nInside information is precise information of a non-public nature, which, if  made  public,  could  have  a  significant  influence  on the  share  price.  Such  inside  information  may  fall  into  one  of three  categories:  strategic,  linked  to  the  definition  and application  of  the  Group's  development  policy;  recurring, linked to the annual schedule for production and publication of annual and interim financial statements, regular releases or periodic meetings devoted to financial information; exceptional,  linked  to  a  specific  programme,  project  or financial transaction.\n\nThe  Stock  Market  Code  of  Ethics  restates  the  ban  on  any person  in  possession  of  insider  information  from  executing  or ordering  the  execution  of  financial  transactions  on  L'Or\u00e9al shares, and emphasises that any misconduct in this area may result  in  criminal  proceedings. The Internal Rules of the Board specifically  ask  Directors  to  refrain  from  trading  in  L'Or\u00e9al shares precisely in certain periods and when they have access to inside information.\n\nLastly,  Directors  are  required  to  notify  the  AMF  of  each transaction carried out by them or by persons closely affiliated with them related to L'Or\u00e9al shares. The Company periodically reminds them of this obligation (see section 2.6. 'Summary of trading in L'Or\u00e9al shares by directors and corporate officers in 2020' of this document).",

He has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors  of  Nestl\u00e9  since  2017.  He  is  also  a  Director  of  Roche (Switzerland).\n\nHe  brings  to  the  Board  his  strategic  vision,  his  multicultural approach,  his  detailed  knowledge  of  consumers  on  all continents, and his taste for innovation, which are vital assets for  developing L'Or\u00e9al's universalisation strategy. His analyses enhance Board discussions and allow the Board to adopt solid orientations in a number of areas.\n\nOver  the  four  years  of  his  term  of  office  as  Director, Mr  Paul  Bulcke's  attendance  at  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  three  Committees  on  which  he  serves  has been 100%.\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of Ms Virginie Morgon's term of office as Director\n\nAs the term of office of Ms Virginie Morgon as Director is due to expire in 2021, the renewal of her term of office for four years is submitted to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nA Director of L'Or\u00e9al since 2013, Ms Virginie Morgon has also chaired the Audit Committee since 2016.\n\nMs Virginie Morgon is Chairwoman of the Management Board of Eurazeo, which she joined in 2008 after working for 16 years at  Lazard,  as  well  as  Chairwoman  of  Eurazeo  North  America Inc. (USA). She is also Co-Chair of the Paris Committee of the Human Rights Watch.\n\nMs  Virginie  Morgon  brings  to  the  Board  her  recognised financial expertise, combined with a dynamic and entrepreneurial  vision  of  business.  The  Board  will  benefit  from her serious interest in innovation and the ongoing attention she brings  to  new  consumer  trends.  She  actively  contributes, particularly  in  her  capacity  as  Chairwoman  of  the  Audit Committee,  to  the  development  of  a  sustainable  business model, based both on economic excellence and corporate social responsibility excellence.\n\nOver  the  four  years  of  her  term  as  Director,  Ms  Virginie Morgon's attendance rate has been 96.5% at meetings of the Board  of  Directors  and  100%  at  meetings  of  the  Audit Committee which she chairs.",

General information on the meetings of the Board of Directors and its Committees in 2020\n\nIn 2020, the Board met 8 times.\n\nFour Committees prepare for the discussions and deliberations by the Board. 22 meetings were held in 2020: 4 for the Strategy and  Sustainability  Committee,  4  for  the  Audit  Committee, 10  for  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  and  4 for the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\nDirectors  may  independently  propose  any  subject  that  is appropriate  for  good  governance  to  be  included  on  the agenda for  work  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees.  L'Or\u00e9al's Directors are regularly informed of all the Company's activities and its performances in a highly competitive universe.\n\nBoard  meetings  are  generally  held  in  the  presence  of  senior managers of the Company invited to attend on the basis of topical  developments  at  L'Or\u00e9al  and  many  aspects  of  its strategy.  In  an  open,  constructive  dialogue,  exchanges  of views, in confidence, contribute to the quality of the Directors' work.  Board  discussions,  encouraged  by  the  Chairman,  take place transparently and in great detail.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nDirectors meet at least once a year without the presence of the corporate officer, Directors representing employees or any other Group employee (Article 4.2 of the Internal Rules). Two executive  sessions  were  held  in  2020,  on  30  July  and 3 December.\n\nThe Audit Committee also meets twice a year in the presence of Statutory Auditors and in the absence of any representative from Management, at the end of the meetings dedicated to reviewing  the  annual  and  interim  financial  statements.  These two meetings were held on 6 February and 30 July 2020.\n\n## Attendance rate\n\nThe  preparation  and  holding  of  Board  and  Committee meetings requires significant availability and investment by the Directors.\n\nIn  2020,  the  attendance rate at Board meetings was 99% on average.  The  individual  attendance  rate  at  Board  and Committee meetings is specified below.\n\nThe  allocation  of  Directors'  fees,  based  on  the  rate  of attendance  by  each  member  at  Board  meetings  and meetings of the various Committees,  is described in section 2.4. 'Remuneration of directors and corporate officers' of this document.\n\n## INDIVIDUAL ATTENDANCE RATES OF DIRECTORS IN 2020 AT BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS\n\n|                                        | Board of Directors   | Strategy  and Sustainability  Committee   | Audit Committee   | Nominations  and Governance  Committee   | Human Resources  and Remuneration Committee   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Mr Jean-Paul Agon                      | 100%                 | 100%                                      |                   |                                          |                                               |\n| Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers        | 100%                 | 100%                                      |                   | 100%*                                    | 100%*                                         |\n| Mr Paul Bulcke                         | 100%                 | 100%                                      |                   | 100%                                     | 100%                                          |\n| Ms Ana Sofia Amaral                    | 100%                 |                                           |                   |                                          | 100%                                          |\n| Ms Sophie Bellon                       | 100%                 |                                           | 100%              | 100%                                     | 100%                                          |\n| Mr Patrice Caine                       | 100%                 | 50%*                                      |                   | 100%                                     |                                               |\n| Ms Fabienne Dulac                      | 100%                 |                                           | 100%              |                                          | 100%                                          |\n| Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo                        | 100%                 |                                           |                   |                                          | 100%                                          |\n| Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch         | 88%                  |                                           | 100%              |                                          |                                               |\n| Ms Ilham Kadri (as from 30/06/2020)    | 100%                 |                                           |                   |                                          |                                               |\n| Mr Georges Liarokapis                  | 100%                 |                                           | 100%              |                                          |                                               |\n| Mr Jean-Victor Meyers                  | 100%                 | 100%*                                     | 100%              |                                          |                                               |\n| Mr Nicolas Meyers (as from 30/06/2020) | 100%                 |                                           |                   |                                          |                                               |\n| Ms Virginie Morgon                     | 100%                 |                                           | 100%              |                                          |                                               |\n| 2020 AVERAGE                           | 99%                  | 93%                                       | 100%              | 100%                                     | 100%                                          |\n\n- * Director who joined this Committee in 2020.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## 2.3.2. Activities of the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.3.2.1. Main Remits and Internal Rules\n\nThe  Directors  oversee  the  Group's  economic  and  financial management  and  contribute  to  defining  its  strategy.  They examine  and  approve  the  main  lines  of  action  adopted  by the General Management, which implements them.\n\nWithin this context, the Board of Directors seeks on an ongoing basis  to  adopt  a  modus  operandi  which,  while  strictly complying  with  French  law,  assures  the  conditions  of  good corporate governance.\n\n## Internal  Rules  that  frame  and  organise  actions  of  the  Board of Directors\n\nThe work of the Board of Directors is based on Internal Rules, regularly  updated,  and  designed  to  supplement  the  legal, regulatory and statutory rules and the market recommendations  to  which  the  Board  of  Directors  refers. The Internal Rules are made public in full in this document and published on L'Or\u00e9al's website.\n\nThe  Internal  Rules  address  both  the  formal  aspects  of  the Board of Directors' remits and the rights and obligations of the Directors  (knowledge  of  and  compliance  with  regulations, recommendations and obligations, respect of the Company's interest,  obligations  of  diligence  and  provision  of  information, reserve  and confidentiality,  responsibility  with  regard  to  stock market ethics, etc.).\n\nThey are updated by the Board of Directors in order to take account  of  the  changes  in  the  laws  and  regulations,  best corporate governance practices and its own modus operandi, particularly  within  the  scope  of  the  annual  evaluation  of  its work. The latest updates to the Internal Rules were made on 11 February 2021. The update was to specify, in the duties of the Nominations and Governance Committee, the procedure for  reviewing  and  proposing  candidates  for  new  Directors  to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  composition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors,  the  rules  it applies to its work, its modus operandi, and the work that it has carried out in the year, evaluated on an annual basis by the Directors,  as  well  as  the  decisions  made,  are  described  in sections 2.2 and 2.3 below.\n\nThe Board of Directors wishes to point out that it carries out its work above all on a collegial basis, in accordance with ethical principles  and  in  compliance  with  regulations  and  market recommendations.\n\nThe  Board's  debates  and  decisions  are  assisted  by  the  work performed by its Committees, which report to the Board after each of their meetings. The Board of Directors ensures that all of the topics within its remit are thoroughly investigated by the Committees in charge of those issues. In 2020, the subjects of sustainable  development,  diversity,  and  gender  balance,  as well as succession plans, were reviewed by the Committees in order to report quality information to the Board of Directors to inform its decisions. Details on the activity of these Committees appear in section 2.3.3. 'Activities of the Board Committees' of this document.\n\n## 2.3.2.2. The Board's work in 2020\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors met 8 times.\n\nThe work and agendas were prepared so as to cover all of the subjects within the Board's remit and  to meet  the expectations  expressed  by  the  Directors  in  the  annual evaluation of the modus operandi of the Board.\n\nThe Board of Directors is  consistently  informed  of  the  work  of the various Committees by each Chairman/Chairwoman and bases its decisions on their recommendations.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Board's  activity  was  mainly  focused  on  the  following areas:\n\n## Sense of Purpose (raison d'\u00eatre)\n\nOn 6 February 2020, the Board of Directors approved this raison d'\u00eatre and  decided  to  include  it  in  its  management  report provided  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  shareholders  at  its  Annual  General Meeting of 30 June 2020 (2019 Universal Registration Document, page 6).  At  this  Annual  General  Meeting,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon presented  L'Or\u00e9al's raison  d'\u00eatre , which  sums  up  the  very essence of the Company, its values and its commitments.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\n## Composition of the Board and its Committees\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors deliberated on its composition , taking diversity into consideration in terms of gender, skills, and expertise  (see  section  2.2.1.2.  'Diversity  policy  applied  to  the Board  of  Directors:  experienced  Directors  who  complement one another' of this document).\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of 30 June 2020, it proposed the renewal of the terms of office of two Directors: Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch, Executive Vice-President Human Resources  and  Business  Services  of  the  Nestl\u00e9  group,  and Mr  Jean-Victor  Meyers,  member  of  the  Supervisory  Board  of the  T\u00e9thys  family  holding  company,  son  of  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers and great-grandson of Eug\u00e8ne Schueller, the founder of L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  Board  also  proposed  the  appointment  of  two  Directors: Mr  Nicolas  Meyers,  member  of  the  Supervisory  Board  of  the T\u00e9thys family holding company,  son  of  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers and great-grandson of Eug\u00e8ne Schueller, the  founder  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  and  Ms  Ilham  Kadri,  Chairwoman  of the Executive Committee and CEO of Solvay.\n\nFollowing the renewal of a portion of its members, the Board of Directors  reviewed  the  composition  of  the  Committees  in 2020. Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers joined the Nominations and Governance Committee as well as the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee. Ms Fabienne Dulac joined the Human Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee.  Mr  Patrice Caine  and  Mr  Jean-Victor  Meyers  joined  the  Strategy  and Sustainability Committee.\n\nThroughout  the  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  carefully monitored  the  work  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee with the aim to select independent directors with the potential to join the Board.",

        "page_content": "## 2020 Annual General Meeting\n\nBecause of the health crisis, on 30 March the Board decided to postpone the Annual General Meeting to 30 June 2020.\n\nDespite being postponed to 30 June 2020, the Annual General Meeting  could  not  be  held  under  normal  conditions  as  they were incompatible with the health measures in force taken by the  French  Government.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  the Order  of  25  March  2020  and  Decree  of  10  April  2020,  on  12 May 2020 the Board decided to call shareholders to an Annual General Meeting behind closed doors.\n\nThe Board was kept informed of the conditions for organising the Annual General Meeting behind closed doors; in particular of its live broadcast  and,  given  the  impossibility for shareholders to ask questions at the Meeting, the implementation  of  a  special  system  allowing  to  handle  the majority of questions up to the day before the Meeting and for the  questions  to  be  answered  to  the  best  extent  possible, during the Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  approved the  agenda  and  draft  resolutions submitted to voting by the Annual General Meeting , taking the context of the health crisis into consideration (press release of 12 May 2020):\n\n- \u00b7 it  adapted the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in order to note Mr Agon's decision to  waive all  remunerations relating to the financial targets of  his  annual  variable  remuneration  for  2020  and  any awards  of  performance  shares  for  which  he  was  eligible; and\n- \u00b7 the Board also decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting  of  shareholders  of  30  June  2020  a  dividend identical  to  that  paid  in  2019,  after  abandoning  the planned 10.4% increase in the dividend.\n\n## New governance and succession plan\n\nThroughout  the  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  carefully monitored  the  work  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee  focused  on  the  successor  to  Mr  Agon  as  Chief Executive Officer. As the Company's articles of association do not provide for any exception to the legal retirement age of 65  years,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  must  hand  over  his  duties  as Chief Executive Officer before July 2021.\n\nThe  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  initiated  its discussions in February 2019 and met on numerous occasions so that it could make a proposal to the Board of Directors at the end of a comprehensive procedure that it conducted with impartiality  and  discretion  in  accordance  with  the  best  rules of governance.\n\nFollowing  the  recommendations  of  the  Nominations  and Governance Committee, the Board announced at its meeting of 14 October 2020 a new governance and a succession plan at the head of the Group.\n\nThe Board announced its intention to dissociate the functions of  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to renew Mr JeanPaul  Agon's  mandate  as  Chairman,  a  position  he  has  held since  2011,  and  to  appoint  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  convinced  that  the  proposed organisation will guarantee the sustainability of the performance, values and commitments of the Group, as well as the quality of its governance.\n\nThese changes will take effect on 1 May 2021 by decision of the Board of Directors at the meeting to be held following the Company's  Annual  General  Meeting  on  20  April  2021,  a General Meeting that will notably be called to elect Nicolas Hieronimus  as  director  and  to  approve  the  remuneration policy corresponding to the new organisation.\n\n## Evaluation  of  the  modus  operandi  and  organisation  of  the Board\n\nAs is the case every year, the Board made a full evaluation of its modus operandi and its organisation. This was discussed as an agenda item at its meeting of 3 December 2020. This evaluation led  to  proposals  for  improvements  and  made  it  possible  to define  the  strategic  topics  on  which  the  Board  particularly wished to focus its reflections (see section 2.3.4. 'Self-evaluation by the Board of Directors') of this document.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nTwo  executive  sessions , in  which  the  Directors  meet  in  the absence of the executive corporate officers and any in-house Directors or employees, were held in 2020.\n\n## Dialogue with shareholders\n\nThe Board was informed of the expectations and positions of the  main  investors  and  proxy  advisors,  as  expressed  during meetings  with  the  Company's  departments  responsible  for preparing for the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIt  met to respond to the questions posed by the shareholders before the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIt is noted that dialogue with shareholders is the domain either directly of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Annual General  Meeting,  meetings  with  the  main  investors,  etc.),  or the  L'Or\u00e9al  teams  (governance  roadshows,  Consultative Committee  of  Individual  Shareholders,  etc.)  in  accordance with the principles of stock market ethics and equal access to information.\n\n## Current agreements\n\nIn  2020,  the  Board  implemented  a  procedure  to  regularly evaluate  whether  agreements  on  current  operations  signed under normal terms do meet these conditions.\n\n## Process for selecting Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Board, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, deliberated  on  the  appointments  of  the  Statutory  Auditors, which  are  due  to  expire  following  the  2022  Annual  General Meeting.\n\n## Remuneration  policy,  Human  Resources,  gender balance within the management bodies\n\nThe Board deliberated on the rules relating to the remuneration  of  the  corporate  officer and  approved  the remuneration  of  this  latter  for  2020,  based  on  the  extensive work  by  and  recommendations  from  the  Human  Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\n- It  approved  the  2020  Plan  for  the award  of  performance shares.\n\nIt approved  the  principle  of  increases  in  the  Company's capital reserved for employees in accordance with the 13th, 14th and  15th resolutions  approved  at  the  Annual  General Meeting of 30 June 2020 and noted the very positive results of the second  Employee  Shareholding  Plan launched  in September 2020 and widely subscribed around the world.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "Organisation and modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\nIn  October  2020,  the  Board  interviewed  the  Executive  VicePresident of Human  Relations  on  the  Group's  Human Resources policy. In particular, the Board was updated on the diversity and  gender  balance  policy deployed  in  the Company,  specifically  with  regard  to  the  gender  parity  in management bodies. On the proposal of General Management,  the  Board  defined objectives  for  gender balance  within  management  bodies .  The  goal  is  to  achieve gender  parity  in  the  'TOP  280'  by  2023.  The  Board  will  be informed annually about the results obtained, which are also presented for 2020 in section 4.3.2.6 'Promoting Diversity and Inclusion' of this document.\n\n## Business activity, results and strategy\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the strategic orientations taking social  and  environmental  needs  into  consideration.  It  also considers L'Or\u00e9al's raison d'\u00eatre , which it approved in February 2020 (see above).\n\nThe  chart  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  business  model  can  be  found  in section 1.2 'Business model:  economic  and  corporate excellence to create lasting value for all' of this document.\n\n## Business activity and results\n\nThe systematic and in-depth review, at each meeting, of the Group's  activities  and  results and  net  sales  generated  by Division,  geographic zones, brand, and e-commerce, as well as an analysis of market share gains, enables the Directors to be immersed in the Company's realities and to be continually informed of the problems faced by L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  Board  is  also  informed  throughout  the  year  of the evolutions in the cosmetics market, the results of competitors and the Group's relative positioning.\n\nThe  Board  was  systematically  informed  of  the  consequences of the Covid-19 health crisis and the actions taken: monitoring the  pandemic  around  the  world  and  the  Solidarity  Plan implemented  by  the  Group  (production  of  hand  sanitiser, solidarity  measures  for  healthcare  workers  and  pharmacists, food distribution workers, micro-entities/SMEs, the most vulnerable suppliers and others).\n\nA  regular  update  was  given  on  the  management  of  the Operations activity by region, country and Division. The Board monitored the work of the emergency committee responsible for  establishing  and  ensuring  compliance  with  all  Health  and Safety  instructions  and  procedures  in  the  sites  (laboratories, administrative  sites,  plants,  and  distribution  centres).  The measures to support and assist employees were detailed.\n\nThe Board was kept informed of the activity of IT department which  had  to  meet  the  challenge  of  telecommuting.  It  was particularly  attentive  to  the  measures  taken  to  strengthen cybersecurity in the face of the increased risk of cyberattacks during this period.\n\nThe Board conducted an in-depth review of the impact of the health crisis on changes in sales by Division and region, as well as the impact on cash. It debated the management measures set  up  to  face  this  change,  and  it  validated  the  strategic choices  designed  to  stimulate  demand  for  the  Group's products  and  relaunch  all  growth  drivers  under  the  best conditions.\n\n## Strategic issues in 2020\n\nThe  Board  regularly  meets  with  the  Group's  main  executives and thus benefits from in-depth knowledge of the challenges specific to each business segment. It is able to forge a clear, independent  opinion  of  the  opportunities  for  the  Group's development over the next few years.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer presented L'Or\u00e9al's CSR  policy  in  February  2020.  She  noted  the  principal sustainable development challenges and offered an assessment of the Sharing Beauty with All 2013-2020 programme. She presented the Group's new objectives of the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme for 2030 and the Directors were able to discuss the importance of its new commitments.\n\nThe Board wanted to receive an initial analysis of the medium and  long-term  consequences  of  the  health  crisis  on  the cosmetics  market  and  the  growth  of  L'Or\u00e9al. In  July  2020, Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  in charge  of  Divisions,  spoke  to  the  Board  on  this  issue;  he reported on the changes in consumer behaviour accelerated by  the  Covid-19  crisis.  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  explained  how L'Or\u00e9al  would  take  these  changes  into  consideration  in  its product  offers,  and  how  these  changes  in  behaviour  were opportunities for the Group with the emergence of new needs in existing beauty routines.\n\nIn  July  2020,  the  Directors  welcomed  the  Executive  VicePresident Chief Digital Officer, who explained the reasons why the Covid-19 crisis was a powerful vector in the acceleration of digital  transformation  and  e-commerce.  The  Directors  were able to discuss the strategic challenges related to this revolution and  the  development  prospects  for  the  Group  that  will  arise from those challenges.\n\nThe Board also discussed with Mr Nicolas Hieronimus the new organisation of Zones which will be progressively implemented as from 1 January 2021, a change that should allow the Group to be even more in tune with the degree of maturity of each local beauty market and the needs of consumers.\n\nThe Board also contributes to the development of strategy, by analysing  the  interest  of acquisitions and  the  conclusion  of licencing contracts .  It  studies  their  impact on the Company's financial structure and its long-term development capabilities. In  2020,  the  Directors  reviewed  new  projects,  including  the signing of an agreement for the acquisition of Thayers Natural Remedies, an American skincare brand, which will strengthen the brand portfolio of the Consumer Products Division, as well as  the  signing  of  an  agreement  for  the  acquisition  of  the Japanese company Takami Co, which will be integrated in the Luxury Division.\n\nThe  Central  Works  Council  was  once  again  consulted  and issued an opinion on the Company's strategic orientations ,  as previously  defined  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Board reviewed  the  opinion  of  the  Central  Works  Council  and responded to it.\n\n## 2.3.2.3. Information provided to the Board on the Company's financial position, cash position and commitments\n\nThe  financial  position  and  the  cash  position  are  reviewed  at least  twice  a  year  at  a  Board  meeting,  when  the  annual financial  statements  are  approved  and  when  the  interim financial  statements  are  reviewed,  or  at  any  other  time  if necessary. The balance sheet structure is solid.\n\nEvery  year,  it  reviews  the  agreements  concluded  and authorised during previous financial years and  which continued in force.",

Activities of the Board Committees\n\nThe  Board's  debates  and  decisions  are  assisted  by  the  work performed by its Committees, which report to it after each of their meetings. The remits of each Committee are described in detail in the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors.\n\nresponsibility. The Committees' work systematically gives rise to a  report  presented  by  their  Chairman/Chairwoman  at  Board meetings.\n\nThe  Board's  Committees  act  strictly  within  the  framework  of the remits given to them by the Board.

Self-evaluation by the Board of Directors\n\nEvery  year,  the  Board  carries  out  the  formal  evaluation provided  for  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  of  its  composition,  its organisation and its modus operandi, in particular in order to verify that, under these conditions, the agenda for its work duly covers the scope of its remits,  that  important  questions  have been  appropriately  prepared  for  and  discussed  and  to measure  the  contribution  made  by  each  member  to  the Board's work.\n\nThis evaluation is carried out within the framework of the AFEPMEDEF  Code,  to  which  the  Company  refers  and  market recommendations like those of the AMF.\n\nThe  evaluation  procedure  for  2020  was  reviewed  by  the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\nThis  evaluation  was  carried  out  with  the  help  of  a  thematic interview  guide  setting  out  the  principles  stipulated  by  the Code, allowing all Directors to think about the Board's proper modus operandi and their personal contribution to the Board's work  and  decisions.  This  guide  also  included  a  questionnaire prepared with the assistance of the Spencer Stuart firm.\n\nThese documents,  approved  by  the  Nominations  and Governance  Committee  before  they  were  sent  to  each Director,  served  as  a  basis  for  the  individual  interviews arranged  between  the  Directors  and  the  Secretary  of  the Board.\n\nThese  interviews  concerned  the  Board's  composition,  its organisation and its modus operandi.\n\nThe  Directors  were  called  to  reconsider  key  Governance issues,  specifically:  organisation  of  General  Management, scheduling  of  Board  meetings  without  the  presence  of Executive  Directors,  appointment  of  a  Lead  Independent Director,  and  relations  with  shareholders  over  Corporate Governance issues.\n\nCommittee  activities were  reviewed,  in particular the procedure  for  evaluating  current  agreements,  analysing  the independence of Directors and any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe  Directors  expressed  their  opinion  more  specifically  with regard  to  the  quality  and  relevance  of  the  information provided to them and on the agendas for the Board meeting, and gave their  points  of  view  on  the  Board's  involvement  in the definition of L'Or\u00e9al's strategy.\n\nThey formulated suggestions for improvements and submitted proposals on strategic issues that they would like to discuss in further detail in 2021.\n\nThe summary of these interviews, carried out by the Secretary of  the  Board,  was  submitted  first  to  the  Nominations  and Governance Committee meeting on 2 December 2020, and, the next day, to the Board of Directors, followed by a debate between the Directors and decisions for 2021.\n\nFirstly,  with  regard  to  the Board's  composition ,  the  Directors considered  it  completely  satisfactory  and  balanced.  The number  of  independent  Directors  is  adequate.    The  current composition,  in  terms  of  profile,  experience  and  gender,  is sufficiently diverse.  Generally,  the  expertise  expected  is definitely  present,  in  particular  the  expertise  of  the  General Management  of  major  international  companies,  which generates  a  significant  business  sensitivity  in  the  Board.  This diversity of profiles and experiences produces very beneficial discussions and covers all areas related to the L'Or\u00e9al strategy, as defined by the Board (see section 2.2.1.2. 'Diversity policy applied to the Board of Directors: experienced Directors who complement one another' of this document.\n\nThe composition of the Committees is considered appropriate, with suitable experts serving on each one.\n\nDespite meetings being held remotely as from March 2020, the new  Directors  have  settled  in  well,  primarily  thanks  to  the existing welcoming procedure which allows new members to rapidly  become  familiar  with  the  Company's  strategic  issues (in  particular,  the  transmittal  of  all  necessary  information documents,  meetings  with  the  Board  Secretary,  organisation of interviews with members  of  the  Group's  Executive Committee).\n\nWith regard to the modus operandi of the Board , it was noted that Directors are active, involved and dynamic. It operates as a  collegial  body.  The  Directors  are  very  attentive  and  fully assume  their  role  by  questioning  General  Management  and proving their ability to think critically. The balance of power is assured, given the composition of the Board (the presence of major shareholders, the number and background of independent Directors) and the freedom of speech available for  all  Directors.  It  is,  in  fact,  easy  to  express  oneself  with  a great freedom of speech that is encouraged by the Chairman within  a  very  positive  climate  of  trust.  The  Directors  welcome the leadership style of the Chairman, who is always very open, clear and transparent. They appreciate his ability to listen and the care and depth with which he answers all questions.\n\nThe Chairman highlights the accomplishment of his management  team,  which  appears  regularly  at  Board meetings,  giving  Directors  the  opportunity  to  get  to  know L'Or\u00e9al's  senior  managers  and  appreciate  their  expertise  in their areas of responsibility.\n\nThe  work  performed  by  the Board's  Committees is  thorough and  meaningful.  The  files  are  well  put-together;  they  enable the work of the Committees to be carried out successfully and result in sound recommendations. The reports provided by the Committee  Chairs  during  Board  meetings  are  appreciated. The  Board  makes  its  decisions  with  complete  confidence  on the basis of Committee recommendations.\n\nThe Strategy and Sustainability Committee works smoothly with good discussions. The Audit Committee is managed very well, with  work  that  is  unanimously  praised.  The  balance  between compliance and business  needs  is  appreciated.  The  work  of the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee  is  well prepared  and  anticipated  with  a  good  level  of  information. Regarding the Nominations and Governance Committee, the Directors stress that it completed an exceptional task this year on the succession process for the General Management.  The quality  of  work  was  unanimously  praised.  The  Committee anticipates Board  composition  issues well. The regular information in the 'Top 100' of executives and the succession plan  for  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  is  a  good practice.\n\nThe pace  and  frequency  of  meetings of  the  Board  are deemed  appropriate.  The  meetings  are  well  organised.  The Directors recommend a respect for schedules and, to achieve this, that  the  agenda  should  not  be  too  heavy.  The videoconference meetings organised due to the health crisis went smoothly, and allowed all issues to be approached and discussed in depth. The Board was able to make its decisions after being fully informed. However, when the health situation permits to do so, face-to-face meetings in person will have to be  the  norm  again,  with  the  possibility  for  Directors  who,  in exceptional cases, are unable to travel, to attend the meeting by means of videoconference.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "Organisation and modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Directors  are  of  the  opinion  that the  Board  and  its Committees receive  complete  and  transparent information , with  a  sufficient  degree  of  detail.  Making  documentation available  prior  to  Board  or  Committee  meetings  boosts  the quality of the debates. In compliance with the requirements of confidentiality and time constraints with which the Company is  faced,  it  is  recommended  that  certain  presentations  are made available before the meetings.\n\nThe  Directors  appreciate  receiving  analysts'  reports  after  the publication  of  the  annual  and  half-yearly  results  and  sales figures.\n\nThe  monthly  press  briefing,  'L'Or\u00e9al  This  Month'  covering business activities in general and the main events in the life of the Group, is very useful. Information, including press releases, that  is  systematically  sent  between  Board  meetings  enables Directors  to  be  continually  in  line  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  business activity.\n\nThe  Nasdaq  BoardVantage  secure  digital  platform  is  not regularly used,  even  though  the  Directors  who  favour traditional 'paper' files recognise that it allows easy access to information. It could, therefore, be used more.\n\nThe agendas for  the  Board  meetings  are  appropriate  and cover all issues.\n\nThe  Directors  appreciate  the  detailed  presentation  of  sales, markets  and  competition,  e-commerce  and  Travel  Retail  at each Board meeting which enables Directors to be immersed in the very operational business of the Company.\n\nIn 2020, thanks to a regular update of the agenda devoted to the consequences of the pandemic on the modus operandi and business of L'Or\u00e9al, the Directors believe that they were well informed about the measures taken to deal with the crisis.\n\nAt the request of the Directors, several presentations made by management  were  focused  on  the  lasting  transformations induced  by  the  health  crisis:  Digital,  with  a  focus  on  ecommerce; the beauty market and the acceleration of new consumer  trends.  These  presentations  were  of  very  high quality,  very  well  prepared,  very  complete  and  transparent. They  enabled  Board  discussions  with  General  Management reflections on the Group's strategic directions.\n\nThe  Board  appreciates  that  its  agendas  and  those  of  the Committee  meetings  cover  all  of  the  Group's  business activities - relating not only to business but also to Ethics, CSR and  Human  Resources,  which  give  an  extremely  complete picture  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  these  issues  that  are deemed to be strategic.\n\nFor example, the Board deemed the presentation of the Chief Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  at  the  Board  meeting  of  6 February 2020 to be very useful. This presentation allowed the Board  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Sharing  Beauty  with  All programme  and  to  discuss  the  new L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme that  contains  the  Group's  CSR  commitments  for the coming decade. The Board was also able to listen to the Executive Vice-President of Human Resources and learn more about  the  issues  related  to  professional  equality  between women  and  men  and  the  targets  established  for  gender balance in management bodies. The Board appreciates that these issues are discussed in detail with a constant concern for promoting best practices.\n\nConcerning  acquisitions,  the  Directors  are  satisfied  with  the way in which projects are presented and discussed. They are in line with the Group's strategy and the General Management  listens  to  the  opinions  of  the  Directors.  The Directors  believe  it  is  important  to  regularly  conduct  an evaluation  after  acquisitions  to  measure  their  impact  on  the Group's growth.\n\nThe  'strategic  orientations'  document  is  very  well  done  and permits constructive dialogue with the central Economic and Social Committee.\n\nThe Directors generally believe that strategic issues are shared properly, at the right level, and without going into operational details.  Decisions  are  taken  after  consideration  of  L'Or\u00e9al's environmental and social challenges.\n\nIn  conclusion,  the  Board  considered  that  its role  of  reflecting on  issues  and  driving  the  Group's  strategic  decision-making was fulfilled satisfactorily. Strategic issues are shared properly, at the right level, and without going into operational detail.\n\nWith regard to Governance issues, the Directors consider that decisions relating to the conditions for organisation of General Management ,  the choices of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors are among the most important  decisions  to  be  made  by  a  Board  of  Directors. During  the  self-assessment  of  the  Board's  modus  operandi, they gave their opinion about the procedure set up in 2019 to define the future governance of L'Or\u00e9al and decided on the successor  to  Jean-Paul  Agon  in  General  Management.  The Directors appreciated that the process was highly anticipated and that the Board received detailed, in-depth reports. They unanimously praised the quality of the work performed by the Nominations and Governance Committee. The separation of offices  as  from  1  May  2021  is  the  mode  of  governance  most adapted  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  situation  as  this  was  reviewed  at  the Board meeting of 14 October 2020. However, they do not take a principled stance; it is important to be pragmatic.\n\nThe Directors do not consider it necessary to appoint a Lead Independent Director .  There would be little interest for L'Or\u00e9al in doing so, given the Board's current composition and modus operandi,  as  well  as  the  freedom  of  speech  enjoyed  by  the Directors.  The  Directors  wish  to  maintain  a  direct  relationship with  the  Chairman,  without  going  through  a  Lead  Director, who  would  intervene  between  the  Chairman  and  the  other Directors.\n\nThe Directors do not have any comment to make concerning the organisation of executive sessions. Since 2016, the Directors meet  at  least  once  a  year  without  the  presence  of  the executive  corporate  officer,  the  Directors  representing  the employees  or  any  other  Group  employee.  Two  executive sessions were held in 2020.\n\nThe Directors consider that great attention should be paid to the handling of conflicts of interest , especially as the strategy is discussed  openly  at  meetings  of  the  Board.  They  find  that these  are  well  managed  by  the  rules  in  force:  nonparticipation  in  discussions  and  decisions,  and  an  annual declaration of independence. They attach particular importance to the analysis of the independence of Directors, which  is  carried  out  in  depth  each  year,  and  deem appropriate the procedure for regular evaluation of agreements  concluded  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business under normal conditions, which was implemented for 2020.\n\nDirectors  consider  that  the  current  procedure  for  organising meetings  with  shareholders ,  investors,  and  proxy  advisors  on issues  of  corporate  governance  (meetings  steered  by  the department  in  charge  of  financial  communication  and shareholder relations) is satisfactory. They appreciate that their expectations  are  detailed  in  the  minutes  taken  in  the Committee  and  Board  meetings  by  the  Secretary  of  the Board, who is in attendance.\n\nThe  Directors  representing  employees  were  appreciative  of the training they were offered: on the one hand, the diploma course provided by Sciences Po and the Institut Fran\u00e7ais des Administrateurs  (IFA);  on  the  other  hand,  a  training  course designed to develop digital knowledge and expertise.",

        "page_content": "Concerning  the  Board's self-evaluation  procedure in  2021, the Board believes that there is no reason to revise the current procedure,  which  was  enhanced  with  the  questionnaire prepared  with  the  assistance  of  the  Spencer  Stuart  firm.  The interview guide will be re-examined again by the Nominations and  Governance  Committee,  after  having  been  reviewed, where applicable, by the same external firm consulted on the best operating practices for Boards of directors. The Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  will  supervise  the process in liaison with the Secretary of the Board. The summary of  the  interviews  with  the  Directors  has  been  discussed  at a Board meeting as is the case every year.\n\nFor 2021 ,  various decisions with regard to improvements were made. They concern, in particular, the adherence to timing in the meetings and the time required to provide management information  and  presentations.  The  Directors  also  stated  their desire to go into further detail about certain strategic points.\n\nThe  Directors  made  proposals  for  topics  to  be  included  on  the Board's agenda in 2021 and the organisation of the 2021 strategy seminar. After discussion and review, a list of priority subjects was drawn up by the Board meeting of 6 December 2020.\n\n## PREAMBLE\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al  ('the  Company')  is  a collegial body which is mandated by all the shareholders. It has  the  authority  given  to  it  by  law  to  act  in  all circumstances in the best interests of the Company.\n\nBy  exercising  its  legal  prerogatives,  the  Board  of  Directors ('the Board') fulfils the following main duties: it validates the Company's  strategic  orientations,  appoints  the  corporate officers given responsibility for managing the Company within the scope  of  this  strategy, chooses  the  method  of organisation  of  General  Management  (combination  or separation  of  the  roles  of  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer),  oversees  management  and  ensures  the  quality  of the  financial  and  non-financial  information  provided  to  the shareholders and to the markets.\n\nThe organisation of the Board's work and its composition is adapted to the specificities of L'Or\u00e9al and is in line with an approach of constant progress. The Board's main responsibility is to adopt the method of organisation and the modus operandi which enable it to perform its duties to the best of its  ability.  Its  organisation  and  modus  operandi  are described  in  these  Internal  Rules  which  it  draws  up,  and which are published in full on L'Or\u00e9al's website and in the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.3.5. Appendix: Complete text of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors\n\nThese Rules are applicable to all present and future Directors, whether they are appointed by the General Meeting or by the employees,  and  are  intended  to  complement  the  legal, regulatory  and  statutory  rules  and  those  under  the  Articles of Association in order to state accurately the modus operandi of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  committees,  in  the  interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  refers  to  the  principles  of corporate  governance  as  presented  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code.  The  Internal  Rules  specify  the  modus  operandi  of  the Board,  in  the  interests  of  the  Company  and  of  all  its shareholders,  and  those  of  its  Committees,  whose  members are Directors to whom it gives preparatory assignments for its work. The latest updates to the Internal Rules were made on 11 February 2021. The update was to specify, in the duties of the Nominations and Governance Committee, the procedure for  reviewing  and  proposing  candidates  for  new  Directors  to the Board of Directors. As was the case for previous versions, the Internal Rules are made public in full in this section.\n\nThe Board's actions are carried out within the framework of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. The Corporate Governance Report provides more detail on the Board's composition and on the way in which the Board's work is prepared and organised, and explains, where applicable, the recommendations that have  not  been  adopted  in  light  of  the  Company's specificities.\n\nThese  Rules  apply  to  all  the  Directors,  both  current  and future, whether they are appointed by the Annual General Meeting or the employees, and are intended to complement  the  legal,  regulatory  and  statutory  rules  and those  under  the  Articles  of  Association  in  order  to  state accurately  the  modus  operandi  of  the  Board  of  Directors and its committees.\n\n## 1. Remit and authority of Board of Directors\n\n## 1.1. General powers of the Board\n\nThe  Board  defines  the  business  strategy  of  the  Company and  monitors  its  implementation,  in  accordance  with  its corporate interest, taking social and environmental challenges into consideration.\n\nSubject  to  the  powers  expressly  conferred  to  Annual General  Meetings  and  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose,  the  Board  deals  with  all  matters  regarding  the smooth  running  of  the  Company  and  settles  issues concerning the Company by virtue of its decisions. At any time  in  the  year,  the  Board  carries  out  the  controls  and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nThe  Board  ensures,  as  appropriate,  that  a  mechanism  for the prevention and detection of corruption and influencepeddling is in place.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "The Board also ensures that the executive corporate officers implement  a  policy  of  non-discrimination  and  diversity  as regards the balance of women and men in management bodies.\n\nThe  Corporate  Governance  Report  relays  the  Board's activity.\n\nThe  Board  prepares  for  and  convenes  Annual  General Meetings and sets the agenda. It puts the parent company and  consolidated  financial  statements  to  the  vote  and presents  to  the  meeting  its  Management  Report  to  which the Corporate Governance Report is appended.\n\nThe Board sets the remuneration of directors and corporate officers. It reports  on  its  policy  and  decisions  in  its Management  Report  and  in  the  Corporate  Governance Report. The Annual General Meeting is consulted every year on  the  components  of  remuneration  due  or  allocated  to each executive corporate officer for the past financial year. The  Board  is a  collegial  body  which  is  legally  unable  to delegate its authority, except to the General Management in  those  cases  expressly  provided  for  by  law.  Within  the scope of its work, it may decide to set up Committees which do not have decision-making powers but have the task of providing  all  useful  information  for  the  discussions  and decisions  which  it  is  called  upon  to  make.  The  Board decides  on  the  composition  of  the  Committees  and  the rules with regard to their modus operandi.\n\nThe  Board  may  ask  one  or  more  of  its  members  or  third parties to carry out special assignments or projects aimed in particular at studying one of more specific topics.\n\n## 1.2. Relations between General Management and the Board\n\n## 1.2.1. Forms of General Management\n\nGeneral Management of the Company is carried out, under the  responsibility  of  either  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) or by another  individual  with  the  position  of  Chief  Executive Officer.  Leaving  the  possibility  to  choose  between  the separation  or  combination  of  roles,  French  law  does  not give preference to any form and gives the Board authority to choose between the two methods of organisation of the General  Management  in  light  of  the  specificities  of  the Company.\n\nWhether  the  General  Management  is  carried  out  by  a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a Chief Executive Officer,  the  Board  has  the  same  prerogatives.  It  may  in particular take all specific measures aimed at ensuring the continued balance of powers.\n\n## 1.2.2. Powers of General Management\n\nThe  General  Management,  which  may  be  carried  out  by the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  by  a  Chief Executive Officer, is vested with the broadest powers to act in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company.  It  must exercise  these  powers  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose subject to the powers expressly granted by French law  to  General  Shareholders'  Meetings  and  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe Board has the possibility to provide for limitations on the powers  of  the  General  Management.  Thus,  transactions which may materially impact the scope of consolidation of the  Company,  in  particular,  transactions  involving  an amount in excess of \u20ac250,000,000 and all new transactions\n\nwhich  are  outside  the  normal  course  of  business  for  an amount in excess of \u20ac50,000,000, must be submitted to the Board.  In  any  event,  the  Board  of  Directors  must  be informed  of  the  conclusion  and  implementation  of  all transactions.\n\nThe  General  Management  represents  the  Company  in  its dealings with third parties.\n\nUpon a proposal by the Chief Executive Officer, the Board may appoint one or more individuals responsible for assisting the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  will  hold  the  corporate office of Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s).\n\n## 1.2.3. Duties of General Management\n\nWhatever the form of organisation chosen (Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  or  Chief  Executive  Officer),  the General Management is required to provide each Director with  all  the  documents  and  information  required  to  carry out their duties.\n\nMore  specifically,  the  General  Management  provides  the Board members with useful information in connection with the preparation of meetings, or at any time during the life of the  Company  if  the  importance  or  urgency  of  the information so requires. This provision of ongoing information also  includes  any  relevant  information  concerning  the Company,  and  in  particular  press  articles  and  reports containing financial analysis.\n\nThe  General  Management  gives  the  Board  and  its Committees the possibility to meet with the senior managers of  L'Or\u00e9al  within  the  strict  framework  of  their  remits  and duties.  In  consultation  with  the  General  Management,  the Board and the Committees may use external consultants if they consider it necessary.\n\nThe Board is informed, at the time of closing of the annual financial statements and the review of the interim financial statements  or  at  any  other  time  if  necessary,  of  the Company's financial position and cash position.\n\n## 2. Composition of the Board\n\n## 2.1. Directors\n\nThe Directors of the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 provide their expertise and professional experience;\n- \u00b7 are  required  to  act  with  due  care  and  attention  and participate  actively  in  the  work  and  discussions  of the Board;\n- \u00b7 have complete freedom of judgement.\n\nThis  freedom  of  judgement  enables  them  in  particular  to participate,  in  total  independence,  in  the  decisions  and work  of  the  Board,  and,  where  appropriate,  of  its Committees.\n\n## 2.1.1. Independence\n\nThe  Board  reviews  the  independence  of  each  of  its members  every  year,  after  obtaining  the  opinion  of  the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  in  particular  in light of the independence criteria in the AFEP-MEDEF Code and  taking  account  of  the  specific  needs  of  L'Or\u00e9al. The  findings  of  this  evaluation  are  reported  to  the shareholders and made available to the general public.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.2. Diversity\n\nThe Board considers the issue of the desirable balance of its composition  and  that  of  its  Committees,  notably  in  the representation  of  men  and  women,  nationalities  and diversity  of  skills.  The  objectives,  terms  and  conditions,  and results  of  its  policy  in  this  area  are  made  public  in  the Corporate  Governance  Report  and  included  in  the Registration Document.\n\n## 2.1.3. Terms of office\n\nThe  length  of  the  term  of  office  of  Directors  is  four  years. However, the staggering of the terms of office is organised in order to avoid renewing too many Directors at once and favour renewing Directors harmoniously.\n\nIn  principle,  it  is  agreed  by  the  Board  members  that  all Directors  will  tender  their  resignation  to  the  Board  prior  to the  Annual  General  Meeting  following  their  73 rd birthday and that they will no longer apply for renewal of their term of  office  if  this  rule  does  not  enable  them  to  perform  their office for at least two years.\n\nIn  any  event,  in  accordance  with  French  law  and  the Articles  of  Association,  the  total  number  of  Directors  who are over 70 years of age may not exceed one third of the Directors in office.\n\n## 2.2. Chairman of the Board\n\nThe Board of Directors must elect a Chairman from among its members.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  organises  and  oversees  the Board's  work  and  reports  thereon  to  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman  is actively involved in defining the Company's growth strategy and encourages and strengthens, inter alia, links between the Company and the main market players.\n\nThe Chairman oversees the work of the Company's bodies responsible  for  corporate  governance  and  ensures,  in particular, that the Directors are able to perform their duties. He  may  ask  for  the  communication  of  any  document  or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  must  use  his  best  efforts  to promote the values and image of the Company at all times. He expresses his views in that capacity.\n\nHe  is  provided  with  the  material  resources  required  to  perform his duties.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  takes  care,  particularly  in  the event  of  separation  of  roles,  to  develop  and  maintain  a trustful and regular relationship between the Board and the General  Management,  in  order  to  guarantee  continuous, ongoing  implementation  by  the  General  Management  of the strategies defined by the Board.\n\n## 3. Rights and obligations of the Directors\n\n## 3.1. Knowledge of and compliance with regulatory texts, recommendations and obligations\n\nEach of the members of the Board declares that they have read the following documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company's Articles of Association;\n- \u00b7 the  legal  and  regulatory  texts  that  govern  French 'soci\u00e9t\u00e9s  anonymes'  (public  limited  companies)  within the framework of the functioning of a Board of Directors and, in particular, the rules relating to:\n- \u00b7 the number of offices that may be held simultaneously,\n- \u00b7 the agreements and transactions concluded between the Director and the Company,\n- \u00b7 the definition of the powers of the Board of Directors,\n- \u00b7 the  holding  and  use  of  inside  information,  which  are discussed in section 4.6. ;\n- \u00b7 the recommendations defined in the AFEP-MEDEF Code;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Stock Market Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 and the provisions of these Rules.\n\n## 3.2. Respect for the interests of the Company\n\nThe Directors are required to act in all circumstances in the interest of the Company and all its shareholders.\n\nThe Directors are obliged to notify the Board of any situation that  may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if  such conflict is only potential, and must refrain from participating in the corresponding deliberations.\n\nThe Directors must inform the Board every year of the offices and  positions  they  hold  in  other  companies  and  of  any conflicts of interest, even if they are only potential, that they have  identified  (see  Annual  Report  on  independence under Article 4.4).\n\nThe Board furthermore discusses every year the assessment of  whether  or  not  the  business  relationships  maintained between  the  companies  in  which  the  Directors  hold  their offices  and  the  Company  are  significant.  It  reports  on  its evaluation in the Registration Document.\n\n## 3.3. Obligations of due diligence and provision of information\n\nThe Director must devote the necessary time and attention to his/her duties.\n\nHe/she must limit the number of offices held so as to ensure his/her availability.\n\nA  Director  must  not  hold  more  than  four  other  terms  of office  in  listed  companies  outside  the  Group,  including foreign companies. The Director concerned is given enough time to bring his/her situation into compliance with this rule, where required.\n\nThe  Director  must  keep  the  Board  informed  of  the  terms  of office held in other companies, including his/her participation on  the  Board  Committees  of  such  French  or  foreign companies.\n\n2",

The  Director  must  ask  for  the  Board's opinion before accepting a new corporate office in a listed company.\n\nEach Board member undertakes to be diligent:\n\n- \u00b7 by  attending  all  Board  meetings,  where  necessary  by means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities, except in the case of a major impediment;\n- \u00b7 by attending, whenever possible, all General Shareholders' Meetings;\n- \u00b7 by attending the meetings of the Board Committees of which he/she is a member.\n\nThe  Corporate  Governance  Report  gives  shareholders  all useful  information  on  the  Directors'  individual  participation in these sessions and meetings.\n\nIn connection with decisions to be made, the Director must ensure that he/she has all the information he/she considers essential for the smooth conduct of the work of the Board or the Committees. If this information is not made available to him/her,  or  he/she  considers  that  it  has  not  been  made available,  he/she  must  request  such  information  from  the Chairman of the Board who is required to ensure that the Directors are in a position to perform their duties.\n\n## 3.4. Training for Directors\n\nAll  the  Directors,  and  in  particular  those  representing  the employees, may  benefit, on their appointment or throughout their directorship, from the appropriate training programmes for the performance of the office.\n\nThese training programmes are organised and proposed by the Company and are provided at its expense.\n\n## 3.5. Obligation of reserve and confidentiality\n\nThe Directors undertake not to express themselves individually  other  than  in  the  internal  deliberations  of  the Board on questions raised at Board meetings.\n\nOutside the Company, only collegial expression is possible, particularly in the form of releases intended to provide the markets with information.\n\nWith  regard  to  information  not  in  the  public  domain  to which the Director has access as a result of his duties, the Director  must  consider  him/herself  to  be  bound  by  strict professional confidentiality, which is more demanding than the  mere  legal  obligation  of  discretion.  This  obligation applies to all persons called on to attend Board meetings, and covers all information of a confidential nature and all information  presented  as  confidential  by  the  Chairman  of the Board.\n\nBeyond this legal obligation and to ensure the quality of the discussions  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  all  the  information given to Board members and the opinions they express must be kept strictly confidential.\n\nThis  obligation  applies  to  any  person  invited  to  attend  a Board meeting.\n\n## 3.6. Stock market ethics\n\n## 3.6.1. Principles\n\nThe  Company  has  put  in  place a  'Stock  Market  Code  of Ethics'  that  is  regularly  updated,  in  particular  to  take  into account changes in the regulations in force. This Code was updated following the applicability, as from 3 July 2016, of European  Regulation  (EU)  No.  596/2014  on  market  abuse ('Market  Abuse  Regulation').  The  Board  members  comply with the Principles of Stock Market Ethics 'related to inside information' provided for by this code.\n\nInside information must only be used by the Director in the exercise of his office. Such information must in no case be communicated to a third party other than in the exercise of the Director's duties, and for any other purpose or any other activity than those for which it is held.\n\nIt is the duty of all Directors to refrain from trading in, having others  trade  in,  or  enabling  others  (including  through recommendations  or  encouragements)  to  trade  in  the securities  of  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  this  information, until such time as the information has been made public.\n\nIt is the personal responsibility of each Director to determine whether the information he/she holds is inside information or not, and accordingly whether he/she may or may not use or transmit any of the information, and whether he/she may or  may  not  trade  or  have  others  trade  in  the  Company's securities.\n\n## 3.6.2. Abstention periods\n\nDuring  the  period  preceding  the  publication  of  any  inside information  to  which  Directors  have  access,  in  their capacity of insiders, the members of the Board must by law refrain from all trading in the Company's securities.\n\nFurthermore,  in accordance  with  the  Market  Abuse Regulation  and  the  recommendations  of  the  French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), they are prohibited from trading in the Company's shares over the following periods:\n\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  30  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication of the press release on the annual and half-year results;\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  15  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication  of  the  press  release  on  quarterly  financial information.\n\nThe Directors are only authorised to trade in L'Or\u00e9al shares on the day after publishing the press release.\n\n## 3.6.3. Insider trading\n\nThe  Director  has  been  informed  of  the  provisions  in  force relating to the holding of inside information, insider trading and the unlawful disclosure of inside information: Articles  465-1  et  seq.,  L.  621-14  and  L.  621-15,  III  c  of  the French Monetary and Financial Code and Articles 7 et seq. of the Market Abuse Regulation.",

Obligation to declare trading in the securities of the Company\n\nIn accordance  with  the  applicable  regulations,  the Directors  and  closely  associated  persons,  as  defined  by Article  3.1.26  of  the  Market  Abuse  Regulation,  must  inform the AMF (1) of all acquisitions, sales, subscriptions or trades of the  Company's  shares  and  transactions  involving  related instruments where the cumulative amount  of  such transactions is higher than \u20ac20,000 for the current calendar year.\n\nThe  Directors  and  closely  associated  persons  must  submit their declarations to the AMF by e-mail within three trading days following completion of the transaction.\n\nThese individuals must simultaneously provide a copy of this declaration  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Company's  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe declarations are then posted on the AMF's website and are  mentioned  in  an  annual  summary  set  out  in  the Company's Management Report.\n\n## 3.6.5.

Modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\n## 4.1. Convening the Board\n\nThe Board is convened by any appropriate means. Notices convening a meeting may be transmitted by the Secretary of  the  Board  of  Directors.  They  are  sent  in  writing  at  least eight  days  prior  to  each  meeting,  except  in  particular circumstances.  The  notices  specify  the  venue  of  the meeting,  which  may  be  the  headquarters  or  any  other venue.\n\nAll the documents that are necessary to inform the Directors about the agenda and about any questions submitted to the  Board  for  review  are  enclosed  with  the  notice convening  the  meeting  or  are  sent  or  provided  to  them within a reasonable period of time, prior to the meeting.\n\nThese  documents  may  be  provided  to  them  on  a  secure digital platform, within a reasonable period of time prior to the meeting. They may in exceptional cases be provided at the meeting.\n\n## 4.2. Board meetings and method of participation\n\nThe  Board  meets  as  often  as  required  in  the  best  interest of the Company, and at least five times per year.\n\nThe dates of the Board meetings for the following year are set  no  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  summer,  except  in the case of Extraordinary Meetings.\n\nThe frequency and length of Board meetings must be such that they allow for an in-depth review and discussion of the matters  that  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  remits  of  the Committees.\n\nThe Directors meet once a year without the presence of the executive  corporate  officer,  the  Directors  representing  the employees or any other Group employee.\n\nIn accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions and with  Article  9  paragraph  2  of  the  Articles  of  Association, Directors  who  take  part  in  Board  meetings  by  means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities are deemed to be present for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the quorum and the majority.\n\nThese  means  must  guarantee  simultaneous,  continuous retransmission of the debates.\n\nHowever, these means of participation are excluded when the Board so decides and in any event when it decides with regard to closing of the Company's parent company and consolidated  financial  statements  and  on  the  preparation of the Management Report.\n\nA Director who participates by means of videoconference or teletransmission must ensure that the confidentiality of the debates is preserved.\n\nThe attendance register mentions the Board members who attend  Board  meetings  by  means  of  videoconference  or telecommunication  facilities,  with  the  Secretary  of  the meeting having the task of initialling the register for them.\n\n## 4.3. Minutes of Board meetings\n\nMinutes are prepared for each Board meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting mention the use of videoconference  or  telecommunication  facilities  and  the name  of  each  person  who  participated  in  the  Board  by such  means.  The  minutes  also  indicate  whether  any technical  incidents  occurred  during  a  meeting  held  by means of videoconference or telecommunication facilities, and if such incidents disrupted the course of the meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the deliberations include a summary of the debates  and  specify  the  decisions  that  were  made.  They mention the questions raised or the reservations expressed by participants.\n\nThe draft minutes of the last Board meeting are sent or given to all the Directors at the latest on the date when the next meeting is convened.\n\n2",

Secretary of the Board\n\nThe Secretary is appointed by the Board. He/she assists the Chairman in  organising  the  Board's  work  and  in  particular with regard to the definition of the annual work programme and the dates of Board meetings.\n\nWith  the  support  of  the  General  Management,  he/she ensures the quality and production, sufficiently in advance, of the documents and drafts put to the vote of the Board at its meetings.\n\nHe/she prepares the draft minutes of Board meetings, which are submitted for the Board's approval.\n\nHe/she  is  responsible  for  the  secure  IT  platform  made available to the Directors.\n\nHe/she  monitors  on  an  ongoing  basis  changes  in  the regulations  and  reflections  in  the  marketplace  with  regard to the corporate governance of listed companies.\n\nThe  Secretary  organises,  together  with  the  Chairman,  the annual  evaluation  of  the  Board's  work  and  receives  the annual  reports  on  independence  by  each  Director  (see Article 3.2).\n\nEvery Director may consult the Board Secretary at any time with regard to the scope of the rights and obligations linked to his/her office.\n\n## 4.5. Annual evaluation of the modus operandi of the Board\n\nEvery year, the Board carries out an evaluation of its ability to respond to the expectations of shareholders by reviewing its composition, its organisation and its modus operandi.\n\nAt  its  last  meeting  for  the  year  and  on  the  basis  of  a summary of the interviews that are previously organised and conducted  with  each  Director,  on  the  basis  of  a  guide which  includes  the  recommendations  adopted  by  the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board discusses points of view and opinions  expressed.  It  draws  the  conclusions  from  this  with the aim of improving the conditions for the preparation and organisation of its work and that of its Committees.\n\nThe results of the evaluation, with the avenues of progress that remain open, are passed on to the shareholders in the Annual Report and at the time of the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## 5. Board Committees\n\nWhen  the  Board  sets  up  Committees,  it  appoints  the members of these Committees and determines their duties and responsibilities.\n\nThese Committees act within the remit granted to them by the  Board  and  therefore  have  no  decision-making  power. The Committees may not at any time take over the powers of the General Management as set out in chapter 1.2.2. of these Rules.\n\nThe Committee members are Directors. They are appointed by  the  Board  in  person  and  may  not  be  represented.  All Board  members  have  the  necessary  qualifications  due  to their  professional  experience.  They  actively  take  part  in Committee meetings with complete freedom of judgement and in the interest of the Company.\n\nThe task of secretary of each Committee is carried out by a person  appointed  in  agreement  with  the  Chairman/\n\nChairwoman of the Committee. It may also be performed by the Secretary of the Board.\n\nEach  Committee  defines  the  frequency  of  its  meetings. These meetings are held at the Company's headquarters or at any other place decided by the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Committee.\n\nThe  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  each  Committee  prepares the agenda for each meeting.\n\nThe Committees may make contact, in the performance of their  duties,  with  the  Company's  main  senior  managers,  in agreement  with  the  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  the  Board and  after  informing  the  General  Management  and  will report on such contacts to the Board.\n\nThe Board may entrust a Committee Chair, or one or more of its members, with a special assignment or project to carry out  specific  research  or  study  future  possibilities.  The designated  individual  will  report  on  this  work  to  the Committee  concerned  such  that  the  Committee  may deliberate  on  this  work  and  in  turn  report  thereon  to  the Board.\n\nFor each Committee meeting, its members may decide to invite  any  other  person of their choice to attend as needs be  and  on  an  advisory  basis,  when  they  consider  it appropriate.\n\nIn its field of competence, each Committee makes proposals and  recommendations  and  expresses  opinions  as  the  case may be. For this purpose, it may carry out or have carried out any  studies  that  may  assist  the  Board's  deliberations.  When they use the services of external consultants, the Committees must ensure that their service is objective.\n\n## 5.1. Strategy and Sustainability Committee\n\n## 5.1.1. Remits\n\nThe remit of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee is to throw  light,  through  its  analyses  and  debates,  on  the Group's strategic orientations as submitted to the Board of Directors and to monitor the implementation and advancement of significant operations in progress.\n\nThe Committee examines:\n\n- \u00b7 the  main  strategic  lines  of  development,  options  and projects  presented  by  the  General  Management,  and their  economic,  financial,  societal  and  environmental consequences;\n- \u00b7 opportunities  for  acquisitions  or  investments  that  involve significant  amounts  or  represent  a  departure  from  the Group's  usual  business  operations,  and  the  conditions relating to their implementation;\n- \u00b7 financial transactions that could significantly change the balance sheet structure;\n- \u00b7 the Company's commitments with regard to Sustainable Development, in light of the issues specific to the Group's business activities and its objectives, and the means and resources put in place;\n- \u00b7 the proposed strategic orientations to be defined by the Board  with  a  view  to  consultation  of  the  Central  Works Council.\n\nMore  generally,  the  Committee  debates  all  questions considered  essential  for  the  future  strategy  of  the  Group and for preserving its main financial balances.",

Remuneration policy for corporate officers\n\nThe Board refers, in particular, to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code for the determination of the remuneration and benefits granted to corporate officers.\n\nAccording to this Code, corporate officers (' dirigeants mandataires sociaux ')  of  a  French  ' soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme \u00e0 conseil d'administration '  (public  limited  company  with  a  Board  of Directors)  are:  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer ( Pr\u00e9sident-Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral ), the CEO, and Directeurs G\u00e9n\u00e9raux D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s (executive  corporate  officers),  and  the  Chairman/ Chairwoman of the Board without assuming the office of Chief Executive Officer (non-executive corporate officers).\n\nOn 14 October 2020, L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors announced its  intention  to  dissociate  the  functions  of  Chairman  of  the Board and Chief Executive Officer as from 1 May 2021.\n\nThe  Board  announced  its  intention  to  renew  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon's  mandate  as  Chairman,  a  position  he  has  held  since 2011, and to appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAs of this date, the remuneration policies are applied to:\n\n- \u00b7 Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  in  his  position  as  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer until 30 April 2021, then Chairman of the Board as from 1 May 2021; and\n- \u00b7 Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  in  his  position  as  Chief  Executive Officer as from 1 May 2021.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code,  the  Board  ensures  that  the  remuneration  policy complies  with  the  principles  of  comprehensiveness,  balance, comparability,  consistency,  transparency  and  proportionality, and takes into account market practices.",

Remuneration policy applicable to executive corporate officers\n\n## A/ Fundamental principles for determination of the remuneration of executive corporate officers\n\n## Specific requirements for appointments as executive corporate officers for employees who have completely succeeded in the various stages of their careers in the Group\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  constant  practice  has  been  to  appoint  senior managers  who  have  completely  succeeded  in  the  various stages  of  their  careers  in  the  Group  as  executive  corporate officers.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  executive  corporate officers is the logical result of this choice.\n\nIt must  make  it  possible  to  attract  the  most  talented employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  to  the  very  top  positions  in  General Management, without them being deprived for all that, after a long career in the Group, of the benefits to which they would have continued to be entitled had they remained employees.\n\nTo  achieve  this  objective,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to maintain  the  employment  contract  of  executive  corporate officers  with  at  least  15  years'  of  service  at  the  time  of  their appointment  in  the  Group  and  ensured  that  the  benefits under the suspended employment contract are not combined with those in respect of the corporate office.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  considered  that  the  objective pursued  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  and  intended  to  avoid  the combination  of  benefits  drawn  from  both  an  employment contract and a corporate office, could be fully achieved by maintaining the suspended employment contract and clearly separating  the  benefits  related  to  the  corporate  office  from those relating to the employment contract.\n\nThis is why the Board of Directors has decided to make a clear distinction between:\n\n- \u00b7 firstly, the remuneration  components  related  to  the corporate office: fixed and variable remuneration, grant of performance shares; and\n- \u00b7 secondly, the other benefits that may be due pursuant to the suspended employment contract: termination indemnities, retirement indemnities in the event of voluntary retirement or retirement at the Company's  request, financial consideration for the non-compete clause and the defined benefit pension scheme.\n\nRemuneration  in  respect  of  the  corporate  office  will  in  no event  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  calculation  of  all benefits  that  may  be  due  under  the  employment  contract described above.\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for  the  calculation  of  the  aforementioned  pension  scheme, will  be  based on the amount of remuneration at the date of suspension  of  the  employment  contract.  This  reference remuneration  is  revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund (Caisse nationale d'assurance  vieillesse).  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire  career,  including  the  years  spent  as  an  executive corporate officer.\n\nInformation  on  the  benefits  that  could  be  owed  under  the suspended employment contract are discussed in\n\nsection  2.4.3.  'Termination  indemnities  and  supplementary pension  scheme  applicable  to  corporate  officers'  of  this chapter.\n\nExecutive corporate officers are also treated in the same way as  senior  managers  during  the  term  of  their  corporate  office which allows them to continue to benefit from the additional social protection schemes and, in particular, from the defined contribution pension scheme, and the employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\n## Remuneration that is consistent with that of the Company's senior managers\n\nThe remuneration policy for executive corporate officers is in line,  where  applicable,  with  the  policy  which  was  applied  to them as senior managers.\n\nTheir level of remuneration as an executive corporate officer is set on the basis of the level of responsibilities they exercised in the company at the time of their appointment.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  is  based  on  the  same  foundations and  instruments  as  those  applied  to  the  Company's  senior managers.  The  remuneration  principles  are  therefore  stable and durable.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  informed  every  year  of  the  Group's Human  Resources  policy.  It  is  in  a  position  to  verify  the consistency between the remuneration of executive corporate officers and the procedures in place, particularly for the  members  of  the  Group's  Executive  Committee,  on  the basis of the work by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\n## Competitive remuneration in comparison to a coherent and stable reference panel\n\nThe  remuneration  of  executive  corporate  officers  must  be competitive in order to attract, motivate and retain the best talents in the Company's top positions.\n\nThis  remuneration  is  assessed  overall,  namely  by  taking  into account all the components that make it up.\n\nTo assess the competitiveness of this remuneration, a coherent and stable  reference  panel  is  defined  with  the  assistance  of an external consulting firm.\n\nThe panel consists of French and international companies that have  leading  global  positions.  These  companies  operate  on similar  markets  and  are,  in  the  cosmetics  sector,  direct competitors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  or  operate  on  the  wider  everyday consumer goods market, as regards all or part of their business activities.\n\nThis  panel  is  composed  of  the  remuneration  of  executives  in the following companies:\n\n| Coty          | Kimberly  Clark    | Reckitt  Benckiser   | Beiersdorf   | Danone             |\n|---------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| GSK           | Henkel             | LVMH                 | Unilever     | Colgate  Palmolive |\n| Est\u00e9e  Lauder | Johnson &  Johnson | Procter &  Gamble    | Kering       | Colgate  Palmolive |\n\nThis panel is re-examined every year by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee in order to check its relevance. It may evolve, particularly to take into account the changes in the structure  or  business  activities  of  selected  companies,  on the basis of the proposals made by the external firm.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "Remuneration of directors and corporate officers\n\n## Remuneration that is aligned to the Company's interests and directly linked to the Company's strategy\n\nThe Board of Directors has aligned the remuneration policy for an  executive  corporate  officer  in  the  interests  of  the Company, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and development of the Company, taking into consideration the social  and  environmental  challenges  of  its  business  activity and the sense of purpose (raison d'\u00eatre) of L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## a) Close links with strategy\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  applied  to  the  executive  corporate officer is directly linked to the Group's strategy.\n\nIt  supports  its  development  model.  It  promotes  harmonious, regular, durable growth, both over the short and long term.\n\nThe Board of Directors' constant desire is indeed to incite the General  Management  both  to  maximise  performance  for each  financial  year  and  to  ensure  that  it  is  repeated  and regular year-on-year.\n\n## b) Performance targets that are directly correlated with those of the Company and create value\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  chooses  to  correlate  the  executive corporate officer's performance directly with the Company's performance  by  using  the  same  performance  indicators, financial indicators in particular.\n\nThe  choice  of  correlating  the  performance  criteria  for  the executive corporate officer's remuneration with the Company's  performance  indicators,  particularly  those  of  a financial  nature,  is  the  guarantee  of  a  clear  and  relevant remuneration policy.\n\nThese  criteria  make  it  possible  to  assess  L'Or\u00e9al's  intrinsic performance,  namely  its  progress  year-on-year  via  internal performance  indicators  and  also  its  relative  performance  as compared  to  its  market  and  its  competitors  via  external growth indicators.\n\nThe objectives adopted generate long-term value creation. In particular, the choice of varied operational financial criteria aims  at  encouraging  durable,  balanced  growth.  Overall long-term performance results from the convergence of these criteria.\n\nThese objectives must also be an incentive for the executive corporate  officer  to  adapt  the  Group's  strategy  to  the profound  transformations  in  the  world  of  beauty,  and  the digital revolution in particular.\n\n## c) Preponderant portion of the remuneration subject to performance conditions\n\nThe executive corporate officer's remuneration must include a predominant portion subject to performance conditions, with annual and multi-annual assessment periods adapted to the time horizon of each of these objectives.\n\n## Remuneration that is directly in line with the Group's ambitious social, societal and environmental commitments\n\nThe remuneration must be designed to favour a regular and sustainable development, in line with the Group's commitments  with  regard  to  ethics,  and  respectful  of  the environment in which L'Or\u00e9al operates.\n\nIn  2020  L'Or\u00e9al  announced its Corporate Social Responsibility vision  by  2030  in  the  context  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme,  which  has  a  set  of  objectives  for  climate, biodiversity, water and the use of natural resources.\n\nThe social and societal commitment is just as important since no  environmental  transition  is  possible  without  an  inclusive society.\n\nThe  annual  variable  portion  of  the  executive  corporate officer's remuneration includes non-financial criteria related to L'Or\u00e9al's sense of purpose and the commitments made by the Group,  particularly  in  the  context  of  its  corporate  social, societal and environmental responsibility programmes.\n\nThese  criteria  will  be  assessed  year-on-year  with  a  long-term perspective.\n\n## Remuneration that creates medium- or -long-term value for the shareholders\n\nThe executive corporate officer's remuneration must be linked\n\nto the  changes  over  the  medium -to long-term  in  the Company's intrinsic value and share performance.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  the  executive  corporate  officer's remuneration thus consists of performance shares, a significant percentage  of  which  is  retained  until  the  end  of  his/her corporate  office,  with  the  undertaking  not  to  carry  out  risk hedging transactions.\n\nThis leads  to  alignment  with  the  shareholders'  interests, understood as long-term value creation.\n\n## B/ Policy on fixed and variable remuneration and granting of performance shares to the executive corporate officer\n\n## The key for allocating annual remuneration\n\nThe  annual  remuneration  of  the  executive  corporate  officer consists of a fixed remuneration, an  annual  variable remuneration and the granting of performance shares.\n\nIt does not include any exceptional components.\n\nThe Board of Directors adopts the various components of this remuneration,  paying  attention  to  the  necessary  balance between each of them.\n\nEach  component  of  annual  remuneration  corresponds  to  a well-defined and clearly substantiated objective.\n\nThe  various  components  of  annual  remuneration  form  a balanced whole with a breakdown that is approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  fixed  remuneration  and  target  annual variable remuneration;\n- \u00b7 50/50 between  annual  remuneration  and  long-term remuneration (performance shares);\n- \u00b7 50/50 between  cash  remuneration  and  share-based remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 75/25  between  remuneration  subject  to  performance conditions  and  remuneration  not  subject  to  performance conditions.",

It  serves  as  a  basis  to determine  the  maximum  percentage  of  the  target  annual variable remuneration.\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nThe  target  annual  variable  remuneration  may  amount  to a maximum of 100% of the fixed remuneration.\n\nAs  from  1  May  2021,  the  annual  variable  remuneration  may exceed 100% of the fixed remuneration and up to a maximum of 120% of this remuneration in order to be able to remunerate outperformance.  This  outperformance  is  assessed  on  a criterion-by-criterion basis.\n\nThe aim is not to encourage inappropriate and excessive risk taking.  For  this  purpose,  the  annual  variable  remuneration remains reasonable in comparison with the fixed portion.\n\nThe variable remuneration is designed to align the executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  with  the  Group's  annual performance  and  to  promote  the  implementation  of  its strategy year after year.\n\nThe  variable  remuneration  is  based  on  precise  performance appraisal criteria determined at the beginning of the year by the Board of Directors.\n\nThese criteria are financial, non-financial and qualitative.\n\nThe  financial  and  non-financial  criteria  are  simple  and quantifiable.  They  represent  a  predominant  portion  of  the annual variable remuneration.\n\nA limit is set on the qualitative portion.\n\nThe weighting of each of the criteria and the objectives to be met  are  set  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  in  question  and communicated to the executive corporate officer.\n\nThese criteria are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 for 60% of the annual variable remuneration:\n- \u00b7 financial  criteria  directly  correlated  with  the  Company's performance indicators:\n- -evolution  in  comparable  sales  as  compared  to  the budget (15%);\n- -evolution  in  market  share  compared  to  that  of  key competitors (15%);\n- -evolution  in  operating  profit  as  compared  to  the budget (10%);\n- -evolution in net earnings per share as compared to the budget (10%);\n- -evolution  in  cash  flow  as  compared  to  the  budget (10%).\n- \u00b7 for 40% of the annual variable remuneration:\n- \u00b7 non-financial criteria, linked in particular to:\n- -the progress of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, which combines L'Or\u00e9al's commitments to sustainable development for 2030 (10%);\n- -the  implementation  of  the  Human  Resources  policy with  special  attention  to  the  development  of  gender balance in the management bodies (7.5%);\n- -the digital development policy (7.5%);\n- \u00b7 qualitative criteria (15%).\n\nThe  quantifiable,  financial  (60%)  and  non-financial  (25%) criteria account for 85% of annual variable remuneration.\n\n2",

Consequently,  the  final  vesting  of  the  shares  is  subject  to performance conditions which are recorded at the end of a vesting period of four years from the grant date.\n\nThe  value  of  these  shares,  estimated  at  the  grant  date according  to  the  IFRS  applied  for  the  preparation  of  the consolidated  financial  statements,  represents  approximately 50% of the executive corporate officer's annual remuneration and may not exceed 60%.\n\n## Preserving natural resources\n\n- \u00b7 By 2030, 95% of ingredients in the Group's formulas will be bio-sourced,  and  come  from  abundant  minerals  or circular processes.\n- \u00b7 By  2030,  100%  of  the  Group's  plastic  packaging  will  be recycled or bio-sourced (target of 50% by 2025).\n- \u00b7 By  2025,  100%  of  the  Group's  plastic  packaging  will  be refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable.\n\n## Empowering our ecosystem in our transformation\n\n- \u00b7 By 2030, 100,000 people from underprivileged communities  will  be  helped  by  the  Group  to  access employment.\n- \u00b7 By 2030, all Group products will be eco-designed.\n\nThe Board of Directors reserves the possibility to decide on an additional  grant  if  a  particular  event  justifies  it.  This  potential grant to the executive corporate officer, duly documented by the Board of Directors, may not exceed a total annual ceiling (all grants combined) of 5% of the total number of free shares granted during that same financial year.\n\nThe executive corporate officer is required to retain 50% of the free shares finally vested to him or her at the end of the vesting period,  in  registered  form,  until  the  termination  of  his  or  her duties, following a review of the performance conditions.\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer  makes  a  formal  undertaking not to enter into any risk hedging transactions with regard to the performance shares, until the end of the holding period set by the Board of Directors.\n\nAn corporate officer may not be granted performance shares at the time of his or her departure.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe  performance  criteria  cover  all  shares  granted  to  the executive corporate officer.\n\nThey partially take into account:\n\n- \u00b7 growth in  comparable sales of L'Or\u00e9al as compared to a panel of L'Or\u00e9al's major direct competitors; and\n- \u00b7 growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit.",

If the L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales  is  lower  than  the  average  growth  in  net  sales  of  the panel of competitors, no shares will be finally vested under this criterion.\n\n## Consequences on performance shares in the event of departure\n\nThe  right  to  performance  shares  is  lost  in  the  event  of departure from the Group due to resignation (other than in the case of termination of corporate office in connection with the exercise of pension  rights under  applicable  retirement regimes)  or  termination  for  gross  misconduct  or  gross negligence.  In  the  event  of  dismissal  of  an  executive corporate officer, the Board will decide, pursuant to the AFEPMEDEF Code, on the outcome of performance shares granted as from the appointment as executive corporate officer.\n\nThe  shares  are  only  finally  vested  at  the  end  of  a  four-year period,  allowing  sufficient  time  to  be  able  to  assess  the performance achieved over three full financial years.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to operating profit , a level of growth,  defined  by  the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  met  or  exceeded in order for  all  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period.  Below  this level,  the  number  of  finally  vested  shares  decreases.  If  the operating  profit  does  not  increase  in  absolute  value  over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nThe  results  recorded  each  year  to  determine  the  levels  of performance achieved are published in  Chapter  7  'Stock Market Information Share Capital' of this document.\n\nWhen  the  benefit  of  performance  share  grants  to  the executive corporate officer is maintained in the event of his or her  departure  prior  to  expiry  of  the  vesting  period,  it  is motivated by the following considerations:\n\n- \u00b7 the performance shares represent a predominant component  of  the  executive  corporate  officer's  annual remuneration assessed during the year of the grant;\n- \u00b7 they  are  the  consideration  for  the  execution  of  his  or  her corporate office  subject  to  the  achievement  of  long-term performance;\n- \u00b7 the maintenance  thereof  encourages  the  executive corporate officer to take a long-term view; and\n- \u00b7 the final vesting of the shares remains  subject  to achievement of the performance conditions.\n\n## HISTORY OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS OVER THE LAST THREE FINANCIAL YEARS\n\n| Performance share plan dated:                                               | 22/04/2015         | 20/04/2016         | 20/04/2017         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Arithmetical average of performances for financial years                    | 2016 - 2017 - 2018 | 2017 - 2018 - 2019 | 2018 - 2019 - 2020 |\n| For 50%: Growth in comparable sales  as compared to a panel of competitors* | +1.2 points        | +1.47 points       | +2.7 points        |\n| For 50%: Growth in the Group's operating profit                             | 3.91%              | 6.99%              | 3.95%              |\n| Level of achievement of the performance conditions                          | 82.6%              | 100%               | 82.95%             |\n\n- * Panel of competitors: Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Shiseido, Beiersdorf, Johnson & Johnson, Henkel, LVMH, Kao and Coty.\n\n## Other benefits\n\n## a) Remuneration for term of office as Director\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer  does  not  benefit  from  the payment of a remuneration for the tenure as Director.\n\n## b) Benefits in addition to remuneration\n\n- \u00b7 Benefits in kind\n\nThere  are  no  plans  to  supplement  the  executive  corporate officer's fixed remuneration by granting benefits in kind.\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer  benefits  from  the  necessary material resources for performance of his or her office such as, for  example,  the  provision  of  a  car  with  a  driver.  These arrangements,  which  are  strictly  limited  to  professional  use, are not benefits in kind.\n\n- \u00b7 Additional social protection schemes\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer  continues  to  be  treated  in  the same way as a senior manager during the term of his corporate office which allows him to continue to benefit from the additional social  protection  schemes  and,  in  particular,  the  defined contribution  pension  scheme,  and  the  employee  benefit  and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\n2",

This panel reports  an  average  remuneration  of  \u20ac8,677,000  and  a median remuneration of \u20ac7,590,000.\n\nThe structure of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' remuneration is in line with  the  principles  developed  in  section  2.4.1.2.1.  of  the remuneration  policy  applicable  to  executive  corporate officers, and forms a balanced whole with a breakdown that is approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  fixed  remuneration  and  target  annual variable remuneration;\n- \u00b7 50/50 between  annual  remuneration  and  long-term remuneration (performance shares);\n- \u00b7 50/50 between  cash  remuneration  and  share-based remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 75/25  between  remuneration  subject  to  performance conditions  and  remuneration  not  subject  to  performance conditions.\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus'  annual  variable  remuneration  may exceed 100% of his fixed remuneration and up to a maximum of 120% in order to be able to remunerate out performance. This outperformance will be assessed on a criterion-by-criterion basis.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  be  called  upon  to  decide  on  a granting  of  performance  shares  in  2021  in  accordance  with the  remuneration  policy  submitted  for  the  approval  of  the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\n|                     | Amount                                                                                                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                      |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed  remuneration | Prorated portion of the  annual \u20ac2,000,000,  over the period  from 01/05/2021  to 31/12/2021, i.e . \u20ac1,333,333                                                | At  its  meeting  of  11  February  2021,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  is  proposing  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of 20 April 2021 to set the fixed remuneration of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus at the gross amount of \u20ac2,000,000 on an annual basis.

His  full-time  commitment  to  the  benefit  of  the Company's  Governance  will  be  an  importance  source  of added  value  for  the  Board,  which  wants  to  highlight  the expertise of Mr Jean-Paul Agon whose in-depth knowledge of the company, its environment and its strategic challenges is a major asset.\n\nThe  Chairman's  remuneration  matches  the  Board's  goal  of ensuring the continuity of its work and to allow development in light  of  the  increasingly  important  duties  expected  from  a Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board has also taken into consideration the extensive duties it has  decided  to  entrust  to  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  in  his  position  as Chairman of the Board as from 1 May 2021.\n\nFinally,  the  Board  took  account  of  the  expectations  of  the stakeholders, by placing this remuneration in perspective with the remuneration offered by an international reference panel that was  defined  with  the  assistance  of  an  external independent consultancy firm.\n\nThe analysis of remunerations of Chairs of Boards of Directors of companies  in  the  reference  panel  used,  which  includes  six companies  with  a  dissociated  governance  structure  already used in the reference panel for the remuneration of executive corporate  officers,  reports  an  average  remuneration  of \u20ac1,380,000 and a median remuneration of \u20ac700,000 with large standard deviations.\n\n## PANEL SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS OF THE POSITIONING OF THE REMUNERATION FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS:\n\n| AstraZeneca   | AB In Bev         | BASF   | Bayer       | Coty     | Diageo   |\n|---------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|----------|----------|\n| Est\u00e9e Lauder  | GSK               | Henkel | Kraft Heinz | Linde    | Nestl\u00e9   |\n| Novartis      | Reckitt Benckiser | Roche  | Starbucks   | Unilever | Nestl\u00e9   |\n\nAs a result of this analysis and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors at its meeting of 11 February 2021 is proposing to the Annual  General  Meeting  of  20  April  2021  to  set  the  fixed annual remuneration of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman of the Board as from 1 May 2021, at \u20ac1,600,000.\n\nMr  Jean-Paul  Agon  notified  the  Company  of  the  termination of  his  employment  contract  on  30  April  2021,  in  order  to  be able  to  benefit  from  his  mandatory  retirement  rights  as  from 1 May 2021.\n\nUnder his employment contract, he is able to benefit from a gross  annual  pension  benefit  of  \u20ac1.59  million  under  L'Or\u00e9al's supplementary defined benefit pension scheme 'Garantie de\n\n## DUTIES OF THE CHAIRMAN:\n\nThe internal rules of the Board stipulate that:\n\n'The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  organises  and oversees  the  Board's  work  and  reports  thereon  to  the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman  is actively involved in defining the Company's growth strategy and encourages and strengthens, inter alia, links between the Company and the main market players.\n\nThe Chairman oversees the work of the Company's bodies responsible  for  corporate  governance  and  ensures,  in particular, that the Directors are able to perform their duties. He  may  ask  for  the  communication  of  any  document  or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  must  use  his  best  efforts  to promote the values and image of the Company at all times.

Decision-making, review and implementation process for the remuneration of corporate officers\n\nRemuneration is established in such a way as to guarantee the due and proper application of the policy and rules set by the Board  of  Directors.  The  Board  relies  on  the  work  and recommendations of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  composed  of  six  Directors,  60%  of  whom  are independent  Directors,  including  its  Chairwoman,  and  one member  of  whom  is a  Director  representing  the  employees. The corporate officer is not a member of the Committee. The Committee's recommendations are made taking into account the  studies  carried  out  at  its  request  by  an  independent consulting firm.\n\nThe Committee met 4 times in 2020 and its work is detailed in section  2.3.3.  'Activities  of  the  Board  Committees'  of  this chapter.\n\nThe  Committee  has  the  necessary  information  to  prepare  its recommendations  and  more  particularly  to  assess  the performance  of  the  corporate  officer  in  light  of  the  Group's short- and long-term objectives.\n\nThe purpose of this organisation and this process is to prevent any conflicts of interest.\n\n## The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee uses the studies conducted by an independent consulting firm\n\nThese  studies  are  based  on  an  international  panel  of  world leaders,  which  serves  as  a  reference  for  the  comparative remuneration studies.\n\n## Executive corporate officers\n\nThe Committee recommended using the same panel to assess the  relative  positioning  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  remuneration as  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  to  determine the  positioning  of  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus'  remuneration  as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThis panel is made up of French and international companies that  hold  the  position  of  global  leader.  These  companies operate  on  similar  markets  and  are,  in  the  cosmetics  sector, direct  competitors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  or  operate  on  the  wider everyday  consumer  goods  market,  as  regards  all  or  part  of their business activities.\n\nThe  panel  applicable  for  2020  comprised  Directors  of  the following  14  companies:  Beiersdorf,  Colgate-Palmolive,  Coty, Danone,  Est\u00e9e  Lauder,  GSK,  Henkel,  Johnson  &  Johnson, Kimberly  Clark,  Kering,  LVMH,  Procter  &  Gamble,  Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever. It is used to assess the competitiveness of the executive corporate officer's total remuneration.\n\nIn  terms  of  market  capitalisation,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  above  the  third quartile of companies on this panel.",

The  Directors  are  therefore  able  to  verify  the consistency  between  the  remuneration  of  the  executive corporate  officer  and  the  remuneration  and  employment conditions of the Company's employees.\n\nSimilarly, the Senior Vice-President and Chief Ethics Officer also regularly explains the policy and the actions taken in this field.\n\nTwo  members  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  are  members  of  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability Committee  at  which  the  actions  taken  with  regard  to  the programmes concerning the Group's social and environmental responsibility are discussed.\n\nThis  information  contributes  to  the  assessment  of  the  nonfinancial  and  qualitative  portion  of  the  annual  variable remuneration.\n\nThe Chairwoman of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee  is a   member  of  the  Audit  Committee  and participates in the closing of the financial statements as well as the  examination  of  the  risk  prevention  policy.  She  is  also Chairwoman of the Nominations and Governance Committee,  which  offers  her  a  Company-wide  vision  of  the various performance assessment criteria.\n\nThe Committee can also carry out a more in-depth evaluation of the Company's performance by contacting the Company's main senior managers, after informing the General Management.\n\nThis  information  enriches  their  vision  of  the  strategy  and performances  of  the  Company  and  its  executive  corporate officer.\n\nRecommendations are made on these bases to the Board of Directors,  which  then  makes  its  decisions  on  the  executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  collectively,  in  accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  organisation  of  the  work  of  the  Committee  on  the remuneration  of  executive  corporate  officers  is  shown  in  the chart below.\n\n## The Committee examines the expectations of investors and proxy advisors, and the rules and recommendations of the regulatory authorities\n\nThe Human Resources and Remuneration Committee carefully analyses the law and reports concerning executive remuneration, notably the French financial markets authority's (AMF) report on corporate governance and the remuneration of executives of listed companies, and the report of the High Committee on Corporate Governance.\n\nIt  is  mindful  of  the  observations and requests of investors and strives to accommodate them while preserving consistency in the  remuneration  policy  adopted  by  the  Board  and  subject to constraints  relating  to  the  disclosure  of  confidential information.\n\n## Conditions for derogation from the remuneration policy in the event of exceptional circumstances\n\nOrder  no.  2019-1234  of  27  November  2019,  pursuant  to  the Pacte  Law,  encourages  companies  to  provide  for  any exceptions in the event of extraordinary circumstances in their remuneration policy. Failing this, the Board of Directors would be unable to grant an element of remuneration not provided for  in  the  remuneration  policy  previously  approved  by  the Annual General Meeting, even though this decision would be necessary  in  view  of  these  exceptional  circumstances.  It  is stated that this  derogation  may only be temporary, pending the approval of the amended remuneration policy by the next Annual General Meeting, and should be duly substantiated.\n\nIf  applicable,  the  adaptation  of  the  remuneration  policy  to exceptional circumstances would be decided by the Board of Directors  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Human  Resources and  Remuneration  Committee,  after  seeking  the  opinion,  as necessary,  of  an  independent  consulting  firm.  Thus,  for example, the recruitment of a new executive corporate officer under  unforeseen  conditions  might  require  the  temporary adaptation  of  some  existing  remuneration  elements  or  the proposal of new remuneration elements.\n\nIt might  also  be  necessary  to  amend  the  performance conditions  governing  the  acquisition  of  all  or  some  of  the existing  remuneration  elements  in  the  event  of  exceptional circumstances resulting in particular from a significant change in the  Group's  scope  following  a  merger  or  sale,  the acquisition or creation of a significant new business activity or the  elimination  of  a  significant  business  activity,  a  change  in accounting  policy  or  a  major  event  affecting  the  markets and/or L'Or\u00e9al's major competitors.\n\n2",

Remuneration paid during the 2020 financial year or allocated for that year to Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGiven the exceptional circumstances related to the Covid-19 health  crisis,  and  in a  spirit  of  solidarity,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon informed  the  Board,  at  its  meeting  on  12  May  2020,  which accepted it, that he would waive the following for 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 any  grant  of  performance  shares  if  a  plan  were  to  be decided in 2020, for which he is eligible in accordance with the  remuneration  policy  detailed  in  section  2.4.1.  of Chapter 2 of the 2019 Universal Registration Document.\n- \u00b7 any  remuneration  based  on  the  financial  targets  of  his annual  variable  remuneration,  which  represents  a  30% reduction in the maximum amount of his annual fixed and variable  remuneration  for  2020  for  which  he  is  eligible  in accordance  with  the  remuneration  policy  detailed  in section 2.4.1. of Chapter 2 of the 2019 Universal Registration Document;\n\n## CHART SHOWING THE REMUNERATION STRUCTURE APPLICABLE TO MR JEAN-PAUL AGON FOR 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.2.2.1. Fixed remuneration\n\nAt its meeting of 6 February 2020, and on the recommendation of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the Board  of  Directors  decided  to  maintain  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's fixed  annual  remuneration  at  the  gross  amount  of  \u20ac2,200,000. This has remained unchanged since 2014.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.2. Annual variable remuneration\n\nConcerning Mr Jean-Paul Agon's annual variable remuneration for 2020, the objective had been set at a gross amount  of  \u20ac2,200,000,  representing  100%  of  the  fixed remuneration.  This  sum  represents  the  maximum  amount  of variable remuneration that may be paid to him.\n\nAt its meeting on 6 February 2020, the Board of Directors had set the variable remuneration criteria applicable for 2020 and the respective weighting of such criteria. The financial criteria represent  60%  of  the  variable  remuneration  while  the  nonfinancial  criteria  represent  40%.  These  financial  criteria  are directly correlated with the Company's economic performance indicators: growth in sales and market share as compared to its main competitors, in operating profit, earnings per share (EPS) and cash-flow.\n\nFollowing  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  decision  to  waive  any remuneration  on  the  financial  targets  of  his  2020  annual variable remuneration, the Human Resources and Remuneration  Committee  on  10  February  2021  assessed  the performance of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  on  the  basis  of  only  the non-financial  and  qualitative  criteria  set  by  the  Board.  The maximum target amount for the annual variable remuneration of  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon for 2020 was, therefore, reduced from \u20ac2,200,000  to  a  gross  amount  of  \u20ac880,000.  The  assessment  is carried  out  on  a  criterion-by-criterion  basis  without  offsetting among the criteria.\n\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the Human Resources and  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors decided  at  its  meeting  on  11  February  2021  to  allocate  to Mr Jean-Paul Agon for the 2020 annual variable remuneration the  amount  of  \u20ac859,831,  on  the  basis  of  non-financial  and qualitative criteria only. This represents an achievement rate of 97.71% of these objectives.\n\nFor information, following the approval by the Annual General Meeting  of  30  June  2020  (Resolution  9),  an  annual  variable remuneration was paid for the 2019 financial year amounting to a total of \u20ac2,168,831, since the Board of Directors decided on  6  February  2020,  as  recommended  by  the  Human Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee,  that  98.6%  of  the maximum objective had been achieved.",

Termination indemnities and supplementary pension scheme applicable to corporate officers\n\nThe  termination  indemnities  and  supplementary  pension scheme  for  which  the  corporate  officers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  may  be eligible,  as  long  as  they  are  former  senior  managers  of  the company with more than 15 years of service, are not related to  performance  of  the  corporate  office,  but  could  be  due under the suspended employment contract.\n\nTherefore,  they  are  not  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 under resolution no. 14 [Approval of the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer].\n\nShareholders  are  called  to  approve  these  schemes  in  the context of approving the agreement  suspending  the corporate officer's employment contract.\n\nThis  was  the  case  for  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  by  the  vote  of  the Annual  General  Meetings  of  27  April  2010  and  17  April  2018, ruling on the Special Report prepared by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nIn resolution no. 15, the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 is called to approve the suspension of the employment contract of Nicolas Hieronimus.\n\n## 2.4.3.1. Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code to which L'Or\u00e9al refers, recommends, but  does  not  require,  that  companies  should  put  an  end  to combining an employment contract with a corporate office.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  shares  the  objectives  of  this recommendation  which  aims  at  avoiding  the  possibility  of concurrently  obtaining  benefits  both  from  the  employment contract  and  the  corporate  office  and  at  prohibiting  any interference with the possibility of removing corporate officers ad nutum. The Board of Directors has formally provided for the methods of application of the objectives of the recommendation,  as  adapted  to  the  context  in  the  L'Or\u00e9al Group.\n\nThe Board's intention is to use the treatment set out below for any new corporate officer appointed who has over 15 years' length of service in the Group at the time of his or her appointment.\n\nAs  L'Or\u00e9al's  ongoing  policy  is  to  appoint  employees  who  have completely  succeeded  in  the  various  stages  of  their  careers  in the Group as corporate officers, the Board does not want these executives  to  be  deprived  of  the  benefits  to  which  they  would have  continued  to  be  entitled  had  they  remained  employees, after spending many years of their career at L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe Board of Directors has considered that the objective pursued by the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation could be fully achieved by maintaining  the  suspension  of  the  employment  contract  and clearly  separating  the  benefits  related  to  the  corporate  office from those relating to the employment contract.\n\nRemuneration in respect of the corporate office will in no event be taken into consideration in the calculation of all benefits that may be due under the employment contract.\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for  the  calculation  of  the  pension  under  the  defined  benefit scheme is based on the amount of remuneration at the date of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract.  This  reference remuneration  is  revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund ( Caisse Nationale\n\nd'Assurance  Vieillesse ).  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire career within the Group, including the years spent as a corporate officer.\n\n## 2.4.3.2. Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  the  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on the reasons for such termination, the corporate officer would only be  paid  termination  indemnities,  except  in  the  event  of  gross misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  or  retirement  indemnities  in  the event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  retirement  at  the  Company's request pursuant  to  the  suspended  employment  contract excluding any indemnity due in respect of the corporate office.\n\nThese indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the employment  contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the  National Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries ( Convention  Collective  Nationale  des  Industries  Chimiques )  and the company-level agreements  applicable to all L'Or\u00e9al managers,  are  automatically  due  pursuant  to  the  public  policy rules  of  French  labour law. They are not subject to any condition other  than  those  provided  for  by  the  National  Collective Bargaining  Agreement for the Chemical Industries or the abovementioned company-level agreements.\n\nIn the event of termination of the employment contract, financial consideration for  the  non-compete clause would be paid under the  terms  of  said  contract,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries,  unless  the  executive  corporate  officer  were  to  be released from application of the clause. This clause does not apply in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  compulsory  retirement  on the  Company's  initiative:  no  consideration  for  non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\n## 2.4.3.3. Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nThe corporate officer, subject to ending his or her career in the Company,  will  benefit  from  one  of  the  defined  benefit schemes currently applicable to the Group's senior managers. This  is  the  scheme  to  which  he  or  she  was  subject  as  an employee.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  rights  to  the  defined  benefit  pension  are uncertain and  conditional  on  the  completion  of  the beneficiary's  career  in  the  Company.  These  schemes  were established by L'Or\u00e9al primarily with the goal of attracting and retaining  the  Company's  senior  managers  by  guaranteeing them a certain level of resources in retirement.\n\nThese  schemes  falling  under  Article  L.  137-11  of  the  French Social Security Code, are now closed to any new beneficiaries and  no  longer  create  rights  as  from  31  December  2019 pursuant to Order no. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 on professional supplementary pension schemes that transposes the European Directive of 16 April 2014.\n\nThe main features of these schemes are explained in detail in section  4.3.2.5.  'Offering  a  motivating  and  competitive remuneration system' of this document.\n\nThey  concern  over  500  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  active  or  retired  senior managers, in France, and are financed by contributions paid to an insurance institution. These contributions are deductible from  the  corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the",

Application of the related-party agreements scheme\n\nThe  above  provisions  are  subject  to  the  procedure  for  relatedparty agreements.\n\nThe  benefits  that  may  be  due  under  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's suspended employment contract were approved by the Annual General Meeting of 27 April 2010 pursuant to Article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  of  17  April  2018  approved  the implementation  of  the  provisions  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's employment  contract  regarding  defined  benefit  pension scheme  commitments  for  the  duration  of  his  renewed corporate office.\n\nThese mechanisms are restated every year in the chapter on the remuneration of corporate officers and in the Statutory Auditors' special report on related-party agreements.\n\nFor  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  an  agreement  suspending  the employment contract is being submitted for the approval of the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 (resolution no. 15).\n\n## 2.4.3.5. Situation of Mr Jean-Paul Agon for the period from 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2021\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon, then Deputy Chief Executive Officer, was appointed as Chief Executive Officer in April 2006, following a brilliant career spanning 27 years with L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe Board of Directors did not wish for Mr Jean-Paul Agon, who accepted the office of Chief Executive Officer after 27 years within  L'Or\u00e9al,  to  be  deprived  of  the  benefits  to  which  he would  have  continued  to  be  entitled  had  he  remained  an employee, and adopted the following measures:\n\n## 1) Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe remuneration under the suspended employment contract to be taken into account for all the rights attached thereto, and in  particular  for  the  calculation  of  the  defined  benefit  pension referred to below, is based on the amount of remuneration at the  date  of  suspension  of  the  contract  in  2006,  namely  fixed remuneration  of  \u20ac1,500,000  and  variable  remuneration  of \u20ac1,250,000.  This  reference  remuneration  is  revised  annually  by applying  the  revaluation  coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension fund ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse ). As of 1 January, 2021, the fixed remuneration amounted to \u20ac1,731,000 and the variable remuneration to \u20ac1,442,500.\n\nThe seniority applied covers his entire career within the Group, including  the  years  he  was  Chief  Executive  Officer  and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 2) Dismissal, termination or retirement\n\n## indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nPayment  of  the  indemnities  due  under  the  suspended employment contract was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2010.\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  his  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on the reasons for such termination, Mr Jean-Paul Agon would only be  paid  termination  indemnities,  except  in  the  event  of  gross misconduct or gross negligence, or retirement indemnities in the event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  at  the  Company's  request pursuant to the suspended employment contract.\n\nThese  indemnities,  which  are  attached  solely  to  termination  of the employment contract and in strict application of the National Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries ( Convention Collective Nationale des Industries Chimiques )  and the company-level  agreements  applicable  to  all  L'Or\u00e9al managers, are automatically due pursuant to the public policy rules of French labour law. They are not subject to any condition other  than  those  provided  for  by  the  National  Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries or the abovementioned company-level agreements. The same applies to the non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nPursuant  to  the  schedule  of  indemnities  under  the  National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries, in the event of dismissal, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross  negligence,  the  indemnity  would  be  capped,  in  light  of Mr Jean-Paul Agon's  length of service, at 20 months' remuneration under the suspended employment contract.\n\nIn respect of the employment contract, pursuant to the provisions of the  National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the Chemical  Industries, in the event  of  termination  of  the employment contract, the indemnity due in consideration of the non-compete  clause  would  be  payable  every  month  for  two years on the basis of two-thirds of the monthly fixed remuneration attached  to  the  suspended  employment  contract  unless Mr Jean-Paul Agon were to be released from application of the clause.  This  clause  does  not  apply  in  the  event  of  voluntary retirement or compulsory retirement on the Company's initiative: no  consideration  for  non-competition  would  be  paid  in  such  a situation.\n\n## 3) Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nMr  Jean-Paul  Agon  benefits,  under  his  suspended  employment contract, from the \"Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture\" (Pension Cover of Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture)  scheme  closed  to  new  members  effective  from 31 December 2000.\n\nThe main features of this scheme,  which  falls under Article  L.  137-11  of  the  French  Social  Security  Code,  are  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 around  120  senior  managers  (active  or  retired)  are concerned;\n- \u00b7 the  minimum  length  of  service  requirement  was  10  years  at the time of closure of the scheme on 31 December 2000; and\n- \u00b7 the  Pension  Cover  may  not  exceed  40%  of  the  calculation basis, plus 0.5% per year for the first 20 years, then 1% per year for the following 20 years, nor may it exceed the average of the fixed portion of the remuneration for the three years used as  the  calculation  basis  out  of  the  last  seven  years  prior  to the end of the beneficiary's career in the Company.\n\n2",

The  premiums  paid  are  deductible  from the corporate income tax and are subject to the employer's contribution as provided by Article L. 137-11, 2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nThe above provisions are subject to the procedure for relatedparty agreements. The corresponding agreement  was approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on  27  April  2010 making a decision with regard to the Special Report prepared by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe provisions of this agreement remained unchanged within the  scope  of  the  appointment  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as from 18 March 2011 and  the  renewal  of  his  term  of  office  on  17  April  2014  and 17  April  2018.  Pursuant  to  Article  L.  225-40-1  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  this  agreement  was  examined  by  the Board of Directors on 11 February 2021, which confirmed the relevance and terms thereof. The Annual General Meeting of 17 April 2018 approved, pursuant to the old Article L 225-42-1 of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the  implementation  of  the provisions  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  employment  contract  for the duration of the renewed corporate office, as approved by the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2010, corresponding to  defined  benefit  pension  scheme  commitments. The Board of Directors subordinated the increase in conditional rights for the period to the achievement of the performance conditions, assessed in light of the Company's performance.\n\nThe  increase  for  a  financial  year  therefore  depends  on  the achievement of at least 80% of the performance targets taken into  account to determine the annual variable remuneration of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon.  If  the  80%  threshold  is  not  met,  no increase will be granted for the financial year in question.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  agreement  to  suspend  the employment contract on defined benefit pension commitments  for  the  tenure  of  his  new  term  of  office,  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefits from:\n\n- \u00b7 the calculation basis of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's pension will be revalued according to the salaries and  contributions  revaluation  coefficient  for  pensions published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund  ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse ), as set out above; and\n- \u00b7 secondly,  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  will continue to accrue seniority during the renewed term of his corporate office, up to the date on which he reaches the upper  limit  of  40  years  of  service  required  under  the scheme, namely, on 1 September 2018. As a result, no other supplementary  annuity  may  be  subsequently  granted  to him.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  11  February  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors noted  that  the  performance  conditions  were  fully  met. Therefore,  the  Board  decided  that  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer benefits from the principle of the revaluation of  his  pension  on  the  basis  of  the  salaries  and  contributions revaluation coefficient published by the French State pension system  ( Caisse Nationale  d'Assurance  Vieillesse )  (coefficient equal to 1.004 for 2020).\n\n## Situation of Mr Jean-Paul Agon as from 1 May 2021\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon notified the company of the termination of his  employment contract on 30 April 2021, in order to benefit from his retirement rights as from 1 May 2021, at the end of a 42-year career in the Company.\n\nAll  provisions  relating  to  the  retirement  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon were approved by the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2010.\n\n- \u00b7 Payment  of  a  retirement  indemnity  stipulated  by  the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries\n\nA retirement indemnity, attached solely to the termination of the  employment contract,  will  be  paid  to  Mr  Agon  over  the month of May 2021 in strict application of the public order rules of  French  Labour  law,  the  National  Collective  Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries ( Convention Collective Nationale  des  Industries  Chimiques ) and  the  collective agreements applicable to all L'Or\u00e9al's senior managers.\n\nThis indemnity is based on the amount of remuneration at the date of suspension of the employment contract in 2006, after applying the revaluation coefficient in respect of salaries and pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension fund ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse ). As of 1  January  2021,  this  revalued  remuneration  amounted  to \u20ac1,731,000  for  fixed  remuneration  and  \u20ac1,442,500  for  variable remuneration.\n\nThe retirement indemnity was a gross amount of \u20ac2.12 million representing  eight  months  of  the  aforementioned  revalued remuneration.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  non-compete  clause  is  not applicable  in  the  event  of  retirement:  no  non-compete indemnity would be paid to Mr Jean-Paul Agon.\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidation without payment of pension under the 'Garantie de  Retraite  des  Membres  du  Comit\u00e9  de  Conjoncture' (Pension Cover of Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) scheme\n\nThe  gross  amount  of  the  pension  that  would  be  paid  to Mr Jean-Paul Agon, under L'Or\u00e9al's 'Garantie de Retraite des Membres  du  Comit\u00e9  de  Conjoncture'  (Pension  Cover  of Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) scheme, represents \u20ac1.59  million,  i.e.  around  36%  of  the  fixed  and  variable remuneration he received as executive corporate officer.\n\nThe Board of Directors agreed to Mr Jean-Paul Agon's wish to waive this supplementary pension during his term of office as Chairman of the Board of Directors so as not to combine it with the  remuneration  of  \u20ac1,600,000  proposed  by  the  Board  of Directors on 11 February 2021, and submitted for the approval of the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 in the context of the vote on the 14 th resolution.\n\nThe pensions that could have been paid for the period of his office  as  Chairman  will  be  definitively  lost  for  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon without any increase in pension or any other subsequent compensation.",

This  new governance will take effect on 1 May 2021, by decision of the Board  of  Directors  at  the  meeting  held  following  the  Annual General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al shareholders on 20 April 2021, which is also called to appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Director.\n\nThe Board of Directors did not wish for Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, by accepting the  office  of  Chief  Executive  Officer  after  34  years within L'Or\u00e9al, to be deprived, at the age of 57, of the benefits to  which  he  would  have  continued  to  be  entitled  had  he remained an employee, and adopted the following measures:\n\n## 1) Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  of  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  to  be taken  into  account  for  all  rights  attached  to  the  employment contract  and,  in  particular,  for  the  calculation  of  the  pension under  the  defined-benefit  scheme  described  below,  is  based on  his remuneration  at  the  date  of  suspension  of  his employment contract. This reference remuneration is \u20ac1,750,000  of  fixed  remuneration  and  \u20ac1,850,000  of  variable remuneration.  This  remuneration  will  be  revised  annually  by applying  the  revaluation  coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension fund ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse ).\n\nThe seniority applied covers his entire career within the Group, including the years spent as an executive corporate officer.\n\n## 2) Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nPayment  of  the  indemnities  due  under  the  suspended employment contract will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2021 for a vote.\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  his  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on the  reasons  for  such  termination,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  would only be paid termination indemnities, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, or retirement indemnities in the event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  at  the  Company's  request pursuant to the suspended employment contract.\n\nThese  indemnities,  which  are  attached  solely  to  termination  of the employment contract and in strict application of the National Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries ( Convention Collective Nationale des Industries Chimiques )  and the company-level  agreements  applicable  to  all  L'Or\u00e9al managers, are automatically due pursuant to the public policy rules of French labour law. They are not subject to any condition other  than  those  provided  for  by  the  National  Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries or the abovementioned Company-level agreements.

This  clause  does  not  apply  in  the event of voluntary retirement or compulsory retirement on the Company's  initiative:  no  consideration  for  non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\n## 3) Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will  continue  to  benefit,  under  his suspended  employment  contract,  from  the  'Garantie  de Ressources des Retraites Anciens Cadres Dirigeants' (Retirement Income Guarantee for Former Senior Managers) scheme closed to new members effective from 31 December 2015. The income guarantee is calculated on the basis of the number of years of professional service in the Company up to 31 December 2019, up to a limit of 25 years. Generally, after 31 December 2019, no new rights  will  be  granted  under  this  scheme  pursuant  to  Order  no. 2019-697  of  3  July  2019  concerning  supplementary  professional retirement  schemes,  which  stipulated  the  closure  of  all  defined benefit  schemes  governed  by  Article  L.  137-11  of  the  French Social Security Code.\n\nThe main features of this scheme are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 around 340 senior managers (active or retired) are concerned;\n- \u00b7 the  minimum  length  of  service  requirement  was  10  years  at the time of closure of the scheme on 31 December 2015;\n- \u00b7 the  income  guarantee  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the number of years of professional service in the Company until 31 December 2019, capped at 25 years, each year leading to a progressive and regular increase of 1.8% in the level of the guarantee.  The  income  guarantee  may  not  exceed  50%  of the  calculation  base  or  exceed  the  average  of  the  fixed portion of salaries; and\n- \u00b7 the  guarantee  is  financed  by  contributions  paid  to  an insurance  institution.  These  contributions  are  deductible  from corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the  employer's contribution as provided by Article L. 137-11, 2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nThe pension rights of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus are no longer likely to change insofar as he has more than 25 years of service, the ceiling above which no additional annuity is granted under this scheme.\n\nFor  information  purposes,  the  gross  estimated  amount  of  the pension  that  would  be  paid  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  under L'Or\u00e9al's  'Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres Dirigeants'  (Retirement  Income  Guarantee  for  Former  Senior Managers) scheme, had he been able liquidate on 31 December 2020 his  full-rate  pension  rights  under  French  Social  Security,  after 34 years of service within L'Or\u00e9al, would represent \u20ac1.56 million.\n\nThis information is given as an indication after estimating the main pension rights accrued by Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as a result of his professional activities, according to the rules for payment of such pensions in force at 31 December 2020, which may be subject to change.\n\nThe  amount of the pension paid to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus under L'Or\u00e9al's 'Garantie de Ressources Dirigeants' (income guarantee for senior managers) will only be calculated on the date when he applies for all his pensions.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  rights  to  the  defined  benefit  pension  are uncertain and conditional on the completion of the beneficiary's career  in  the  Company.

His term of office was renewed at the Annual General  Meeting  on  27  April  2010.  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  has  been  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  since  18  March  2011.  His  term  of  office  was  renewed  on 17 April 2014, and on 17 April 2018 for a four-year period. Mr Jean-Paul Agon's employment contract is suspended throughout the entire length of his corporate office.\n- (2) The appointment of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus to the Board of Directors is submitted to the Annual General Meeting for a vote on 20 April 2021. The Board of Directors announced its intention to dissociate the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer as from 1 May 2021.\n- (3) Mr Jean-Paul Agon's employment contract is suspended throughout the entire length of his office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The employment contract of Nicolas Hieronimus will be suspended as from 1 May 2021, the date he assumes his duties as Chief Executive Officer on the decision of the Board of Directors' meeting held at the end of the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n- (4) Pursuant to his employment contract, Mr Jean-Paul Agon is entitled to benefit from the 'Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture' (Pension Cover of the Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) scheme as described in chapter 4 of this document. Mr Nicolas Hieronimus benefits from the 'Garantie de Retraite des Retrait\u00e9s Anciens Cadres Dirigeants' (Retirement Income Guarantee of Former Senior Managers) scheme described in Chapter 4. These defined benefit pension schemes provide that the building up of rights to benefits is conditional on the completion of the beneficiary's career in the Company; the funding of this scheme by L'Or\u00e9al cannot be broken down individually by employee.\n- (5) No  indemnity  is  due  for  termination  of  the  corporate  office.  Under  the  employment  contract,  pursuant  to  the  schedule  of  indemnities  of  the  National  Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemicals Industry, in the event of dismissal, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, the dismissal indemnity could not be greater than 20 months' of the remuneration under the employment contract (see section 2.4.3.4. 'Application of the related-party agreements scheme' of this document on the accumulated amount of the contractual indemnity and the indemnity due in consideration of the non-compete clause).\n- (6) In  respect  of  the  employment  contract,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries,  in  the  event  of termination of  the  employment contract (excluding voluntary or compulsory retirement), the indemnity due in consideration of the non-compete clause would be payable every month for two years on the basis of two thirds of the monthly fixed remuneration related to the employment contract unless the executive corporate officer were to be released from application of the clause (see section 2.4.3.4. on the accumulated amount of the convention indemnity and the indemnity due in consideration of the non-compete clause).",

SUMMARY TABLE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AFEP-MEDEF CODE WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN APPLIED\n\n## AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al's practices and justifications\n\n## Composition of the Committees: proportion of independent members of the Committees (points 16.1 and 17.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code)\n\nThe  proportion  of  independent  Directors  on  the  Audit Committee must be at least two-thirds.\n\nThe  Selection  or  Appointments  Committee  and  the Remuneration  Committee  must  be  composed  of  a majority of independent Directors.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  consists  of  60%  of  independent  Directors  (i.e.,  three  out  of  five, excluding  Directors  representing  the  employees).  The  Committee  is  chaired  by Ms  Virginie  Morgon,  an  independent  Director.  The  Board  of  Directors  considers  this composition  satisfactory  in  light  of  the  necessary  presence  of  two  Directors  from L'Or\u00e9al's  majority  shareholders  and  its  choice  of  maintaining  a  limited  number  of members in order to ensure the efficiency of the work of this Committee which requires a certain level of expertise in finance or accounting.\n\nThe  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  currently  consists  of  50%  independent Directors. The Committee is chaired by Ms Sophie Bellon, an independent Director.\n\nFurthermore,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Haut  Comit\u00e9  de  Gouvernement  d'Entreprise (High Committee on Corporate Governance) specified that ' an Audit Committee that consists of three independent members out of five, or a Remuneration Committee with two out of four, remains in keeping with the spirit of the code as long as they are chaired by an independent Director ' (Report of October 2014).\n\n## Employment contract of the corporate officer (point 22 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code)\n\nIt  is  recommended,  though  not  required,  that  when  a senior  manager  becomes  a  director  and  corporate officer  of  the  Company,  his/her  employment  contract with  the  Company  or  another  company  of  the  Group should  be  terminated  by  agreed  termination  or  by resignation.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered that the objective pursued by this recommendation can be fully achieved by maintaining the suspension of the employment contract and clearly separating the benefits related to the employment contract from those tied to his corporate office.\n\nThis position of the Board applies to the current office of Mr Jean-Paul Agon as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and, in the future, to the office of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer and, in the future, to any new executive officer appointed who has over 15 years of service in the Group at the time of appointment. L'Or\u00e9al's ongoing policy has been to appoint employees who have completely succeeded in the various stages of their career in the Group as executive corporate officers.\n\nThis  is  how  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  then  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  was  appointed Chief Executive Officer in April 2006, followed by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in  2011,  following  a  brilliant  career  spanning  27  years  within  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  Board  of Directors noted that if, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation, Mr JeanPaul  Agon's  employment  contract  with  L'Or\u00e9al  was  to  be  terminated,  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon would lose the status he acquired as a result of the twenty-seven years he spent working for the Group as an employee.\n\nThe situation of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus is similar: he is called to serve as Chief Executive Officer as from 1 May 2021, after a highly successful 34-year career in the Group. The Board of Directors noted that if, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation, his  employment  contract  with  L'Or\u00e9al  were  to  be  terminated,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus would lose the status he acquired as a result of the 34 years he spent working for the Group as an employee.\n\nThe AMF, in its recommendation 2012-02 last updated on 3 December 2019, considers that a senior manager's length of service as a company employee and their personal situation  may  justify  maintaining  their  employment  contract  if  the  company  provides explanations  adapted  to  the  individual  situation  of  each  executive  (length  of  service and description of the benefits granted under the employment contract).\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Agreement concerning the position of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus whose employment contract will be suspended upon his appointment as Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Nature and purpose\n\nOn  11  February  2021,  your  Board  of  Directors  authorized  an  agreement  to  suspend  the  employment  contract  between  your company and Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, current Deputy Chief Executive Officer and employee of your company, who will become the Company's Chief Executive Officer as of 1 May 2021, following the decision of the Board of Directors' meeting to be held after the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\nThis agreement will be entered into following the Board of Directors' meeting. It will become effective as of 1 May 2021, subject to the effective appointment of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer by the Board of Directors' meeting to be held after the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\n## Reasons justifying the interest for your Company\n\nYour Board of Directors recalled that L'Or\u00e9al's constant practice has been to appoint as executive corporate officers employees who have fully succeeded in the various stages of their career in the Group. The remuneration policy applicable to executive corporate officers is the logical result of this choice. Your Board also considered that this policy should attract the most talented employees of L'Or\u00e9al to the highest positions in General Management, without them being deprived, after a long career in the Group, of the benefits to which they would have continued to be entitled had they remained employees.\n\nTo achieve this objective, the Board of Directors decided to maintain the employment contract of corporate officers who, when appointed,  have  at  least  15  years  of  service  in  the  Group  and  ensured  that  the  benefits  under  the  suspended  employment contract are not combined with those in respect of the corporate office.\n\nPursuant to this  policy,  the  Board  of  Directors  did  not  wish  that  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  who  has  accepted  the  position  of  Chief Executive Officer after 34 years of career at L'Or\u00e9al, be deprived, as of 1 May 2021, of the benefits that he would have continued to obtain had he remained an employee and that he will not receive as director and corporate officer.\n\n## Terms and conditions\n\n- \u00b7 Suspension of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' employment contract on the start date of his corporate office, and during the term of his corporate office.\n\nIn the event of termination of his suspended employment contract during the term of office, and depending on the reasons for such termination, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus will only receive the severance pay (save for gross misconduct or gross negligence) or retirement  indemnities  in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  retirement  at  the  Company's  request  payable  under  the employment contract that has been suspended. These indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the employment contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the  French  collective  bargaining  agreement  for  the  chemicals  industry  ( Convention Collective  Nationale  des  Industries  Chimiques )  and  the  company-level  agreements  applicable  to  all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers,  are automatically due pursuant to the public policy rules of French labor law. They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the collective bargaining agreement or the above-mentioned company-level agreements. The same applies to the non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus will continue to benefit, under his employment contract suspended for the term of his corporate office, from the ' Garantie de Ressources des Retrait\u00e9s Anciens Cadres Dirigeants '  (Retirement  Income  Guarantee for former senior managers) scheme, closed to new entrants as from 31 December 2015. Indemnities are calculated according to the number of years of professional activity within the company as of 31 December 2019, up to a maximum of 25 years. In general, subsequent to  31  December  2019,  no  new  entitlement  is  granted  under  this  scheme  pursuant  to  Order  2019-697  of  3  July  2019  on supplementary pension schemes, which provides for the closure of all defined-benefit schemes governed by Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code. The main features of this scheme are described in Note 4.3.2.5 to the 2019 L'Or\u00e9al Universal Registration  Document.  In  this  specific  case,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  reached  the  limit  of  25  years'  professional  activity  in  the Group  provided  under  the  scheme  in  2012  and  therefore  has  not  benefited  from  any  new  entitlement  to  supplementary annuities since such date.\n\nUnder his employment contract and in accordance with the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry, in the  event  of  termination  of  the  employment  contract,  the  compensation  under  the  non-compete  clause  would  be  payable monthly  over  two  years  based  on  two-thirds  of  the  monthly  fixed  remuneration  provided  for  in  the  suspended  employment contract, unless Mr Nicolas Hieronimus was released from the application of this clause. This clause is not applicable in the event of voluntary retirement or retirement at the Company's request and no non-compete compensation would be paid in this situation.\n\nUnder no circumstances shall  the  remuneration  received  for  the  corporate  office  be  taken  into  consideration  in  calculating benefits likely to be payable under the above-mentioned employment contract.\n\n- \u00b7 Terms and conditions relating to the suspension of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' employment contract\n- \u00b7 The reference remuneration to be taken into account for all entitlements attached to the employment contract will be based on  the  amount  of  remuneration  at  the  date  of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract,  namely,  fixed  remuneration  of \u20ac1,750,000  and  variable  remuneration  of  \u20ac1,850,000.  This  reference  remuneration  will  be  revised  annually  by  applying  the revaluation  coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund  ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse ).\n- \u00b7 The length of service applied will cover his entire career within the Group, including his years as corporate officer.\n\n2",

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nStatutory Auditors' special report on related-party agreements\n\n- \u00b7 Mr Nicolas Hieronimus will continue to be treated in the same way as a senior manager throughout the term of his corporate office,  which allows him to benefit from the additional social protection schemes, including the defined-contribution pension scheme and employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.

The  same  applies  to  the  non-compete  clause  and  the  related  financial consideration.\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon will continue to benefit from the defined-benefit pension scheme currently applicable to the Group's senior managers, as described in chapter 2 of the management report.\n\n- \u00b7 Terms and conditions relating to the suspension of Mr Jean-Paul Agon's employment contract\n- \u00b7 The  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all  entitlements  attached  to  the  employment  contract  and  in particular for the calculation of the pension under the defined-benefit scheme will be based on the amount of remuneration at  the  date  of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract  in  2006,  namely,  fixed  remuneration  of  \u20ac1,500,000  and  variable remuneration of \u20ac1,250,000. This reference remuneration is revised annually by applying the revaluation coefficient in respect of  salaries  and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund  ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse ). As of 1 January 2021, the fixed remuneration amounted to \u20ac1,731,000 and the variable remuneration to \u20ac1,442,500.\n- \u00b7 The length of service applied will cover his entire career, including his years as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. For information purposes, Mr Jean-Paul Agon reached the limit of 40 years of service required under the scheme, namely, on 1 September 2018.\n- \u00b7 Mr Jean-Paul Agon will continue to be treated in the same way as a senior manager throughout the term of his corporate office, which allows him to benefit from the additional social protection schemes, including the defined-contribution pension scheme and employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.

        "page_content": "Definition and objectives of Internal Control\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Board  of  Directors,  the Administration and Finance Department compiled the information contained in this Document on the basis of the different types of work carried out by departments responsible for Internal Control  and  Group  Risk  Management,  which  is  designed  to  cover  the  main  operational, manufacturing  and  environmental,  legal  and  regulatory,  financial  and  market  risks,  and  to present the associated mechanisms for prevention and control.\n\n## 3.1. DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES OF INTERNAL CONTROL\n\n## 3.1.1. Reference work\n\nFor  the  preparation  and  drafting  of  this  Document  and  the definition  of  Internal  Control,  L'Or\u00e9al  used  the  Reference Framework  and  its  application  guide  initially  published  in January  2007,  and  updated  on  22  July  2010  by  the  Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (AMF).\n\n## 3.1.2. Internal Control objectives\n\nAt  L'Or\u00e9al,  Internal  Control  is  a  system  that  applies  to  the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group') and aims at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with the laws and regulations in force and the Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  assets  and  reputation  are  valued  and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nBy contributing to preventing and managing the risks to which the  Group  is  exposed,  the  purpose  of  the  Internal  Control system is to enable the Group's manufacturing and economic development  to  take  place  in  a  steady  and  sustainable manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group's businesses. There are however limits inherent in any system and process.  These  limits  result  from  a  number  of  factors,  in particular the uncertainties of the outside world or malfunctions  that  may  occur  due  to  technical  or  human failures.\n\nThe  handling  of a   risk  relies  in  particular  on  a  reasonable informed choice between the challenges to be controlled, the opportunities to be  seized  and  the  cost  of  the  risk management  measures,  taking  into  account  the  effects  of these measures on the occurrence and impact of the risk.\n\n## 3.1.3. Continuous improvement of the Internal Control system\n\nWith  the  aim  of  continually  improving  the  system  of  Internal Control, the Group continued with its efforts in 2020 by taking the following actions:\n\nThe corpus of standards and procedures was bolstered with, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 new  operating  guides  made  available  to  restate  the Group's  principles  and  to  facilitate  the  sharing  of  best practices  (policy  on  responsible  lobbying,  legal  charter, customs requirements, policies on retail,  e-commerce and protection of personal data);\n- \u00b7 in addition, the existing standards are regularly revised to be adapted to new challenges;\n- \u00b7 an  updated  version  of  the  Group's  digital  standard (see  'Communication  of  information  inside  the  Group'  in section  3.2.1.  'Organisation  and  environment'  of  this document); and\n- \u00b7 revamping of the programme to raise awareness of the risks of fraud.\n\nThe  deployment  of  online  training  (prevention  of  corruption, data  security,  competition,  cyber  security,  personal  data protection) is ongoing.\n\nThe  network  of  Internal  Control  managers  continued  to  be built up worldwide through:\n\n- \u00b7 specific training courses;\n- \u00b7 informative  webchats  for  sharing  updates  on  Group projects and business standards; and\n- \u00b7 a special-purpose communication platform that encourages and facilitates the sharing of best practices.\n\nCommunication  within  the  Group  on  the  main  priorities  of Internal Control is promoted by the 'Internal Control Awards', which reward the best global initiatives, and through the Risk Management and Compliance Department's intranet  which makes  it  possible  to  communicate  all  over  the  world  on Internal Control initiatives, tools and events.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2. COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## 3.2.1. Organisation and environment\n\nThe control environment, which is critical to the Internal Control system,  good  risk  management  and  the  application  of procedures,  is  based  on  behaviour,  the  organisational structure and employees. At L'Or\u00e9al, it forms part of a culture of rigour and commitment  communicated  by  senior management  and  is  also  in  line  with  the  Group's  strategic choices.\n\n## The Group's Ethical Principles\n\n## Ethical Principles\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has built up its business on the basis of strong ethical principles  that  guide  its  development  and  contribute  to establishing  its  reputation:  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and Transparency.  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  acting  ethically  and responsibly is  summarised in a document called 'The L'Or\u00e9al Spirit' accessible  to  everyone.  The  Group's  policies  on sustainable  development,  social  and  societal  responsibility, compliance  and  philanthropy  are  based  on  the  Ethical Principles.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Code  of  Ethics  is  available  in  45  languages  and  in Braille  in  English  and  French.  It  is  distributed  to  all  employees around  the  world.  It  enables  employees  to  understand  how these Ethical Principles need to be reflected in their behaviour and  actions  by  providing  simple  rules  and  a  description  of concrete  situations  they  may  encounter.  The  Code  of  Ethics applies to all employees, directors and corporate officers and members of the Executive and Management Committees of the  Group  and  its  subsidiaries  worldwide.  Since  2010,  13 supplements  to  the  Code  of  Ethics  have  covered  certain aspects of the Code in more detail.\n\n## Chief Ethics Officer\n\nThe Chief Ethics Officer  reports  directly  to  the  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer and keeps him informed on a regular basis.\n\nHis/her mission is to:\n\n- \u00b7 ensure  the  promotion  and  integration  of  best  practices within  the  Group,  providing  guidance  in  ethical  decisionmaking;\n- \u00b7 oversee employee training;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  management  of  complaints  and  directly manage  those  related  to  senior  management  positions; and\n- \u00b7 measure and assess the Company's ethical performance.\n\nThe Chief Ethics Officer regularly informs the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee.\n\nHe/she has a dedicated budget and team, unrestricted and on  first  demand  access  to  all  information  and  documents concerning the Group's business activities and can call upon all  the  Group's  teams  and  resources  to  carry  out  his/her mission.\n\nThe  Chief  Ethics  Officer  is  L'Or\u00e9al's  representative  with  the United  Nations  Global  Compact  and  the  NGOs  linked  to  its activity.\n\n## Implementation of L'Or\u00e9al's Ethics and Human Rights approach\n\nCountry  Managers  (or  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report) are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code of  Ethics.  The  Chief  Ethics  Officer  systematically  meets  each new Country Manager and the Group's main senior managers to raise awareness on their role. Senior managers also benefit from a tool to help develop their ethics leadership as well as specific training.\n\nThe role of the 76 Ethics Correspondents throughout the world is  to assist members of the Executive Committee and Country Managers  in  implementing  the  ethics  programme  and  to provide  all  employees  with  a  local  point  of  contact,  whilst promoting  the  normal  routes  for  handling  concerns  by management and Human Resources. The Ethics Correspondents  benefit  every  year  from  a  specific  support and training programme.\n\nThe  Senior  Vice-President  and  Chief  Ethics  Officer  regularly visits  the  Group's  entities  all  over  the  world  (head  offices, plants,  distribution  centres  and  research  centres)  to  meet employees at all levels of the Company and visit the various sites.  Since  the  end  of  2013,  the  Senior  Vice-President  and Chief Ethics Officer has carried out 107 country visits.\n\nThe ethical and human rights risks are mapped and regularly updated,  which  also  includes  suppliers  and  subcontractors (see section 3.4.3. 'General framework of risk analysis' of this document).  A  practical  tool  has  been  created  to  enable Country Managers to assess and analyse possible local ethical risks  and  to  take  the  necessary  prevention  measures.  An annual reporting system allows to monitor the implementation of the ethics programme. The subsidiaries are informed of their potential  areas  for  improvement  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief Ethics  Officer.  Ethics  risks  are  systematically  reviewed  during audit assignments, through individual interviews. These interviews are conducted  separately  with  the  Country Manager and the Administrative and Financial Director.\n\nFor  prospective  acquisitions,  the  responses  to  the  Ethics  and Human  Rights  questionnaire  submitted  to  target  companies serve to identify whether such companies take account of the risks related to business ethics, among others.\n\nA  specific  and  compulsory  e-learning  course  on  ethics  is available  in  all  subsidiaries.  As  of  31  December  2020,  76%  of employees with access to the online module had completed this course. The Office of the Chief Ethics Officer also provides face-to-face  training  as  part  of  the  ongoing  training  of managers and certain business functions (Country Managers, Buyers, Human Resources).\n\nCompliance  with  the  Ethical  Principles  is  integrated  in  the annual  appraisal  system  for  all  employees  through  three ethical  competences:  'Takes  accountability  with  courage and transparency', 'Delivers both sustainable and short-term results with integrity' and 'Treats all individuals in a respectful and consistent manner'.\n\nRegular  communication  with  stakeholders  and  establishment of  internal  working  groups  contribute  to  include  Ethics  in  the Group's new policies and strategic decisions (for example, the Employee  Human  Rights  policy  and  Responsible  Lobbying policy in 2020).\n\n3",

'Sharing Beauty with All: 2020 Results' of this document), the Group's secure whistleblowing line (www.lorealspeakup.com) accessible to all Group stakeholders,  as  well  as  a  procedure  to  collect  and  process reports to manage any violations.\n\nIn  2020,  536  possible  ethical  violations  were  identified  either via the secure website, or via the Ethics correspondents, and local  or  international  management.  The  cases  reported  are thoroughly  examined  and  appropriate  measures  are  taken, where  applicable.  Employees  are  regularly  informed  of  the number  of  reports  discrimination,  sexual  and  other  types  of harassment at Group level worldwide, the number of fully or partially  substantiated  cases  and  the  corrective  measures taken.\n\n## Ethics Day: an annual day on ethics\n\nEthics  Day  has  been  held  since  2009:  a  live  webchat  with L'Or\u00e9al's  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  enables  all of  the  Group's  employees  to  ask  questions  and  discuss  the day-to-day  application  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Ethical  Principles.  Each member  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  each  Country Manager also organises local ethics discussions. In 2020, nearly 70% of the employees participated in this dialogue and over 8,900 questions were asked worldwide.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Ethics  Day,  employees  receive  regular information about the Group's ethical policy and have access to a dedicated Intranet site.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nFor several years, L'Or\u00e9al has begun a profound transformation of the Company in all areas in order to adapt to the great changes in the world. Sustainable development is a  fundamental  pillar  of  our  transformation  and  a  strategic priority  for  all  our  teams.  In  the  firm  belief  that  sustainable development is an essential factor for success and durability, L'Or\u00e9al is deploying an ambitious corporate social responsibility  policy,  which  is  shared  by  its  management  and teams (see section 4.3. 'Policies, performance indicators and results' of this document).\n\nThe year 2020 marked the end of the Sharing Beauty with All programme,  the  first  generation  of  Group  commitments  to sustainable  development,  initiated  in  2013.    Today,  the acceleration of the environmental and social challenges to be met  calls  for  a  much  more  radical  transformation.  In  this context, in June 2020, L'Or\u00e9al announced its new sustainability programme, L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future , with  a  new  series  of particularly ambitious targets for 2030.\n\nMoreover, in 2015, L'Or\u00e9al undertook to define Science Based Targets (SBT) to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain over the long term, in accordance with the Paris Climate Change Agreements. In December 2017, the SBT initiative validated the Group's proposal: L'Or\u00e9al is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on its Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by  25%  in  absolute  value  by  2030,  compared  with  the  2016 baseline.\n\nThe  sustainable  development  Coordinators  worldwide  are tasked  with  helping  the  Country  Managers/Area  Managers/ Brand  Managers  in  the  implementation  of  the  programme within their entity. The progress in local implementation of the Group's  commitments  is  monitored  by  means  of  an  annual reporting system.\n\nThe  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  risks,  and  the  progress  of the policies put in place to deal with these risks, are reviewed regularly as part of the Internal Audit process.\n\nSince  2019,  in  collaboration  with  the  Risk  Management  and Compliance Department, L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility Department has conducted a deeper assessment of the risks related to climate change on the Group's operations, using  in  particular  the  scenario  analysis  method,  in  order  to improve its ability to anticipate and mitigate the impact of these risks.\n\nIt should be noted that the financial risks related to the effects of climate change and the measures taken by the Group to reduce them are described in Chapter 4.\n\n## Human Resources policy\n\nThe quality and skills of male and female employees are key components of the Internal Control system.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Human Resources (HR) Department has always had the mission of supporting the Group's growth and supporting its transformation  initiatives.  In  order  to  be  sustainable, L'Or\u00e9al's  growth  relies  first  and  foremost  on  the  men  and women  in  the  Company,  who  are  the  key  drivers  of  the Group's  success.  Built  on  this  conviction,  the  Group's  human and social project is based on highly individualised management of employees and on collective strength.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  HR  policy  focuses  on  the  identification,  recruitment and development of employees throughout their career, and the rewarding and commitment of all, as well as on an active policy  on  diversity  and  inclusion.  Dedicated  policies  are developed  within  the  Group  in  each  of  these  areas  (see section 4.3.2. 'Human Relations Policy' of this document).\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe  information  systems,  chosen  in  accordance  with  the strategic orientations given by the Group's  Global  IT Department,  integrate,  in  particular,  implementation  of  a single  'ERP'  (Enterprise  Resource  Planning)  management software application used by the vast majority of commercial subsidiaries,  and  which  issues  instructions  regarding  systems security.  The  worldwide  roll-out  of  this  integrated  software package also contributes  to  strengthening  the  reliability  and security  of  the  process  of  producing  information,  notably accounting  and  financial  information.  In  pursuit  of  the  same objective,  the  deployment  of  an  integrated  production  and management solution in the Group's manufacturing entities is continuing.",

In order to make it easier for employees to make these principles  and  standards  their  own,  the  key  principles  are summarised in the 'Fundamentals of Internal Control', which are  regularly  updated  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Risk Management and Compliance Department.\n\nThis guide  is a reference  framework  for  the  Group's operational  activities,  and  is  presented  in  the  form  of  an information sheet for each area. Each information sheet refers to  the  detailed  charters,  codes  and  standards  of  the  Group. The sheets are regularly updated, expanded and validated by the Support Divisions.\n\nA  management  segregation  of  duties  standard  is  regularly updated and distributed to all entities. It defines the main rules to be observed in the fields of sales,  purchasing,  logistics,  finance, human  resources  and  information  systems  management.  The application of these rules is aimed at better preventing of the risks of  fraud  and  reducing  the  probability  that  errors  (whether intentional or not) may remain undetected.\n\n## Communication of information inside the Group\n\nThe 'Fundamentals of Internal Control' guide is circulated to the  Managing  Directors,  Finance  Directors,  and  Internal Control managers  of  all  the  consolidated  subsidiaries, including manufacturing entities. Furthermore, the Fundamentals,  codes,  charters  and  standards,  together  with the  information  related  to  the  organisation,  changes  and instructions from the Support Divisions are made permanently available to the subsidiaries on the Group's intranet sites.\n\nA Group digital standard provides all employees with guides, charters  and  expert  contacts  organised  by  function  and  by subject.\n\nMeetings  are  regularly  organised  aimed  at  passing  on information about orientations of the General Management to managers  of  the  subsidiaries.  The  Support  Divisions  also coordinate  their  networks  of  experts  through  seminars  and training sessions. News  published  on  the  Intranet  gives employees  news  updates  and  meaningful  messages  on Internal Control.\n\nFinally,  the  Awards  illustrate  the  Group's  commitment  to sustainably  strengthening  Internal  Control:  they  are  aimed  at showcasing  the  best  initiatives  and  promoting  exchanges  of best operational practices between the Group's subsidiaries.\n\n## 3.2.2. Control and supervision activities: those involved and their roles\n\nRisk  management  and  Internal  Control  is  the  business  of everyone, from governance bodies to all employees.\n\nThis  system  is  the  subject  of  ongoing  supervision  in  order  to verify  its  relevance  and  meets  the  Group's  objectives  and addresses its issues.\n\n- \u00b7 the General Management and its Management Committee (Executive Committee);\n- \u00b7 the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Audit  Committee  in particular;\n- \u00b7 the Ethics, Risk Management and Compliance Department, the  Internal  Control  Department  and  the  Internal  Audit Department;\n- \u00b7 the Support Divisions; and\n- \u00b7 the Operational Divisions and Geographic Zones.\n\n## The General Management and its Management Committee (Executive Committee)\n\nThe role of the General Management is to define the general principles  regarding  Internal  Control  and  to  ensure  that  they are correctly put in place. In the context of their global Internal Control responsibilities, the members  of  the  Executive Committee  rely  on  operational  and  functional  managers, according  to  their  respective  areas  of  expertise.  These managers  must  ensure  implementation  of  these  general principles  and  the  correct  functioning  of  the  procedures enabling  the  level  of  Internal  Control  required  by  General Management to be attained.\n\n## The Board of Directors and Audit Committee\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  always  asserted  the  importance that  it  attributes,  together  with  General  Management,  to Internal Control and to its main areas of application. Since its creation,  the  Audit  Committee  has  been  responsible  for monitoring actions undertaken in the area of Internal Control and it reports thereon to the Board of Directors. Its remits are defined in the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors.\n\nEach  year,  the  Committee  performs  a  review  of  the  Internal Audit  plan,  its  objectives  and  the  general  conclusions  of Internal Audit assignments. Major Internal Control projects and initiatives  are  also  presented  to  it.  The  Committee  then prepares  a  report  with  its  own  remarks  for  the  Board  of Directors.\n\n## The Operational Divisions and Geographic Zones\n\nThe Group  is organised into worldwide  Divisions and geographical  zones  which  are  fully  responsible,  with  the management  of  each  country,  business  or  manufacturing entity,  for  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  for  Internal Control defined by General Management.\n\nWorldwide  responsibilities  for  Internal  Control  of  the  activities within the scope of their responsibilities are entrusted to each of  the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee.  A  system  of delegating  authorities  is  in  place  and  continues  to  be reinforced.  The  powers  of  the  legal  representatives  of  Group companies and of those to whom they delegate are limited and controlled in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Charter.\n\nSpecialists in management,  information  systems,  Human Resources,  digital,  retail,  purchasing,  logistics  and  production provide support to operational employees at all levels of the organisation and contribute in this way to the achievement of the Internal Control objectives.\n\n3",

Through their network of specialists or by regular  audits,  they  bring  their  expertise  to  the  operational divisions  and  review  the  correct  operation of their  respective areas of responsibility.\n\nThe main Departments concerned are:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Research,  Innovation  and  Technology  Department, which is particularly responsible for cosmeto-vigilance and the  quality  of  the  formulas  used  in  the  composition  of  the products  (see  'Product  quality  and  safety:  a  priority'  in section 4.3.3.2. 'Measures taken in favour of consumers' of this document);\n- \u00b7 the Purchasing Department with suppliers and their working conditions;\n- \u00b7 the  Environment,  Health  &  Safety  Department,  for  checks related to site safety, employee health and environmental compliance;\n- \u00b7 the Quality Department to measure performance and the progress made by manufacturing entities with regard to the quality of production;\n- \u00b7 the  Global  IT  Department,  primarily  to  assess  compliance with the Cyber Security Policy;\n- \u00b7 the Administration and Finance Department;\n- \u00b7 the  Human  Resources  Department,  which  monitors  and supervises all obligations related to personnel management, specifies the documents to be provided to employees,  the  remuneration  of  the  workforce  and personnel expenses, the recruitment, training and evaluation  procedures,  the  rules  to  be  followed  in  payroll management and the implementation of the Share & Care programme;\n- \u00b7 the Communications and Public Affairs Department, which coordinates  communications  operations,  establishes  crisis management principles and ensures that they are applied (see section 3.5.3.1., 'Crisis Management' of this document);\n- \u00b7 the Digital Department, the mission of which is to secure the digital transformation of the Group (e-commerce, consumer  relations,  influencers,  digital  media,  etc.)  by defining the policies, tools, and processes and ensuring that they are deployed; and\n- \u00b7 the Security Department, which has defined a security and safety  policy  for  people,  travel,  property,  information  and data confidentiality (see section 3.5.3.1. 'Safety of people and property' of this document).\n\nIndicators and reporting procedures enable regular monitoring of the local activities of most of these Support Divisions.\n\n## The Administration and Finance Department\n\nThis  Department's  main  role  is  to  assist  and  control  the operational  employees  in  their  administrative,  financial  and legal activities and in the processing of information. In order to\n\ndo  so,  it  sets  the  operating  rules  that  apply  to  all  entities, defines  and  deploys  tools,  procedures  and  best  practices, particularly  in  the  following  areas:  management,  accounting and consolidation, financing and cash, taxes, legal issues and personal data protection, financial communication, strategic planning, and insurance.\n\nAn  Internal  Control  Committee  has  the  task  of  taking  all measures  to  promote  the  proper  understanding  and  the proper  application  of  the  Group's  Internal  Control  rules  and also to monitor progress on important Internal Control projects. It is composed  of  the  Chief  Administrative  and  Financial Officer, and  the  Directors of Risk Management  and Compliance,  Internal  Control,  Operational  Finance,  Internal Audit and Information Systems (Global IT).\n\n## Ethics, Risk Management and Compliance Department\n\nThe  objective  of  this  department  is  to  coordinate  the processes designed to identify, assess and prioritise risks with all those concerned, and keep the Group's risk mapping analysis up-to-date.  Its  aim  is  to  promote  optimal  use  of  resources  to minimise  and  control  the  impact  of  negative  events  and maximise the performance of opportunities.\n\nThe  Director  of  Ethics,  Risk  Management  and  Compliance reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## The Internal Control Department\n\nThis  department,  which  is  separate  from  Internal  Audit  and placed under the responsibility of the Risk Management and Compliance Department, ensures the distribution and updating  of  the  'Fundamentals  of  Internal  Control'  guide. Frequent  actions  at  seminars  and  during  training  cycles  and the publication of newsletters help to increase knowledge of this  tool,  to  improve  its  application  and  use  by  operational employees and keep them informed of the Group's projects and priorities in the area of Internal Control.\n\nIt is responsible for the continued development of the network of  Internal  Control  managers  in  the  Group's  entities.  For  this reason, the role of this function was specifically detailed and a training module was created. At the end of 2020, the Internal Control  Department  had  a  network  of  140  local  managers present in the Group's different entities.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  Department  leads  the  Internal  Control Committee  and  coordinates  the  implementation  of  projects and work decided by the Internal Control Committee with the business line experts. The updating of the standards mentioned in this document is one example of this work.\n\nWith the constant desire for improvement, the Internal Control Department,  on  the  basis  of  the  'Fundamentals  of  Internal Control' reference guide, develops, disseminates and coordinates  self-evaluation  campaigns  focusing  on  the  main risks and issues identified, gradually being rolled out in each of the business lines. The self-evaluation of Internal Control makes it  possible  for  the  Group's  entities  to  ensure  the  due  and proper  functioning  of  the  system  and  to  reinforce  it  with operational actions.\n\nIn  addition,  this  Department  monitors  changes  related  to Internal Control relating to expectations and market practices.",

These analyses make it possible to direct the work of  the  Internal  Control  Committee  and  to  identify  the  priority areas for improvement and strengthening of procedures.\n\nInternal  Audit  is  carried  out  by  a  central  team  that  reports directly  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.  This department  carries  out  regular  assignments  to  audit  major processes  and  check  on  the  application  of  Group  principles and standards.\n\nInternal  Audit  assignments  are  submitted  to  the  General Management and the Audit Committee for their approval and give  rise,  with  their  agreement,  to  the  preparation  of  an annual audit plan. The entities' contribution to the Group's key economic  indicators,  their  pattern  of  development,  their historical  precedence  and  the  results  of  previous  audits  are factors that are taken into account when defining remits. The risk level assessment carried out by the area departments and experts  in  the  different  business  lines  is  also  a  determining factor in the elaboration of the annual audit plan.\n\nIn 2020, the Internal Audit Department carried out 45  assignments,  23  of  which  involved  commercial  entities representing  almost  23%  of  the  Group's  sales  and  seven  of which  were  carried  out  at  plants  contributing  to  more  than 17% of the plants' global production. The 2020 Internal Audit also  covered a   research  centre,  two  sourcing  centres  and three  International  Marketing  Departments.  In  addition,  three missions were conducted on project management and six on specific themes. And finally, certain resources were dedicated,  on  an  exceptional  basis,  to  support  other  Group departments during the early months of the lockdown.\n\nAudits  systematically  result  in  a  report  that  describes  the findings and corresponding risks, and provides an action plan covering  all  recommendations  to  be  implemented  by  the audited entity. These action plans are followed up regularly by the Internal Audit Department which measures, and communicates  to  the  relevant  departments,  the  rate  of progress made in acting on the recommendations.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  uses  the  Group's  integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and has developed a   number  of  specific  transactions  that  help  it better  identify  potential  weaknesses  in  the  most  sensitive processes.  The  use  of  these  transactions  includes  Data analytics  capacities  that  are  improved  every  year  with  new standard analyses developed by Internal Audit and by access to  dashboards  and  analysis  tools  that  the  businesses  are continually  developing  for  their  own  management  needs. Finally, the Internal Audit Department has a Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC) tool, which enables it to carry out its tasks using  an  integrated  tool  and  to  consolidate  in  real-time  the progress made in the action plans of the audited entities.\n\nThe achievement of the audit plan, the results of assignments and the progress of the action plans are presented to General Management and the Audit Committee each year.\n\nThe audit results are shared with the Group's Statutory Auditors. The  remarks  made  by  the  external  auditors  as  part  of  their annual audit are also taken into consideration by the Internal Audit Department when defining its assignments.\n\nThe  strategic  choices  in  terms  of  systems  are  determined  by the  Group's  Global  IT  Department,  whose  main  mission  is  to implement  ERP  management  software  which  is  used  by  the vast  majority  of  the  Group's  commercial  subsidiaries,  plants and logistics services. It also supports the digital transformation of the Group by developing the use of Cloud services (SaaS, Iaas, PaaS) and connected objects.\n\nWithin the Department,  the  Information  Systems  Security Department  is  responsible  for  the  Information  Systems  Security Policy. Based on the international ISO 27001 standard, this policy covers the main topics of Information Systems security, including the  protection  of  personal  data,  and  describes  the  general principles  to  be  applied  for  each  of  them.  It  enables  all  the Group's  Information  Systems  teams,  and  by  extension,  all employees, to share clear objectives, best practices and levels of control  adapted  to  the  risks  incurred,  notably,  the  risk  of  cyber attack.  This  policy  is  accompanied  by  an  information  systems security audit programme conducted by an outside firm. It is also supplemented by an Information and Communication Technologies Code of Practice, and a Code of Good Practice for the use of Social Media.\n\n## The Operations Division\n\nThis  Division  comprises  the  Departments  of  Packaging  and Development,  Quality,  EHS  (Environment,  Health,  Safety), Production  Management,  Purchasing,  Supply  Chain,  and manufacturing  strategy.  It  defines  the  overall  Operations strategy  worldwide  and  defines  the  standards  and  methods applicable in the areas of quality, safety, and the environment for  deployment  in  all  the  countries  in  which  the  Group operates. It manages the Group's comprehensive strategy to enable the teams in the Operational Divisions and regions to implement  innovation,  manufacturing  and  logistics  policies suited to the markets.\n\nIn line with the Group's Code of Ethics, since 2011, buyers have access  to  a  practical  and  ethical  'The  Way  We  Buy'  guide which aims at helping all employees in their relationships with the Group's suppliers. Buyers also have the Group's The Way We Compete and The Way We Prevent Corruption guides for which online training (e-learning) is provided.\n\nThe  standard  for  managing  suppliers  and  tender  procedures specify  the  conditions  for  competitive  tendering  and  for  the registration  of  the  main  suppliers.  The  general  terms  of purchase  form  the  framework  for  transactions  with  the suppliers. The 'Purchase Commitments and Order Management'  standard is aimed at facilitating and strengthening  control  of  the  spending  and  investments  of Group entities.\n\nIn the area of the supply chain, the main assignments consist of defining  and  applying  the  sales  planning,  customer demand management, development and control of customer service  processes,  including  through  the  management  of physical  order  fulfilment,  application  of  the  general  terms  of sale,  follow-up  of  orders,  management  of  customer  returns and  customer  disputes  as  well  as  accounts  receivable collection  procedures.  Measures  are  also  recommended  for the  management  of  distribution  centres  and  inventories, subcontracting, product traceability, business continuity plans and transportation.\n\n3",

SYSTEMS RELATING TO THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\nFor the preparation of this report, L'Or\u00e9al based its work on the 'Application  Guide  for  Internal  Control  of  accounting  and financial information published by issuers', from the Reference Framework  published  by  the  AMF  on  22  July  2010.  This approach  is  part  of  an  overall  process  aimed  at  making continual  progress  and  improving  the  Internal  Control  system that is already in place.\n\n## 3.3.1. Definition, scope and objectives\n\nInternal  Control  for  accounting  and  finance  covers  the processes  that  provide  accounting  data:  the  process  of producing financial information, the accounts closing process and financial communication actions.\n\nThe  accounting  and  financial  Internal  Control  process  is designed to ensure:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance  with  accounting  regulations  and  the  correct application  of  the  principles  on  which  the  financial statements are based;\n- \u00b7 application of the guidelines set by the General Management for financial information;\n- \u00b7 protection of assets;\n- \u00b7 quality of the reporting that contributes to the preparation of published financial statements and the reliability of their centralised  processing  for  the  Group  for  their  distribution and use for monitoring purposes; and\n- \u00b7 control  of  the  production  of  financial,  accounting  and management information including fraud prevention.\n\nThe  scope  of  application  of  the  Internal  Control  procedures relating  to  the  preparation  and  processing  of  financial  and accounting  information  encompasses  the  parent  company and  all  subsidiaries  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## 3.3.2. Monitoring process for the organisation of accounting and finance functions\n\n## Organisation of the Finance Departments\n\nDedicated teams of specialists ensure the implementation of accounting and financial monitoring, under the supervision of General  Management,  in  the  following  areas:  accounting, consolidation,  tax  matters,  management,  financial  services and cash flow.\n\nIn the Administration and Finance Department, the Operational  Finance  Department  prepares  the  Group's consolidated  financial  results:  the  latter  coordinates  the pooled service centres and a global network of management controllers  who  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with the  Group's  accounting  and  management  standards  to ensure  appropriate  management  of  the  result.  International\n\naccounting management is executed by a team of specialists that  ensure  the  application  of  IFRS  and  the  implementation and harmonisation of the Group's accounting processes in the accounting  pooled  service  centres  and  in  the  countries. Finally, the Operational Finance Department runs the Group's Tax Department which comprises a network of tax lawyers at corporate  level,  in  the  regions  and  in  the  Group's  most vulnerable countries, monitors changes in regulations, ensures compliance with local rules, and oversees the implementation of the  Group's  tax  policy,  and  in  particular  the  strict application of the transfer pricing policy and customs rules.\n\nThe  processing  and  pooling  of  cash  flows  and  hedging  of currency and interest rate risks  are  carried  out  by  the  Group Corporate  Finance  Department,  which  is  in  charge  of identifying commitments and enabling their proper booking.\n\n## Group standards\n\nThe Group has put in place a set of accounting policies and standards  consistent  with  IFRS,  the  consolidated  accounting standards.\n\nThe  application  of  these  standards  is  compulsory  for  all consolidated  subsidiaries  in  order  to  provide  uniform  and reliable financial information.\n\nThe  Operational  Finance  Department  oversees  the  regular update  of  these  Group  standards,  taking  into  account  the changes in regulations and accounting principles:\n\n- \u00b7 they define the principles required for harmonised accounting  treatment  of  transactions.  They  specify  in particular  the  methods  of  recording  balance  sheet  items and  of  identification  and  valuation  of  off-balance  sheet commitments. The Group's Accounting Department monitors, on an ongoing basis, new accounting standards currently  under  preparation,  in  order  to  alert  the  General Management and anticipate their  effects  on  the  Group's financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 the chart of accounts, common to all subsidiaries, and the key  accounting  processes  provide  the  definitions  and methodology  for  preparing  the  reporting  necessary  to establish the financial statements.\n\nThe management standards describe how the rules should be applied operationally. They give the valuation rules for some of the key balance sheet and income statement accounts and also  stipulate  the  controls  and  checks  applicable  to  the key processes.\n\nThe management standards are regularly supplemented and are  thus  part  of  the  continuous  improvement  process.  The purpose of this work is both to take action in response to the findings  of  the  Internal  Audit  Department  and  to  cover  the areas  corresponding  to  the  accounting  and  financial  risks  of subsidiaries.  This  work  has  made  it  possible  to  bring  our approach more closely in line with the recommendations set out in the 'Application  Guide  for  Internal  Control  of accounting and financial information' of the AMF Reference Framework.",

Tools  have  been  made available to enable them to ensure that access rights comply with the Group's rules.\n\n## Management tools\n\nThe  system  for  monthly  reporting  of  the  various  economic indicators  enables  continuous,  homogenous  monitoring  of changes in the performance of each subsidiary and ensures they are in line with the objectives set.\n\nThe  reporting  and  consolidation  system,  used  by  all  entities, ensures the consistency and reliability of figures at the level of each subsidiary through blocking controls that operate before the financial  data  is  uploaded  to  Group  level.  In  this  regard, the operating profit and loss account by destination, which is common  to  both  management  and  general  accounting, contributes  to  strengthening  the  control  of  accounts  in  the financial  statements  through  the  use  of  a  single  reference framework.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group's  organisation,  which  is  based  on reporting from each subsidiary that is provided directly by the countries  to  the  parent  company,  without  any  intermediate aggregates for the vast majority of the subsidiaries, optimises data  transfer  and  the  completeness  of  information  and,  in particular, verification of data accuracy.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each subsidiary  make  a  joint  commitment  with  regard  to  the quality,  reliability  and  completeness  of  the  accounting  and financial  information  they  have  prepared  and  sent  to  the Group's Operational Finance Department, through a representation letter that they jointly sign.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  role  and  tasks  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  described above.  These  tasks  are  in  compliance  with  European regulations  and,  in  particular,  Directive  2014/56/EU  and EU regulation 537/2014 on statutory audits, and are based on the  report  by  the  working  group  on  the  Audit  Committee published by the AMF on 22 July 2010.\n\n## 3.3.3. Processes used to prepare accounting and financial information\n\n## Operational processes contributing to accounting figures\n\nAll  of  the  processes  that  contribute  to  accounting  figures, particularly  sales  and  purchases,  and  inventory,  fixed  asset, payroll  and  treasury  management  are  covered  by  specific procedures,  follow-up checks  and  rules  for  validation, authorisation and booking operations.\n\n## Closing of accounts, consolidation and management reporting information\n\nThe  accounts  closing  process  is  governed  by  precise instructions  and  is  based  on  a  detailed  time  schedule circulated  to  all  subsidiaries  to  make  sure  that  deadlines  are met  and  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  a  consistent manner.  In  this  regard,  the  Group  has  introduced  two  hard closings  (anticipating  the  work  involved  in  the  closure  of financial  statements)  in  May  and  November  which  make  it possible  to  better  anticipate  and  speed  up  closing  times. For  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements, validation procedures apply at each stage of the process of reporting and processing information. Their purpose is to verify in particular that:\n\n- \u00b7 inter-company  transactions  are  correctly  adjusted  and eliminated (these are reported on a monthly basis);\n- \u00b7 consolidation operations are checked;\n- \u00b7 accounting standards are correctly applied; and\n- \u00b7 the consolidated published accounting and financial data are  harmonised  and  properly  determined  and  general accounting  data  and  management  data  used  in  the preparation of the financial information are consistent.\n\n## Financial communication\n\nManagers  in  charge  of  Financial  Communication  prepare a precise timetable for publication of up-to-date information on the  Group  to  the  financial  markets.  This  timetable  complies with  the  requirements  of  market  authorities.  These  managers ensure,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Legal  Department,  that communications are made within the required deadlines and in accordance  with  laws  and  regulations,  which  they constantly monitor.\n\nTheir  role  is  also  to  publish,  precisely  and  accurately,  the information provided by the Operational Finance Department. All  material  information  provided  to  the  financial  community reflects with truth and transparency the situation and activities of  the  Group  and  the  process  is  carried  out  in  accordance with  the  principle  of  equal  provision  of  information  to  all shareholders.\n\n## Statutory Auditors\n\nAll accounting  and  financial  information  prepared  by consolidated subsidiaries is  subject  to  a  limited  review  at  the time of the half-year closing process and to a full audit at yearend by the external auditors. Twice a year, the Chief Executive Officer  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  the  consolidated subsidiary make a joint commitment as to the fair presentation, reliability  and  completeness  of  the  financial  information  by jointly signing a representation letter.\n\nAudit assignments in the countries are almost all entrusted to members of the networks of  the  two  Statutory  Auditors  who, after  having  jointly  performed  the  review  of  all  the  Group's accounts and the manner in which they were prepared, are responsible for issuing an opinion on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditors issue an opinion as to  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the parent  company  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair view.  They  are  kept  informed  from  the  early  stages  of preparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  present  an overview of their work to the Group's accounting and finance managers and to the Audit Committee at the time of the halfyear and annual closings.\n\n3",

Insurance policy\n\n## The Group's general insurance policy\n\nThe objective of the Group's insurance policy is to provide the best  protection  of  Group  assets  and  people  from  the occurrence  of  significant  and  insurable  risks  that  could adversely affect it.\n\nFor that purpose,  the  Group  has  implemented  global insurance programmes (in particular for the Property Damage &  Operating  Losses,  Third-Party  Liability,  Transport  and  Credit Insurance)  that  harmonise  coverage  and  control  insurance cover  for  all  its  subsidiaries  throughout  the  world,  except  in countries  where  regulations  do  not  allow  this  type  of arrangement (see 'Restrictions' below). National programmes have been set up in the countries in which global programmes cannot be deployed.\n\nThis policy is applied as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 at a   central  level,  the  Group  has  negotiated  insurance programmes on a worldwide basis with first-rate insurance companies to cover its main risks on the basis of the cover available;\n- \u00b7 at  a  local  level,  the  national  programmes  are  deployed; and\n- \u00b7 in all cases,  the  subsidiaries  must  obtain  mandatory insurance  cover  in  order  to  meet  their  local  regulatory obligations.\n\nThe  financial  solvency  of  insurers  chosen  is  an  important criterion  in  the  Group's  insurer  selection  process.  Most  of  the insurance  programmes  subscribed  by  the  Group  involve  coinsurance. Globally, the world's main insurance companies are involved in one or more of these programmes.\n\n## Integrated global programmes\n\n## General third party and environmental liability\n\nThis global programme covers two complementary components that benefit all Group subsidiaries (except where restrictions apply):\n\n- \u00b7 general third-party liability, which covers operating liability, third-party  liability  related  to  products,  and  sudden  and accidental environmental damage; and\n- \u00b7 third-party  liability  for  environmental  damage  for  sudden, accidental or gradual damage, which includes prevention inspections  at  Group  sites  conducted  by  the  specialised units of the insurer.\n\nThese  programmes  cover  the  financial  consequences  of  the civil liability of Group entities, to the extent that they are liable.\n\n## Property damage and operating losses\n\nFire, lightning, explosion, theft and natural disasters are insured within  the  limits  of  the  products  available  on  the  insurance market.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  a  global  programme  to  cover  its property,  chiefly  fixed  assets  and  inventories  (except  where restrictions  apply).  This  cover  also  includes  a  portion  on operating losses directly resulting from covered property loss or damage.\n\nAs the capacity of the insurance market is limited for certain risks,  this  programme includes sublimits, particularly as regards natural disasters.\n\nThrough  its  reinsurance  subsidiary,  the  Group  carries  risk retention  levels  that  are  not  material  at  consolidated  level, and  these  are  applicable  over  and  above  local  deductible amounts.\n\nFinally,  the  insurance  offering  includes  prevention  inspections for  the  Group's  sites  conducted  by  specialist  departments  of the leading insurer.\n\n## Transport\n\nThe Group has set up an insurance programme to cover the transportation  of  all  its  products.  All  subsidiaries  benefit  from the  protection  offered  by  this  global  programme,  which ensures  that  appropriate  cover  is  provided  for  Group operations (except where restrictions apply).\n\n## Customer credit risk\n\nGroup  subsidiaries  must  set  up  credit  insurance,  assisted  by head office and under the terms and conditions negotiated, in  addition to their own credit management policy, provided that  insurance  cover  compatible  with  their  level  of  sales activity is available under financially acceptable conditions.",

These  Principles  -  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage and  Transparency  -  form  the  foundation  of  its  policies  on sustainable  development, corporate social responsibility,  and philanthropy.  L'Or\u00e9al  promotes  respect  for  all  internationally recognised Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nIn  line  with  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business and Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al's particular point of reference is the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  International Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights,  the  International Covenant  on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  rights,  and  the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Vigilance  Plan  meets  the  obligations  of  the  French law  of  27  March  2017  on  the  duty  of  vigilance  for  French parent companies and order-givers companies.\n\nIt  contains  reasonable  due  diligence  measures  intended  to prevent  the  risk  of  serious  adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, health, as well as safety and the environment within the framework of a best efforts obligation.\n\nIt  applies  to  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.,  the  parent  company  of  the  Group, and  to  the  subsidiaries  controlled  directly  or  indirectly  by L'Or\u00e9al  (the  'Subsidiaries'),  as  defined  by  Article  L.  233-16  of the French Commercial  Code,  and  to  suppliers  and subcontractors with which the companies of the Group have an  'permanent  commercial  relationship',  that  is,  a  direct, ongoing  and  stable  commercial  relationship  (based  on  the definition  in  French  case  law),  hereinafter  the  'Suppliers', depending on the risk level as identified in this Vigilance Plan. It is  understood  that  in  its  own  activities,  L'Or\u00e9al  complies  with the rules and diligences contained in this Vigilance Plan, even when L'Or\u00e9al is not expressly mentioned therein.\n\nThe  Vigilance  Plan  contains  the  rules  applied  to  prevent  the risk of serious adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights  and Fundamental Freedoms, the health and safety of people and the  environment  resulting  from  the  activities  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its Subsidiaries and Suppliers (see section 3.4.4. 'Applicable rules resulting  from  the  risk  analysis'  of  this  document).  It  also includes reasonable measures for the effective application of these rules by L'Or\u00e9al, its Subsidiaries and Suppliers as well as regular  assessment  procedures  to evaluate  their  compliance (see  section  3.4.5.  'Effective  application  and  control  of  the compliance  with  the  Vigilance  Plan'  of  this  document).  It includes  a  whistleblowing  mechanism  and  reporting  system (see  section  3.4.6.  'Whistleblowing  mechanism  and  reporting system' of this document) and presents a report on the plan's implementation (see section 3.4.7. 'Reporting on the effective implementation of the Vigilance Plan' of this document).\n\nThe  actions  to  support,  encourage  and  prevent  serious adverse Human Rights, Fundamental Freedoms, health, safety and  the  environment  contained  in  this  Vigilance  Plan constitute reasonable efforts to be implemented by Suppliers and  Subsidiaries.  Given  the  diversity  of  the  businesses  of  the Subsidiaries and  Suppliers, the Vigilance Plan contains common measures intended for them on these issues.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  common  measures,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its Subsidiaries  voluntarily  conduct  additional  actions  on  these same issues. These actions are described in other chapters of this  document,  particularly  Chapter  4.  Suppliers  voluntarily conduct  additional  actions  on  these  issues  and  L'Or\u00e9al encourages them to do so.\n\n## 3.4.2. A continuous improvement process\n\nAs  part  of  an  ongoing  improvement  approach,  this  Plan  is regularly reviewed by a committee composed of representatives of the Office of Ethics, Risk Management and Compliance,  the  Operations  Division  (EHS,  Purchasing),  the Human Resources Department, the Corporate Social Responsibility Department and the Legal Department. It meets three times a year. Each of these representatives leads a local network  (Ethics  Correspondents,  Environmental,  Health  and Safety,  Purchasing,  and  Human  Resource  teams,  managers from  Internal  control,  SBWA  coordinators)  around  the  world, which  also  means  that  feedback  from  the  field  can  be considered in improving the Vigilance Plan.\n\nThe Plan was presented to internal stakeholders (such as the employee  representatives  in  the  context  of  the  European Works  Council  (EWC)  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group)  and  qualified outside  stakeholders.  Its  updated  contents  are  presented every year to the Audit Committee and to the L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors.\n\n## 3.4.3. General framework of risk analysis\n\nThe risks of serious impacts on Human Rights, the environment, health  and  safety,  have  been  analysed  on  the  basis  of  the business  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  Subsidiaries  and  its  Suppliers.  The  risk analysis was used, first, in the definition of the applicable Rules and,  second,  to  the  measures  for  effective  application  and monitoring of these Rules.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  activity  consists  of  production  of  cosmetic  products and distribution of these products to the Group's clients.\n\n## A/ Manufacturing of finished products\n\nL'Or\u00e9al manufactures the vast majority of the finished products that  it  sells  in  its  own  plants,  with  a  presence  in  the  major growth markets through its network of 40 plants equipped with the very latest technologies and advances in automation. This network of plants adapts constantly with agility to incorporate acquisitions and embrace external innovations.\n\nThis  network  is  completed  by  production  sub-contracting,  to meet  temporary  demand  peaks  in  the  case  of  specific technologies (make-up pencils, soaps, etc.) or sometimes for purchases  of  finished  products.  Cascade  subcontracting  is prohibited in our contracts. If, due  to  manufacturing constraints,  some  subcontractors  must  subcontract  a  portion of  the  production  intended  for  L'Or\u00e9al,  they  must  obtain authorisation  from  L'Or\u00e9al.  L'Or\u00e9al  does  not  work  with subcontractors wishing to subcontract the entire production in order to act as simple intermediaries. When, in certain cases, the subcontractor is authorised to subcontract a portion of its production,  the  same  rules  as  those  defined  in  this  Vigilance Plan are applied to the subcontractors of the subcontractors, and the same types of controls and sanctions in the event of non-compliance are in place.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "In order to execute their production, L'Or\u00e9al's plants purchase different raw materials, packaging components and equipment  from  third-party  suppliers.  These  suppliers  have specific  expertise,  develop  their  products  and  have  the infrastructures  necessary  for  their  production.  They  act  with complete independence from L'Or\u00e9al, without depending on L'Or\u00e9al's instructions or expertise.\n\nThe  manufacture  of  packaging  components  is  not  part  of L'Or\u00e9al's activity. All packaging  components  used  are purchased from companies specialising in this area. The same is true for the production equipment.\n\n## B/ Product distribution\n\nProducts are distributed by the Subsidiaries and independent third-party  distributors  in  the  countries  or  regions  where  the Subsidiaries are not present.\n\nIn order to ensure this distribution, warehouses are operated by the  Subsidiaries  directly,  or  these  services  are  entrusted  to third-party  logistics  service  providers  that  render  services  on the same type of activity: storage and preparation of orders in warehouses that they lease or own.\n\n## 3.4.4. Applicable rules resulting from the risk analysis\n\nThe Subsidiaries and Suppliers must comply with the applicable local  legislation  and  the  minimum  common core of the rules listed  below  (the  'Applicable  Rules')  in  order  to  prevent  the risk of serious adverse  impacts  on  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people and the environment.  When  local  laws  and/or  the  internal  rules  of Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  stipulate  more  stringent  standards than  the  Applicable  Rules,  such  standards  must  take precedence.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  Applicable  Rules provide  for  stricter  standards,  the  Applicable  Rules  take precedence  unless  they  result  in  an  unlawful  activity.  In  the event of contradictions between local laws and internationally recognised Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al works to comply with these international standards. When faced with conflicting requirements between local law and internationally recognised Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al seeks ways to honour these international standards.\n\n## 3.4.4.1. Risks and Applicable Rules for the prevention of serious violations of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\n## Risk Analysis and risks identified relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAn  initial  analysis  was  conducted  in  2017  by  the  Group  and was expanded in 2020 by identifying the salient Human Rights risks. To do so, L'Or\u00e9al relied on the reporting framework of the Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGP Reporting  Framework).  This  identification  process  takes  into consideration  the  severity,  scale  and  remediability  of  its impact  on  people  throughout  its  value  chain.  To  date,  the identification  process  on  a  global  level  and  in  a  few  pilot markets has been finalised.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  analysis,  the  following  salient  risks  were identified in the context of the application of the French Law on Duty of Vigilance:\n\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  child  labour  among  the  employees  of  the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  forced  labour  among  the  employees  of  the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  job  discrimination  because  of  gender,  age, disability,  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation  of  the employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  employees  of  the  Group's Suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 the risk of a lack of decent living wage for the employees of the Group's Suppliers.\n\nAnother  risk identified concerns  the  Human  Rights  of communities  potentially  impacted  by  the  Group's  activities (respect  for  the  environment,  right  of  access  to  water, consideration of Human Rights in the choice of raw materials and, in  particular,  the  right  of  access  of  local  populations  to their  land  and  respect  for  their  traditional  knowledge  under the Nagoya Protocol).\n\n## Applicable rules on Human Rights\n\nSubsidiaries and Suppliers must comply with the minimum core rules,  which  consist  of  the  following  rules  that  result  from  an analysis of the risks related to the activities of the Group and its Suppliers.\n\n## Non-discrimination\n\nActs of discrimination are serious attacks on Human Rights that remain anchored in all regions of the world in which L'Or\u00e9al is present.  Discrimination  related  to  gender,  sexual  orientation and gender identity, disabilities, family situation, age, political and philosophical opinions, religious beliefs, union activities, or related  to  ethnic,  social,  cultural  or  national  origins  are prohibited. Discrimination related to pregnancy  is  also prohibited.  In  this  respect,  L'Or\u00e9al  bans  pregnancy  testing when employees are hired within the Group, and requires its Suppliers to comply with this standard.\n\n## Bullying and sexual harassment\n\nBullying  and  sexual  harassment  are  also  prohibited  in  the Group.  L'Or\u00e9al  requires  that  its  Suppliers  comply  with  this standard.\n\n## Child labour\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  presence  in  certain  regions  of  the  world  that  are particularly  at  risk  for  child  labour,  including  Asia  and  Latin America, has led the Group to identify this issue as a priority.\n\nTo  take  into  consideration  the  vulnerability  of  young  workers, L'Or\u00e9al has set the minimum hiring age at 16 years old.\n\nThe Subsidiaries and Suppliers are required to check the age of all new employees upon hire.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al prohibits night work and work hazardous to health and safety for employees younger than 18 in its Subsidiaries. L'Or\u00e9al requires that its Suppliers comply with this standard.",

        "page_content": "## Forced or compulsory labour\n\nL'Or\u00e9al refers to the definition of forced labour in Convention 29  of  the  International  Labour  Organisation.  Forced  labour  is defined  as  'all  work  or  service  which  is  exacted  from  any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily'.\n\nIn certain regions of the world where L'Or\u00e9al is present, certain practices  that  violate  internationally  recognised  Human Rights, such as holding the identity papers of migrant workers, are current.\n\nAny form of forced labour is prohibited. As a result:\n\n- \u00b7 unless  there  is  a  legal  obligation,  employees'  identity papers,  passports  or  any  other  personal  documents  may not be held from them. In the event of a legal obligation, these  documents  must  be  returned  to  employees  at  their first request;\n- \u00b7 employees may not be asked to pay for recruitment costs or to make cash deposits to obtain employment;\n- \u00b7 if workers from foreign regions are hired, the employer must pay the costs related to these hires;\n- \u00b7 the use of prison labour is possible only when it is voluntary within  the  scope  of  a  professional  reinsertion  programme, and  paid  at  the  market  rate.  Suppliers  must  request authorisation  from  L'Or\u00e9al  before  they  use  this  type  of labour;\n- \u00b7 security  personnel  must  only  ensure  the  safety  of  people and property; and\n- \u00b7 any salary withholding must be strictly authorised by law. It may not under any circumstances be used for the purpose of  confiscation,  for  the  direct  or  indirect  benefit  of  the employer.\n\nEmployees must be free to move around their place of work, with  the  exceptions of areas to which access is restricted for confidentiality  or  safety  reasons,  and  must  have  access  to drinking water and bathrooms.\n\n## Working hours\n\nWhichever the region of the world in which L'Or\u00e9al is present, the  working  hours  in  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers,  including overtime,  may  not  exceed  60  hours  a  week  for  employees whose working time is monitored.\n\nAll employees must also be granted at least one day of rest for every  seven-day  period,  or  two  consecutive  days  of  rest  for every fourteen-day period. They must have reasonable breaks when they work.\n\n## Freedom of association\n\nViolations of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, such as discrimination against employee representatives, may occur in all regions of the world in which L'Or\u00e9al operates.\n\nEmployees'  freedom  of  association  and  right  to  collective bargaining must be respected:\n\n- \u00b7 elections  of  employee  representatives  must  take  place without interference from the employer by secret ballot;\n- \u00b7 employee  representatives  have  access  to  the  work premises subject to safety and/or confidentiality requirements, if any; and\n- \u00b7 discrimination against employees conducting union activities is prohibited.\n\nVigilance Plan\n\nIn  regions  where  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective  bargaining  are  limited  or  discouraged,  L'Or\u00e9al authorises  its  employees  to  meet  independently  in  order  to discuss  their  professional  concerns.  L'Or\u00e9al  requires  that  its Suppliers do the same.\n\n## Additional actions for Human Rights\n\nIn addition to the actions resulting from the risk analysis on the activities  of  the  Group  and  the  Suppliers,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts actions on Human Rights in addition to those implemented in the  context  of  the  law  on  the  Duty  of  Vigilance,  which  are described  in  chapter  4  'L'Or\u00e9al's  social,  environmental  and societal responsibility' of this document.\n\nFor  example,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  actions  with  the  aim  to  improve the  working  conditions  of  the  Indian  communities  whose livelihood  depends  on  the  mineral  mica.  Since  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al has been one of the five founding members of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI), joined by 54 other organisations that use mica. The RMI has three goals:\n\n- \u00b7 implement standards on the responsible workplace on 100% of  mica  supply  chains  in  Bihar  and  Jharkhand  (standards on  employment,  health,  safety  in  the  workplace,  the environment, and non-use of child labour);\n- \u00b7 support  the  abilities  of  communities  through  an  inclusive programme  that  improves  the  standard  of  living  and generates additional sources of income; and\n- \u00b7 establish  a  legal  framework  and  related  control  systems with  mica  pickers,  processing  units,  and  mica  operators  in Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also participates in the development of the RMI audit standard  in  order  to  facilitate  member  collaboration  and effectively deploy the collective actions necessary in cooperation  with  local  authorities.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  supports  the establishment  of  a  price  calculated  using  the  living  wage approach in addition  to  diversified  income  contributing  to  a more resilient living conditions.\n\nTo  complete  this  approach,  L'Or\u00e9al  requires  that  its  suppliers have their own due diligence process in place on their scope of supply of Indian mica. In 2020, 99% of Indian mica used in the  Group's  formulas  came  from  suppliers  committed  to obtaining their supply from verified sources.\n\n## 3.4.4.2. Risks and Applicable Rules to prevent serious adverse impacts on and Safety in the workplace and the Environment\n\n## Analysis of Risks to the Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace\n\nThe analysis risks to the Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace  covers  generic  risks  related  to  industrial  activities and specific risks related to the own activities of the Suppliers and Subsidiaries.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "## Generic risk analysis process\n\nAs is the case for any production (manufacture and filing and packing),  distribution,  research  and  general  administration operations, the Group and its Suppliers are exposed to safety and environmental challenges.\n\nBased on the risk prevention work on the Environment, Health and Safety at the workplace carried out by L'Or\u00e9al for many years, the major risks listed below have been identified. On this basis,  the  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  must  define  at  each  of their sites, the measures designed to prevent the risks identified in this Vigilance Plan (the 'Prevention System').\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Subsidiaries\n\nThe Subsidiaries  conduct their own risk analysis based on the list of risks below, particularly the fire risk that is framed by very strict fire prevention  standards  (National  Fire  Protection Association standard).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  generic  risks,  the  subsidiaries  identify  the specific  risks  related  in  particular  to  cosmetics  production. Thus,  for  example,  the  physical  risks  are  the  subject  of  SHAP ( Safety Hazards Assessment Procedure )  studies, which identify the  dangers,  generally  and  for  each  workstation,  assess  the risks and allow the implementation of the necessary means of control.  Environmental  risks  are  also  analysed  to  characterise the aspects and impacts of the site on its environment, and to control  those  that  lead  to  potentially  serious  impacts,  or  the risks  of  process  safety  are  analysed  using  the  HAZOP (Hazard and  Operability  analysis)  guide,  which  focuses  on  operating conditions,  or  FMECA  (Failure  Mode,  Effects  and  Criticality Analysis), which analyses risks related to failures in the process at the different steps in production.\n\nThe results and means for controlling industrial and specific risks are summarised in the GHAP (General Hazardous Assessment Procedure) programme.\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Suppliers\n\nSuppliers,  in  addition  to  their  own  risk  analysis,  rely  at  a minimum on the risks  identified  in  the  audit  grid  provided  by L'Or\u00e9al at the signing of the Letter of Ethical Commitment (see section  4.3.1.3.  'Fighting  climate  change  and  preserving natural  resources'  of  this  document)  in  order  to  implement preventive means adapted to each site concerned. This grid was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  list  of  the  major  risks described below and is applied during referencing and followup audits.\n\nIf the  specific  nature  of  the  Suppliers'  activity  requires identification  of  specific  risks  and/or  additional  prevention measures, the Suppliers are required to roll out these additional measures in accordance with best practices in their industry.\n\nFor example,  in  the  activity  of  subcontracting  finished products, the specific risks may involve the use of certain raw materials,  electrical  machines  or  electrical  equipment  in manufacturing or storage areas, handling operations that can cause accidents involving bodily injury, wastewater treatment, etc.\n\nIn  the  specific  case  of  subcontracting  suppliers  of  aerosol production or storage, bleaching powders, flammable products,  the  sites  are  subject  to  specific  risks  analyses  on process safety.\n\n## Risks identified in the Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n## Risks of serious adverse impacts to Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n- (i) Risks associated with buildings and the use of equipment:\n- \u00b7 the soundness of buildings (construction and interior fittings, including  the  compliance  of  equipment  with  operating authorisations and  building permits issued by local authorities  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  legislation and, in any event, adaptation to the activity for which the buildings are intended);\n- \u00b7 use  of  motorised  forklift  trucks  and  Automatic  Guided Vehicles (AGV): risks caused by interactions and interference between forklift trucks, AGVs and pedestrians; and\n- \u00b7 injuries caused  by  interactions  between  humans  and machines:  risks  related  to  access  to  the  moving  parts  of work equipment.\n- (ii) Risks related to energy sources, matter and materials:\n- \u00b7 exposure to energy sources, fluids and hazardous emissions including  electricity,  high  pressure,  steam,  vapour,  hot water and high temperatures;\n- \u00b7 fires resulting,  notably,  from  flammable  products  and materials or electrical installations;\n- \u00b7 exposure  to  hazardous  dust  and  chemical  products:  by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact; and\n- \u00b7 exposure to high noise levels.\n- (iii) Risks related to human activities:\n- \u00b7 entry in confined spaces and/or the risk of anoxia;\n- \u00b7 isolated  work:  risks  associated  with  working  alone  for  long periods of time;\n- \u00b7 slipping and falls;\n- \u00b7 ergonomics of workstations related to load handling;\n- \u00b7 construction  work  (risks  for  the  employees  of  Subsidiaries and Suppliers during construction work); and\n- \u00b7 work  at  heights  (risk  of  falls  associated  with  the  use  of ladders  and  step  stools,  access  to  and  work  on  platforms and roofs, use of lift tables and scaffolding, etc.).",

Applicable rules to prevent risks of serious adverse impacts on the Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n## EHS Referential\n\nThe Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy aims to minimise the impact on the environment and guarantee the health  and  safety  of  the  employees  of  its  Subsidiaries  and Suppliers, its customers and the communities in which L'Or\u00e9al carries out its activities.\n\nThis  policy  is  built  on  an  EHS  management system composed of standards with stringent requirements that set the principles of  L'Or\u00e9al's  EHS  policy,  internally  with  its  Subsidiaries  and externally  with  its  Suppliers,  which  is  all  included  in  the  EHS referential and purchasing referential.\n\nWhen local laws and/or the internal  rules  of  Subsidiaries  and Suppliers  stipulate  more  stringent  standards  than  what  is defined in these referentials, such rules must take precedence.\n\n## Additional Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace actions\n\nIn addition to the actions resulting from the risk analysis on the activities  of  the  Group  and  the  Suppliers,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts actions on Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace in addition  to  those  implemented  in  the  context  of  the  law  on the  Duty  of  Vigilance,  which  are  described  in  Chapter  4 'Corporate Social Responsibility' of this document.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  in the  workplace  is  supported  at  the  highest  level  of  the Company  by  its  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  who renews  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  the  United  Nations  Global Compact each year.\n\nFor example, this includes the following additional actions and commitments:\n\n- \u00b7 in 2017, L'Or\u00e9al joined the Science  Based  Targets programme,  an  initiative  of  the  CDP,  the  United  Nations Global  Compact,  the  World  Resources  Institute  and  the NGO WWF;\n- \u00b7 in 2018, L'Or\u00e9al became a   partner  of  the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and, with Act4Nature, in the context of individual commitments, L'Or\u00e9al set biodiversity objectives for 2030;\n- \u00b7 in  2019, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the first companies to sign the Business  Ambition  for  1.5\u00b0  C  pledge  of  the  UN  Global Compact,  thereby  committing to reach 'zero net emissions' by 2050 over its entire value chain, in accordance with the 1.5\u00b0 C path of the IPCC; and\n- \u00b7 in  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  became  a  signatory  of  the  Task  Force  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## (i) Additional actions intended for Sites of Subsidiaries\n\nAt  its  own  sites,  L'Or\u00e9al  implements  the  LIFE  (Life  threatening Incident or Fatality Event) programme, which covers activities on all its sites that, if not controlled, could result in potentially serious injury and illness. Over time the Group is prolonging the ambition of moving towards 'zero accidents' by ensuring the sustainability of actions and defining the requirements in terms of preparing for emergencies following an incident.\n\nMoreover, the Sharing Beauty with All programme is intended, by the end of 2020, to reduce the environmental footprint of the  Group's  sites,  particularly  through  the  definition  and dissemination of best practices in energy efficiency, reduction of  CO2  emissions,  the  preservation  of  water,  biodiversity  and resources, and waste reduction and treatment (the assessment  of  the  programme  is  presented  in  Chapter  4 'L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility' of this document, in particular in the table provided in section 4.4. 'Sharing Beauty with  All:  2020  Results').  The  new  commitments  made  by  the Group  for  2030  in  the  context  of  its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme demonstrate an ambition all the greater as they aim at guaranteeing the compatibility of the Group's activities with a  planet  with  limited  resources  (see  section  4.1 'Introduction' of Chapter 4).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  also  commited  to  no  longer  send  waste  to  landfills and to reduce the footprint from transportation of its products.\n\nIn the context of ongoing improvement of its EHS performance, the Group has committed to an ISO certification process  on  its  sites  in  order  to  permanently  anchor  the  EHS policy on its industrial sites: ISO 45001 for the management of employee health and safety and improvement in their working conditions;  ISO  14001  for  the  management  of  environmental impacts  and  improvement  in  environmental  performance; and  ISO  50001  for  energy  management  and  performance improvement.\n\nDetailed information on these additional actions is available in Chapter  4  'L'Or\u00e9al's  Corporate  Social  Responsibility'  of  this document.\n\n## (ii) Additional actions intended for Suppliers\n\nThe Purchasing teams select the most competitive suppliers in accordance  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Buy  &  Care  responsible purchasing  policy.  The  EHS  performance  of  Suppliers  is managed by monitoring indicators included in the corporate social responsibility criterion, which is one of the five criteria for monitoring supplier performance.\n\nParticular  attention  is  paid  to  palm  oil.  In  the  context  of  its 'Zero  Deforestation'  commitment,  L'Or\u00e9al  developed  the Sustainable  Palm  Index  (SPI),  a  tool  to  evaluate  and  select suppliers of palm oil and palm kernel derivatives to assess the level of commitment, progress and achievements of its direct suppliers  in  favour  of  sustainable  palm  oil.  This  tool  is  used annually  to  evaluate  suppliers'  progress  towards  the  Zero Deforestation objective and their level of compliance with the Group's requirements.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "The  specific  feature  of  the  Sustainable  Palm  Index  lies  in  its integration  in  the  purchasing  decision  process.  A  supplier  in compliance  with  the  SPI  will  benefit  from  an  allocation  of volumes,  long-term  contracts,  and  will  be  favoured  in  the context of partnerships in land projects.\n\nIn 2019, L'Or\u00e9al co-founded  the  collective  Action  for Sustainable  Derivatives  initiative  in  order  to  share  knowledge and  methods  with  other  operators  to  encourage  the production and responsible supply of palm oil derivatives.\n\n## 3.4.5. Effective application and compliance with the Vigilance Plan\n\nThe  Vigilance  Plan  includes  effective  application  measures intended  to  ensure  the  correct  implementation  of  the Applicable Rules by the Subsidiaries and Suppliers. Monitoring of compliance with the Plan is carried out through audits and analyses performed by external service providers or by Group teams. In addition, the Subsidiaries and Suppliers are asked to carry out self-assessments.\n\n## 3.4.5.1. Effective application of the Vigilance Plan\n\n## Adoption of Applicable Rules\n\n## (i) Adoption of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries\n\nThe effective implementation of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries  is  achieved  through  their  incorporation  in  the Group's Internal  Rules.  For  this  purpose,  compliance  with  the effective application of the Plan is based on control activities in accordance with the applicable legislation.\n\nThe communication of Applicable Rules to Group employees is described below.\n\n## (ii) Adoption of Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\nSuppliers  undertake  to  comply  with  the  Applicable  Rules.  In particular,  the  principal  Suppliers  sign  the  Letter  of  Ethical Commitment  that  covers  these  applicable  Rules.  Moreover, the  Suppliers  that  could  present  the  most  significant  risks because  of  their  activity  or  geographic  location  may  be audited on these issues in accordance with the Risk Matrix. The contents  of  the  points  that  will  be  audited  is  set  forth  in  the Letter of Ethical Commitment.\n\n## Governance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of people in the workplace and the environment is supported at the highest level of the Company  by  its  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  who renews  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  the  United  Nations  Global Compact each year. These commitments are also indicated in the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  and  the  Human  Rights  and Employee Human Rights Policy.\n\n## (i) Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms governance\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer,  a  member  of  the Executive Committee, is responsible for overseeing the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Group. This mission has been entrusted to her by L'Or\u00e9al's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to whom she reports.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer has a budget and a dedicated  team  composed  of  experts  in  Human  Rights.  She relies on all the Group's teams and resources to carry out her work.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee, chaired by the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer and composed of representatives of the various  activities,  functions  and  geographic  areas  (including Purchasing, HR, CSR, Safety, Security, etc.), allows coordination and exchange on the implementation of the Group's Human Rights policy. Its primary objective is to enable the emergence of a human rights culture within the Group.\n\nCountry  Managers  (or  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report)  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Human Resources teams are responsible for ensuring that the  activities  of  the  Subsidiaries  respect  employees'  human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nEmployees may  contact  their manager,  their Human Resources  Director,  their  Legal  Director,  their  Purchasing Director,  their  Human  Rights  Correspondent,  their  Ethics Correspondent and, ultimately, the Chief Ethics Officer if they have  any  questions  about  compliance  with  the  Applicable Rules.\n\nThe  Purchasing  teams  ensure  that  Supplier  activities  respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Suppliers included in the  Risk  Matrix  are  not  listed  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  Supplier  database until  they  have  contractually  committed  to  comply  with  the Applicable Rules. Purchasing teams discuss, during Management Committee meetings that include representatives  from  all  Zones  and  purchasing  areas,  the results of audits, their consequences for commercial relations, and  the  related  actions  plans  to  achieve  continuous improvement of results at the Group's Suppliers.\n\n## (ii) Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace governance\n\nThe  Executive  Vice-President  of  Operations,  reporting  to  the Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a member of  the  Executive  Committee,  is  responsible  for  the  general policy to prevent serious adverse impacts on the environment, and health and safety. The implementation of this policy is the responsibility of the Group's Subsidiaries and Sites.",

Their remuneration is partly linked to their performance in the areas of the environment, health and safety in the workplace;\n- \u00b7 EHS  managers  are  managers  trained  and  dedicated  to compliance with the EHS policy who  ensure the deployment  of  the  rules,  procedures  and  associated performance  objectives  of  the  Group  in  all  of  its  entities; and\n- \u00b7 country  Operations  Directors  who  are  responsible  for, among other things, compliance with the EHS policy by the distribution  centres,  the  administrative  Sites  and  stores  in their country.\n\nIn addition, the Purchasing teams are responsible for collecting confirmation  of  acceptance  of  Applicable  Rules  from  the Suppliers via their Letter of Ethical Commitment.\n\nThe  Purchasing  teams  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that Suppliers included in the Risk Matrix implement the prevention measures  for  EHS  risks  via  control  audits  carried  out  by  thirdparty companies. As for Human Rights, the Purchasing teams discuss, during Management  Committee  meetings  that include representatives from all  Zones  and  purchasing  areas, the  results  of  audits,  their  consequences  for  commercial relations, and the related actions plans to achieve continuous improvement of results at the Group's Suppliers.\n\n## Communication and training\n\nCommunication  of  the  Applicable  Rules  and  training  of  the teams involved complete and support the effective application  of  the  measures  set  out  in  the  Vigilance  Plan  by L'Or\u00e9al's Subsidiaries and Suppliers.\n\n## (i) Communication on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\nHuman Resources teams are informed of the Applicable Rules by their line manager.\n\nIn addition, all new Group employees must receive a hard or electronic  copy  of  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  and  must confirm that they have read it. Employees must be reminded of the Code of Ethics and its contents on a regular basis.\n\nIn  addition,  any  employee  in  contact  with  Suppliers  must receive the 'The Way We Buy' guide when they are hired. It explains ethical standards which apply to Supplier relations.\n\nAn Ethics intranet site is available to employees.\n\nAn annual Ethics Day, including Human Rights, has been held since 2009. This day enables employees to discuss matters such as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms via a webchat with L'Or\u00e9al's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and  the  other  members  of  the  Executive  Committee. Discussions  on  ethics  are  also  organised  in  the  Subsidiaries  to let  employees  exchange conversations with their  Subsidiary's General Manager.\n\nIn 2020, the Ethics Day participation was close to 70% and over 8,900 questions were asked.\n\nOn  10  December  2020,  to  celebrate  the  UN  International Human Rights Day, the Group launched a training campaign on Human Rights for the second consecutive year to increase employee  awareness  on  this  issue.  On  this  occasion,  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer addressed all employees  and  restated  the  importance  of  the  Group's commitment.  This  campaign  is  intended  to  strengthen  the Group's  Human  Rights  culture,  and  highlights  the  specific advances made on these issues.\n\nWith respect to Suppliers, in addition to the communication of Applicable  Rules  via  the  Letters  of  Ethical  Commitment,  a website  has  been  provided  to  strategic  Suppliers  (Class  A Suppliers  as  defined  in  section  3.4.5.2.1.  'Risk  hierarchy  of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules' of this document) of  raw  materials,  packaging  and  subcontractors  of  finished products. The site contains the following documents:\n\n- \u00b7 Code of Ethics; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's  policy  on  Suppliers/subcontractors  and  child labour.\n\n## (ii) Training on human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nThere  is  a  specific,  compulsory  e-learning  course  on  ethics covering human rights and fundamental freedoms issues.\n\nIn addition,  new  buyers  receive  compulsory  training  on Responsible Purchasing to learn about how to ensure respect of the Group's Ethical Principles.\n\nAn  e-learning  course  on  Supplier  audits,  detailing  the applicable audit procedure, is also available for all buyers. A Suppliers  version  is  available  on  the  same  website  as  the above  information.  There  is  also  an  e-learning  course available: Ethics e-learning for business partners.\n\n## (iii) Communication on the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) in the workplace\n\nEHS  managers  are  informed  of  the  Applicable  Rules  by  their functional hierarchy.\n\nEvery Group Site must hold a day dedicated to EHS, once a year, to raise the awareness among all employees about the risks  to  which  they  are  exposed  and  suitable  prevention,  in addition to specific local actions.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  environment,  a  sustainable  development week  organised  each  year  at  the  sites  is  punctuated  by different events involving many employees.\n\nIn addition, a Group awareness-raising campaign about major safety risks, deployed over three years, and the implementation of a specific topic every four months, serve to develop employee awareness of risks over time.\n\nA monthly newsletter for the Group's EHS managers and their team leaders enables performance tracking and the sharing of best EHS practices.\n\nAn annual progress report focused on the Sharing Beauty with All programme  reports  on  the  reduction  of  L'Or\u00e9al's environmental footprint year after year.\n\n3",

They  constitute  one  of  the  cornerstones  in  the implementation  of risk identification and  management systems,  and  the  deployment  of  the  EHS  culture  in  all  Group entities.\n\nEHS training includes the various training actions for health and safety  in  the  workplace,  or  the  environment  and  covers general EHS training, EHS training by business line and specific EHS training.\n\nGeneral EHS training includes:\n\n- \u00b7 core general training completed, for example, when a new employee  arrives  at  a  Site  (L'Or\u00e9al  employee  or  temporary staff) regardless of their position; and\n- \u00b7  fire  safety  training,  first  aid,  pollution  prevention,  recycling, general EHS awareness raising, etc.\n\nEHS business training refers to training specific to a given m\u00e9tier area or activity  (for  example,  all  of  the  packaging  staff  of  a plant).\n\nSpecific  EHS  training  refers  to  EHS  training  for  a  particular workstation and the activities carried out by the employee.\n\nIn terms of ergonomics, a 'manual handling' e-learning course is provided to all employees.\n\nLastly,  a  high  level  of  expertise  for  global  EHS  Teams and the development of an EHS culture for 'Top managers', managers and  supervisors  is  assured  via  the  deployment  of  training specific to each person.\n\n## 3.4.5.2. Monitoring compliance with the Plan\n\n## Risk hierarchy of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules\n\nThe risk hierarchy is used to enhance controls on compliance with the Applicable  Rules  by  defining  procedures  for monitoring compliance with the Rules that are adapted to the risks,  including  a  policy  of  third-party  audits.  Other  means  of control  are  also  used,  such  as  monitoring  and  evaluation  of Suppliers conducted  by  third-party  companies  such  as Ecovadis.\n\nWith  respect  to  the  Subsidiaries,  the  risk  hierarchy  of  noncompliance with the Applicable Rules was created taking into account  the  type  of  activity  (administrative,  manufacturing, warehousing, etc.) and, thereafter, the type of Site (administrative  offices,  plants,  distribution  centres,  research centres, etc.).\n\nWith respect to Suppliers, the risk mapping of non-compliance with  the  Applicable  Rules  was  created  for  Human  Rights, Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  environment,  and  health  and safety  in  the  workplace  using  a  methodology  that  takes  the following parameters into account:\n\n- \u00b7 The  country  in  which  the  Supplier's  sites  are  located:  a country is  considered  vulnerable  in  terms  of  Human  Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and environment, health and safety, if it meets at least one of the following criteria:\n- 1.  The  country  is  classified  as  'High  risk'  or  'Extreme  risk' according  to  the  criteria  of  the  consultancy  firm  Verisk Maplecroft: 12 evaluation indices are used in this methodology and aggregated in a single grade compared with the threshold values set by Verisk Maplecroft;\n- 2.  The  results  of  social  audits  conducted  by  L'Or\u00e9al  in  the country include cases of Zero Tolerance or Need Immediate  Action  ('NIA'  rating  that  corresponds  to  the most severe compliance failures); and\n- 3.  L'Or\u00e9al's  internal  experts  or  partners  ( e.g. Ecovadis) recommend that the country be considered for auditing.\n- \u00b7 Business  sector:  each  Supplier  is  associated  with  a  sector area  according  to a  governance  ranking  of  Purchases ('Global Purchasing Categories').\n- \u00b7 The  nature  of  operations:  the  activities  most  heavily exposed  to  labour  risk  are  the  activities  with  high  manual added value, implying work on a production line.",

        "page_content": "## Audit and self-assessment system\n\n## (i) Audits\n\n## Audits of Applicable Rules\n\nAudits  of  Applicable  Rules  are  used  to  check  that  the Vigilance  Plan  is  correctly  implemented  by  the  Subsidiaries and Suppliers included in the Risk Matrix.\n\nAudits are done by specialist external companies.\n\nWhen a Subsidiary or Supplier is audited, the process is carried out in accordance  with  the  Risk  Matrix  described  in section  3.4.5.2.1.  'Risk  hierarchy  of  non-compliance  with  the Applicable  Rules'  of  this  document.  A  written  audit  report is prepared.\n\nWith  respect  to  the  Subsidiaries,  the  reports  are  stored  in  a secure  database  available  to  Group  Human  Resources Directors  and  to  the  Country  Operations  Directors,  in  some cases. The reports on Suppliers are intended for Group buyers.\n\n## There are three types of audits:\n\n- \u00b7 initial audits (first audits conducted) are a prerequisite to the start of the relationship with a new Supplier;\n- \u00b7 follow-up  audits  (audits  done  12  to  24  months  maximum after the immediate improvement request (Needs Immediate Action or NIA), depending on the severity of the non-conformities found); and\n- \u00b7 confirmation audits, three years after the initial audit.\n\n## The possible outcomes of the audits are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Satisfactory: all criteria conform to the Applicable Rules and the best practices are highlighted;\n- \u00b7 Needs  Continuous  Improvement: minor  non-conformities were found, but they do not have an impact on employee safety or health;\n- \u00b7 Needs  Immediate  Action :  non-conformities  are  reported either because they are serious, because they are recurring or  because  they  have  a  potential  impact  on  the  health and safety of employees;\n- \u00b7 Zero  Tolerance :  reported,  for  example,  in  the  event  of  a critical  non-conformity  because  of  child  labour,  forced labour,  physical  abuse,  restricted  freedom  of  movement, an immediate risk of accident for employees or attempted bribery of the auditors; and\n- \u00b7 Access  Denied: reported  when  the  audit  is  refused  (for example in the event of refusal to provide partial or full site access to the auditors).\n\nIn the  event  of  a  non-compliance  (Needs  Continuous Improvement,  Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero  Tolerance), corrective action plans must be implemented which are then audited at the level of the Subsidiary or Supplier.\n\nFailure to implement a corrective action plan can, in the case of  a  Subsidiary,  result  in  an  alert  being  sent  to  the  Country Manager. In addition, Subsidiaries can decide to link part or all of  the  remuneration  of  their  managers  and/or  of  their performance  evaluation  to  the  implementation  of  the Applicable Rules.\n\nIn  the  case  of  Suppliers,  serious  non-conformities  (Needs Immediate Action, Zero Tolerance and Access Denied) or the failure  to  implement  corrective  action  can  result  in  the  nonlisting  of a  new  Supplier  or  the  suspension  or  termination  of commercial relations with a listed Supplier.\n\nIn the event that the existence of a serious non-conformity with the  Applicable  Rules  is  reported,  a  specific  audit  can beinitiated. In particular, visit reports are issued as part of the process  of  routine  visits  made  to  Suppliers.  They  can  result,  if necessary, in additional audits.\n\n## EHS audits specific to Subsidiaries\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with the Group's EHS policy, a system of  worldwide  audits  has  been  set  up  since  1996,  and was reinforced in 2001 with the presence of external auditors, who  are  experts  in  the  local  context  and  regulations.  These audits  take  place  regularly  on  each  L'Or\u00e9al  site:  every  three years for production sites and every four years for distribution centres, administrative sites and research centres. If the result of  the  audit  does  not  meet  the  standard  required  by  the L'Or\u00e9al  benchmarks, a specific  interim  audit  is  scheduled  for the  following  year.  Every  year,  the  teams  responsible  for  EHS risks review the audit results and identify general improvement plans. The improvement plans specific to the audited Sites are established immediately after the end of the audit. In addition, any  emergency  measure  intended  to  prevent  an  imminent risk for the health of persons at the Site is implemented by the Site EHS teams without waiting for the completion of an audit even if it is not part of the improvement plan that may exist.\n\nThere  are  various  audit  grids  called  'risk',  'culture',  or 'combined risk and culture', used depending on the maturity and type of activity at the Sites. They assess in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of practices and facilities with the Group's rules and procedures;\n- \u00b7 progress in terms of EHS performance;\n- \u00b7 any risks that the sites may present from an EHS standpoint; and\n- \u00b7 the  level  of  management  and  deployment  of  EHS  culture on the Sites.\n\nEach risk finding is classified in one of three categories A, B and C  according  to  a  matrix  of  level  of  impact/probability  of occurrence. 'A' findings are monitored monthly and consolidated annually by risk type.\n\nThe monthly reporting of safety and environmental data also enables  consolidation  and  analysis  of  any  anomalies  and incidents  leading  to  regulatory  non-compliance,  complaints and/or fines.\n\n## Specific EHS audits of subcontractor sites\n\nAdditional specific EHS audits are conducted by independent third  parties  for  subcontractor  sites  for  aerosol  production  or storage,  bleaching  powders,  flammable  products  under  the criteria defined by L'Or\u00e9al, which are similar to those used for the  Group's  sites.  These  audits  are  triggered  at  the  time  of referencing/qualification, follow-up (audits conducted between  12  months  and  36  months  maximum  after  the immediate  improvement  request  (NIA),  depending  on  the severity of the non-conformities found); and again at the time of confirmation, 5 years after the initial audit.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  are  the  same  type  as  those previously described: satisfactory, NCI, NIA and ZT.\n\nSerious  non-conformities  (Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero Tolerance  and  Access  Denied)  or  the  failure  to  implement corrective actions can result in the non-listing of a new Supplier or  the  suspension  or  termination  of  commercial  relations  with a listed Supplier.\n\nAll the  main  non-conformities  found  are  monitored  and consolidated annually by risk type.\n\nIn the event that the existence of a serious non-conformity with the  Applicable  Rules  is  reported,  a  specific  audit  can  be initiated.  In  particular,  visit  reports  are  issued  as  part  of  the process  of  routine  visits  made  to  Suppliers.  They  can  result, if necessary, in additional audits.",

        "page_content": "## Additional procedures\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also uses analyses and ratings provided by Ecovadis, an analytical company, to evaluate the policies implemented by the Suppliers, among others, in terms of the issues covered by  the  Vigilance  Plan.  This  evaluation  is  an  indicative  guide that can be added to the audits described above.\n\nBy participating in the ECOVADIS  assessment,  L'Or\u00e9al compares its environmental and social policy with the experts and the recommendations of external auditors qualified in the analysis  of  multi-sector  risks.  This  is a  useful  rating  for  ongoing improvement  in  our  programme,  but  its  also  contributes  to transparency  in  the  practices  of  industries.  This  assessment  is used  to  select  suppliers  by  taking  their  environmental  and social performance into consideration.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a co-founder of the Responsible Beauty Initiative (RBI),  a  sector  initiative  created  in  2017  with  ECOVADIS  that brings  together seven major players in the cosmetics industry for  the  sustainable  transformation of the entire Beauty supply chain.\n\n## (ii) Self-assessment system\n\n## Human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAn annual ethics  reporting  system  enables  monitoring  of  the implementation  of  the  Applicable  Rules  in  the  Subsidiaries, namely  with  regard  to  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms.\n\n## Environment, health and safety in the workplace\n\nThe  Management  Committees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Sites  have  selfassessment  tools  for  their  practices  based  on  the  audit standards  provided  to  them,  which  enables  them  to implement  an  improvement  plan,  if  required.  These  selfassessments are input data in the EHS risk audits.\n\nTo direct its performance:\n\nEvery  year,  each  Subsidiary  site  defines  and  revises  its  safety and  environmental  roadmaps  to  achieve  the  targets  set  by the Group. It tracks EHS indicators monthly.\n\nAt  Group  level,  the  indicators  are  consolidated  monthly  by region and globally for the Group's results.\n\nAnnually,  a  Greenhouse  Gas  Assessment  is  established (pursuant to the GHG Protocol).\n\n## 3.4.6. Whistleblowing mechanism and reporting system\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  'Speak  Up'  policy  enables  employees  and  external  stakeholders  to  report  serious  violations  of  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms, non-compliance of rules relating  to  the  health  and  safety  of  people  and  respect  for  the  environment, notably via a secure website (ethics whistleblowing channel) directly to the Chief Ethics Officer.\n\n## 3.4.7. Update on the effective implementation of the Vigilance Plan\n\nThis section provides the 2020 results of the application of the Vigilance Plan for Subsidiaries and Suppliers.\n\n## 3.4.7.1. General results of whistleblowing mechanisms and reporting\n\nThe Group's ethics whistle-blowing line (www.lorealspeakup.com) was  opened  in  2008,  and  then  to  all  stakeholders  outside  the Group,  including  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  in  2018.  A  new procedure  to  collect  and  handle  reports  was  published.  In addition,  Employees  can  use  several  other  channels  to  raise their concerns (hierarchical line, dedicated local lines, etc.).\n\nIn  2020,  there  were  536  reports  on  potential  non-compliance with the Applicable Rules, including:\n\n- \u00b7 31 on sexual harassment, 18 of which were proven, in whole or  in  part,  and  which  resulted  in  7  departures  from  the Group;\n- \u00b7 96 on bullying, 22 of which were proven, in whole or in part, and which resulted in 6 departures from the Group;\n- \u00b7 75 on discrimination, 16 of which were proven, in whole or in part, which resulted in one departure from the Group;\n- \u00b7 42 on health and safety, 8 of which were proven, in whole or  in  part,  which  did  not  result  in  a  departure  from  the Group; and\n- \u00b7 none on environmental issues.\n\n## 3.4.7.2. Results of the application of the plan to Subsidiaries\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by the Subsidiaries\n\nThe  Applicable  Rules  are  incorporated  into  the  Group's Subsidiaries' internal rules.\n\n94%  of  employees  individually  acknowledged  the  receipt  of the Code of Ethics and 76% of employees have been trained using an e-learning training tool on ethics.\n\nEach  EHS  manager  and  each  person  working  in  a  plant  or distribution centre is trained in the Applicable Rules on Health, Safety  and  the  Environment  (EHS).  All  new  employees  are trained in the Rules on Health and Safety in the workplace and the Environment, regardless of their work location.\n\n## Monitoring and control system in respect of Human Rights\n\nTwo audits were conducted within Group owned plants and distribution centres, covering all the Rules on Human Rights.\n\n(i) Child  labour: none  of  the  audits  revealed  any  noncompliance of employment of a child under the age of 16.\n\n3",

This was an employee who had worked ten consecutive days without a day off.\n- (vi) Salaries and costs: the audits did not reveal any cases of non-compliance.\n- (vii) Sexual and psychological harassment: the audits did not reveal any cases of non-compliance.\n\n(viii) Health and safety: the audits did not reveal any cases of non-compliance.\n\n## Monitoring and control system in respect of Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nIn  2020, because of the Covid-19 health crisis, only 13 (versus 63 in 2019) 'top managers' (managers of plants or distribution centres,  Management  Committee  members  etc.)  attended the  Leadership  &  Safety  Culture  seminar,  held  at  the  CEDEP, the  European  Centre  for  Executive  Development  at  the INSEAD campus in France. Since the start of this programme, 586 senior managers have been trained. The main objectives of  these  seminars  are  to  raise  awareness  with  top  managers about  safety  issues,  increase  their  leadership  ability  and  see these  behaviours  adopted  and  maintained  over  the  long term.\n\n34 plants are certified OSHAS  18001, or equivalent, representing 87% of the Group's plants.\n\n33  plants  are  certified  ISO  14001,  representing  85%  of  the Group's plants.\n\nIn 2020, in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis, only three combined risk and EHS culture audits were performed on site.\n\nThe  most  frequently  identified  risks  during  EHS  risk  audits  are related  to  fire protection,  procedure  safety,  hazardous energies,  containment  of  fire  water  runoff  and  effluent management.  The  cases  of  non-compliance  and  formal notice were systematically subject to corrective actions.\n\nThere were five neighbourhood complaints in 2020: two plants were  the  subject  of  a  complaint  about  the  release  of  a nauseating  odour  due  to a   one-off  malfunction  of  the installations;  one  distribution  centre  was  the  subject  of  a complaint because of the disturbance caused by a delivery truck that blocked access to the neighbouring company; one administrative site and one research centre were the subject of complaints about noise nuisances: one due to inappropriate  use  of  the  speaker  system  and  the  other because of defective operation of an air extraction motor. All these cases resulted in effective corrective action.\n\nThere  were  6  cases  of  non-compliance  with  environmental regulations notified by an administrative authority in 2020. They cover one notification about a non-finalised administrative file, three  notifications  about  the  quality  of  effluents  and,  finally, two  notifications  on  the  need  to  adapt  some  of  the  Group's facilities.  The  formal  notices  were  the  subject  of  immediate or scheduled corrective actions over the first half of 2021.\n\nA fine was levied in 2020 (United States) in the amount of $US 1, 000  following  a  sampling  taken  at  the  outlet  of  the  site  to evaluate  the  potential  foam  rate.  The  result  required  an adaptation  of  the  quantity  of  anti-foam  introduced  at  the wastewater  treatment  plant  so  that  the  situation  is  not repeated.\n\n## 3.4.7.3. Results of the application of the plan to suppliers\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\n100%  of  strategic  Suppliers  are  contractually  committed  to comply with the Applicable Rules.\n\nAll  purchasers  know  the  Applicable  Rules  and  know  which people to contact in the event of doubts.\n\nIn  2020,  59  newly recruited purchasers in the Group received in-depth training in responsible purchases.\n\n## Monitoring and control system\n\nThe  Applicable  Rules  are  controlled  through  external  audits. These  audits  cover  questions  on  Human  Rights  as  well  as Environment, Health and Safety and cover all activities of the audited Site without being limited to the parts of the Site that operate for L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n1,268 on-site audits were conducted in 2020, as part of regular audits, but also ad hoc audits  following  a  risk  analysis  (45 ad hoc audits  in  2020) (2) .  Thus,  96%  of  Supplier  production  sites requiring audits were audited at least once.\n\nThe cases of non-compliance noted during these social audits that come under the Vigilance Plan are described below.",

        "page_content": "## In terms of Human Rights\n\n## Results of audits by topic\n\n## (i) Child labour : 1.6% non-compliance.\n\nNo audits found employment of a child under the age of 16. Cases  of  non-compliance  were  found  in  the  area  of  'Child Labour',  particularly  concerning  the  absence  of  procedures to  verify  age  at  the  time  of  hiring  by  the  Supplier,  and  the absence  of  copies  of  identity  documents.  The  Suppliers concerned  have  been  asked  to  correct  this  situation,  and follow-up audits are planned.\n\n## (ii) Forced labour: 6% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nMost  cases  of  non-compliance  concern  the  demand  for  a monetary deposit at the time of hiring, withholding of identity documents  without  a  legal  requirement,  as  well  as  the freedom for  employees  to  end  their  contracts  without  being penalised (financially or other) except for those stipulated by social  legislation.  The  main  corrective  measures  requested were the return of the identity documents and the updating of employee contracts. Follow-up audits will check the effective implementation of these corrective measures.\n\n## (iii) Freedom of association (1) : 2.7% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nMost  of  the  cases  of  non-compliance  concern  the  failure  to freely  elect  employee  representatives  without  management interference.  Elections  must  be  carried  out,  or  in  countries where such elections are not legal, employee meetings must be organised to report items to be improved.\n\n## (iv) Non-discrimination : 1.3% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nThese cases of non-compliance mainly concern the absence of a   clear  and  uniform  policy  to  ensure  the  absence  of discrimination at recruitment or discrimination in the payment of wages and other costs.\n\nSuppliers  were  requested  to  implement  such  policies,  which will be checked in future audits.\n\n## (v) Working hours: 23% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nCases of non-compliance involved failure to comply with the Applicable Rules for work time and regular days off, but also the lack of sufficient documents to ensure correct monitoring of the Applicable Rules. In all of these cases, action plans are implemented and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\nVigilance Plan\n\n## (vi) Wages and charges : 19% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nThe audits did not find undue salary withholding or charges.\n\nMost of the cases of non-compliance concerned insurance and social contributions as well as a failure to monitor payments of wages. When an audit notes a case of non-compliance with regard to the correct settlement of wages, social benefits or the correct  payment  of  overtime,  even  though  these  are  not undue salary deductions, the Suppliers are requested to correct the situation and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\n## (vi) Sexual harassment and bullying: 2.7% non-compliance.\n\nMost  of  these  cases  of  non-compliance  concerned  the absence of a written policy prohibiting sexual harassment and bullying  or  the  absence  of  an  internal  system  allowing  the situation  to  be  reported  without  negative  consequences  for the employee concerned.\n\nSuppliers were requested to draft these policies, which will be checked in future audits.\n\nThe  other  cases  of  non-compliance  did  not  concern  serious breaches of the Applicable Rules.\n\n## Health, Safety and the Environment\n\n41%  of  the  cases  of  non-compliance  concerned  the applicable rules on Health, Safety and the Environment.\n\nMost of these cases concerned (i) the absence of fire safety certification, (ii) the lack of training in emergency evacuation, extinguisher  handling  or  the  use  of  protection  equipment,  or (iii) access to running water flows in all spaces exposed to the use of solvents, corrosive products or other chemical risks.\n\nThe missing certifications  were  obtained  from  approved  third parties,  and  the  training  in  emergency  evacuation  and extinguisher handling were  implemented  as  the  main corrective measures. Likewise, renovations to adjust the water points were carried out by the Suppliers.\n\n3",

Definitions and general framework\n\nRisk  management  (events  or  situations,  the  occurrence  of which  is  uncertain,  could  have  a  financial,  non-financial,  or reputational impact) is a process that applies to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group').\n\nRisk management  consists  of  identifying,  assessing  and controlling  risks  that  may  affect  the  smooth  running  of  the Company. It also participates in the Group's development by promoting the good use of resources to minimise the impact of negative events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.\n\nIn order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate and  manage  the  risks  to  which  it  is  exposed  in  its  different areas of activity. In addition, the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors  specify  the  role  played  by  the  Audit  Committee which 'must ensure that General Management has the means to enable it to identify and manage the economic, financial and legal risks facing the Group inside and outside France in carrying out its normal or exceptional operations'.\n\nOn the basis of the work by the Internal Audit Department, the analysis of major risks, in conjunction with the processes used by  subsidiaries,  makes  it  possible  to  identify  Internal  Control improvements and update the Group's standards.\n\n## 3.5.2. Risk mapping\n\nThe  Group's  risk  mapping  process  is  led  by  the  Risk Management and Compliance Department with the support of  all  Support  Divisions  and  Business  lines.  This  mapping  is reviewed  by  the  Group's  Executive  Committee,  which validates it.\n\nThe  risk  mapping  for  all  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities  is  updated annually. This process to identify, analyse and assess significant risks strengthens  Group  actions  and  allows  them  to  be prioritised.  The  results  of  this  work  are  presented  to  the  Audit Committee. The main risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.\n\n## 3.5.3. Risk factors\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  changing  environment.  Like  any company, it is necessarily exposed to risks which, if they were to  materialise,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  its  business activities,  its  financial  position  and  its  assets,  particularly  in terms of reputation and image.\n\nFor taking an informed investment decision, as required by the regulations  in  force,  this  section  presents  the  major  risks  in  a limited  number  of  categories  (given  the  probability  of  their occurrence  and  the  expected  magnitude  of  their  negative impact)  taking  risk  management  policies  into  account.  In each category, the most material risks are mentioned first. This section specifies the way in which each risk factor could affect L'Or\u00e9al as well as the management policy implemented.\n\nRisk management work classifies the residual risks by category of importance (low, moderate or significant).\n\nHowever, a wholly risk-free environment cannot be guaranteed.  Moreover,  the  Group  could  be  adversely impacted  by  other  risks  of  which  it  is  not  currently  aware  or which  it  does  not  consider  material  at  the  date  of  this Document.",

Business risks\n\n## Business risks/Sanitary crisis\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nBecause of its global presence, L'Or\u00e9al is exposed to epidemics or other public sanitary crises in the 79 countries in which it operates.\n\nThe  primary  risks  identified  cover  different  segments  of  the  Group's operations:\n\n- \u25cf impairment of  the  health,  safety  and  security  of  employees  in  the context of their duties and their business travel, and confinement of the population that prevents employees from entering their work site, particularly at the manufacturing and distribution sites;\n- \u25cf difficulties  for  the  Company  to  operate  normally  because  of  the restrictive  measures  established  by  the  authorities,  which  restrict employee  access  to  the  Group's  sites,  or  as  a  result  of  the unavailability  of  individual  protective  equipment  necessary  to protect them;\n- \u25cf supply difficulties or unavailability of raw materials and components, and limited capacities to produce and distribute products related to the  restrictive  health  measures  established  by  the  authorities  of  the country in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf reductions in product demand related to the impact of the measures to restrict movement on access to physical points of sale, particularly in  the  Travel  Retail  network  that  is  particularly  sensitive  to  sanitary crises;\n- \u25cf financial  difficulties  for  suppliers  and  clients  as  a  result  of  a  drastic reduction in their levels of business.\n\nThus,  the  year  2020  was  marked  by  the  Covid-19  sanitary  crisis  that spread  around  the  world  and  continues  to  affect  a  number  of geographic regions in which the Group operates.\n\nDepending  on  its  duration,  geographic  expansions  and  the  resulting economic  and  social  consequences,  a  sanitary  crisis  may  have  a material  impact  on  the  Group's  activities,  the  achievement  of  its objectives, and its reputation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set up a crisis management process led by a unit at Group level that can prevent and limit the impacts of undesirable events on all its entities.\n\nFacing a sanitary crisis, the Group's priority is to protect the health, safety and security of its employees. The Group responds through compliance with the directives of the authorities in the countries in which it operates, the  application  and  adaptation  of  its  worldwide,  high  management standards  for  health  and  safety  at  its  operational  sites  and  in  business travel situations.\n\nThe  Group's  information  systems  allow  large-scale  development  of flexible  and  remote  work  methods  and  are  the  subject  of  adequate safety protection processes (see section 4.3.2.4. 'Creating conditions for a positive and attractive work environment' of this document).\n\nThe policies to manage supply chain and inventories, and the business continuity plans of the manufacturing and logistics sites, allow the Group to anticipate the actions necessary to manage disturbances. The longterm relations with the Group's strategic suppliers, the policies to diversify sources,  and  operational  continuity  plans  limit  the  impacts  of  these crises.\n\nThe Group's presence in all distribution channels, particularly online sales capacities developed with diversified partners (owned sites, e-retailers, pure players), as well as its expertise in digitised consumer relations, help to maximise development opportunities in disturbed contexts.\n\nFinally,  the  Group's  worldwide  and  balanced  presence  in  terms  of geographic  areas,  product  categories  and  distribution  channels,  the very  high  responsiveness  and  capacity  for  adaptation  of  its  teams through  its  strategically  concentrated  and  operationally  decentralised organisational model, as well as its robust financial position, contribute to its ability to face the economic consequences of these crises.\n\n3",

Furthermore,  in  order  to adapt  to  the  development  of  new  methods  of  communication  and collaboration, L'Or\u00e9al has introduced an Information and Communication Technologies Code of Practice. To address the growing threat  of  cybercrime,  L'Or\u00e9al  takes  continuous  steps  to  strengthen  the resources dedicated to information system security.\n\nThis plan relies in particular on anti-intrusion equipment, regular intrusion tests, an information system security audit programme, the protection of sensitive  equipment  and  global  supervision  to  identify  irregularities. L'Or\u00e9al's safety focus is constantly adjusted to deal with new threats of cyberattacks. For example, the Group is increasingly investing in systems for detecting and reacting to warnings and security incidents and in the periodic supervision of the effectiveness of such solutions.\n\nIn addition, in order to mobilise all teams, the Group conducts a global awareness  campaign  every  year.  Online  training  in  best  cybersecurity practices is available for all employees. As at 31 December 2020, 80% of employees  had  validated  this  e-learning  programme,  which  was updated at the end of 2019.\n\nManagement  of  risks  related  to  data  is  described  in  the  'Data'  risk section.\n\n## Business risks/Geographic presence and economic and political environment\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is a global corporation that has subsidiaries in 74 countries. More specifically, global changes in the cosmetics market has led L'Or\u00e9al to develop  its  activities  in  Travel  Retail  and  in  the  countries  in  the  'New Markets' Zone (this zone represented 48.5 % of its sales in 2020). Because of this globalisation, political or economic  disturbances  (strong economic slowdown due to e.g. geopolitical tensions or a health crisis, international trade tensions, sovereign debt crises) in countries in which the  Group  generates  a  significant  portion  of  its  sales  could  have  an impact on its business activities.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  suffered  the  consequences  of  the  Covid-19  major health crisis, the impact and risk management of which are described in the 'Sanitary Crisis' risk factor.\n\n## Business risks/Crisis management\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nPrejudicial events or information relating primarily to the use or misuse of a product, or an inappropriate individual behaviour, whether proven or not,  could  affect  the  reputation  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  35  major  international brands and its products.\n\nThe impact of the risk could be amplified, notably, by:\n\n- \u25cf the explosion of the digital universe and social networks in all countries;\n- \u25cf the emergence of social beauty, which is social, connected and shared beauty;\n- \u25cf the role of influencers as opinion leaders with a significant community of subscribers;\n- \u25cf societal movements and questioning of the Group or the brands by civil society, consumers, etc.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set up a system of:\n\n- \u25cf training  sessions  in  crisis  communication  and  support  for  the communication teams on key issues for the Group;\n- \u25cf crisis risk management at corporate and local levels;\n- \u25cf permanent watch system that monitors English, French and Chineselanguage  websites.  The  subsidiaries  deploy  their  own  social  media and web monitoring systems under the responsibility of their Director of  Communication  and  immediately  report  a  media  risk  in  their country to the Corporate Communications Department; and\n- \u25cf L'Or\u00e9al  has  also  set  up  a  crisis  management  procedure  which  is tasked with preventing, managing and limiting the consequences of undesirable  events  on  the  Company  across  the  globe.  The  Group crisis management officer reports directly to General Management.\n\nThe  deployment  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  throughout  the  Group  aims  at reinforcing  the  dissemination  of  the  rules  of  good  conduct  which  form the basis of L'Or\u00e9al's integrity and ethics. These rules of good conduct seek  to  guide  actions  and  behaviour,  inspire  choices  and  make  sure that  the  Group's  values  are  reflected  in  the  everyday  acts  of  each employee. L'Or\u00e9al has also implemented a 'Code of Good Practice for the Use of Social Media' for its employees.\n\nOn its website, the Group has published the 'Charter of values' which each influencer with whom L'Or\u00e9al collaborates agrees to respect. The Group's  principles  and  operational  processes  to  be  applied  for partnerships with influencers, have been disseminated worldwide to the collaborators concerned.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  global  presence  and  its  portfolio  of  35  major  international brands  helps  to  maintain  a  balance  in  sales  and  offsets  between  the geographic zones, product categories and distribution channels (details on  sales  from  the  zones  are  presented  in  section  1.3  '2020  Financial results and  corporate  social  responsability  commitments'  of  this document).",

Specifically,  the  European  General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides for significant sanctions.\n\nAny  breach  of  data  integrity  or  confidentiality,  notably  personal  data processed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  or  its  partners,  for  exogenous  or  endogenous reasons  (including  intrusions,  malicious  acts,  etc.)  could  have  a significant impact on its reputation and consumer confidence and thus on the Group's business activities.\n\n## Business risks/Market and innovation\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  subject  to  constant  pressure  from  many  competitors  in  all countries due to:\n\n- \u25cf its  size  and  the  positioning  of  its  brands  in  various  markets  in  which major international groups operate;\n- \u25cf local brands and new players coming from the digital economy;\n- \u25cf rapid technological changes in emerging fields of research by new operators.\n\nIf  the  Group  fails  to  anticipate  or  respond  to  changes  in  consumer expectations,  especially  in  the  areas  of  natural  beauty,  health, personalised services, connected things and environmental commitments, with innovative and adapted product offerings, its sales and growth could be affected.\n\nThe  Group  continually  adapts  its  innovation  model  and  is  constantly increasing  its  investments  in  research  and  digital  services.  L'Or\u00e9al's research  teams  innovate  to  respond  to  the  infinite  diversity  of  beauty aspirations  all  over  the  world.  The  Consumer  &  Market  Insights Department within the Innovation Department is constantly monitoring changes  in  consumer  expectations  by  product  category  and  major regions of the world.\n\nAll of these research programmes, which are part of a long-term vision, allow  L'Or\u00e9al  to  meet  the  challenges  of  innovation  (see  section  1.2.6. 'The bet on research, safety and innovation' of this document).\n\nThe  Digital  General  Management  is  responsible  for  accelerating  the Group's  digital  transformation  by  helping  the  brands  create  enriched spaces for expression and helping teams to establish more interactive, close-knit and bespoke relationships with consumers.\n\nConsumers'  expectations  with  regard  to  sustainability  are  also  at  the heart of the Sharing Beauty with All programme (see chapter 4) and are taken  into  account  in  developing  the  Group's  brand  and  product portfolio.\n\nFinally,  the  Group's  acquisition  strategy  always  takes  into  account changes in the competitive environment.\n\nThe  Group  constantly  and  progressively  deploys  policies,  training  and data management tools as well as the associated organisational  and technical measures. The Global IT Department has introduced strict rules with  regard  to  data  security  (back-up,  protection  of,  and  access  to data, in particular confidential data).\n\nThe Group's principles governing the processing of personal data have been  disseminated  all  over  the  world  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all employees about respect for ethical principles, and legal and regulatory requirements in the matter.\n\nAn  organisation  based  on  a  Group  Governance  Committee,  a  world Steering Committee and a network of Business Line, Zone and Country contacts  responsible  for  personal  data  protection  has  been  set  up  to coordinate the operational teams involved. The Group has specifically appointed a Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) and set up a network of DPOs for all countries in the European Zone and gradually in the other regions of the world.\n\nThis  governance notably aims to monitor the Group's compliance with different laws, such as the GDPR in Europe, by ensuring the mobilisation of all stakeholders and by adapting customer, supplier and business line processes to the Group's rules and to applicable laws.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n3",

        "page_content": "RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n## Business risks/Business ethics\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs L'Or\u00e9al is an international group of over 85,000 employees working in 79 countries at more than 422 sites, it cannot exclude potential violations of  its  ethical  commitments  (Code  of  Ethics  based  on  the  four  Ethical Principles  -  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and  Transparency-,  its  Human Rights  policy,  support  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  and  the United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  etc.),  whether  directly by  its  employees,  or  indirectly  because  of  the  activities  of  its  partners, particularly  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  In  addition,  civil  society  is expressing  higher  expectations  with  regard  companies'  integrity  and transparency  and  the  way  in  which  they  manage  scientific  and technological  innovations.  Such  non-compliance  with  its  commitments or  the  lack  of a   response  to  new  ethical  questions  could  have  an adverse impact on the Group's reputation and expose it to criminal or administrative sanctions.\n\n## Business risks/Sales distribution networks\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nTo sell its products, L'Or\u00e9al uses independent distribution channels, and may  develop  direct  distribution  to  the  consumer  for  certain  brands (branded  retail  and  e-commerce).  The  concentration  of  the  Group's large  customers,  the  restructuring  or  disappearance  of  physical  supply chains,  and  changes  in  selective  distribution  could  impact  the development of the Group's brands in the country or countries involved.\n\nThe presence of the Group's brands in all types of distribution channels allows  the  Group  to  offer  its  products  and  services,  whatever  the consumer practices.  The  departments  concerned  anticipate  trends  to adapt  to  these  changes  and,  in  particular,  have  steadily  developed online  sales  with  diversified  partners  (e-distributors,  pure  players,  and market places).\n\n## Business risks/Risks related to Human Resources\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nOne of the keys to L'Or\u00e9al's success lies in the talent of its employees to ensure its growth. This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is changing within a complex,  highly  competitive  and  rapidly  changing  environment (globalisation,  digital  transformation,  diversity  and  inclusion  challenges, sustainable development issues, etc.) that requires specific expertise. If L'Or\u00e9al  fails  to  identify,  attract,  retain  and  train  competent  and engaged employees who behave responsibly, the development of its activities and its results could be affected.\n\nMoreover,  given  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities,  particularly  its  industrial  operations, the risk of workplace accidents or occupational illnesses could become a reality.\n\nThe  Group  is  developing  a  motivating,  professional  environment  with respect for its ethical values, particularly diversity.\n\nThe recruitment and development of employees occurs within a longterm perspective, also to ensure the continuity of key functions within the Group,  in  which  training  plays  a  core  role  throughout  an  employee's career.\n\nThe remuneration policy combines external competitiveness and internal fairness. It recognises both individual and collective performance.\n\nThe  international  global Share & Care programme meets the essential needs  of  each  of  the  Group's  employees  in  terms  of  benefits, healthcare,  parenthood  and  quality  of  life  at  work.  Actions  for  stress prevention and workstation ergonomics are organised.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  ambitious  goals  for  the  health  and  safety  of  its employees, defining high standards that often exceed legal obligations and  involve  personnel  at  all  levels.  Prevention  is  based  on  the  GHAP (General  Hazardous  Assessment  Procedure)  and  SHAP  (Safety  Hazard Assessment  Procedure)  programmes,  which  identify  the  dangers, generally  and  for  each  workstation,  assess  the  risks  and  allow  the implementation of the necessary means of control (see section 4.3.2.1 'Preserving employee health and safety' of this document).\n\nThe  Group's  policies  on  sustainable  development,  social  and  societal responsibility,  compliance  and  philanthropy  are  based  on  the  Ethical Principles. The role and the resources granted to the Chief Ethics Officer allow him to succeed in his mission by relying on all the teams and resources of the Group (see section 3.2.1. 'Organisation and environment' of this document). Specific  training  of  management  teams,  regular  dialogue  with  stakeholders and  the  establishment  of  internal  working  groups  facilitate  the  inclusion  of Ethics in the Group's new policies and strategic decisions. The ethical risks are mapped and regularly  updated,  including  for  suppliers  and  subcontractors (see section 3.4.5.2. 'Monitoring compliance with the Plan' of this document). The deployment of the Code of Ethics throughout the Group, mandatory elearning training and ongoing communication campaigns via an Ethics Day, ensure that employees are aware of the ethical standards. A network of 76 Ethics  Correspondents  around  the  world  and  regular  meetings  of  the  Chief Ethics Officer with the Countries ensures close contact with these employees. Regular  audits  of  the  Group's  sites  and  those  of  its  suppliers  and subcontractors  (see  section  3.4.  'Vigilance  Plan'  of  this  document),  the Group's  whistleblowing  line  (www.lorealspeakup.com)  opened  in  2018 accessible to all Group stakeholders, as well as a procedure to collect and process reports to manage any violations.",

The direct and indirect consequences of these risks may adversely affect people and the assets of the Group (tangible and intangible).\n\nIn  order  to  permanently  protect  these  resources  (or  Group  assets) against malicious acts, the Security Department helps in the preventive implementation of technical, HR and operational procedures to limit the residual risk of malicious damage and support the Group's international development  in  high-risk  countries.  For  this  purpose,  the  Security Department:\n\n- \u25cf has implemented a watch and evaluation of the state of security in the countries in which the Group is active;\n- \u25cf conducts evaluation visits in the countries in which it is present;\n- \u25cf creates country security sheets for international travellers;\n- \u25cf defines  the  security  standards  and  minimum  protection  to  be implemented to protect the Group's activities; and\n- \u25cf coordinates,  with  related  key  players,  the  crisis  management procedure  which  is  tasked  with  preventing,  managing  and  limiting the consequences of undesirable events on the Group.\n\nThe security measures are adjusted and reassessed based on the local situation and the level of exposure of employees and sites.\n\nConsumer  safety  is  an  absolute  priority  for  L'Or\u00e9al:  assessing  safety  is central  to  any  new  product  development  process  and  a  prerequisite before any new product can be brought to the market. The principles governing the Group's quality and safety policy are:\n\n- \u25cf satisfaction of customer needs;\n- \u25cf compliance with safety requirements and laws;\n- \u25cf the  maintenance  of  standards  and  regular  updates  of  safety assessment approaches; and\n- \u25cf product quality and conformity across the supply chain.\n\nThe Worldwide Safety Evaluation Department specifically evaluates the safety  of  raw  materials  and  finished  products.  It  establishes  the toxicological  profile  of  the  ingredients  used  and  the  tolerance  of  the formulas  before  they  are  launched  on  the  market.  The  same  safety standards are applied worldwide to ensure identical quality across the globe.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  goes  one  step  further  in  safety  assessments  by  monitoring  the potential  adverse  effects  that  may  arise  once  the  product  is  on  the market  through  its  international  cosmeto-vigilance  network  in  order  to take  the  appropriate  corrective  measures  if  necessary  (see  'Product quality  and  safety:  a  priority'  in  section  4.3.3.2.  'Measures  taken  in favour of consumers' of this document).\n\nIn  terms  of  questions  that  civil  society  may  ask  regarding  certain substances and their effects on health and the environment, L'Or\u00e9al's position can be summarised in three points:\n\n- \u25cf vigilance with regard to any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u25cf co-operation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u25cf precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  relies  on  its  scientific  teams  to  answer  consumers'  questions about  the  safety  of  its  products,  primarily  through  its  'Inside  our Products' platform that has been online since 2019.\n\nFinally, production quality standards define rules governing the quality of products,  for  all  stages  from  creation  to  production  and  distribution. Almost all plants are ISO 9001 certified for their production and follow the Best  Manufacturing  Practices  in  accordance  with  the  ISO  22716 standard. In the case of production subcontracting, the rules governing the  choice  of  the  subcontractor  and  its  production  follow  the  same principles. The subcontracting quality charter lays out these requirements, compliance with which is evaluated during audits.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n3",

Industrial and environmental risks\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks/Product availability\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn  the  context  of  a  globalised  logistics  chain  and  the  increased geographic  concentration  of  certain  supply  sources,  the  failure  of  an external  supplier  to  deliver  raw  materials,  packaging  components  or finished  products,  along  with  a  major  interruption  of  operations  in  a L'Or\u00e9al manufacturing unit or shipping hub, could impact the Group's sales because of the unavailability of products that could result.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al regularly revises its inventory policies, reserves capacities with its suppliers  and  negotiates  long-term  contracts.  Likewise,  there  are business continuity plans for each operational site. The Group is currently deploying  a  single  methodology  of  business  continuity  plans  at  all  its plants  and  distribution  centres.  These  plans  aim  at  planning  for  the unavailability of part of the Group's supply chain as far as possible and resuming business activities as quickly as possible.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also looks for alternative sourcing of its raw materials, duplicates packaging  moulds  for  its  strategic  products,  implements  operational continuity plans with its suppliers and reviews, if required, the design of its formulas and finished products.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks/Climate change\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs for any company, the Group's activities are exposed to the physical and transition risks related to climate change.\n\nThe increase in risks of natural origin, both extreme and chronic, the loss of  biodiversity,  and  the  increased  pressure  on  water  resources  could impact  the  availability  of  finished  products  by  disturbing  the  Group's operations  and  supply  chain.  The  scarcity  of  resources  and  the implementation of the transition towards a low-carbon economy could also increase production costs.\n\nIn  addition,  insufficient  consideration  of  these  impacts  related  to  the usage  phase  during  product  design  could  represent  a  risk  for  sales  in certain  areas  of  the  world  affected  by  water  scarcity  or  the  lack  of adapted infrastructures to collect and treat effluents and waste.\n\nFinally,  the  consumption  choices  made  by  certain  categories  of consumers  could  be  increasingly  influenced  by  the  impact  of  carbon and water on products and their impact on biodiversity along with the Group's total environmental performance.\n\nAs a result, if the Group did not sufficiently anticipate all these impacts and did not initiate a voluntary process to adapt to climate change, its financial performance and reputation could be impacted.\n\nThrough  its  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  since  2013  the  Group has pursued its initiatives aimed at reducing its environmental footprint by setting ambitious and concrete targets (see chapter 4). Thus, L'Or\u00e9al has undertaken to reduce the environmental footprint of its operations by  60%  in  2020  from  a  2005  baseline.  This  programme  also  aims  to reduce  the  environmental  footprint  of  its  product  formulas  and  to respect  biodiversity  through  a  sustainable  and  responsible  sourcing policy for raw materials, the eco-design of packaging and commitments to 'zero deforestation' so that 100% of created or renovated products had  an  improved  environmental  or  social  profile  by  the  end  of  2020. L'Or\u00e9al is also committed to ensuring that 100% of its plastic packaging will  be  refillable,  reusable,  recyclable  or  compostable  by  2025.  This objective will have a direct effect on the end of life of packaging and stimulate a circular economy.\n\nIn addition, by relying on recent scientific developments, particularly in the  area  of  biotechnology,  the  Group  also  initiated  a  Green  Sciences programme to drive change in its portfolio of raw materials through the development of ingredients with a favourable environmental profile, by minimising the environmental impacts linked to the cultivation of plants that  are  the  source  of  these  ingredients  (deforestation,  soil  depletion, and consequences for biodiversity, for example), and by relying on ecofriendly transformation procedures that prevent upstream pollution.\n\nFinally, L'Or\u00e9al has sought to cover all impacts associated with its value chain and had its commitment validated in late 2017 with the Science Based Targets initiative:\n\n- \u25cf from 2025, all its manufacturing, administrative and research sites will be carbon neutral;\n- \u25cf by 2030, the Group will have reduced all its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in absolute value compared to 2016 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3); and\n- \u25cf as a signatory of the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C call to action, L'Or\u00e9al has made a commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nIn  June  2020,  with  its  new L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  of environmental  and  social  targets  for  the  next  ten  years,  L'Or\u00e9al announced  that,  by  2030,  all  the  water  used  in  the  Group's manufacturing processes would be recycled and reused in a loop at its sites. Deployment  of  the  necessary  equipment  will  be  prioritised according to the water situation of the drainage basins in which L'Or\u00e9al operates.\n\nManagement of potential consequences of extreme events is described in the section on 'product availability' risk.",

As a result of this policy, the risks inherent in our business  activities  are  systematically  identified  and  brought  under control.\n\nThe  Operations  Department  issues  Internal  Rules  that  set  out  the principles of L'Or\u00e9al's EHS policy. Each site is covered by an EHS officer. Training  programmes  are  systematically  organised.  EHS  performance indicators are collected monthly from all plants, distribution centres, and administrative and research sites with over 50 people. Specific audits are conducted  by  internal  EHS  teams,  and  external  independent  experts. Fire  risk  is  dealt  with  in  the  framework  of  very  strict  fire  prevention standards (National Fire Protection Association standards).\n\nIndustrial  sites  classified  as  'Seveso'  are  subject  to  specific  procedures adapted to  the  nature  of  the  risks  related  to  storage  of  chemicals  or flammable materials and are in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAcross all sites, the Group strives to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, its  water  consumption  and  its  waste  generation.

The  diversity  and  constant reinforcement of the regulatory environment expose the Group to a risk of non-compliance or increased compliance costs. L'Or\u00e9al could be exposed to a failure or an act of fraud, which could have an impact on the reputation, operations and results of the Group. Finally, in the ordinary course of its business, the Group will potentially be involved in all types of legal actions and may be subject to tax, customs and administrative audits. | The Legal Charter reaffirms the obligation to comply with local legislation and,  in  particular,  sets  out  the  internal  principles  for  signatures,  the general  and  specific  rules  relating  to  contracts,  trademark  law, intellectual  property  law,  company  law,  competition  law,  embargoes and  economic  sanctions  and  the  protection  of  personal  data.

Financial and market risks\n\n## Financial and market risks/Currency risk\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nDue  to  its  international  presence,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  naturally  exposed  to currency  fluctuations.  In  addition,  commercial  flows  resulting  from purchases  and  sales  of  items,  products,  royalties  and  services  arise between subsidiaries in different countries. Procurement by subsidiaries is mainly in the currency of the supplier's country.\n\nFluctuations  between  the  main  currencies  may  therefore  have  an impact on the results of the subsidiaries, but also on the Group's results during the conversion of non-euro subsidiaries' accounts into euros and, as a  result,  make  it  difficult  to  compare  performances  between  two financial years.\n\nThe  impact  of  hedging  on  equity  and  the  analysis  of  sensitivity  to currency fluctuations  are  detailed  in  note  11.3.  'Other  comprehensive income' in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Finally, the impact of foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  the  income  statement  is described  in  note  10.2.  'Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses'  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  Financial  Code  and  the  currency  risk  management  standard specify,  in  particular,  the  principles  to  be  applied  by  Group  entities  to ensure  that  management  of  currency  risk  is  both  prudent  and centralised.\n\nTo  limit  currency  risk,  the  Group  adopts  a  conservative  approach whereby it hedges a significant portion of its annual requirements for the following year through currency forward contracts (purchases or sales) or  through  options.  Hedging  requirements  are  established  for  the following  year  on  the  basis  of  operating  budgets  of  each  subsidiary. These requirements are then reviewed regularly throughout the year in progress.  In  order  to  obtain  better  visibility  over  the  flows  generated, currency risk management  is  centralised  through  the  Treasury Department  at  head  office  (Group  Corporate  Finance  Department), which uses a specific tool for centralising the subsidiaries' requirements by currency (FX report).\n\nThe system of foreign exchange risk hedging is presented to the Audit Committee.  The  hedging  methodology  and  the  equities  involved  are described in note 10.1. 'Hedging of currency risk' of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Worldwide Claims Substantiation Department ensures the conformity of product communications before they are introduced on the market. The  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  sets  out  the  fundamental  principles  of responsible  communication  and  L'Or\u00e9al  has  made  a  commitment  to implement  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce  Consolidated Code of  Advertising  and  Marketing  Communication  Practice  and  the Cosmetics  Europe  Charter  and  Guiding  Principles  on  responsible advertising  and  marketing  communication  to  which  the  key  global cosmetics industry players in Europe adhere. The Group's principles for 'responsible product advertising' are described in a summary brochure disseminated  worldwide  in  order  to  raise  employee  awareness  about compliance  with  ethical  principles,  specific  legal  and  regulatory requirements, and operational processes for the prior control of product communications.\n\nSpecial  care  is  given  to  the  protection  of  trademarks,  designs,  models and  domain  names  belonging  to  the  Group.  This  responsibility  is entrusted  to  a  special  unit  of  the  Legal  Department.  The  department ensures  the  worldwide  protection,  management  and  defence  of intellectual  property  rights  via  searches  for  prior  rights,  monitoring  of registration and renewal procedures, the implementation of monitoring services and  the  initiation of appropriate  legal  action  against counterfeiters.\n\nIn  order  to  protect  the  Group  against  the  risk  of  appropriation  of  a molecule,  a  production  or  packaging  process  by  another  company, L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  the  International  Industrial  Property  Department,  a specific  structure  which  is  part  of  the  Research  and  Innovation Department. It is responsible for filing the Group's patents, their use and defence on a worldwide basis. It also conducts studies on the free use of Group  products  with  regard  to  third-party  patents  and  monitors  the legality of competitors' products with regard to the Group's patents.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Group is also an active member of organisations which have set  themselves  the  goal  of  combating  counterfeiting  and  promoting best commercial practices. This is the case of the French Manufacturers' association  (Union  des  Fabricants),  the  Association  des  Praticiens  du Droit des Marques et des Mod\u00e8les (APRAM) and the AIM.",

'Non-current  financial  assets'  of  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements),  the  value  of  which  fluctuates primarily as a function of global market trends, Sanofi's results and, more generally, economic and financial data from Sanofi and its sector.\n\nThis  interest  and  changes  in  the  market  in  which  Sanofi  operates  are monitored on a regular basis. As at 31 December 2020, the market value of the Sanofi share was significantly higher than the value recorded on the L'Or\u00e9al balance sheet (see note 9.3. to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nA significant decrease in the amount of the dividend paid by Sanofi or a significant or extended decline in its market price could have an impact on L'Or\u00e9al's share price.\n\n## Financial and market risks/Risk relating to the impairment of intangible assets\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's intangible assets, which are primarily its 35 major international brands,  and  the  goodwill  recognised  at  the  time  of  external  growth transactions, are susceptible to impairment.\n\nAs described in note 7. 'Intangible assets' of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  brands  with  an  indefinite  useful  life  and  goodwill  are  not amortised but are tested for periodic impairment at least once a year. Where the  recoverable  amount  of  a  brand  is  lower  than  its  net  book value,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised.  Similarly,  any  difference between the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit and the net  book  value  of  the  assets  including  goodwill  would  lead  to  an impairment  loss  in  respect  of  the  asset,  recorded  in  the  income statement. The amounts for the last three financial years are provided in note 4 'Other operational income and expenses' of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe data and assumptions used in impairment tests carried out on CashGenerating Units for which the goodwill and non-amortisable brands are significant,  are  presented  in  note  7.3.  'Impairment  tests  on  intangible assets' of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n3",

Confronting the acceleration of the environmental and social challenges facing the world, in June 2020 L'Or\u00e9al announced its new sustainability programme, L'Or\u00e9al for the Future ,  with a new series of particularly ambitious commitments for 2030.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  also  presents  its  progress  and  achievements  in  its Sharing  Beauty  With  All Progress Report, on its website www.loreal.com/sharing-beauty-with-all, and through its annual reporting made to the United Nations Global Compact. L'Or\u00e9al participates in 16 of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (1) .\n\n## 4.1. INTRODUCTION\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  is  based  on  Universalisation,  which  is globalisation  with  profound  understanding  and  respect  for differences  in  order  to  meet  the  beauty  expectations  and needs  of  women  and  men  around  the  world,  while  at  the same time being an environmental and societal leader.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Ethical  Principles -  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and Transparency  -  guide  the  Group's  development  and  help establish  its  reputation.  It  is  on  these  principles  that  its sustainable  development,  social  and  societal  responsibility, compliance and philanthropy policies are based.\n\nFirmly  believing  that  acting  ethically  is  the  only  way  for a company to succeed in the long term, the Group has created the Office of the Chief Ethics Officer reporting to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Innovating sustainably\n\nBy the end of 2020, 96% of the Group's products have an improved environmental or social profile.\n\n## Living sustainably\n\nBy the end of 2020, the Group o/ffers its consumers sustainable consumption choices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the Sharing  Beauty  with  All  programme  ended  on 31 December 2020, this document reports on the achievements of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  achievement  of  the  targets  set  in  2013. These results  are  summarised  in  the  table  presented  in  section 4.4 of this chapter.\n\nAs the acceleration  of  the  environmental  and  social challenges to be met calls for a more radical transformation, in June  2020  L'Or\u00e9al  announced  its  new  sustainability programme L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future , with  a  new  series  of particularly ambitious commitments for 2030.\n\n- (2) The Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer is a member of the Executive Committee and the Executive Vice President of the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo  guarantee  greater  strategic  consistency  between  the measures  the  Group  takes  to  integrate  the  sustainable development  dimension  across  its  entire  value  chain  and  its philanthropic work, the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (2) .\n\nAt  the  end  of  2013,  L'Or\u00e9al  defined  its  first  generation  of sustainable  development  commitments  by  2020,  through  its Sharing Beauty With All programme, which covers the Group's entire  value  chain  and  addresses  all  the  impacts  of  its products,  from  their  design  to  their  consumption.  These commitments provided a demonstration of the Group's ability to  decouple its growth from its environmental impact and to involve its consumers by offering them products that are both aspirational  and  growingly  sustainable,  encouraging  them  to make sustainable consumption choices.\n\n## Producing sustainably\n\nBy the end of 2020, the Group has reduced the CO 2 emissions generated by its plants and distribution centres by 81% in absolute terms, as compared to 2005, while concurrently developing its presence worldwide.\n\n## Developing sustainably\n\nwith employees - By the end of 2020, L'Or\u00e9al employees have access to healthcare coverage, social protection and training, wherever they are in the world; with suppliers - By the end of 2020, 99% of the Group's strategic suppliers participate in our sustainability programme designed for them; with communities - By the end of 2020, the Group's actions have enabled more than 100,000 people from underprivileged or poor communities to access work.",

This index ranks 9,124 large  companies  worldwide,  reflecting  the  perceptions  of stakeholders, the media and company communications on corporate social responsibility needs.\n\nAs  in  previous  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  also  acclaimed  by  the most  demanding  organisations  in  this  field  in  2020,  and  in particular:\n\n- \u25cf L'Or\u00e9al is the only company to have been awarded an 'A' for five consecutive years for each of the three issues evaluated by the CDP (1) : efforts to fight climate change, forest preservation, and water security. Only 10 companies  in  the  world  earned  this  triple  'A'  score  in 2020;\n\n## 4.2. MAIN NON-FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nL'Or\u00e9al presents its Corporate Social Responsibility strategy (2) in order to meet  the  requirements  of  the  Non-Financial Information Statement (3) in  particular. This Declaration sets out the  Group's  main  non-financial  risks  and  then  describes  the policies  implemented  to  address  them,  which  are  monitored and measured by performance indicators and their results. This presentation  refers  to  the  Group's  business  model,  set  out  in section  1.2.  'Business  model:  economic  and  corporate excellence to create lasting value for all' of this document.\n\nAs L'Or\u00e9al has had a long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility, section 4.3. 'Policies, performance indicators  and  results'  of  this  document  also  includes  the policies  and  actions  voluntarily  implemented  beyond a response to the main risks.\n\n## 4.2.1. Risk identification process\n\nIn application of the European Directive of 22 October 2014 on the disclosure of non-financial information, as transposed into French law, the main environmental, social, Human Rights risks and risks related to the fight against corruption (4) are detailed in  this  section  4.2.  'Main  non-financial  risks',  to  the  extent necessary  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  Company's position,  business  development,  economic  and  financial results, and activity.\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  ninth  consecutive  year,  the  non-financial  rating agency  ISS-Oekom  gave  L'Or\u00e9al  Prime  status,  a  rating awarded to top-performing companies;\n- \u00b7 the non-financial ratings agency MSCI awarded L'Or\u00e9al an AAA rating;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  was  recognised  for  the  11 th time  as  one  of  the 'World's  Most  Ethical  Companies'  by  the  Ethisphere Institute; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al was  again  recognised  by  the  Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index acknowledging the most advanced companies in the area of gender parity.\n\nThe  Group's  good  performance  means  that  it  is  regularly included in the indices requiring the highest standards:\n\n- \u00b7 the Solactive Europe Corporate Social Responsibility and Solactive  Global  Corporate Social Responsibility  indices, (formerly the 'Ethibel index');\n- \u00b7 the  Euronext-Vigeo  Eiris  indices  which  highlight  the  top performing companies in the areas of the environment, corporate social responsibility and governance.\n\nThe  Group's  significant  risks, i.e. the  risks  that  could  have  a material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  position  or  outlook, are described in chapter 3 of this document (see section 3.5. 'Risk  factors  and  risk  management'  of  this  document)  and have been established in conjunction with Group risk mapping (see section 3.5.2. 'Risk mapping' of this document).\n\nThese  risks  cover  all  areas  of  the  Group's  activities.  Some  of these  risks  are  specific  to  non-financial  issues;  others  are broader, and may stem from environmental or societal causes. These  so-called  'CSR'  risks  were  the  subject  of  detailed analysis in order to select the main risks within the meaning of the  Non-Financial  Information  Statement.  This  analysis  was carried  out  on  the  basis  of  the  work  of  Group  experts, in  conjunction  with  the Risk  Management Department  and consistent  with  the  Group's  business  model.  This  work  also draws on the sustainable development materiality analysis, the Group's Human  Rights and  corruption mapping,  also conducted for each country on corruption, as well as on the risk  analysis carried out within the framework of the Vigilance Plan (see section 3.4. 'Vigilance plan' of this document).\n\nThe  risks  associated  with  climate  change  have  been  the subject of a long-term approach - more than 10 years - given their specific nature.\n\nThe  main  risks  have  been  validated  at  the  highest  level  of responsibility  of  the  organisation  by  the  relevant  General Managements.\n\n4",

Main risks for corporate social responsibility, Human Rights and corruption\n\nThe  main  risks  in  respect  of  corporate  social  responsibility, Human Rights and corruption identified by the L'Or\u00e9al Group, as  described  in  section  4.2.1.  'Risk  identification  process'  of this  document,  are  set  out  below.  Other  risks,  of  which  the Group  is  not  currently  aware  or  which  it  does  not  consider material at the date of this Document, could have a negative impact.\n\n## Main environmental risks\n\n## Industrial risks\n\nAs with any production, distribution, research and general administration activity, L'Or\u00e9al is exposed to a variety of industrial risks that may impact the  environment  and  safety:  fires,  explosions,  technical  failure  of  safety  system  installations,  or  even  human  failure  in  the  operation  of  existing facilities (such as those dedicated to the treatment of effluents and/or their discharge), or when managing exceptional works. These events can generate  accidental  pollution  (surface  and  underground  water,  air,  soils)  that  may  have  consequences  inside  or  outside  the  sites,  which  are sometimes located near an inhabited area.\n\n## Physical and transition risks associated with climate change\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks of natural origin in many countries. Risks of natural origin are those related to the occurrence of extreme weather events such as cyclones or floods, or those resulting from long-term climate change such as the rise in average temperatures, noticeable change in precipitation levels and the reduction of available water. The increase in these risks could impact the availability of finished products by disturbing the Group's operations and/or supply chain. To be sold, the products manufactured by the Group must be available on the market on the dates scheduled so as to respect consumer demands and launch plans, in a cosmetics market where the need for responsiveness is growing constantly. A  major  stoppage  of  activity  at  a  plant  or  distribution  centre  could  therefore  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  achievement  of  commercial objectives.\n\nThese risks may impact the Group directly on its sites, or indirectly via the sites of suppliers and subcontractors, thereby reducing the availability of raw materials or packaging components necessary to manufacture products. For instance, an exceptionally steep rise in the price of basic raw materials because of their scarcity, or in the energy costs necessary for their production due to carbon taxation, or even their total unavailability or the resulting failure of suppliers, could affect the Group's performance.\n\n## Risks related to the use and end of life of products\n\nThe  use  of  cosmetics  and  their  disposal  after  use  by  consumers  and  professional  customers  (mainly  hairdressers  and  beauticians)  generate environmental impacts. So-called 'rinsed' formulas (shampoos in particular) require water for their use, and the ingredients used in their composition can  be  found  after  use  in  domestic  wastewater,  the  treatment  of  which  is  dependent  on  existing  sanitation  systems  in  place  in  the  relevant geographic areas. Insufficient consideration of these impacts related to the usage phase during the design of L'Or\u00e9al products could represent a risk in certain areas of the world affected by water scarcity or the lack of adapted infrastructures for the collect and treatment of effluents. Similarly, the use of predominantly plastic containers may represent an environmental risk resulting from the disposal of plastic waste, depending largely on the collect and treatment channels available.\n\n## Risk related to changing stakeholder and consumer expectations in terms of environmental and social performance\n\nThe Group anticipates that the choices made by certain categories of consumers could be increasingly influenced by the carbon impact of the products and the global environmental performance of industrial producers. If the Group is unable to anticipate changes in such behaviours, meet stakeholders' expectations, overcome major environmental and social challenges and respond notably with appropriate product innovation, a significant contribution in the transition towards a low carbon economy and the preservation of water and natural resources within its value chain, the Group's performance and reputation could be affected.\n\n## Risk of regulatory non-compliance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates through subsidiaries located in many countries. Like any international business, L'Or\u00e9al is subject to a wide range of constantly changing local laws and regulations in the areas of safety and the environment, including efforts to fight climate change, and the preservation of water resources and of biodiversity. This exposes it to the risk of regulatory non-compliance or higher compliance costs for its activities in a broad context of increasingly diverse norms.\n\n## Main social risks\n\n## Employee health and safety risk\n\nGiven L'Or\u00e9al's activities, particularly its industrial operations, the risk of work accidents or occupational illnesses could become a reality.\n\n## Human Resources management risk\n\nOne of the keys to L'Or\u00e9al's success lies in the talent of its staff to ensure its development. This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is evolving within a complex, highly competitive and rapidly changing environment (globalisation, digital transformation, sustainable development challenges, etc.) that requires specific expertise. If L'Or\u00e9al fails to identify, attract, retain and train competent and engaged employees who behave responsibly, the development of its activities and its results could be affected.\n\nFor  the  main  environmental  risks,  the  concept  of  risk  covers both  risks  related  to  the  impact  of  the  Group's  business activities  on  its  ecosystem  and  the  risks  of  the  impact  of climate change in the short and medium terms on its business model, activity and financial performance (1) .",

        "page_content": "## L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## Main Human Rights risks\n\nFollowing an initial analysis conducted in 2017, the Group wanted to expand its mapping in 2020, by identifying the potential salient Human Rights risks.  To  do  so,  L'Or\u00e9al  relied  on  the  reporting  framework  of  the  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGP  Reporting  Framework). This identification process takes into consideration the severity, scale and remediability of its impact on people throughout its value chain. To date, the identification process on a global level and in a few pilot markets has been finalised. The next phase will allow the results' testing in all markets and with external stakeholders. This mapping should be finalised in 2021.\n\nThe following list of the main risks results from the 2017 risk analysis, complemented by the work to date to identify the detected salient risks:\n\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of L'Or\u00e9al employees (discrimination because of gender, age, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation);\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of L'Or\u00e9al's suppliers' employees (child labour, forced labour, discrimination because of gender, age, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation, lack of a living wage);\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of consumers (failure in the quality and safety of products, lack of protection of personal data); and\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of communities (stereotypes in advertising).\n\nAnother  identified  risk  concerns  the  Human  Rights  of  communities  potentially  impacted  by  the  Group's  activities  (respect  for  the  environment, right of access to water, consideration of Human Rights in the choice of raw materials and, in particular, the right of access of local populations to their land and respect for their traditional knowledge under the Nagoya Protocol).\n\n## Main corruption risks\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates in many countries where the risk of corruption can be significant and could lead L'Or\u00e9al employees, as well as third parties acting in its name or on its behalf, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, to adopt practices contrary to the Group's ethical principles and the prevailing regulations. Corruption takes a variety of forms that are not necessarily easy for employees to identify. For instance, the exchange of gifts or invitations of excessive value could be perceived as corruption.\n\nThe assessment of corruption risk is materialised by specific mapping, carried out at Group level and by each country in its local context.\n\nThe Group's activities involve in particular relations with:\n\n- \u25cf public authorities and their representatives, either directly or via intermediaries or professional bodies, to obtain the authorisations necessary for the Group's activities, for instance. The countries in which the Group operates must be given support in the fight against public corruption;\n- \u25cf the Group's customers and suppliers; and\n- \u25cf journalists, doctors, etc., to whom products can be given so that they can recommend them. Relationships are also maintained with third parties that,  beyond the Group's products themselves, issue various or general opinions on the Company. Any action potentially deemed as being intended to cause the persons in question to breach their obligation of loyalty must be avoided.\n\nAny breach of the Group's corruption prevention principles may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al and its partners. Equally, any failure of a partner may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## 4.3. POLICIES, PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RESULTS\n\nThe  Group's  policies,  described  in  this  section,  address  the need to prevent the main CSR risks and mitigate their impact. By contributing to preventing and controlling the risks to which the  Group  is  exposed,  these  policies  are  intended  to contribute  to  the  Group's  sustainable  growth  in  a  controlled environment suited to its business lines. There are however limits inherent in  any  system  and  process.  These  limits  result  from  a number of factors, in particular the uncertainties of the outside world  or  malfunctions  that  may  occur  due  to  technical  or human failures.\n\nThese policies also reflect a proactive approach by the Group that  takes  stakeholder  expectations  into  consideration  (see section  4.1.2.  'Constant  dialogue  with  stakeholders'  of  this document).\n\n## 4.3.1. Environmental policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al,  whose  strategy  is  one  of  Universalisation,  sees  its economic  performance  and  its  environmental  and  social performance as being inextricably bound. Long committed to reducing its environmental footprint, the Group aims to be one of the best companies in the field by proving that it is possible to decorrelate  growth  and  impact,  and  to  contribute positively to its ecosystem, throughout the world.\n\nIn  2013,  L'Or\u00e9al  intensified  its  environmental  ambitions  by launching  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All programme based on\n\nfour  pillars:  'Innovating  sustainably',  'Producing  sustainably', 'Living sustainably' and 'Developing sustainably'. In 2015, the Group announced its  aim  of  becoming  a  Carbon  Balanced company by the end of 2020. In 2016, a programme was rolled out  within Sharing  Beauty  With  All:  Working  sustainably .  It brings  administrative  sites  and  research  centres  into  the process  of  improving  L'Or\u00e9al's  environmental  and  social impacts. In 2017, through its membership of the Science Based Targets  programme,  an  initiative  of  the  CDP,  the  United Nations  Global  Compact,  the  World  Resources  Institute  and WWF,  L'Or\u00e9al  signalled  its  goal  of  reducing  its  global greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  25%  compared  to  their  2016 levels  by  the  end  of  2030  and  of  going  one  step  further  by putting  its  environmental  policy  at  the  service  of  a  major collective  challenge,  namely efforts  to  fight  climate  change. To  progress  further,  in  2018,  in  the  context  of  the  individual Act4nature commitments,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  a  goal  of  100% renewable raw materials coming from sustainable sources by 2030.  Also  in  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  became  a  partner  of  the  Ellen MacArthur  Foundation,  with  the  aim  of  adopting  refillable, reusable,  recyclable  or  compostable  plastic  for  100%  of packaging by 2025. Finally, in 2019, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the first companies to sign the Business  Ambition  for  1.5\u00b0C  pledge  of the UN Global Compact, thereby committing to reach 'zero net  emissions'  by  2050  over  its  entire  value  chain,  in accordance with the 1.5\u00b0C paths of the IPCC (1) .\n\n4",

Beyond  its  commitment  to preserving  the  health  and  safety  of  its  employees  and reducing  the  impact  of  its  sites  on  their  environment,  the Group  has  implemented  an  ambitious  policy  to  reduce  its environmental  footprint by preserving natural resources (energy,  water,  materials,  biodiversity)  on  all  sites  operated and throughout the product life cycle, from the supply of raw materials to the end of life of products. L'Or\u00e9al is increasingly involving its  suppliers  in  this  process,  sharing  its  ambitions  and best  practices,  with  the  vision  of a  comprehensive  and inclusive environmental policy.\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  announced  its  new L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future sustainability programme  built on three pillars: 'Transforming ourselves', 'Empowering our business ecosystem', and 'Contributing to solving the challenges of the world'. In order to reconcile the Group's needs to preserve a planet with limited resources, L'Or\u00e9al has raised its goals and defined  targets  for  improvement  by  2030  that  cover  all  its direct and indirect impacts, related for example to the activity of its suppliers or the use of its products by consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's commitment is to ensure that its activities respect the 'planetary  boundaries',  meaning  what  the  planet  can withstand, as defined by environmental science.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An ambitious EHS policy shared by all\n\nA pioneering, socially responsible company, L'Or\u00e9al applies an ambitious policy with regard to the Environment (E), Health (H) and  Safety  (S)  in  order  to  minimise  its  environmental  impact and  guarantee  the  health  and  safety  of  employees (1) , customers and the communities in which the Group carries out its business activities.\n\nThis has been reflected, for a number of years, in the desire to systematically control the risks related to the safety of people and the environment that are inherent in the Group's business activities. Any establishment or renovation of a site, any launch of  new  equipment  or  production  processes,  any  changes  in industrali  processes  give  rise  to  a  risk  assessment  and  action plans that make it possible to reduce their potential impact.\n\nThis  commitment  has  led  to  deployment  of  the  Group's  EHS policy  over  the  entire  spectrum  of  its  business  activities,  but also  beyond  it.

While  knowledge  of  and compliance  with  these  procedures  are  fundamental,  the lasting  improvement  of  the  safety  results  and  environmental performance  essentially  requires  the  dissemination  of  a sustainable  EHS  culture  to  each  and  every  employee  and large  programmes  of  actions  aimed  at  improving  the  safety and  environmental  impact  of  its  activities.  A  dedicated training programme has been established for this purpose with the  aim  of  passing  on  this  EHS  culture  at  every  level  of  the\n\n## WORLDWIDE EHS ORGANISATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group EHS Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 Corporate department responsible for this field at global level\n\nSimilar organisation in each Zone/Division\n\nManagers on each site\n\nIn support of this organisation, the EHS manual is the reference tool  for  the  Group  sites.  It  is  essential  to  the  improvement  of their performance and respect for the key EHS commitments: moving towards 'zero accidents' for the Group and to reduce\n\nthe sites' environmental footprint (see ' A continuous improvement  process '  section  below).  It  defines  the  EHS management  system  and  the  responsibilities  shared  at  all levels of the organisation, up to the operational responsibilities:\n\n| General Management                                                                     | The Executive Vice-President Operations, who reports to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the Group's Environment, Health and Safety.                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Site managers (plants, distribution  centres, administrative sites, research  centres) | Site  managers  are  responsible  for  the  deployment  and  effective  implementation  of  the  policies defined.

Lastly,  in  a  manner  consistent  with  this  entire approach,  an  audit  system  combining  both  a  'risk'  and  a 'culture'  evaluation  serves  to  assess  the  compliance  of activities  with  the  key  regulatory  requirements,  the  proper application of the Group's standards and the degree to which the EHS culture is spread.\n\n## A worldwide organisation\n\nThe EHS organisation, under the responsibility of Operations, is built in line with the Group's worldwide organisation. It includes a  Group  'M\u00e9tier'  (business  activity)  Department,  mirror organisations  in  each  geographic  zone  and  managers  at each site.",

However,  work was  done  to  restructure  the  different  EHS  training  courses  to make  them  more  compatible  with  remote  learning.  More webinars  were  rolled  out  to  mobilise  the  different  EHS programmes:\n\n- \u00b7 Safe@Work Safe@Home : 251 participants;\n- \u00b7 We care : 109 participants; and\n- \u00b7 Green steps TOP drivers : 433 participants in 8 sessions.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  specialist  trainings  sessions,  eveyr  new L'Or\u00e9al  employees  receive  general  and  specific  training  at their workstation including the Group's EHS rules before taking up their position.\n\n## A worldwide audit programme\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with the Group's EHS policy, a system of  worldwide  audits  has  been  set  up  since  1996,  and was reinforced in 2001 with the presence of external auditors, who are experts in local contexts and regulations. These audits take place regularly at all  L'Or\u00e9al  sites:  every  three  years  for production  sites  and  every  four  years  for  distribution  centres, administrative  sites  and  research  centres.  A  follow-up  visit  is scheduled  for  the  following  year  for  the  sites  where  it is necessary.\n\nTwo types of audits known as 'risks' or 'culture' are performed depending  on  the  maturity  and  type  of  activity  at  the  sites. The risks audits primarily assess:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of practices and facilities with the significant requirements of local regulations and Group procedures and rules;\n- \u00b7 controls  of  risks  to  health,  safety  and  the  environment generated  by  technical  equipment,  processes  and operating modes implemented and used by employees; and\n- \u00b7 progress in environmental, health and safety performances.\n\nThese  audits  are  carried  out  by  external  independent experts.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  give  the  Group's  General Management objective knowledge of the risks in the areas of EHS on L'Or\u00e9al sites and provide the assurance that they are under control.\n\n4",

An initial audit is carried out and, on the basis of the results,  a  follow-up  audit  may  take  place  after  one  month. Most of these audits were conducted remotely.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  also  shares  with  its  subcontractors  the  objective  of improving  Environmental,  Health  and  Safety  performances. Audits  are  carried  out  in  addition  to  social  audits  by independent  third  party  specialists  on  manufacturing  or logistics  subcontracting  sites,  in  accordance  with  the  criteria defined by L'Or\u00e9al and similar to those used for the Group's entities.\n\nIn 2020, in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis:\n\n- \u00b7 only  three  combined  risks  and  EHS  culture  audits  were conducted on site;\n- \u00b7 167 COVID audits were carried out, most of them remotely; and\n- \u00b7 28 additional EHS audits of subcontracting sites were carried out  in  plants  and  17  in  distribution  centres.  All  of  these audits were conducted on site.\n\nIn addition to these audit programmes, prevention inspections are  regularly  conducted  by  experts  from  the  Group's insurance companies as part of external Fire and Environment insurance  policies.  In  2020,  given  the  COVID-19  health  crisis, site inspections were reduced: 2 sites (1 distribution centre and 1 administrative site) were inspected for environmental risks in 2 countries (France and China). A dozen remote reviews were also completed to ensure progress in the effective implementation  of  recommendations  made  during  previous inspections.  With  regard  to  fire  prevention  inspections,  only 4  sites  were  inspected  in  2020  (2  plants,  1  distribution  centre and 1 research centre) in 2 countries (Germany and France). About fifty sites around the world were reviewed remotely.\n\n100% of all preventive audits and inspections described above involved  a  risk  component  which  is  always  carried  out  by external  independent  auditors  specialising  in  the  area  being audited.\n\n## A continuous improvement process\n\nThe implementation of the standards, the spread of the L'Or\u00e9al EHS culture and the governance system in place contributes to the continuous improvement of the Group's EHS performance. Major  developments  occurring  within  the  framework  of  the Group's  operations  are  also  included  with  this  same  goal, whether  it  involves  the  construction  of  a  new  plant,  the purchase of new equipment or the definition of new processes, each  industrial  development  is  an  opportunity  to  reduce  the environmental footprint and safety risks.\n\nLastly, some major programmes within EHS, or more generally within the Group, are vectors for progress in the areas of safety or  the  environment  for  all  entities,  and  are  the  subject  of detailed  improvement  plans,  the  effectiveness  of  which  is evaluated during the audits.\n\n## LIFE programme ( Life threatening Incidents or Fatality Events )\n\nFor  all  L'Or\u00e9al  sites,  this  programme  covers  activities  posing risks that, if not controlled, could result in serious injury or illness. Over  time  the  Group  is  prolonging  the  ambitious  of  moving towards  'zero  accidents'  by  ensuring  the  sustainability  of actions and defining the requirements in terms of preparing for emergencies following an incident. It is backed up by a threeyear  communication  campaign  relayed  by  managers  to cover the 10 identified families of LIFE risks.\n\n## The Sharing Beauty with All programme\n\nThe Producing Sustainably component of this programme has contributed to the continuous improvement of environmental performance in industrial sites for several years, notably via the definition  and  dissemination  of  best  practices  in  energy efficiency, CO2  emissions, consumption of water and resources, and waste reduction and treatment.\n\nThe  programme's  Working  Sustainably  component  aims  to achieve  continuous  improvement  of  the  environmental performance  of  administrative  sites  and  research  centres.  It aims to reinforce the commitment of administrative sites and research  centres  with  regard  to  the  environment  and  to encourage them to identify and formalise improvement plans. It  also  involves  engaging  employees  at  these  sites  in  the development of eco-responsible behaviour.",

Some  administrative  sites  and  research  centres have also initiated this process; and\n- \u00b7 Since  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to  OHSAS  18001 certification, and then ISO 45001 'Occupational Health and Safety Management' certification to all its plants.\n\n| 2020 Certifications   | ISO 14001       | ISO 50001   | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001   | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001   |    |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----|\n|                       | number of sites | %           | number of sites         | number of sites         | %  |\n| Plants                | 33              | 85          | 27                      | 34                      | 87 |\n\nAn internal Group communication system exists so that each site  is  informed when accidents, near accidents or significant incidents occur. Specific communication is circulated worldwide  so  that  the  facts  and  lessons  to  be  learned,  the existing  rules  and  the  new  requirements  to  be  applied  are taken into account. Finally, a historical record is accessible by each  site  covering  the  nature  and  root  causes  of  EHS incidents/accidents that have occurred in all sites.\n\n## A process of integrating new sites\n\nThe  Group  regularly  acquires  new  sites.  A  formal  integration process  then  makes  it  possible  to  provide  these  sites (1) with extra  support  and  assistance  in  order  for  them  become compliant  with  all  EHS  requirements  defined,  and  to  bring potential risks under control.\n\nThe purpose of this process is to enable these sites to rapidly achieve  the  performance  level  expected  by  the  Group.  It comprises:\n\n- 1. a  regulatory  compliance  audit  carried  out  by  an independent  third party within six months  of the acquisition;\n- 2. deployment  of  the  EHS  processes  described  above  (EHS manual, EHS reporting, training, audit programme); and\n- 3. monitoring of the integration within the Group.\n\n## 4.3.1.2. Managing risks and controlling the impact of sites on their environment\n\nThe  Group  systematically  anticipates  industrial  risks  of  its activities, specifically the environmental impacts in the places where it operates, whether they concern soil, water or air.\n\n## Controlling and limiting risks to the environment\n\nEach site  has  a  general  environmental  analysis  that  must  be updated  at  least  once  every  three  years  or  whenever  a significant change occurs.\n\nAll activities performed by employees  (permanent  or temporary) are covered by an environmental aspects analysis, including  routine  and  maintenance  activities.  The  preventive measures  described  in  the  internal  procedures  must  be complied  with  in  order  to  avoid  all  forms  of  pollution  (soil, surface  water,  groundwater,  air,  etc.).  Contingency  plans  in the  event  of  accidents  are  planned  and  are  the  subject  of training for the people concerned. Proper implementation of these  measures  is  verified  during  prevention  inspections  by insurers and periodic EHS audits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Appropriate  action  plans  -  with immediate  action  where  necessary  -  are  implemented  to reduce significant risks to an acceptable level.\n\nAny establishment or site renovation, any introduction of new equipment  or  manufacturing  processes,  and  any  change  in industrial processes is also the subject of a risk assessment and action plans to reduce the potential impacts.\n\nIn the same way, at the time of purchasing land or buildings, L'Or\u00e9al conducts due diligence, which includes, in particular, a review of the environmental aspects.\n\n## Biodiversity and soil use\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  biodiversity  and  soil  use  commitments  are  based on the following fundamentals:\n\n- \u00b7 establish an ecological inventory of the site. The purpose of the inventory is to preserve, restore and develop the site's biodiversity in its ecosystem. This inventory is performed by a local  expert  and  may  be  based  on  the  SITESv2  standards (Reference  guide  for Sustainable Land  Design  and Development) , which is aligned with the LEED environmental  certification (Leadership  in  Energy  and Environmental Design) ;\n- \u00b7 reduce the impact of construction on the environment, for instance  by  choosing a  zone  that  is  already  industrially developed, or an existing industrial site or brownfield site or, for administrative  sites, an  urban  area  with  a  high population  density  close  to a  residential  neighbourhood, ideally located in the city centre or in a neighbourhood well served  by  public  transport.  A  sustainable  building  site charter  includes  these  recommendations  and  requires selective  sorting  of  building  site  waste  and  minimised impact on residents during the project phase;\n- \u00b7 if possible,  place  the  site  on  land  located  more  than 30 metres from any body of water (sea, ponds, lakes, rivers, etc.), outside natural areas, public green spaces, land with endangered or threatened species, or any other undeveloped areas (farmland, etc.);\n- \u00b7 prevent soil erosion that may result from rainwater runoff or wind  erosion  during  construction,  inter  alia  by  protecting the stored arable soil layer to enable it to be reused;\n- \u00b7 maintain or restore native natural habitats and biodiversity;\n- \u00b7 maximise green space areas or natural spaces on the site (even  in  excess  of  local  regulations)  and  minimise impermeable surfaces;\n- \u00b7 clean up polluted sites (brownfield site) where development  is  more  difficult  due  to  environmental contamination (real contamination or contamination perceived as such), thus avoiding construction on natural or undeveloped land; and\n- \u00b7 for  future  administrative  sites,  lease  buildings  that  are certified  LEED  Gold  or  equivalent  in  mature  real  estate markets.\n\n## Surface water\n\nThe Group has adopted standards for rainwater management in order  to  monitor  its  quality  and  avoid  polluting  it. For instance, sites are equipped with oil separators for parking areas. Similarly, any retention and operating area where spills are liable to occur must have adequate retention capacities. Sites  must  also  have  retention  capacity  to  contain  fire extinguishing water.\n\nIn 2020, two accidental spills were recorded:\n\n- \u25cf A  gradual  shampoo  leak  at  the  level  of  the  finished products'  compacter  in  the  V\u00e9mars  distribution  centre (France).  A  small  quantity  of  product  was  carried  by  rain water outside the site, resulting in a formation of foam in the nearby stream. As soon as the problem was detected, the site was isolated and analyses were carried out by the local industrial water clean-up station (SIAH). The results of these analyses revealed that the foam observed had no impact on the quality of the water in the waterway.\n- \u25cf Following  an  accidental  overflow  of  effluents  from  the wastewater  treatment  plant  at  the  Rambouillet  (France) plant, effluents were spilled into the city's rainwater run-off network,  causing  the  appearance  of  foam  in  front  of  the plant which extended over about 3 metres.\n\n## Industrial effluents\n\n30 L'Or\u00e9al plants have their own effluent treatment plant. They use a range of technologies, including physical, chemical and biological  processes  adapted  to  the  characteristics  of  the effluent  and  local  discharge  conditions.  L'Or\u00e9al  continues  to install  its  effluent  treatment  plants,  as  for  example  in  France and Poland in 2020.\n\nEquipment operation and effluent management are the sites' responsibility,  and  are  subject  to  specific  procedures  and instructions. An  internal  audit  or  self-assessment  of  the corresponding facility  is  organised  and  documented  at  least once each year.\n\nA self-monitoring system representative of effluent discharges has  been  established  in  each  plant,  and  serves  to  monitor regulated  and  contractual  parameters  such  as  chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), pH,  the  temperature  of  effluents  and  substances  that  could disturb  the  operation  of  an  internal  or  external  effluent management facility. This self-monitoring is a tool for detecting the  risk  of  overshooting,  which  helps  anticipate  any  noncompliances and initiate corrective actions.\n\nIn  2020,  total  chemical  oxygen  demand  of  the  Group's effluents  leaving  the  site  was  down  50%  in  tonnes  and  61% in  grams  per  finished  product  (0.65  g  per  finished  product) from 2005.",

The sites comply  with  the  noise  standards  to  which  they  are  subject. Internal environmental reporting is one way in which to ensure monthly readings of any non-compliance on this issue.\n\n## Provisions for environmental risks\n\nThe  amount  of  the  provisions  for  environmental  risks  is  not material  (see  Note  13.3  of  the  'Consolidated  Financial Statements').\n\n## 4.3.1.3. Fighting climate change and preserving natural resources\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  a  major  objective  of  fighting  climate change  and  preserving  natural  resources  in  the  overall exercise  of  its  activity.  All  efforts  are  being  made  to  achieve this objective in the sites where its activities are performed and\n\nacross  its  entire  value  chain,  from  the  search  for  renewable ingredients  and  the  sustainable  sourcing  of  raw  materials  to the transport of products, their consumption and their end of life. L'Or\u00e9al is committed to continuously improving the impact of its products throughout their life cycle.\n\n## 4.3.1.3.1. On operated sites\n\nAs  part  of  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed  to  improving  the  environmental  footprint  of  all operated  sites.The  Group  strives  to  reduce  greenhouse gas emissions (1) , water consumption, waste generation, and to protect  biodiversity.  It  is  also  committed  to  reducing  the footprint of product transport, and no longer sending waste to landfill apart from regulatory constraints.\n\nThe  specific  context  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis  had  a significant impact on the activities of the L'Or\u00e9al Group in 2020:\n\n- \u25cf Production  of  the  industrial  sites  fell  by  6%  from  2019  and was accompanied by a major change in the categories of products manufactured; generally, the volumes of makeup products  declined,  and  quantities  of  skincare,  hair  colour and hair care products increased;\n- \u25cf Hours  worked  at  the  administrative  sites  and  research centres  decreased  by  47%  from  2019,  because  of  the different  lockdown  periods  that  resulted  in  the  periodic  or partial closure of some of these sites as well as an increase in  telecommuting  for  eligible  positions.  The  nature  of  the activities maintained on the sites - laboratories, pilots, etc. which  generally  consume  more  resources  than  the administrative activities, increased the effects of this activity decline  on  certain  environmental  ratios  (energy,  water, waste per 100 hours worked).\n\n## A/ Fighting climate change\n\nAs  the  cosmetics  industry  has  low  energy  consumption  and low  CO2  emissions  compared  with  other  industries,  L'Or\u00e9al  is not  subject  to  the  CO2  emission  quotas  provided  for  by European regulations, whether for the industrial sites, administrative  sites  or  research  centres.  However,  L'Or\u00e9al, which has been committed to the efforts to combat climate change for many years, applies a particularly proactive policy for the reduction of its CO2 emissions.\n\n## Group greenhouse gas emissions\n\n(Scopes 1 and 2, according to the GHG Protocol )\n\nTo limit its impact on climate change and fulfil its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2), L'Or\u00e9al has implemented a strategy based on three pillars:\n\n- 1. Reducing its energy needs by improving energy efficiency across all its facilities (buildings, equipment, etc.);\n- 2. Increasing  the  use  of  local  renewable  energy  wherever possible;\n- 3. Achieving the targets defined for the sites without recourse to carbon offsetting.\n\n4",

In  2020,  an  81%  reduction  in  CO2 emissions  was  achieved  on  a  29%  increase  in  production compared with 2005.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in absolute terms: tonnes of CO 2 equivalent at constant scope, as per the GHG Protocol )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon Balanced project: towards a low-carbon company by the end of 2020\n\nIn  2015,  faced  with  the  climate  emergency,  the  Group  committed to balance its residual CO2 emissions (Scopes 1 and 2, downstream transportation of its finished products) by the end of 2020, in order to become a Carbon Balanced company. This new  ambition  was  to  strengthen  the  low  carbon  strategy  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  applying  a  twofold  approach  to  reduce  its  carbon footprint:\n\n- \u25cf a  60%  reduction  in  absolute  value  in  emissions  related  to  its  industrial  activities  by  the  end  of  2020  compared  to  2005, through the growing use of renewable energy and by improving energy efficiency at its industrial sites; and\n- \u25cf reaching  a  balance,  by  the  end  of  2020,  in  the  remainder  of  those  emissions  by  reducing  carbon  emissions  from  its sustainable sourcing of raw materials, in partnership with its suppliers. With this new ambition, L'Or\u00e9al wants to avoid carbon emissions in a quantity equivalent to its residual greenhouse gas emissions (approximately 400,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year in 2014).\n\nThis innovative programme has been rolled out since 2016 via various projects structured around three main components in line with the methodologies developed by international standards and the Kyoto protocol:\n\n- \u25cf improvement in energy efficiency;\n- \u25cf promotion of productive, low-carbon agricultural practices; and\n- \u25cf development of forest management and agroforestry projects.\n\nTo evaluate and support this approach, L'Or\u00e9al has developed, with the help of a committee of independent experts who are carbon specialists, the Carbon Balanced Programme Framework, a methodology used for the selection, development and monitoring of such projects, and shared with all its suppliers, project carriers and the assessment organisations involved. In 2020, L'Or\u00e9al continued to exchange views with external experts on issues relating to Insetting mechanisms, notably within the International Insetting Platform, or on accounting methodologies for Scope 3 emission reductions by joining the Value Chain Intervention Consortium led by the Gold Standard.\n\nIn  2020,  it  was  estimated that the nine projects in place generated carbon savings of 405,241 tonnes CO2 equivalent, thus reaching the target set in 2015 to balance all the residual emissions of its Scopes 1 and 2, as well as the emissions related to transportation of the Group's products, which represented a total of 403,721 tonnes CO2 equivalent in 2020.\n\nFor example, in north-eastern Madagascar, the L'Or\u00e9al Group supports the local NGO Fanamby for the reforestation of 213 hectares  of  mangroves  and  large  continental  forest  tracts  in  the  protected  zone  of  Loky  Manambato,  in  addition  to  the technical and economic support provided to the vanilla producers of the region. The reforestation activities carried out in 2020 permitted the sequestration of 22,588 tonnes of CO2 equivalent estimated ex-ante at 10 years.\n\n## CO2 EMISSIONS - SCOPES 1 AND 2 OF ADMINISTRATIVE SITES AND RESEARCH CENTRES\n\nIn 2020, the 76% reduction in CO2 was achieved thanks to the decrease  in  energy  consumption  and  the  increased  use  of renewable  energy  for  a  large  number  of  administrative  sites and research centres. In fact, energy consumption was down 15% from 2019, and the share of renewable energy rose to 76% (compared with 54% in 2019). In addition to the improvement projects  in  place,  which  continued  in  2020,  the  Covid-19 health crisis also had a favourable impact on this result due to the lower number of hours spent on site by teams.\n\n4",

The use of the 7,250 cooking items distributed since 2016 has reduced unpaid domestic work, primarily spent preparing meals and collecting wood, often at the expense of income-generating  activities,  by  more  than  70  hours  a  year  per  woman.  Thanks  to  the  wood  savings  achieved,  energy expenditures, which represent up to 30% of the household budgets, have been reduced by more than CFA 20,000 per woman per year. Finally, 31 jobs for artisans making cooking equipment have been created locally for the project.\n\n## Reducing energy consumption\n\nFor over 20 years, the Group has been endeavouring to reduce its energy consumption. These efforts essentially concern two areas:\n\n- \u00b7 ongoing improvement of industrial processes and the performance of associated equipment; and\n- \u00b7 optimisation of energy consumption in the buildings. In this respect, any new Group building has to comply with the strictest environmental standards.\n\nThis policy led to a 33% decline in consumption in kWh at plants and distribution centres per 1,000 finished products between 2005 and 2020.\n\nThe administrative sites and research centres also pursued this approach, obtaining a 21% drop in total energy consumption in kWh between 2016 and 2020. However, the Covid-19 health crisis resulted in a decrease of 41% in hours worked on these sites compared with 2016, with the result of a 34% increase in the consumption of the administrative sites and research centres in kWh/100 hours worked between 2016 and 2020.\n\n## TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF INDUSTRIAL SITES IN KILOWATT-HOURS\n\n## TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE SITES AND RESEARCH CENTRES IN KILOWATT-HOURS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn millions of kilowatt-hours\n\nIn kilowatt-hours per 1,000 finished products\n\n- The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator. \u2611\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn millions of kilowatt-hours\n\nIn kilowatt-hours per 100 hours worked",

The scope of  consolidation  covers  the  transportation  flows  of  finished products  from  the  production  sites  up  to  the  first  customer delivery point (1) .\n\nThe Sharing Beauty With All commitments were shared with the entire internal and external transportation ecosystem: sustainable transportation was ranked as a priority. As from In 2018,  in  support  of  the  sustainable  transport  strategy,  seven priorities  were  communicated to the country transport teams via a manifesto. The first being reduction at source, especially with  the  study  of  the  network  in  order  to  reduce  distances travelled and the number of deliveries, as well as to optimise the  fill  rate.  It  was  also  stated  that  all  Group  entities  should make a contribution. The process to select the Group's carriers also  includes  the  criteria  of  Sustainable  Development.  In parallel  with  the  implementation  of  the  strategy  and  the manifesto,  a  more  in-depth  analysis  of  results  placed  a spotlight on the biggest emissions contributors in transport: the use of air and urban transportation.\n\nIn  2020,  the  sustainable  transport  strategy  was  built  on  three pillars:\n\n## 1. Increasing the reduction of air transport and set-up of the Global Freight Cockpit\n\nThe  reduction  of  air  transport  is  a  pillar  of  the  distribution strategy, at the same level as service quality. It is included in the  2020  budget  targets  of  each  of  the  divisions  and  is integrated  into  our  sourcing  strategies;  for  example,  by favouring local production.\n\nThanks  to  global  and  collaborative  management,  including the sales and marketing teams, the production development services, purchasing, and the supply chain, the luxury division reduced the  tonnage  of  CO2  emissions  from  air  transport  by 43%  compared  to  2019  leaving  the  international  distribution centre  of  Roye  (France).  In  the  same  way,  the Travel  Retail Asia  Zone  also  reduced  the  tonnage  of  its  COI2  emissions  by 40% compared to 2019.\n\nIn  2020,  the  implementation  of  the Global  Freight  Cockpit provided  precise  monthly  management  of  the  air  transport activity, with visibility by site, by brand, and by each flow line, leading  to  more  informed  and  proactive  decision-making according to the trend.\n\n## 2. The Greener  Lanes programme  dedicated  to  longdistance road transport (excluding air transport)\n\nThis  programme  implements  solutions  that  will  reduce  CO2 emissions  on  long-distance  road  flows  with  the  highest emissions.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  the  Group  is  developing  multimodal transport that prioritises rail.\n\nFor  example,  in  2020,  since  the  recovery  of  activity  in  early August, most of the volumes from the San Luis Potosi (Mexico) plant to the Dallas (USA) distribution centre were carried by this form of transport, resulting in an approximately 50% reduction in CO2 emissions for this flow.\n\nMultimodal transport solutions are one of the primary ways to reduce  the  Group's  CO2    emissions  linked  to  transport.  New solutions  are  progressively  being  rolled  out  over  all  flows between  the  Group's  plants, distribution centres and customers:\n\n- \u00b7 biogas vehicles as an alternative to diesel; and\n- \u00b7 multimodal  transport  with  the  use  of  river  or  rail  freight  as an alternative to roads.\n- 3. The GLAM ( Green Last Mile ) programme which targets the implementation of solutions that will reduce CO2 emissions from urban transport.\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2019,  the  GLAM  programme  was launched in cities selected for the large quantities of deliveries they represented, and then rolled out in all geographic zones. Since the launch, 20 innovative initiatives have been deployed in 12 countries.",

Initiatives  are  increasing,  combining  deliveries  on  bicycles,  in biogas  and  electric  vehicles,  which  also  contributes  to  a reduction of emissions of fine particles in urban areas.\n\nOn the occasion of the 3 rd edition  of  the CO2  challenge , the Greener Lanes and GLAM programmes are offered in order to promote  the  innovation  with  all  the  teams.  The  resulting initiatives are assessed on the basis of four criteria: quantitative,  innovative,  collaborative  and  transposable,  so that  the  best  of  these  will  then  be  deployed  throughout  the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\n(tonnes of CO 2 equivalent per sales unit and per kilometre)\n\nProduct transport resulted in 347,942 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent emissions in 2020, representing 0.0209 g CO 2 /sales unit/km.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The 'Waterloop Factory' concept\n\nThe  'Waterloop  Factory'  concept  consists  of  using  city mains  water  only  for  human  consumption  and  for  the production  of  the  high-quality  water  used  as  raw  material for  product  manufacture;  all  the  water  required  by  the utilities  (cleaning  equipment,  steam  production,  etc.)  is derived from water that is reused or recycled in a loop on the site.\n\nIt involves the implementation of a two-step system:\n\n- \u00b7 optimisations  of  industrial  processes  in  order  to  minimise water consumption; and\n\nThe tonnages shipped by air declined 43% over 2020 vs 2019, which generated a reduction of around 41% in CO2 emissions via  this  transport  method.  These  reductions  are  occurring globally in all zones and are the result of the combined effect of  the  Covid-19  crisis  and  the  use  of  new  transport  methods. Road transportation  emissions  fell  by  3%  while  emissions  from rail transport were up 53%. In effect, the quantities shipped by rail rose by 30% in 2020.\n\nAt  Group  level,  CO2  emissions  related  to  the  downstream transportation of the Group's products declined by 20% (absolute value) in the 2020 financial year compared to that in 2019.\n\n## B/ Preserving water resources\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Group  is  committed  to  preserving  water  resources throughout  its  value  chain,  especially  on  each  of  the  sites operated. The 'Producing Sustainably' and 'Working Sustainably' pillars establish a goal for sustainable management  of  this  vital  resource.  The  action  plans implemented  around  the  world  are  based  notably  on  the following key principles:\n\n- \u00b7 mapping  of  the  consumption  of  the  Group's  plants  using the Waterscan tool, a standard tool for exhaustive mapping of water consumption;\n- \u00b7 the  installation  of  reduction  equipment  and  processes, particularly  during  the  cleaning  phase  of  production equipment  and  plant  packaging  lines,  following  the OPTICIP ( OPTimisation Cleaning In Place ) approach; and\n- \u00b7 the  reuse  of  untreated  industrial  water  for  a  new  purpose and recycling of the water used, after a specific additional treatment step.\n\nBy  the  end  of  2020,  17  Group  plants  had  such  recycling installations allowing them to reuse process water.\n\n- \u00b7 the  installation  of  a  water  recycling  system:  industrial effluents,  after  pre-treatment  in  the  on-site  treatment plant, are reprocessed  using various technologies (ultrafiltration,  reverse  osmosis,  nanofiltration,  etc.)  in order to extract very high quality water. This is then used in  a  loop  to  clean  production  tools  and  services  as a replacement for municipal mains water. As such, water requirements for utilities are fully covered.\n\nThe  Waterloop  Factory  concept  was  adopted  for  the  first time  in  2017  by  the  Burgos  plant  in  Spain.  In  2020,  this concept was also extended to the plants in Settimo in Italy, Vorsino  in  Russia,  Libramont  in  Belgium  and  Mexico  City  in Mexico. It will gradually be deployed to all Group plants.\n\n4",

L'Or\u00e9al has also reduced the water consumption of its plants and distribution centres by 35% in  absolute  terms  in  this  way  compared  to  2005,  while  the production  of  finished  products  rose  by  29%  over  the  same period.\n\nWater consumption is 0.37 litres per finished product for 2020 \u2611 , which is a decrease of 49% from 2005.\n\n(in litres per finished product)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Water Disclosure Project: a CDP initiative for transparency in information on water and water risk management across the value chain\n\nSince  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  taken  part  in  the  Water  Disclosure Project,  of  which  it  is  one  of  the  Founding  Responders.  This programme is aimed at encouraging companies to publish every  year  their  water  management  strategy,  their  results and  the  projects  they  have  launched  to  improve  their performances  and  to  reduce  the  risks  with  regard  to  their activities  related  to  water  consumption. It was launched by\n\n## C/ Protecting biodiversity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Group is committed to limiting the impact of its activity on biodiversity throughout its value chain, especially on each of the sites it operates. Projects that promote the protection or development of biodiversity were initiated on most of the sites, along with actions to raise awareness among employees. All these  actions  must  be  harmonised  with  the  environment  in which these sites are located.\n\nIn 2018, in addition to the rules laid down by L'Or\u00e9al on the use of soils (see section 4.3.1.2. 'Managing risks and controlling the impact  of  sites  on  their  environment',  it  was  proposed  that each of the sites implement an adapted organisation deploy a  specific  biodiversity  roadmap  and  establish  a  partnership with  external  organisations  such  as  the  League  for  the\n\n## WATER CONSUMPTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE SITES AND RESEARCH CENTRES\n\nTotal  water  consumption  in  the  administrative  sites  and research  centres  was  254  thousand  m 3 in  2020,  a  decrease of 36% decrease compared to 2019.\n\nWater consumption is 653 litres per 100 hours worked for 2020, representing a 5% decrease from 2019.\n\nThese results are primarily linked to the effects of the Covid-19 health  crisis,  which  led  to  the  complete  or  partial  closure  of several sites around the world resulting in a decrease in hours worked  on  site  of  47%  compared  with  2019.  This  difference between  the  drop  in  hours  worked  on  site  and  the consumption  of  water  is  primarily  linked  to  the  nature  of activities that continued on the sites (laboratories, pilots, etc.), which itself consumes water.\n\nThis  decrease in hours worked represents a drop of 41% from 2016,  causing  a  decline  in  the  performance  of  water consumption per 100 hours worked: these consumptions were down  5%  in  2020  compared  with  2016;  they  had  been reduced by 21% in 2019.\n\n(in litres per 100 hours worked)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe CDP, an important, independent not-for-profit organisation that promotes transparency and environmental information  reporting  on  several  issues:  climate  change, water, deforestation, etc.\n\nIn  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  recognised  for  the  fifth  consecutive year as one of the world leaders for its strategy and actions in  sustainable  water  management  throughout  its  entire value chain, from the production of raw materials to the use of products by consumers, receiving a score of 'A', which is  the  highest  possible  level  of  performance  in  the  CDP ranking.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  also  working  with  its  supply  chain  on  sustainable water  management  (see  Section  4.3.1.3.2.  'Within  the supply chain' of this document).\n\nProtection  of  Birds  (LPO)  for  example.  Biodiversity  inventories were  conducted  in  order  to  establish  an  overview  of  the biodiversity on the sites. They take into account local, regional and  national  challenges,  and  cover  soil  permeability,  the proportion  and  connection  of  green  spaces,  the  diversity  of habitats  and  plant  populations,  the  number  of  species  (flora and fauna), including protected and endangered species. In this way, the inventories contribute towards a basis of scientific knowledge  in  order  to  define  targeted  biodiversity  action plans, conducted with associations or local experts, in line with the ecosystem in which the sites operate. These projects may have a transformation component of the available spaces in favour  of  biodiversity  at  the  site  itself  and/or  an  educational component intended for L'Or\u00e9al employees and stakeholders by leading them to a stronger connection with nature.",

An  ambitious challenge,  in  light  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  exacting  definition  of  waste. Indeed,  any  solid  discharge  that  is  not  a  finished  product intended  for  consumers  is  considered  as  waste,  whatever  its treatment and future recovery. This includes, for example, raw material  packaging  or  packaging  components,  sludge  from effluent  treatment  plants,  broken  pallets,  etc.  At  the  same time, the Group has committed to recovering over 99% of the waste generated by reusing, recycling, or using is as an energy source.  For  the  industrial  sites,  the  Group  has  set  a  goal  for materials  recovered  (reuse  or  recycling)  of  70%  by  the  end of 2020.\n\nAt year-end 2020, 44 biodiversity inventories were conducted in the Group, 73% of which by industrial sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n44\n\nsites have conducted a biodiversity inventory.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 113 sites, i.e. 86% of L'Or\u00e9al sites (1) do not or no  longer  use  phytosanitary  products  to  maintain  green spaces.\n\ngenerating  positive  social  and  environmental  impacts  as well  as  economic  effects  with  the  goal  of  supporting projects  to  restore  degraded  land  and  marine  natural habitats.  This  means  going  beyond  efforts  to  reduce  the Group's  impact  on  biodiversity  across  the  value  chain through the regeneration of damaged natural ecosystems and the fight against climate change. Strategic reflections on  the  structuring  of  a  fund  are  in  progress  to  invest  the amount of \u20ac50 million in an investment fund with an impact that will finance innovative projects in the area of recycling and management of plastic waste.\n\n## Reducing waste generation at source\n\nWaste reduction requires the involvement of a large number of players.  It  is  an  environmental  performance  indicator,  first  for its industrial sites, administrative sites and research centres, but also across the entire value chain of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  packaging  teams,  who  are  mobilised  through  an eco-design  approach  to  packaging  components  and transportation packaging (reduction of weight, optimisation,  reuse,  etc.)  aimed  at  reducing  waste  and improving their recyclability;\n- \u00b7 for the purchasing teams, privileged contacts with suppliers, with  the  aim  of  optimising  packaging  used  for  the transportation of raw materials and packaging components received in the Group's plants, a major source of  waste.  The  development  of  the  wall-to-wall  approach (production  of  packaging  components  close  to  the Group's  production  facilities)  is  a  particularly  effective means  of  reducing  waste  related  to  the  supply  of components at the source;\n- \u00b7 for the industrial teams involved in a process of continuous improvement  of  manufacturing  and  packaging  processes in order to reduce losses during production;\n\n4",

In  each zone, programmes combine industrial agility and improved sales forecasts with the aim of reducing obsolete products, and ensuring  better  flows  via  the  establishment  of outlets , family  sales ,  sales  to  staff  and  donations  to  not-for-profit organisations.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  has  initiated  a  campaign  against wasting  food.  Because  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  4,606 meals were served daily in the Paris regions, down sharply from 2019.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  adopts  best  practices  in  its  directly  managed restaurants. A genuine awareness programme for employees, the recovery of 100% of food waste  via the Bio-Waste system, very strict monitoring of use-by dates and inventories, real-time and  on-demand  cooking  methods,  and  attention  to  the quantities served have been implemented in the restaurants.\n\nA number of initiatives are also taken to develop responsible, fair  and  sustainable  food  in  the  Group's  restaurants  and cafeterias.  For  example,  the  development  of  a  fair  trade coffee  supply,  the  proportion  of  local  products  from  organic farming, or the priority given to seasonal fruits and vegetables in menu preparation are applied.\n\nThe  donation  of  surplus  food  is  requested  of  company restaurants  managed  directly  and  those  run  as  concessions with not-for-profit organisations such as Le Cha\u00eenon Manquant.\n\nThe  campuses  in  the  Paris  region  also  initiated  actions  to reduce plastic use (elimination of plastic bottles and glasses for services  in  rooms  and  the  elimination  of  plastic  glasses  in cafeterias) and to recycle cooking oil into biofuel.\n\nFor  example,  the  Aulnay-sous-Bois  campus  developed  a special  partnership  with  the  French  Restaurants  du  C\u0153ur charity based on a food donation agreement for more than 1,265  meals  in  2020  and  solidarity  sales.  It  also  made  the choice  for  supplies  exclusively  based  on  free  range  eggs. Finally, for all its efforts, it earned the 'Mon restau responsable' label established by the Fondation Nicolas Hulot for a quality food  service  that  respects  the  environment.  This  label  is granted  for  four  areas:  the  well-being  of  guests,  sustainable meals,  eco-friendly  practices,  and  a  social  and  local commitment.\n\n## GENERATION OF TRANSPORTABLE WASTE FROM INDUSTRIAL SITES\n\n(in grams per finished product, excluding returnable packaging in rotation, with returnable packaging accounted at source)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste  production  at  the  industrial  sites  represented  85,398 tonnes in 2020 \u2611 ,  which is a decrease in absolute value of 9% compared with 2019.\n\nThis result is tied to the economic decrease in units produced (-6%) but also to the projects conducted on a targeted basis to  reduce the waste from finished products, which offset the increase  in  the  tonnage  of  sludge  generated  (+3%)  by  the deployment  of  new  wastewater  Treatment  Plant  within  the Group.\n\nIn 2020, waste production for the industrial sites was 14.9 grams per finished product.\n\n## GENERATION OF TRANSPORTABLE WASTE FROM ADMINISTRATIVE SITES AND RESEARCH CENTRES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in kilograms per 100 hours worked, excluding returnable packaging in rotation, with returnable packaging accounted at source)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste  production  from  the  administrative  sites  and  research centres  represented  4,219  tonnes  in  2020,  which  was  a decrease in absolute value of 34% from 2019.\n\nIn 2020, waste production for these sites was 10.9 kilogrammes per 100 hours worked.\n\nThese results are primarily linked to the effects of the Covid-19 health  crisis,  which  led  to  the  complete  or  partial  closure  of several sites around the world resulting in a decrease of 47% in hours  worked  on  site  compared  with  2019.  This  difference between the drop in hours worked on site and the generation of  waste  is  primarily  due  to  the  nature  of  activities  that continued  on  the  sites  (laboratories,  pilots,  etc.),  which generate waste themselves.\n\nThis  decrease in hours worked represents a drop of 41% from 2016,  causing  a  decline  in  waste  production  per  100  hours worked:  this  waste  production  was  down  8%  in  2020 compared with 2016; it had been reduced by 26% in 2019.",

This  method identifies  and  quantifies  the  sources  and  causes  of  waste generation  in  the  different  flows  of  a  site.  This  approach enhances  the  action  plans  to  reduce  waste  and  is  an additional vector of progress for the sites.\n\nAt  each  Group  site,  specific  tracking  (volumetry,  collection streams,  treatments,  etc.)  of  waste  that  is  subject  to  special regulations (flammable, toxic, etc.) is implemented, taking into consideration  the  specific  characteristics  of  each  country  in which the site operates. Regulated waste benefits, as does all waste, from a continuous improvement approach.\n\n| Regulated waste (tonnes)                  | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | Variation vs. 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|----------------------|\n| L'Or\u00e9al Group                             | 17,774 | 19,253 | 17,812 | -7%                  |\n| Industrial sites                          | 17,225 | 18,690 | 17,359 | -7%                  |\n| Administrative sites and research centres | 549    | 563    | 453    | -19%                 |\n\nThe  proportion  of  regulated  waste  generated  in  the  Group was down in 2020, at 17,812 tonnes. This is particularly the result of  the  decrease  in  waste  from  the  bulk  category  and regulated finished products.\n\n## Recovering the waste generated\n\nThe  Group  has  adopted  a  systematic  approach  to  the preservation  of  materials.  As  such,  beyond  the  reduction  at source,  the  Group  is  also  committed  to  finding  the  best solutions to energy recovery the waste it produces.\n\nWork  in  collaboration  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Research  laboratories and  a  waste  treatment  company  began  in  2020  to  find solutions for recycling finished products that cannot be sold or donated.\n\nA  study  also  began  in  2020  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Research Laboratories  to  find  material  recovery  alternatives  for  the sludge coming from the Group's purification stations.\n\nIn  2020,  96%  of  the  waste  generated  by  industrial  sites  was recovered through re-use, recycling or energy recovery, and 58%  was  recovered  through  re-use  or  recycling,  thereby preserving the material \u2611 .\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  the  goal  of  achieving  'zero  waste  to landfill'  by  the  end  of  2020  for  all  sites  (without  regulatory constraints). Work has been done with specialised companies and  local  authorities  to  implement  appropriate  treatment solutions.  The  mobilisation  of  all  the  plants  and  distribution centres  ensured  the  achievement  of  the  'zero  waste  to landfill'  objective  for  the  third  consecutive  year  (excluding regulatory  requirements  and  excluding  food  waste  from  2 sites).\n\n0 tonne\n\n\u2611\n\nIn 2020, all of the Group's plants and distribution centres achieved the 'zero waste to landfill' target (without regulatory constraints and with the exception of food waste from two sites).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u2611 The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the administrative sites and research centres, the process is more  recent,  but  has  accelerated:  the  waste  sent  to  landfill (excluding  regulatory  requirements)  was  reduced  in  2020  by 76% from 2019, representing a quantity of 59 tonnes.\n\nAchievement of the 'zero waste to landfill' target is part of the more  global  circular  economy  approach  the  Group  is engaged in. As far as possible, L'Or\u00e9al seeks to promote the local treatment of waste, in order to reduce the environmental impact  and  to  create  potential  synergies  with  other  local stakeholders.\n\nUse  of  landfills  due  to  regulatory  requirements  totalled 20  tonnes  for  the  plants  and  distribution  centres, \u2611 and 182 tonnes for the administrative sites and research centres.\n\n4",

Within the supply chain\n\n## The Group's commitment and actions with its suppliers during the health crisis\n\nStrongly  mobilised  since  the  start  of  the  Covid-19  health crisis, L'Or\u00e9al has taken  aboard  social  issues  while considering its responsibility to take action with its stakeholders.\n\nThe  Group  has  taken  action  with  its  suppliers  through  a number  of  adapted  and  customised  decisions,  such  as shortening  the  payment  periods  for  a  large  number  from May 2020, and even the decision for a cash payment when the situation required.\n\nAbove  and  beyond  its  strict  requirements  with  regard  to  its own  sites,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  for  a  number  of  years  applied  an environmental policy throughout its value chain.\n\nIndeed,  L'Or\u00e9al  works  in  partnership  with  its  suppliers  to improve the environmental and social profile of its products via the  eco-design  of  packaging,  ingredients  and  formulas  and their method  of  transportation.  There  are  thousands  of suppliers  around  the  world  that  cover  the  Group's  needs  for packaging, raw materials, sub-contracting, production equipment, promotional and advertising articles, etc.\n\nIn 2020, despite the context that prevented the organisation of in-person  events,  L'Or\u00e9al  maintained  its  leadership  through  a number of Webinars (titled 'Spread the green vibes' )  around the world in order to share its commitment to decarbonisation ( Science  Based  Targets )  and  to  introduce  its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future programme  more  widely.  More  than  800  suppliers participated in these interactive exchanges.\n\nThe Group's subcontractors and its suppliers of raw materials, packaging,  production  equipment  and  POS/promotional advertising items located in countries identified as being at risk according  to Verisk  Maplecroft are  subject  to  a  mandatory social audit (and prior to any inclusion on the supplier panel) aimed notably at ensuring compliance with applicable laws, Human Rights and labour law. This audit also covers employee safety  and  working  conditions,  and  the  way  in  which  the impact of activities on the environment is taken into account.\n\n94%\n\nwaste recovery in 2020 for administrative sites and research centres.\n\n94%  of  the  waste  generated  on  administrative  sites  and research centres was recovered in 2020. 45 administrative sites\n\nand 5 research centres had a recovery rate of 100% in 2020. 6%  of  waste  was  destroyed  without  recovery  in  2020, representing 229 tonnes.\n\nThe Group also supported its partners by sharing best practices for health measures with them and set up a solidarity fund to assist the local communities of its Solidarity Sourcing programme (farmers,  collectors)  within  the  framework  of  the needs  identified  by  NGOs  in  the  field.  It  responded  to  their urgent  needs  (food  baskets,  hygiene  kits  with  hand  sanitisers and personal protective equipment, etc.).\n\nCertain suppliers also contributed to L'Or\u00e9al's production of hand  sanitisers  by  making  the  supply  of  alcohol  and packaging possible.\n\nThe collaboration with its suppliers, which was in line with the values and raison  d'\u00eatre of  L'Or\u00e9al,  enabled  the  Group  to continue its activities in this extraordinary situation.\n\nThe  social  audits  are  carried  out  on  behalf  of  L'Or\u00e9al  by independent external service providers.\n\nThe  initial  audits  and  re-audits  three  years  later  are  financed by the Group. Follow-up audits that make it possible to verify the  effectiveness  of  the  action  plans  are  paid  for  by  the suppliers.\n\nTen areas are audited:\n\n- \u00b7 child labour;\n- \u00b7 forced labour;\n- \u00b7 the environment, health and safety;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the laws relating to trade unions;\n- \u00b7 non-discrimination;\n- \u00b7 disciplinary practices;\n- \u00b7 harassment or a hostile working environment;\n- \u00b7 due payment of remuneration and benefits;\n- \u00b7 working time; and\n- \u00b7 relations with subcontractors.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  social  audit  is  largely  based  on  the  internationally recognised  SA  8000  standard.  The  Group  has  also  imposed more stringent criteria, particularly with regard to the minimum age  for  child  labour.  It  is  set  at  16  years  of  age  for  all employees  working  for  suppliers,  a  higher  age  limit  than  the minimum  age  required  by  the  Fundamental  Conventions  of the International Labour Organization (ILO).",

This international not-forprofit organisation, of which L'Or\u00e9al has been a member since 2003, invites companies to publish their environmental impact and  provides  them  with  measurement,  evaluation  and communication tools.\n\nIn  2020,  484  suppliers  participated  in  the  CDP Supply  Chain , representing 88% of the 549 suppliers invited. They were selected in the six purchase categories (raw materials, packaging components, production equipment, subcontracting, POS advertising/promotional items and materials and indirect purchases) all over the world, whether large manufacturing groups or SMEs. The average of the 2020 Supplier results was 'C'.\n\nIn the direct purchases category, the suppliers participating in the  CDP  Supply  Chain  programme  account  for  87%  of expenditures made in 2020. Among them, 246 suppliers have assigned their emissions to L'Or\u00e9al. The average score of the direct suppliers is 'C'.\n\nIn December  2015  at  the  time  of  the  COP21,  L'Or\u00e9al strengthened its objectives to accelerate the implementation of  efforts  to  combat  climate  change.  Since  then,  suppliers have been encouraged to:\n\n\u2611\n\n## Key figures\n\n1,268 audits (1) \u2611 were carried out in 2020, which is more than 13,600 audits since the implementation of the reporting tool in  2006,  corresponding  to  8,883  supplier  sites (see  section 3.4.5.3. 'Results of the application of the plan to suppliers' of this document):\n\n- \u00b7 In  the  context  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  technical resources  were  deployed  by  the  Group  to  organise remote  audits  of  sites  and  thus  guarantee  health protection and social compliance. In 2020, several social audits of supplier sites were organised remotely.\n- \u00b7 Follow-up  audits,  which  verify  the  correction  of  nonconformities, represent 34% of the total number of audits conducted  in  2020  and  allowed  74%  of  the  suppliers audited to improve their results; and\n- \u00b7 96%  of  supplier  production  sites  requiring  audits  have been audited at least once.\n- \u00b7 participate in the CDP Supply Chain;\n- \u00b7 set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; and\n- \u00b7 communicate about their action plans in order to succeed in those plans.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  the  suppliers  meeting  this  commitment represented  71%  of  expenditures  on  direct  purchases.  The average score of these suppliers is  'B-',  the  best  score  since the start of the programme.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continues to be recognised by the CDP as one of the companies  most  committed  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions.  The  majority  of  the  Group's  suppliers  who  are partners  of  the  CDP  testifies  to  this  fact.  This  growing commitment results in particular from the strong commitment of L'Or\u00e9al's Purchasing and Environmental teams who transmit results  with  comments  and  opportunities  for  improvement  to the suppliers who participated. In 2020 these teams:\n\n- \u00b7 organised, together with the CDP, meetings to explain and train  on  climate  change, particularly for suppliers of direct purchases, transport and distribution centres;\n- \u00b7 led online conferences for suppliers entering the programme; and\n- \u00b7 continued  to  develop  online  toolboxes  to  help  suppliers understand these issues.\n\nThe  CDP  Supply  Chain  assessment  is  at  the  heart  of  the discussions during annual business reviews, but also throughout the year, in the context of our interactions with suppliers.\n\n4",

L'Or\u00e9al  also encourages  these  suppliers  to  measure,  report  and  set water  consumption  reduction  targets  for  each  of  their production  sites  and  to  deploy  a  water-related  risk assessment and management system.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  suppliers  fulfilling  this  commitment represented  61%  of  the  expenses  incurred  on  all  suppliers, raw materials, packaging components and subcontracting selected. Their average score was B-.\n\n## Encourage strategic suppliers to conduct a selfassessment of their sustainable development policy\n\nIn  2014,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  a  programme for assessing strategic suppliers (1) and  their  Sustainable  Development  policy.  In addition  to  its  own  assessment,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  mandated Ecovadis  to  evaluate  its  suppliers'  sustainable  development policies  with  the  aim  of  fine-tuning  the  analysis  of  supplier performance  and  assisting  suppliers in improving their performance  by  identifying  areas  for  improvement.  The Ecovadis  assessment  allows  L'Or\u00e9al  not  only  to  involve  its suppliers  in  Sustainable  Development,  but  also  to  encourage them  to  develop  their  ethics  policies  with  a  focus  on combating  corruption,  monitoring  the  health  and  safety  of their  employees  and  the  application  of  their  sustainable purchasing policies (see section 4.3.3. 'Human rights policy' of this document).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Associating the Group's suppliers in the CDP Forest Disclosure Project\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  a  target  of  Zero  Deforestation  to ensure  the  traceability  of  products  linked  to  deforestation (palm oil and derivatives, paper, soya, replanting projects, etc.) and has also participated in CDP Forest since 2012.\n\nWith the new CDP Forest programme devoted to the Supply Chain which was launched in 2018, L'Or\u00e9al has encouraged  its  85  main  suppliers  of  paper,  palm  oil  and soya to participate in the CDP Supply Chain .At the end of 2020,  49  of  the  selected  suppliers  had  participated  in  this third year. Suppliers that reported and implemented a zero deforestation policy and related initiatives represented 41% of expenditure in respect of all selected suppliers (raw materials, packaging components and subcontracting).\n\nTheir average score was B-.\n\n## 2020 results\n\nIn  2020,  769  suppliers  conducted  an  Ecovadis  assessment  of their social, environmental and ethical policies, as well as the implementation of those policies by their own suppliers in 2020 (an increase of 56 suppliers compared with 2019). 173 of them represented 99% of the Group's strategic suppliers.\n\nIn 2020, 99% of strategic suppliers completed a self-assessment of their sustainability policy with L'Or\u00e9al's support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Selecting and evaluating strategic suppliers based on their environmental and social performance\n\nThe Group has decided to use its partners' environmental and social performances as a selection criterion. On this basis, the\n\ncommitments under the Sharing Beauty With All programme fit in  with,  and  follow  on  from,  those  in  the  Group's  responsible purchasing policy initiated in 2002 with the L'Or\u00e9al Buy & Care programme. This contributes to sharing best practices and the Company's values and standards with its suppliers.",

In  this  respect,  L'Or\u00e9al's  purchasing  teams  have  defined  five performance pillars that make it possible to assess and choose suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 quality;\n- \u00b7 corporate social responsibility;\n- \u00b7 innovation;\n- \u00b7 the Supply Chain & Service; and\n- \u00b7 competitiveness.\n\nThese pillars form the basis both for daily performance and for long-term strategies.  A  global  scorecard  has  been  deployed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfor  all  purchasing  fields  and  makes  it  possible  to  accurately measure  supplier  results,  in  particular  their  compliance  with their corporate  social  responsibility commitments  which represent 20% of the final assessment.\n\nThe  CSR  strategy  and  action  plans  of  the  suppliers  are  fully integrated into their relationship with L'Or\u00e9al and are therefore discussed  at  strategic  meetings  (Business  Reviews).  Thus, in 2020, 356 business reviews were carried out, a lower number in  2020,  given  the  COVID-19  health  crisis.  The  evaluation  of suppliers  on  the  CSR  pillar  is  based,  in  particular,  on  their compliance  with  their  social  audits,  the  implementation  of Solidarity Sourcing projects and their results in the 'CDP Supply Chain' programme for the reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\nIn 2020, 97% of strategic suppliers were assessed and selected to date on the basis of their environmental and social performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll  the  suppliers  evaluated  represent  more  than  85%  of  total direct purchases (raw materials, packaging components and subcontracting).\n\nTo  give  suppliers  access  to  L'Or\u00e9al  training  tools  designed  to optimise their sustainable development policies, an online site dedicated  to  suppliers  has  been  operational  since  2016.  It offers e-learning modules,  videos,  presentations  on  ethics, climate change, social audits, etc. Today, it is open to all the Group's strategic suppliers and is being progressively expanded to all suppliers.\n\n## Using the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion\n\nThe  objectives  of  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All programme express  L'Or\u00e9al's  conviction  that  the  reduction  of  the environmental footprint of its products has to be accompanied by an improvement in their social and societal benefit.\n\nDue to its many manufacturing and administrative sites all over the  world,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  strongly  involved  in  the  life  of  the  local communities. While being a company  committed  to demonstrating  strong  corporate  citizenship,  L'Or\u00e9al  makes  a contribution  to  many  local  projects.  As  a  general  rule,  the Group's  establishments  and  subsidiaries  build  good  relations with the communities in the areas in which they operate, and make every effort to share their growth with them.\n\nWithin  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  this  goal  has resulted in a commitment to allow more than 100,000 people from underprivileged or poor communities to access work by the end of 2020. This means that L'Or\u00e9al's goal is to support as many people outside the Company as there are employees in the Group.\n\nCreated in 2010, Solidarity Sourcing is L'Or\u00e9al's global inclusive purchasing  programme.  In  2020,  81,138  economically  or socially  vulnerable  people  benefited  from  decent,  lasting employment  under  this  programme  (see  section  4.3.3.5. 'Solidarity sourcing' of this document).\n\nIts  aim is to use the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion.  It  consists  of  dedicating  part  of  its  purchases  to suppliers giving people who are generally excluded from the labour market access to work and a sustainable income.\n\nThe Group is therefore continuing to open up its procurement process to companies who employ people from economically vulnerable communities, including small companies and those who  have  more  difficulty  in  having  access  to  multinational companies.  Fair practices in the business and  equal opportunities  have  gradually  become  major  pillars  of  the Group's Solidarity Sourcing programme, sustainable purchasing strategy, and growth model.\n\nConvinced  of  the  need  to  act  collectively  to  transform  the corporate business model and increase the impact, the Group joined  the  Business  For  Inclusive  Growth  (B4IG)  coalition  from the beginning. This initiative, which was officially launched at the  G7  summit  in  Biarritz  in  August  2019  and  is  housed  within the OECD, covers 40 international companies that decided to join forces around the central issue of fighting inequalities.\n\nIn this framework, L'Or\u00e9al:\n\n- \u25cf also  made  a  commitment  as  the  leader  of  the  working group on inclusive purchasing and the issue of living wages in supply chains;\n- \u25cf provided the complete method and 10-year experience of its  inclusive  purchasing  Solidarity  Sourcing  programme  to the coalition; and\n- \u25cf is  also  a  driver  in  several  business  projects  with  a  positive social impact within the B4IG incubator.\n\n4",

(see section 4.3.1.3.3 Assessing the footprint of products using the SPOT tool)\n\nIn the particular case of raw material purchases, a prerequisite for Solidarity Sourcing projects is that they combine responsible  agricultural  practices,  environmental  protection and  biodiversity,  and  that  they  generate  a  positive  societal impact,  notably  through  the  implementation  of  fair  trade principles.\n\nExamples include the following sourcing:\n\n- \u00b7 the sourcing of shea butter:\n- \u00b7 since 2014, 100% of our shea butter volumes have been sourced  from  Burkina  Faso;  the  Group's  purchasing contracts ensure prefinancing of crops, respect for a fair price,  access  to  training  and  the  establishment  of community projects  for  39,100  women  working  together within groupings of women producers,\n- \u00b7 in  Burkina  Faso,  less  than  3%  of  families  have  access  to electricity and 87% of households use wood for cooking. Energy expenses represents nearly one third of household budgets and 105,000 hectares of forest disappear every year.  Since  its  introduction  in  2016,  the  sustainable  and fair sourcing system has striven to combat energy poverty and  deforestation  by  facilitating  the  distribution  of  socalled  improved  stoves  to  women.  The  project  is multiplying its impacts:\n- -household  wood  consumption  has  reduced  by  half and significant savings are being achieved,\n- -thousands  of  hours  of  unpaid  work  are  avoided (collecting wood, cooking),\n- -working  conditions  have  improved  (60%  less  smoke in rooms), and\n- -CO2 emissions have reduced.\n\nIn  the  ongoing  progress  approach,  2020  saw  significant advances in the shea butter project:\n\n- \u00b7 the shea nuts purchased by the Group obtained the Fair for Life fair trade certification standard, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, 96% of new or renovated products have an improved environmental or social profile.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2017, the SPOT (Sustainable Product Optimisation Tool) was rolled out to all Group brands (except recent acquisitions). This tool  calculates  the  complete  environmental  and  social footprint  of  a  product  in  accordance  with  the  European Commission recommendation (Product Environmental Footprint)  on  the  use  of  common  methods  to  measure  and communicate  the  environmental  performance  of  products and organisations.\n\nA  method  for  measuring  the  social  impact  of  products  has been  jointly  developed  with  internal  expertise  (formula, packaging, plant, stakeholders) and nine international experts in social life cycle assessments (see Section 4.3.1.3.2 'Using the Group's  purchasing  power  to  serve  social  inclusion'  of  this document).\n\n- \u00b7 an  inclusive  pilot  insurance  project  was  created  in collaboration with several partners, including the Group's shea  butter  suppliers  and  an  insurance  specialist.  This unique,  innovative  health  and  crop  loss  micro-insurance project is designed to improve the economic resiliency of producers  by  offering  them  security  in  the  event  of hospitalisations or life-threatening injuries;\n- \u25cf the  sourcing  of  beeswax:  at  the  beginning  of  2020,  a  new project was launched in West Africa in collaboration with the Group's  suppliers.  This  partnership  promises  a  new  activity that will secure and diversify the income of 7,479 producers.\n\n## 4.3.1.3.3. Throughout the product life cycle\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  preservation  of  resources  covers  the  entire product life cycle, from research to use. Through its brands, the Group  involves  the  consumer  in  a  responsible  consumption approach.  The  Packaging  &  Development  teams,  the  CSR team  and  the  laboratories  conduct,  together  with  the Management  Committees  of  the  international  brands, analyses  of  their  portfolios  of  formulas  and  their  packaging. The  aim  is  to  define  sustainable  innovation  plans  in  order  to systematically  identify  the  possible  improvement  drivers  for each range and product in order to activate them.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  the  'Innovating  sustainably'  pillar  of the Sharing Beauty With All programme, the Group has made the  commitment  that  100%  of  L'Or\u00e9al  products  will  have  an improved environmental or social profile by the end of 2020. Whenever a product is created or updated, its environmental or social  profile  is  improved.  The  Group  is  promoting  sustainable innovation  by  reducing  the  environmental  footprint  of  its product  formulas,  by  respecting  biodiversity  through  a  raw materials  sustainable  sourcing  policy,  packaging  eco-design and committing to 'zero deforestation'.",

A standardised version of these different impacts is applied  on  the  basis  of  the  average  impacts  of  a  European consumer.  Then,  to  obtain  a  single  value  for  the  product environmental footprint (formula and packaging), impacts are aggregated  using  a  method  based  on  the Planetary Boundaries developed  by  an  international  team  led  by Professor Johan  Rockstr\u00f6m  of  the Stockholm  Resilience Centre .In  a  final  stage,  the  footprint  is  compared  to  a benchmark in order to obtain a dimensionless score between 0 and 10 which allows the product design teams to measure their progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe SPOT tool has replaced the previously used environmental and social improvement assessment systems for formulas and packaging. SPOT takes account of more criteria and allows for a  more  complete  and  demanding  analysis  where  the different impacts are weighted according to their contribution to  the  product's  overall  impact.  This  tool  has  allowed assessment  the  environmental  and  social  footprint  of  all products developed in 2020.\n\n100% of new or renovated products in 2020 were assessed using the product assessment tool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving the environmental profile of packaging: the 3Rs\n\nPackaging represents a significant  part  of  the  environmental impact of cosmetic products (depends on product category). The  reduction  in  the  environmental  footprint  of  packaging  is therefore  naturally  part  of  the  'Innovating  sustainably' commitment  under  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme and the new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme.\n\nIn  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  Packaging and the Environment policy and strategy based on three pillars, called the '3Rs':\n\n- \u00b7 Respect:  respecting  consumers,  the  environment  and biodiversity;\n- \u00b7 Reduce:  designing  packaging  components  and  finished goods  with  an  optimised  weight  and  size  for  the  service delivered; and\n- \u00b7 Replace:  replace  non-renewable  sourced  materials  with alternative materials such as recycled materials or biosourced  materials  when  with  lower  environmental footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, 85% of new or renovated products have an improved environmental profile due to improved packaging.\n\n## Respect: materials vigilance and preservation of resources\n\nL'Or\u00e9al requires a food-grade level for all materials used in its packaging that is in contact with its products. The Group also takes a proactive approach with its suppliers in order to ensure that  packaging  does  not  contain  any  sensitive  substances. Audits are conducted regularly to ensure the conformity of the packaging components delivered, thus ensuring an uncompromised level of quality and safety for consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al pledged not to produce finished products containing PVC from 1st  January  2018.  This  commitment  has  been  kept since,  no  PVC  packaging  was  used  in  the  manufacture  of finished products in 2020 (scope excluding recent acquisitions).\n\nThese pillars are applied well ahead of each launch, right from the marketing brief, and  are  orchestrated  via  a  global, systematic  eco-design  process  for  the  Group's  packaging, notably  with  the  help  of  the  SPOT  measurement  tool  and methodology.  This  process  is  continually  enhanced  with documents and tools, for example, in the context of the new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the '6R' packaging levers (reduce,  recycle,  replace,  recharge,  refill  and  reinvent). L'Or\u00e9al's  sustainable  development  commitments  are  an integral part of the Group's packaging strategy.\n\nThis  approach has been extended to POS advertising display stands.  An  eco-design  process  based  on  detailed  best practices and key performance indicators has been defined.\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nControlling  the  source  of  materials  used  in  packaging  is  a major challenge that requires responsible sourcing. L'Or\u00e9al has set  itself  the  target  of  using,  for  its  paper,  cardboard  or wooden  packaging,  materials  from  sustainably  managed forests,  exploited  with  respect  for  populations  and  forest ecosystems.  The  paper  and  cardboard  used  for  packaging come from forests that are FSC preferably or PEFC certified (or have  obtained  any  other  certification  recognised  by  PEFC International).  In  2020,  100%  of  the  paper  used  for  product leaflets and 100% of the cardboard used for folding boxes for finished  goods  were  certified  as  coming  from  sustainably managed forests. This certification process is also used for POS advertising  (cardboard  stands,  graphic  prints):  in  2020,  99.4% of the paper/cardboard tonnages used in POS & Promotional materials came from FSC or PEFC sources (this figure covering 99.9% of spend in this category). Since the last quarter of 2020, 99.9%  of  these  volumes  have  been  certified  sustainable:  3 suppliers  (representing  less  than  0.01%  of  our  volumes)  were unable to deliver the certified quality. In 2020, an independent documentary audit covering our entire POS and Promotional scope was conducted to identify areas for improvement to be included  in  our  new  'zero  deforestation'  policy  to  be published in 2021.\n\nSince  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a  member  of  the  Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in France and the FSC branding is the only one claimed on packaging for the Group's products.\n\nFinally, with the aim of improving the recycling of the products put  on  the  market,  the  Group's  brands  have  worked  to provide  consumers  with  detailed  sorting  instructions  and  to design  packaging  that  is  at  most  compatible  with  existing sorting  and  recycling  streams,  eliminating  disruptors  and thereby promoting material recovery after use of the product for a true circular economy.\n\nIn addition, several brands sold by L'Or\u00e9al in France (Ushua\u00efa, L'Or\u00e9al  Paris,  Garnier,  Cadum,  Narta,  Vichy,  and  others),  in partnership with the eco-organism CITEO, have launched and reinforced a sorting awareness campaign (media advertising, etc.) via the 'Trionsenbeaut\u00e9.fr' platform, designed to support consumers in their process to sort their beauty products at the end of life.\n\n## Weight and volume reduction: optimising resources used\n\nThe  reduction  of  the  weight  and  volume  of  product packaging, an integral part of the design, is a major driver for improving  their  environmental  profile.  Every  year,  L'Or\u00e9al launches  new  initiatives  aimed  at  reducing  the  quantity  of materials used in packaging.\n\nA  continuous  process  is  in  place  to  reduce  the  weight  of existing products. As an illustration, two initiatives implemented in 2020 can be mentioned:\n\n- \u00b7 removal of  the  5.5g  plastic  brush  from  Franck  Provost  hair colouring kits, representing 14 tonnes of plastic saved;\n- \u00b7 a reduction of 18% in the weight of the L'Or\u00e9al Paris Studio Line  plastic  caps,  which  represents  11  tonnes  of  plastic saved.\n\nAfter  the  first  PET  compressed  aerosol  deodorant  under  the Ushua\u00efa brand in 2019, L'Or\u00e9al is continuing the initiative with, for example, the Vichy brand, which launched a compressed 100ml  aerosol  equivalent  in  number  of  uses  to  the  same product containing 200 ml with substantial improvement in the environmental impact.\n\nMoreover,  to  reduce  the  resources  intended  for  packaging, L'Or\u00e9al  puts  on  the  market  a  growing  number  of  reusable products,  including  the  reloadable  or  re-fillable  systems  with, for example, products from the Luxury Division: the refill of the Face Color palette from Shu Uemura, the refillable bottles for the My  Way perfume  from  Armani,  and  the  50ml The  Shots Night Reboot Pure Shot serum from YSL.\n\nTo  limit  packaging  cubic  volumes  for  its  finished  products, L'Or\u00e9al  has  established  its  own  procedures  for  reduction  at source. L'Or\u00e9al's requirements are respectful of local regulations,  and  even  exceed  the  regulations  of  most countries.\n\nTo  optimise  the  flow  of  components,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  developed wall-to-wall (1) production to reduce the environmental impact.\n\nTo  evaluate  the  impact  of  its  finished  products,  the  Group makes the following tools available in its design centres:\n\n- \u00b7 an innovative tool, SPOT (Sustainable Product Optimisation Tool) ,  to  meet  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All commitments (see Section 4.3.1.3.3. 'Assess the footprint of products using the SPOT tool' of this document); and\n- \u00b7 a  tool  to  help  in  reducing  the  environmental  impacts  of transportation packaging  for  packaging  components from  suppliers  to  plants  and  finished  products  from  plants to  the  Group's  distribution  centres,  particularly  through optimisation of palletisation.\n\nTo share its research and results with the cosmetics industry, in 2018 the L'Or\u00e9al Group  created  the SPICE initiative (Sustainable  Packaging  Initiative  for  Cosmetics) with  Quantis (an environmental consulting firm). The purpose of SPICE is to share  the  best  practices  and  methodologies  of  each cosmetics  player  in  order  to  harmonise  and  enhance  the methods used to assess the cosmetic packaging environmental  footprint  to  make  it  easier  to  understand  for consumers.  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  its  own  SPOT-PKG  methodology. Tracking of work and achievements, as well as the plan for the coming  months,  are  accessible  on  the  open  platform www.Open-Spice.com. The SPICE initiative now has more than 25  members  worldwide  ( Corporate  members :  Alb\u00e9a,  Aptar, Avon, Axilone, Berry, Bormioli Luigi, Chanel, Clarins, Coty, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Heinz Glass, Hermes, L'Occitane, L'Or\u00e9al, LVMH, Mary Kay,  Meiyume,  Pochet,  Puig,  Schwan  Cosmetics,  Shiseido, Sisley, Unilever  Prestige  and Associate  members: Citeo, Cosmetic  Valley,  Elipso,  Febea,  Feve,  PCPC,  Recyclass).  The dedicated SPICE tool was launched in July 2020.\n\nSince 2018, L'Or\u00e9al has been implementing a program to ecodesign  POS  materials  and  furnishings  with  its  teams  and suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 14 robust and pragmatic golden rules;\n- \u00b7 training support for teams and suppliers;\n- \u00b7 indicator monitoring sharing best practices and inter-team challenesg.\n\nThe  principles  included  recycled  and  biosourced  materials, plus their weight, recyclability and separability. They also cover the optimisation of electricity consumption for the permanent POS.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  testing  and  developing  circular  economy processes with its suppliers and local operators, notably in the context of uninstalling, recycling or donations. L'Or\u00e9al has also moved  towards  sharing  best  practices,  through  the  FEBEA (French Federation for Beauty Companies) guide, for example.",

For our  permanent  POS  materials,  but  also  for  our  free-standing stores, the Group uses design firms that are experts in lighting to  optimise  energy  consumption  without  compromising  the quality  of  in-store  lighting.  The  first  pilot  projects  are  very promising,  in  particular  for  the  reduction  of  environmental impacts. This new  initiative also benefits the Group's distributors, helping them to improve and optimise their energy consumption.\n\n## Replace: new sources of materials\n\nAware that non-renewable resources will not last forever, the Group  seeks  to  replace  them  with  recycled  or  biomass materials.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  using  non-fossil  sources  for 50% of its plastics by 2025, with an initial target of 40% for PET plastic  in  2020.  This  stage  was  exceeded  since  54.8%  of  the world's  quantity  consumed  by  the  Group  is  recycled  PET. Moreover,  in  the  context  of L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future ,  L'Or\u00e9al  is aiming at reaching 100% non-fossil plastic by 2030.\n\nSeveral  brands  use  up  to  100%  recycled  plastic  or  recycled glass  in  their  bottles.  57,096  tonnes  of  recycled  materials (1) , including 28,439 tonnes in primary and secondary packaging, saved the equivalent amount of virgin materials in 2020.  54.8%  of  the  PET  quantity  consumed  worldwide  by  the Group is recycled PET. For example, the 500g jars of the Bleach Paste  line  from  L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel  are  made  from  100% recycled  PET  plastic,  thus  saving  up  to  44  tonnes  of  virgin plastic each year. The same efforts are being made on both tube and bottle PE containers (up to 100% PE PCR).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  brands  whose  bottles  are  now  made  with 100% recycled PET, such as Garnier and Elvive, the SLM gloss bottles  from  Maybelline  in  Asia  are  made  with  50%  recycled PET. This change has still allowed to save 27 tonnes of virgin PET per year.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  a  partnership  on  innovation  in responsible packaging , in 2019 L'Or\u00e9al and Alb\u00e9a developed a  breakthrough  innovation:  the  first  cosmetics  tube  with cardboard, thus replacing a significant portion of plastic with a renewable material. This innovation became a reality in June 2020 for the La Roche Posay and Garnier brands enabling a reduction in plastic weight as high as 49%.\n\nRegarding  glass  packaging,  Sanoflore  enriched  the  Group's existing  'recycled  glass'  initiatives  by  launching  its  jar  made with 25% recycled glass thanks to an improved formula in 2020. This trend has spread to other categories than skin care, such as makeup  and  perfumes,  which  offer  products  with packaging containing up to 10% recycled glass. An example of this is the My Way perfume refill from Armani. In addition, the first loop  of  the  premium  glass  circular  economy  was established by L'Or\u00e9al in 2018, in partnership with glassmaker Pochet.  Glass  waste  from  'Perfumery  and  Cosmetics'  was recycled to produce the 'Flowerbomb' bottles from the Viktor & Rolf brand (for their Christmas editions).\n\nIn  order to find new solutions to optimise the end of life of its packaging,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  collaborating  with  an  ecosystem  of partners to develop better recycling technologies:\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al has created a consortium with Carbios to develop a biorecycling process using very specific enzymes that will recycle PET plastics and polyester fibers more broadly. This innovative process will produced a recycled PET equivalent to virgin PET. In April 2019, Suntory, Nestl\u00e9 Waters and PepsiCo joined this consortium;\n- \u00b7 since  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  signed  a  partnership  with LOOP Industries \u00ae  to  produce  food  quality  PET  through  chemical recycling;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  signed  a  partnership  with  PURECYCLE  in  order  to produce recycled food quality PP.\n- \u00b7 In  November  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  signed  a  partnership  with Lanzatech and Total to develop a very innovative process to  convert  captured  carbon  from  the  waste  of  industrial sites (steel mills) into packaging materials.\n\nIn  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the New  Plastics  Economy (NPEC) initiative  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation,  the  objective  of which  is  to  rethink  the  life-cycle  of  plastic  so  that  plastic packaging never becomes a waste product, and is re-inserted into  the  circular  economy  in  the  form  of  materials  with biological or technical value. Since 2018, L'Or\u00e9al has been a partner  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation  (NPEC),  with  the goal, for example, of using 100% reusable, recyclable and/or compostable plastic packaging by  2025.  This  ambition  is  one of  L'Or\u00e9al's  major  commitments  within  the  framework  of  the Ellen MacArthur Global Commitment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

To do so, the Group gives  preference,  in  particular,  to  the  use  of  renewable  raw materials (1) and  ensures  that  they  are  responsibly  sourced. L'Or\u00e9al  has  adopted  green  chemistry  principles  to  promote the use of renewable raw materials, to design products serving to reduce waste and preserve the water cycle. For more than\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nten  years,  green  chemistry  has  been  a  catalyst  for  L'Or\u00e9al's sustainable  innovation  policy.  In  the  broadest  sense,  green chemistry aims to prevent upstream pollution and to combat the use and contamination of the environment at source. The increasing use of plant-based ingredients presents risks in terms of  supply  related  to  the  consequences  of  climate  change (availability  and  price),  and  can  also  result  in  environmental consequences  through  the  cultivation  of  the  crops  that produce  these  ingredients  (deforestation,  soil  depletion, consequences  on  biodiversity,  for  instance).  Between  2013 and  2020,  the  percentage  of  raw  materials  by  volume increased  from  43%  to  59%.  Over  the  same  period,  the percentage in volume raw materials meeting green chemistry criteria  increased  from  less  than  10%  to  29% (2) .  This  represents more  than  775  raw  materials.  In  2020,  27  new  raw  materials based  on  green  chemistry  principles were  registered, representing 32% (2) of the total.\n\n59%  (by  volume)  of  the  raw  materials  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al  are renewable, i.e. roughly  1,568  raw  materials  from  nearly 343 plant species from over 100 countries.\n\nIn 2020, of the Group's newly registered raw materials, 53% are renewable and 32% are based on green chemistry principles.\n\n## Products marketed in 2020 had a proportion of renewable raw materials above 98%\n\n| Ushua\u00efa - Hibiscus - Brume Bio    | Ushua\u00efa    |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|\n| Botanicoil cleansing oil          | Shu Uemura |\n| Romarin Lotion anti-imperfections | Decleor    |\n| Deep purifying cleanser           | Lanc\u00f4me    |\n\nL'Or\u00e9al finalised the traceability campaigns launched with all its  suppliers,  thus  making  it  possible  for  100%  of  plant-based ingredients to now be traced to their country of production, or even as far as the biomass production site.\n\nWith  regards  to  raw  materials,  the  Group  promotes  green chemistry  principles  which  encourage  the  development  of ingredients with a favourable environmental profile made from plant  raw  materials,  which  minimise  the  number  of  synthesis stages,  the  consumption  of  non-toxic  solvents  and  energy, and the production of by-products.\n\n## Respect for biodiversity and societal contribution\n\nIn 2018, as part of the Act4nature initiative, L'Or\u00e9al set a goal of having  100%  renewable  raw  materials  coming  from sustainable sources by 2030. To be included in this category, they  must  be  traceable,  with  an  identified  botanic  and geographic origin. The respect for Human  Rights in accordance  with  ILO  principles  is  now  expected  throughout the  production  chain.  At  the  level  of  plant  growing  and harvesting, attention  is also placed  on  the  economic development of the producers and respect for the traditional knowledge coming from biodiversity in accordance with the principles of the Nagoya Protocol (preservation of biodiversity, and  fair  and  equitable  sharing  of  the  benefits  with  local communities).\n\nBy relying on sustainable sourcing for the supply of renewable raw  materials,  L'Or\u00e9al  contributes  to  the  social  inclusion  of disadvantaged population groups while ensuring environmentally  friendly  sourcing.  Fair  trade  and  equal opportunities  have  gradually  become  major  pillars  of  the Solidarity Sourcing responsible purchasing programme launched  in  2010  (see  Section  4.3.3.5.  'Measures  taken  in favour of communities' of this document).",

        "page_content": "## L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nIn  2020,  100%  of  the  renewable  raw  materials  used  by  the Group were reassessed on the basis of criteria such as respect for  biodiversity  and  forced  labour  (see  SCAN  Index  below). Out  of  the  343  plant  species  that  are  the  source  of  the renewable raw materials used by the Group, around 12.5% (2) present significant Biodiversity challenges (endangered species,  impact  of  production  on  natural  environments) depending  on  their  geographic  origin  and  the  method  of extraction or production used. They are the subject of specific action plans initiated  with  suppliers  and,  if  necessary,  benefit from  the  systematic  support  of  independent  external  third parties, in order to manage the real impacts on the territories of origin of the ingredients.\n\n- \u00b7 For the palm oil and its by-products segment, which are the subject  of  a  specific  'Zero  deforestation'  approach  (see below),  at  year-end  2020,  100%  of  the  supplies  were covered by action plans with the suppliers concerned.\n- \u00b7 For  other  streams  of  renewable  raw  materials,  which represent 17% of the portfolio of renewable raw materials in volumes  and  74%  in  number,  L'Or\u00e9al,  on  the  basis  of environmental,  social and  economic  indicators  from external  databases  (IHDI  of  the  UNDP,  EPI  from  Yale University, Verisk  Maplecroft  Country  Inde x),  has  defined indicators  of 'sustainable  sourcing  challenges' to  assess renewable  raw  material  streams  with  regard  to  their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsustainability.  These  indicators  are  consolidated  within  the SCAN  (Sustainable  CAaracterisatioN)  index,  allowing  the Group  to  prioritise  the  implementation  of  its  sustainable sourcing  action plans. The Group updates the information collected  regularly.  66%  of  volumes  and  34%  of  raw materials  identified  as  representing  sustainable  sourcing challenges, according to the SCAN index, are already the subject of plans or improvement initiatives with the relevant suppliers to ensure sustainable supply. The goal is for 100% of the  Group's  renewable  raw  materials  to  come  from sustainable  sources.  To  achieve  this,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a support  and  training  programme  for  more  than  200 suppliers  on  the  issues  of  sustainable sourcing of  raw materials in order to guarantee the traceability of the raw materials  delivered  to  L'Or\u00e9al  and  ensure  the  associated streams are secure. Depending on the level of environmental and/or social risk identified on these streams, suppliers  are  notably  asked  to  deploy  the  field  audit procedure  for  producers  (88  indicators),  developed  by L'Or\u00e9al with the support of the Rainforest Alliance NGO and reviewed in 2019 by EcoCert, The Biodiversity  Consultancy and The  Danish  Institute  for  Human  Rights .  They  are  also invited to rely on  sustainable sourcing certifications adapted  to  the  challenges  of  their  streams  ( Fair  Trade , Sustainable Agricultural Network , Organic, etc.).\n\nIn 2020, 69% of new or renovated products have an improved social/environmental profile due to a new formula incorporating renewable raw materials that are sustainably sourced or based on green chemistry principles.\n\n## Bees of Africa: sustainable sourcing of beeswax in West Africa\n\nBeeswax is  the  most  consumed  natural  wax  by  L'Or\u00e9al.  A wide  range  of  products,  from  baby  care  to  makeup contains beeswax for its emulsifying or stiffening properties.\n\nThis  market  is  dominated  by  China,  where  production  is faced  with  problems  of  traceability  and  adulteration. Beeswax  production  in  Europe  is  low  and  primarily dedicated  to  artisanal  markets.  At  the  same  time, beekeeping  is  threatened  by  the  collapse  of  colonies ( Colony Collapse Disorder -  CCD) which are widespread in all countries with an intensive agricultural system.\n\nIn  West Africa, bee colonies benefit from better conditions in an environment that is less impacted by farming activities, and the wax is not yet recovered by beekeepers since they only sell the honey. There are also challenges to be met in the  region:  weak  organisation  of  beekeepers,  a  lack  of technical  knowledge  and  modern  equipment  to  ensure optimal well-being of the bees and good quality beeswax.\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al, its supplier Koster Keunen and the NGO Fair Match Support (FMS) signed a Solidarity Sourcing partnership  on  beeswax  in  Western  Africa  aimed  at increasing the incomes of around 10,000 beekeepers while promoting  sustainable  beekeeping  practices  (inspired  by the European bio standard) to ensure the well-being of the bees. The project will lead to the installation of several hives in areas of shea tree populations and to plantations of fruit or nut trees. The produce from fruit trees would thereby be improved by the increased pollination provided by the hives and lead to better harvests for the local populations.\n\n4",

Since 2007, L'Or\u00e9al has been deploying action plans in order to guarantee a sustainable supply of agricultural raw materials that could be the cause of deforestation, including palm oil, soybean extract, and fibrewood-based products.\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al consumed 266 tonnes of soybean extract and 48 tonnes of soybean extract derivatives. In 2020, 100% of the soybean  extract  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al  and  coming  from  Latin America is from a land project certified RTRS, Bio and Fair For Life ,  aimed at supporting 36 small soybean producers in Brazil and Paraguay, or from certified sources (IP Identity Preserved Proterra ).  Most  derivatives  come  from  areas  classed  without risk of deforestation.\n\nRegarding  materials  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al  for  its  packaging,  100% of the paper used for notices and product leaflets and 100% of  the  cardboard  used  for  boxes  is  certified  as  coming  from sustainably managed forests (FSC or PEFC certified).\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al consumed less than 310 tonnes of palm oil and 75,000 tonnes of palm oil derivatives (which come from palm fruit  pulp)  and  palm  kernel  oil  (extracted  from  palm  fruit kernels).  These  two  oils  are  used  to  produce  glycerine,  fatty acids  and  fatty  alcohols  which  form  part  of  the  composition of the Group's products.\n\nAs  part  of  its  'zero  deforestation'  commitment,  L'Or\u00e9al  is rolling  out  a  specific  strategy  for  palm  oil  derivatives,  in partnership  with  all  stakeholders  (producers,  NGOs  and suppliers):\n\n- \u00b7 100%  of  purchases  of  palm  oil,  and  palm  oil  and  palm kernel  derivatives  have  been  certified  as  sustainable according to the RSPO criteria (www.rspo.org) since 2012; and\n- \u00b7 92%  of  the  main  derivatives  come  from  sources  that  are identified (as far as mills).\n\nIn terms of certification, 100% of the volumes of palm oil used by  L'Or\u00e9al  meet  the  standards  and  procedures  of  the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), via one of its most demanding traceability models, the SG (Segregated) model. 100%  of  the  derivatives  are  also  certified.  L'Or\u00e9al  had increased the proportion of its physically certified purchases to 95% of RSPO Mass Balance at the end of 2020, compared with 70% in 2019 and 54% in 2018. The remainder continues to be covered  by  the  RSPO  Book  &  Claim  model.  To  complete  its certification  objectives,  L'Or\u00e9al  made  a  commitment  for  at least 30% of its volumes to be connected to field projects that support  small,  independent  planters.  In  2020,  approximately 30%  of  these  volumes  were  physically  connected  to sustainable sourcing projects in Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  its  'Zero  Deforestation'  commitment made in 2014, the Group had pledged to trace the main palm and palm kernel derivatives that it uses as far as the mills by the  end  of  2015.  This  was  a  difficult  task  as  the  process  for transforming  derivatives  involved  a  large  number  of  players and many branches of the supply chains.\n\nAn  initial  phase  involving  a  survey  was  conducted  in  2014, with the support of a firm of independent experts, of L'Or\u00e9al's strategic  suppliers,  who  supply  more  than  half  its  palm  and palm kernel derivatives.  Since  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  progressively updated  and  enriched  its  data  collection  by  extending  the scope to cover all suppliers in order to be able to trace and identify  the  origin  of  100%  of  its  main  palm  and  palm  kernel derivatives.  The  results  of  this  work  show  that  Malaysia  and Indonesia  are  the  main  countries  from  which  supplies  are obtained and that, for 2019, 98% of these volumes of palm and palm  kernel  derivatives  can  be  traced  to  the  refineries,  92% to the mills and 27% as far as the plantations. (1)\n\nIn 2020, on the basis of this work and with the goal of greater transparency, for the third consecutive year, L'Or\u00e9al published the list of the 970 mills indirectly connected to its supply chain and representing over 90% of its palm derivative volumes, as well as the list of its direct suppliers of derivatives.\n\nIn 2016, L'Or\u00e9al rounded out its evaluation and selection tools for palm oil and palm kernel derivative suppliers with a specific tool,  the  Sustainable  Palm  Index,  to  assess  the  level  of commitment, progress and achievements of its direct suppliers in  favour  of  sustainable  palm  oil.  This  tool  is  used  annually  to evaluate  suppliers'  progress  towards  the  zero  deforestation objective  and  their  level  of  compliance  with  the  Group's requirements. It was first made public in 2016 to enable it to be used by all players in the supply chain.\n\nIn  2018,  to  take  its  commitment  further,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the development  of  a  new  tool  in  collaboration  with  ZSL (Zoological  Society  of  London)  and  Transitions,  to  evaluate refineries and crushers (which extract the oil from the kernels), on  the  basis  of  their  reporting,  policies  and  procedures.  The indicators  used  for  this  evaluation  were  aligned  with  the requirements of the Group's standards in respect of deforestation.  This  tool  was  made  public  in  2019  and  is  now available.\n\nAt mill level, since 2016, the L'Or\u00e9al Group has relied on Global Forest Watch's  risk  assessment  tool  to  ensure  that  no derivative traced to mills is linked to deforestation.\n\nIn  2018,  the  procedure  for  dealing  with  cases  of  noncompliance with our zero deforestation commitment by direct or indirect suppliers was also made public.\n\nSince  November  2019,  in  order  to  contribute  to  the  sector transformation,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a  founding  member  of Action for Sustainable Derivatives (ASD), an initiative coordinated  by  BSR  and  Transitions  within  which  L'Or\u00e9al  has actively contributed, in particular by sharing all its methodologies and tools developed since 2014.",

The  project  aims  to  support  12,500  independent small  farmers  in  the  next  five  years  in  the  improvement  of production practices with the goal of preventing deforestation  activities,  while  improving  their  standard  of living. The involvement of all stakeholders in the supply chain to  support  the  project,  from  the  mill  to  the  derivatives manufacturer,  reinforces  traceability  and  improves  the control  of  production  practices  to  ensure  the  absence  of deforestation.\n\n## Reducing the environmental footprint of formulas\n\nMost of the ingredients used in the formulas (>90% by weight) have an end of life in domestic wastewater, and are treated by  more  or  less  advanced  sanitation  systems  depending  on the geographic area.\n\nAll formulas  marketed  by  the  Group  are  safe  for  the environment. However, as some of the ingredients used in the formulas  may  have a  more  or  less  significant  environmental impact,  L'Or\u00e9al  opened  its  first  environmental  research laboratory in 1995 to evaluate and reduce the environmental footprint  of  its  formulas.  Through  this  initiative,  the  Group  has developed expertise with regard to the potential impacts of its cosmetic  products  on  aquatic  environments.  Raw  materials used in the formulation of products from the design stage are evaluated  in  such  a  way  as  to  allow  a  strict  selection  of ingredients.\n\nIn 2020,  9,675  small  independent  producers  received training  in  best  agricultural  practices  offered  by  SNV.  The increase  in  the  quality  of  the  crops  and  the  yields  from plantations  secured  and  boosted  their  income,  which  is  a major challenge of Solidarity Sourcing .\n\nSince  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  worked  in  a  research  partnership with  the  French  Agricultural  Research  and  International Cooperation Organisation (CIRAD) to assess the impacts of the agricultural practices of the small independent producers  of  two  project  cooperatives  on  soil  quality  and the productivity of palm plantations. The results obtained in 2020 will permit the formulation of individual recommendations  to  farmers  to  improve  their  agricultural practices and reduce their environmental impact. In order to boost the territorial impact of the project, L'Or\u00e9al is also supporting the restoration of 22,000 hectares of peat bogs in the  region,  contributing  in  this  way  to  the  protection  of  a biodiversity corridor and preventing the emission of 100,000 tonnes  of  CO2  in  2020  recovered  as  part  of  the  Group's Carbon Balanced Programme.\n\n## Measuring the environmental impact of formulas\n\nIn 2013, an index was developed to quantify the environmental performance of a cosmetic formula in respect of the aquatic environment. To do this, a calculation method for the Water Footprint specific to cosmetic products was also applied to the entire portfolio of formulas (performance index for  a  formula  based  on  the  environmental  profile  of  its ingredients  in  terms  of  biodegradability  and  aquatic  ecotoxicity).  This  methodology has now been integrated into the SPOT tool.\n\nFor  several  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  carried  out  analyses  of  the  life cycles  of  its  products  in  order  to  identify,  evaluate  and improve their environmental impact.\n\nSince 2017, the SPOT tool, applied to all of the Group's brands, has been used to calculate the full environmental and social footprint of the Group's created or renovated products.\n\nIn  2020,  39%  of  created  or  renovated  products  have  an improved environmental profile due to a new formula with a lower environmental footprint. Because of the Covid-19 health crisis,  the  number of new product launches was reduced this year, which impacted this indicator.\n\nIn 2020, 39% of new or renovated products have an improved environmental profile due to a new formula with a lower environmental footprint.\n\n## Improving biodegradability through eco-design\n\nThe Group  is working to measure  and  increase  the biodegradability  of  its  formulas  and  reduce  their  water footprint. These two parameters have been integrated in the SPOT product eco-design tool.\n\nTo  classify  the  products  according  to  the  benefits  offered  to the  consumer,  all  19  product  types  manufactured  by  the Group (shampoos, hair care products, shower gels, skin care products, cleansers, hair colours, styling products, deodorants,\n\nsun  care  products,  make-up,  perfumes,  etc.)  were  analysed. After  defining  143  product  categories  and  screening  more than 40,000 formulas between 2014 and 2015, the performance  of  each  consumer  benefit  category  was established  to  allow  eco-design  of  products  using  the  SPOT tool  to  ensure  that  all  new  formulas  are  developed  with  the goal  of  an  improved  environmental  profile  with  identical benefits  for  the  consumer.  It  is  used  by  all  teams  of  product formulators to assess the biodegradability and water footprint whenever new formulas are created.\n\n4",

Over the same period, the overall water footprint of the Group's formula portfolio was reduced by 3% in absolute value and by 15% in intensity (1) .\n\nIn  2020,  Biotherm  launched  its  sunscreen  innovation,  which  is eco-designed and respects aquatic life. Its formula base is 97% biodegradable  and  the  bottle  is  100%  recycled  and recyclable.  Ten  years  of  research  was  necessary  to  obtain  a sunscreen as respectful of aquatic life, without compromising\n\nin  the  filtering  performance  and  sensory  feel.  These  efforts were  also  recognised  by  the  official  and  independent certification label, the 'Nordic Swan Ecolabel', a Scandinavian  Ecolabel  that  recognises  sunscreen  products with the lowest environmental impact.\n\nAmong  the  new  products  launched  in  2020,  the  products below have formulas with biodegradability levels of over 98% across L'Or\u00e9al's Divisions:\n\n| Hyalu B5 Serum                                         | La Roche-Posay     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Pure Shots Hydra Bounce Essence-In-Lotion              | Yves Saint Laurent |\n| D\u00e9odorant Senteur \u00c9corce de C\u00e9drat                     | La Proven\u00e7ale Bio  |\n| Elvive Dream Lengths Nourishing Waves Waterfall Mousse | L'Or\u00e9al Paris      |\n| Fructis Dry Shampoo Coco Water                         | Garnier            |\n\nThe Sharing  Beauty  with  All programme,  in  its  'Innovate sustainably' component, led to a very significant increase of 59%  in  the  percentage  of  raw  materials  of  renewable  origin and  produced  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  of  green chemistry  (32%).  The  biodegradability  of  the  portfolio  of  raw materials  reached  80%  in  2020.  Within  the  framework  of  the 'Innovate sustainably' component of the Sharing Beauty With All programme, 96% of L'Or\u00e9al's products have an improved environmental or social profile.\n\n## Raising awareness among consumers about sustainable lifestyle choices\n\nThe Group wants to empower all L'Or\u00e9al consumers to make sustainable consumption choices.\n\nThe SPOT environmental and social assessment tool, rolled out to  all  of  the  Group's  brands  (excluding  recent  acquisitions), established  the  environmental  and  social  profile  of  all  new products in a process dating back to 2017.\n\n## Displaying the environmental and social impact of the products\n\nPursuant to the pledge made in 2013 at the launch of its first Sustainability Programme, Sharing Beauty With All, L'Or\u00e9al has developed  a  labelling  system  designed  to  inform  consumers on  the  environmental  and  social  impact  of  its  products  to allow them to make enlightened consumption choices.\n\nThe  labelling  is  built  on  the  SPOT  methodology  to  measure impacts, which was  co-created  with  11  independent international experts in accordance with the directives of the European Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), to scientifically measure the environmental and social impact of a product.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis  tool  for  comparing  between  two  products  of  the  same category thus provides an accurate vision of the impact of a Group  product,  taking  into  consideration,  at  this  date, 14 planetary impact factors such as greenhouse gas emissions, hydric stress, ocean acidification or the impact on biodiversity.\n\nThese impacts are measured at each step in the life cycle of a product and calculated by taking into account not only the cultivation of raw materials, the manufacture and transport of the product, but also the usage phase by the consumer and the recyclability of the packaging.\n\nIn  the  case of cosmetics, as the carbon and water footprints are the most important impact factors, the Group made the choice  to  communicate  a  total  environmental  impact  note combined with a focus on carbon and water footprints.\n\nThis  information  will  be  accessible  to  consumers  on  the product website. The first phase of the roll-out began with the Garnier hair-care category in July 2020.\n\nAt  the  same  time  as  the  deployment  of  this  tool,  89%  of  the brands  assessed  their  environmental  and  social  impact  at year-end  2020  and  made  commitments  to  improve  their impact  (see  section  4.3.1.3.3.  'Throughout  the  product  life cycle'  of  this  document).  100%  of  the  international  brands present in the Group in 2013 have assessed their environmental  and  social  impact,  enabling  the  Group  to achieve  its  objective;  the  acquisitions  made  since  that  date are not included in this calculation.\n\nIn 2020, 100% of the international brands present in the Group since 2013 have assessed their environmental and social impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

'Encouraging strategic suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions' of this document);\n- \u00b7 the commitment made by the Group to reduce the impact of  downstream  transport  by  -20%  per  sales  unit  per kilometre  between  2011  and  2020  (see  section  4.3.1.3.1. 'Reducing  emissions  from  product  transport'  (Scope  3  as per the GHG Protocol' of this document);\n- \u00b7 the  Carbon  Balanced  commitment,  stipulating  that  the residual emissions for Scopes 1 and 2, and the downstream transport category of Scope 3, be offset in 2020 thanks to an ambitious insetting programme: the remainder of these emissions  must  be  balanced  via  the  reduction  of  carbon emissions  in  sustainable  sourcing  channels  for  certain  raw materials, in partnership with suppliers (see section 4.3.1.3.1. 'Carbon Balanced project: towards a low-carbon company by the end of 2020' of this document);\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al, through its Science Based Targets (SBT) commitment validated by the initiative at the end of 2017, has sought to cover  all  impacts  associated  with  its  value  chain.  The commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in 2030  (baseline  2016)  comprises  all  of  Scopes  1,  2,  and 3  (according  to  the  GHG  Protocol)  (see  section  4.3.1.4.2. 'Science  Based  Targets  commitment'  of  this  document); and\n- \u00b7 finally,  in  June  2020,  in  the  context  of  the  launch  of  its L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme consistent with its Science Based  Targets (SBT)  commitment  (see  section  4.3.1.4.2. 'Science Based Targets (SBT) commitment' in this document),  the  Group  specified  its  2030  roadmap  by committing  to  a  reduction,  from  2016,  of  25%  per  finished product  in  the  emissions  associated  with  its  product  use phase, a 50% reduction in the emissions associated with its strategic suppliers and a 50% reduction per finished product in the emissions associated with product transportation.\n- \u00b7 CO2 emissions in 2020 (Scopes 1, 2, 3) over the entire Group (industrial sites, administrative sites and research centres):\n\n| (in thousands of tonnes of CO2 equivalent)   | Scope 1   | Scope 2   | Scope 3   | Scopes 1, 2 & 3   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Group                                        | 43.1      | 12.6      | 11,169    | 11,225            |\n| Industrial sites                             | 39.0  \u2611   | 7.0  \u2611    | -         | -                 |\n| Administrative sites and research centres    | 4.1       | 5.7       | -         | -                 |",

Science Based Targets commitment\n\nIn 2015, L'Or\u00e9al undertook to define Science Based Targets to reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  across  its  entire  value chain  and  over  the  long  term,  in  accordance  with  the  Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nIn  December  2017,  the  SBT  initiative  validated  the  Group's proposal: Thus, by 2030, L'Or\u00e9al is committed to reducing by 25% in absolute value the greenhouse gas emissions of Scopes 1,  2  and  3  (with  full  coverage  of  the  items  of  Scope  3,  in accordance with the definition of the GHG Protocol ),  with  a reference  year  of  2016;  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  is  committed  in particular to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sites it operates  by  100%  by  2025,  through  a  programme  of  energy efficiency and a supply of renewable energy exclusively.\n\nThese  commitments  were  revaluated  in  2019  over  Scopes  1 and 2 by the SBT initiative and considered to be in compliance with the new SBT 1.5\u00b0C criteria.\n\nRoadmaps are  currently  being  deployed  within  the  different business  lines  (packaging,  research,  sourcing,  supply  chain, etc.)  so  that  each  one  contributes  to  the  reduction  of  CO2 emissions  in  Scopes  1,  2  and  3.  Specific  tracking  has  been started and will allow each of the segments to monitor its own performance starting in 2020.\n\n## 4.3.1.4.3. UN Global Compact Pledge: 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C'\n\nIn  September  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  'Business  Ambition  for 1.5\u00b0C' initiative, a call to action launched by a broad coalition of companies, civil society and UN leaders, thus reaffirming its leadership on climate action. The Group has committed to net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, contributing in this way to limiting the  increase  in  global  temperature  to  1.5\u00b0C  above  preindustrial  levels,  a  necessary  condition  for  limiting  the  worst impacts of climate change  according  to  the  latest conclusions of climate science.\n\n4",

Adapting the model to the climate emergency: alignment of the Group with the TCFD principles\n\nConscious  of  the  consequences  of  climate  change,  L'Or\u00e9al has  initiated  its  transition  towards  an  increasingly  responsible business  development  model  in  which  the  non-financial challenges  are  placed  at  the  same  level  as  the  financial challenges  that  contribute  to  its  overall  performance.  The ambition is to design an innovative low-carbon business model and to make a contribution to the major collective challenge that is represented by limiting climate change.\n\nThe  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  rolled  out  globally since 2013 and supported at all levels of the organisation, has helped establish a culture in which environmental impacts and climate change  are  taken  into  account,  increasingly influencing  the  decision-making  process  of  each  of  the Group's  'M\u00e9tiers'  (business  activities)  each  day,  as  well  as their  major  projects,  as  shown  by  the  policies,  programmes and outcomes described above.\n\nAs the acceleration  of  the  environmental  and  social challenges to be met calls for a more radical transformation, in June 2020 L'Or\u00e9al announced its new sustainability programme L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future , with  a  new  series  of particularly  ambitious  objectives  for  2030.  The  efforts  to combat climate change is an integral part of the Group's new ambitions  and  are  aligned  with  the  Science  Based  Targets commitment validated in 2017.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  made  a  public  commitment  in  2020  to  adopt  the recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related Financial  Disclosure  (TCFD),  which  encourages  companies  to include  climate  issues  in  their  strategy,  and  to  provide consistent, reliable and clear information to allow investors to take  into  account  climate-related  financial  risks  in  their decisions.\n\nAlong with this dynamic move towards a low-carbon transition, L'Or\u00e9al  intends  to  fully  manage  the  risks  and  opportunities related to the challenges of climate change, anticipate their effects,  and  ensure  its  resilience  by  adapting  its  business model,  its  governance  and  decision-making  processes,  its Research and Operations with respect for its values and sense of  purpose (raison  d'\u00eatre) to  'Create  the  Beauty  that  moves the world'.\n\n## Governance\n\nEvery  year,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Board  of  Directors  determines  the Group's strategic directions, which integrate the challenges of climate change and, more generally, the issues of sustainable development.\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  reports  directly  to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and reports on the Group's activities every year to the Board of Directors or to the Strategy and Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Sustainability  Officer  is  responsible  for  the formulation and implementation of the sustainable development strategy,  assesses  and  manages  the  climate-related  risks  and opportunities  Groupwide,  through  the  action  plans  of  the sustainability  programmes  ( Sharing  Beauty  with  All and  now L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future ). She  leads  an  internal  sustainability committee, which includes experts  responsible  for  the  rollout  of the sustainability programme within Operations, Research, Public Affairs, Communication and the Brands.\n\nShe  guarantees  the  implementation  of  the  orientations  and decisions  adopted  by  this  Committee.  She  also  defines  and deploys  annual  targets  across  L'Or\u00e9al's  value  chain,  and assesses  the  level  of  commitment  of  all  the  brands,  Country Managers  and  subsidiaries  in  implementing  the  sustainable development  strategy.  This  implementation  determines  a portion of the variable remuneration of the Brand and Country Managers.\n\nThe  mission  of  the  Sustainable  Finance  Department,  created in 2020, is to integrate the climate challenges from a financial standpoint.  This  Department,  which  reports  to  the  Chief Administrative  and  Financial  Officer  and  to  the  Chief Corporate  Responsibility  Officer,  aims  at  developing  and directing Sustainable Finance actions. This means, in particular, building  a  new  income  statement  model  that  includes sustainable  development  elements  and  allows  the  Group  to measure  its  efforts,  especially  with  respect  to  the  carbon impact, coordinate finance actions, and  continue  to incorporate  sustainable  development  in  its  decisions  on investing and acquisitions.\n\n## Strategy\n\nFor  the  main  environmental  risks,  the  concept  of  risk  covers both  risks  related  to  the  impact  of  the  Group's  business activities  on  its  ecosystem  and  the  risks  of  the  impact  of climate change in the short and medium term on its business model, activity and financial performance .\n\nThe  Group  has  identified  seven  principal  risks  and  six opportunities  relating  to  climate  change  that  have  potential consequences  for  its  activities  and  the  development  of  its strategy.\n\nIn-depth analyses of climate risks were conducted: identification and  a  dynamic  approach  to  the  risks, assessment of their impact using scenarios developed on two assumptions  based  on  the  2\u00b0C  and  4\u00b0C  paths,  assumptions that  also  integrate  political,  economic,  social,  technological, environmental and legal trends (PESTEL analysis).\n\n## Scenarios\n\n- \u00b7 a  'governed  transition'  scenario  ('TG')  on  the  basis  of global  warming  of  around  +2\u00b0C  in  2100.  This  scenario  is based on strong international cooperation, major increased consumer awareness of climate and external effects and, globally,  actions  to  anticipate  and  attenuate  climate change in a more responsible world based on solidarity,\n- \u00b7 'a  disorganised  transition'  scenario  ('DT')  on  the  basis  of global  warming  of  around  +4\u00b0C  in  2100.  This  scenario  is based on assumptions of limited international cooperation, growing  tensions  on  trade,  economic  stagnation  or slowdown  and,  generally,  a  primarily  reactive  adaptation to climate change.\n\nThese  L'Or\u00e9al  scenarios  integrate  pre-existing  scenarios  or assumptions  based  on  scientific  content  as  input  data, particularly  the  RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) -AR5) of the IPCC (Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change)  to  assess  the physical  risks  for  the  governed  transition  and  disorganised transition respectively.\n\nMore specifically, studies of the impact of climate change on plant-based  raw  materials  sourcing  were  also  conducted. Assumptions  have  also  been  made  on  the  paths  of  carbon pricing  and  consumer  preferences,  the  main  factors  in L'Or\u00e9al's  exposure to climate-related transition risks.  This  work will allow the Group to adapt policies and define its strategic goals.",

        "page_content": "## L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nTwo  timeframes  were  considered:  a  medium-term  2030 timeframe,  aligned  with  scientific  targets,  and  a  long-term 2050  timeframe,  to  detect  significant  trends  in  the  physical climate variables.\n\nThe  entire  value  chain  was  considered  in  the  analysis  of L'Or\u00e9al's scenarios.\n\nThe two scenarios resulted in differentiated assessments of the impact of the risks identified and favoured the prioritisation of the  policies  implemented  and  the  determination  of  the related  programmes  and  action  plans  to  reduce  these impacts.    They  contributed  to  the  development  of  the  new sustainability programme, L'Or\u00e9al for the Future , for 2030.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe Group's risk review includes physical risks and transition risks associated  with  changes  in  its  value  chain  and  ecosystem. Risks  as  diverse  as  those  associated  with  extreme  weather events on the Group's infrastructures, or the risks inherent in the supply  chain , those  inherent  in  the  scarcity  of  resources, carbon  pricing  (taxes,  emissions  quota  systems)  and  their financial  impacts,  or  those  related  to  the  Group's  reputation and  consumer  expectations,  are  analysed,  resulting  in  the preparation  of  impact  scenarios  as  part  of  the  scenarios constructed, and strategic orientations are defined.\n\nIn  particular,  the  following  main  risks  and  opportunities  were studied:\n\n## Risk 1\n\nRegulations  concerning  the  mechanisms  for  pricing  carbon, such  as  specific  taxes  on  fossil  fuels,  carbon  taxes  on  a  raw material  and  negotiable  emission  quotas,  are  a  major challenge for the Group's suppliers. In this context, an increase in the pricing on direct greenhouse gas emissions for suppliers could be reflected in the prices of their products and services, and potentially have a material impact on L'Or\u00e9al's operating costs. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group is engaged with its  suppliers,  in  particular  through  the  CDP Supply  Chain, in designing  and  implementing  actions  plans  to  reduce  their greenhouse  gas  emissions.  L'Or\u00e9al's  2030  Science  Based Targets commitment implies, for example, reducing the Scope 1  and 2 emissions of suppliers by 50% in 2030 compared with 2016, thus reducing the Group's exposure to carbon pricing in the supply chain.\n\n## Risk 2\n\nChanges  in  consumer  preferences  towards  consumption choices  increasingly  influenced  by  the  carbon  footprint  of products  and  the  overall  climate  performance  of  industrial plants could have a material impact, progressively and in the medium-term,  for  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  challenge,  if  this  risk  were insufficiently  managed,  would  be  a  potential  loss  of  revenue because of a reduction in demand for L'Or\u00e9al products from consumers. L'Or\u00e9al's strategy to attenuate the associated risk is  to  continue  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  products and  to  give  consumers  the  means  to  take  enlightened purchasing decisions by providing transparent information and listening  to  their  expectations  on  the  issues  of  sustainable development.\n\n## Risk 3\n\nClimate  change  is  expected  to  lead  to  an  increase  in  the frequency and intensity  of  extreme  weather  events,  resulting primarily in changes in precipitation patterns, which will have a particularly strong impact on agriculture.\n\nIn particular, in Indonesia and Malaysia, medium-term chronic changes in the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a cycles are likely to occur. For  the  preparation  of  its  palm-based  ingredients,  which represent a large share of its purchasing volumes of ingredients of plant origin, 99% of L'Or\u00e9al's supply of palm oil comes from Indonesia and Malaysia. L'Or\u00e9al could, therefore, be affected by the consequences of a chronic increase in the frequency and intensity of these extreme weather events with, as a result, an  increase  in  the  supply  costs  for  these  raw  materials  and, therefore,  in  the  associated  production  costs.  Other  raw materials  such  as  shea  butter  or  coconut  oil,  for  example, could also be affected.\n\nThese  risks  are  taken  into  account  by  adapting  the  supply chain, developing projects in the field with the suppliers, and by  making  a  long-term  commitment  with  some  of  them.  In order to drill down on this identification of climate-related risks on  the  price  and  availability  of  the  most  important  raw materials of plant origin in the L'Or\u00e9al portfolio, a specific study taking  account  of a   set  of  methodologies  and  sources  on climate change was carried out with 'BIPE' (a consulting firm specialised  in  the  analysis  of  the  consequences  of  climate change  on  plant  production)  in  2017,  then  refined  in  2018 and 2019 in order to adapt supply strategies.\n\n## Opportunity 1\n\nOne of the consequences of climate change is the increase in the number of regions around the world that will face periods of  water  shortage,  particularly  in  urban  areas.  A  market opportunity  consists  in  innovating  and  developing  products appropriate  for  use  by  consumers  living  in  these  areas  of hydric  stress.  These  new  products  could  increasingly  better meet consumer's needs in this context. L'Or\u00e9al could seize this opportunity by evaluating the products as a function of their water footprint, by developing new products, routines or new technologies  that  save  water  in  the  use  phase,  and  by increasing consumer awareness of the challenges associated with water quality and availability.\n\n## Opportunity 2\n\nThe medium-term global trend in the price of non-renewable energy is expected to rise, both because of future regulations and  taxes  on  fossil  fuels,  and  complex  balances  between supply and demand. The progressive elimination of the use of conventional  fuels  in  favour  of  renewable  energies  would protect  L'Or\u00e9al  from  increases  in  the  fossil  fuel  prices  and could  result  over  time  in  operating  costs  that  are  relatively lower  than  those  paid  by  other  manufacturers  who  are  not committed to this energy transition. L'Or\u00e9al intends to seize this opportunity  by  rapidly  reducing  the  use  of  fossil  energies. L'Or\u00e9al has thus committed to using 100% renewable energy at  all  sites  operated  by  2025,  by  developing  projects  for  selfproduction  and  self-consumption  of  renewable  energies on site, as well as a 100% local and renewable energy supply (electricity, heat, biogas, etc.). L'Or\u00e9al has already started on this path with the completion of a series of projects for its own production and consumption of renewable electricity on site in the  United  States,  Western  Europe,  Brazil  and  China, for example.\n\n4",

When necessary and  relevant, an additional risk analysis is conducted  in  the  operational  entities,  particularly  for  the physical risks associated with climate change.\n\nContributions  are  collected  from  the  main  operational managers and experts in this area worldwide, representing all the  Group's  business  activities,  regions  and  areas  of  activity. Climate-related  risks  have  been  the  subject  of  a  specific approach  that  identified  and  assessed  their  financial  and strategic impact when the Group's reputation is impacted or the  long-term  growth  of  the  Group  may  be  impacted.  This analysis is regularly updated.\n\nThe  mapping  of  the  Group's  risks  is  reviewed  regularly.  It  is validated  by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Executive  Committee  once  a  year and presented to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Measurement of results and reporting\n\nIn the context of the first generation of Sharing Beauty with All commitments,  the  Group  defined  a  number  of  indicators tracked  to  evaluate  monthly  and  annually  the  progress\n\nachieved  on  the  targets  set  for  2020.  As  a  result  of  the acceleration of the environmental challenges, these indicators were reassessed and completed at the time of the June 2020 launch  of  the  new  sustainability  programme L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future . They cover the Group's entire value chain in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, water, biodiversity, resources and waste, and support the goals for 2030.\n\nMore  specifically  in  terms  of  climate  change,  the  goals announced  in  the  context  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  are  aligned  with  the  Science  Based  Targets initiative  that  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  in  2015.  In  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed to reducing in 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in absolute value (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) and by 50% per  finished  product  over  its  entire  value  chain  (Scopes  1,  2 and 3), compared with 2016.\n\nFinally,  in  September  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  United  Nations Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative and made a commitment to reach net zero emissions of CO2 by 2050.\n\nA  greenhouse  gas  assessment  is  prepared  and  published annually and details emissions over all the items described by the GHG Protocol.\n\nThe cross-reference table below identifies the main information of  this  document  according  to  the  recommendations  of  the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\n| Governance              | Governance                                                                                                                           | Sections of this document   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1.                      | Supervision by the Board of Directors of climate-related risks and opportunities                                                     | 1.1. and 2.3.               |\n| 2.                      | Role of Management in the assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities                                       | 3.2.                        |\n| Strategy                | Strategy                                                                                                                             |                             |\n| 1.                      | Climate-related risks and opportunities identified in the short, medium and long term                                                | 3.5. and 4.2.               |\n| 2.                      | Impact of climate-related risks on the Group's business activities, strategy and financial forecasts                                 | 4.2.                        |\n| 3.                      | Resilience of the Group, taking into consideration different climate scenarios, including a scenario of 2\u00b0C  or less                 | 1.2. and 4.3.               |\n| Risks and opportunities | Risks and opportunities                                                                                                              |                             |\n| 1.                      | Procedures to identify and assess climate-related risks                                                                              | 3.5. and 4.2.               |\n| 2.                      | Procedures for managing climate-related risks                                                                                        | 3.5. and 4.2.               |\n| 3.                      | Integration of the procedures to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks within the total  management of the Group's risks | 3.2.                        |\n| Indicators              | Indicators                                                                                                                           |                             |\n| 1.                      | Indicators used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, in line with the Group's strategy  and risk management procedure  | 4.1. and 4.3.               |\n| 2.                      | Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions and associated risks                                                                      | 4.2, 4.3. and 4.5.          |\n| 3.                      | Objectives used to manage climate-related risks and/or opportunities and the Group's performance  in relation to its objectives      | 1.1, 2.4, 4.3 and 4.4       |",

Human Resources policy\n\nThe mission of L'Or\u00e9al's Human Resources Department (HR) is to support the Group's growth and its transformation initiatives. The Group, which has always placed people at the heart of its organisation,  relies  on  its  employees  above  all.  L'Or\u00e9al's  HR strategy  is  built  on  this  double  conviction:  individualised management linked with collective strength.\n\nTo meet the challenges of a world that is constantly changing, which impact both the organisation and the work connection, the  Group  initiated  a  process  of  transformation  to  adjust  its model  to  new  aspirations  and  is  implementing  dedicated  HR policies on recruitment, development and engagement. These policies are presented in this chapter.\n\nThe  Executive  Vice-President  of  Human  Resources  reports  to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on a regular basis.\n\n## Recruiting, developing and engaging: employees are central to the business model\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  always  placed  the  individual  at  the  centre  of  its model, convinced that the qualities of each person contribute to the performance of all. L'Or\u00e9al finds, recruits and supports its employees with  a  long-term  vision.  Training  and  development play a core role throughout their professional careers.\n\nIn order to fully perform their function as strategic partner, Human Resources integrates the technological and digital dimensions and takes  into  account  strong  challenges  such  as  corporate  social responsibility.  The  transformation  of  the  Group  towards Beauty Tech requires  the  recruitment  of  experts,  the  integration  of  new businesses and the dissemination of a digital culture at all levels of the company.\n\nHR  also  plays a   central  role  in  the  transformation  of  work methods and management culture. Thus, they supported the rollout of the Simplicity programme, initiated in 2016, to foster a management  style  based  on  trust  that  leaves  room  for initiative, cooperation and development. The programme was\n\n## Exceptional measures to manage the Covid-19 pandemic crisis\n\nFrom the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, L'Or\u00e9al played its role as a solidary employer and a responsible company by taking strong measures to guarantee the health and safety of its employees in all its subsidiaries:\n\n- \u00b7 39  international  instructions  were  issued  in  all  the subsidiaries  of  the  Group  and  adapted  to  the  different locations  and  type  of  work  (plants,  distribution  centres, laboratories,  administrative  sites).  These  measures  were audited  and  certified  in  several  subsidiaries  by  an independent organisation;\n- \u00b7 an  international  travel  ban  was  declared  in  February 2020;\n\nsupported  by  a  major  training  programme, LeadEnable  for Simplicity and  specific  goals  target  the  highest  level  of  the Company.  Members  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  their management committees are now evaluated by their peers and their teams via the Leadership Survey .\n\nSince 2018, L'Or\u00e9al's HR department has adopted a brand new modus  operandi.  HR  has  become  the  incubator  for  country ideas  and  initiatives  as  an  extension  to  and  in  the  spirit  of Simplicity.  With  the  Disrupt  HR  approach,  the  Group  prioritises co-construction  and  a test-and-learn approach  designed  to boost agility and respond more effectively to the expectations of employees and job candidates.\n\nIn  the  area  of  corporate  social  responsibility  within  the framework of the Sharing Beauty With All programme, L'Or\u00e9al has committed to providing training to 100% of its employees every year, worldwide.\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  economic  growth  cannot  be  separated  from  social progress.  To  support  this  conviction,  the L'Or\u00e9al Share  &  Care programme, created  in  2013  and  deployed  in  all  the  subsidiaries, offers employees a set of social benefits in welfare schemes, health, parenthood and quality of life at work. All the objectives set in 2017 were implemented worldwide.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also offers its employees a policy of sharing its growth. Profit-sharing programmes have been in place for many years everywhere  in  the  world.  After  launching  its  first  employee shareholding plan in 2018, the Group launched a second one in 2020.\n\nQuality social dialogue is also one of the essential components of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  model.  It  illustrates  the  Company's  desire  to involve  employees  and  their  representatives  in  the  Group's development.\n\nFinally,  L'Or\u00e9al  acts  with  the  conviction  that  a  policy  in  favour  of Diversity and Inclusion allows everyone, regardless of their gender, social  or  cultural  background,  religion,  sexual  orientation,  age  or disability, to give their best in the company. This is an essential driver of  performance  and  innovation  and  is  crucial  for  maintaining sustainable growth.\n\n- \u00b7 vulnerable  or  at-risk  employees  were  exempted  from being physically present at work;\n- \u00b7 for teleworking employees, L'Or\u00e9al adapted its operating mode and developed e-learning sessions and guidelines to  provide  the  best  support  to  employees  at  all  levels; measures were taken to strengthen cyber security given the increased risk of cyberattacks during this period (see section  4.3.2.4.  'Creating  the  conditions  for  a  positive and attractive work environment' of this document);\n- \u00b7 for  employees  who  were  physically  present  at  work, measures  focused  on  prevention  were  implemented, including social distancing, the daily distribution of masks, the  availability  of  sanitisers;  the e-learning  module #safetogether was  rapidly  developed  internally  to  train employees on good hygiene standards or rules; and\n- \u00b7 the  fixed  salaries  of  employees  were  100%  guaranteed during lockdown periods.\n\n4",

The  conventional  frequency  rate  (TFc)  is  0.66  and  the enlarged  total  incident  rate  (TIRe) (2) is  1.17;  they  improved in 2020.\n\nInjured with lost-time recorded in the Group in 2020 resulted in the following frequency rates by entity:\n\n| Sites                                  | TFc 2020   | Variation in TFc vs. 2019   | TIRe 2020   | Variation in TIRe vs. 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| Plants and distribution  centres sites | 1.34  \u2611    | -11%                        | 2.99  \u2611     | -3.9%                        |\n| Administrative sites                   | 0.14       | -56%                        | 0.29        | - 42%                        |\n| R&I Sites                              | 0.55       | 57%                         | 0.86        | - 55%                        |\n| Sales forces & Stores                  | 0.96       | - 9%                        | 1.27        | - 26%                        |\n| Group: all sites                       | 0.66       | - 16%                       | 1.17        | - 21%                        |\n\n- \u2611 The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance with regard to this indicator.\n\nThe  accident  gravity  rate  was  lower  than  the  rate  for  the Group in 2019. It stood at 0.02 for the Group and 0.04 for plants and distribution centres in 2020.\n\n## Priorities\n\nThe  main  Health  and  Safety  priorities  and  orientations  relate to the following eight areas:\n\n- 1. definition  and  deployment  of  strategy  and  action  plans to  achieve the targets set: Conventional Frequency Rate (TFc) <0.5 for all Group sites;\n- 2. commitment and visible participation by management;\n- 4. organisation and Health and Safety practices in line with the  Group's  standards  with  OHSAS  18001  or  ISO  45001 certification for all Operations sites;\n- 5. specific training programme for managers, EHS managers and operators/technicians;\n- 6. ongoing improvement of the Health and Safety management systems at all sites;\n- 7. 7active employee participation; and\n- 8. sharing of resources, feedback and best practices.\n\n87%  of  the  Group's  plants  are  OHSAS  18001  or  ISO  45001 certified for their safety policy.\n\n- 3. initiatives  to  fight  the  most  frequent  incidents,  which include a  global  ergonomics  programme  and  a  specific LIFE programme  (see  Section  4.3.1.1.  'A  continuous improvement  process'  of  this  document)  on  potentially serious accidents;\n\n4",

Recruiting and supporting talents\n\nThe Group continually strives to enrich and diversify its pool of talent around the world for its present and future needs.\n\nThe  recruitment  teams  are  tasked  with  recruiting  the  best talent in all countries in which L'Or\u00e9al Group operates so as to form  teams  that  resemble  our  consumers  and  integrate  all cultures. The local implementation of the recruitment policy is carried out by a network of recruitment experts present in most countries.\n\nTo select the best talents capable of contributing to L'Or\u00e9al's transformation, the Group has developed a reference system of skills and innovative methods to evaluate them. To this end, the Group  is  looking  for  people  with  innovative  and entrepreneurial  skills,  who  take  a  strategic  and  holistic  view,\n\nand who are capable of developing talent, as well as profiles with  the  potential  to  grow  and  blossom  within  the  Group thanks to its training schemes and internal mobility policy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  a  unique  know-how  in  the  recruitment  of  new graduates, in connection with higher education:\n\n- \u00b7 Brandstorm ,  an  international  student  competition  which  in 2020 brought together more than 48,000 students from over 65 countries, in a completely digital format for the first time in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis, and gave them a  unique  experience  allowing  them  to  get  to  know  the beauty  industry,  express  their  creativity  and  discover  the Group's values of innovation and entrepreneurship; and\n- \u00b7 the Management  Trainee programme , a rotational programme  that  allows  new  graduates  to  prepare effectively to take on major business responsibilities. In 2020, this programme was offered in most of L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiaries.",

L'Or\u00e9al's  Social  Media  strategy  in  recruitment  has also  been  recognised  as  one  of  the  best  in  the  world for several years (1) . A strong presence on LinkedIn, with more than 3  million followers, helps  with  proactively  recruiting  the  best talent.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  ranked  as  one  of  the  best  employers  selected  by Glassdoor in France.\n\nAn  International  Digital  team  provides  L'Or\u00e9al  recruiters around the world with cutting edge digital tools to efficiently select  the  best  candidates  from  among  nearly  one  million applications  received.  These  solutions,  such  as  MYA  and SEEDLINK,  use  artificial  intelligence,  which  both  provides greater efficiency and  targets  a  broader  diversity of backgrounds.\n\nIn addition, all the recruiting teams have worked to strengthen their  fundamentals  by  updating  the  candidate  data  base, tracking  performance  indicators  for  the  tools  used  more systematically, and placing the focus on relationships with the candidates  in  order  to  preserve  L'Or\u00e9al's  positioning  as  an employer of choice.  In 2020, the community of recruiters was also  trained  to  identify  and  avoid  unconscious  biases  in recruiting.\n\nSuccessful integration of new employees lays the groundwork for a lasting, quality relationship with the Company. To this end, the 'FIT' integration programme provides a number of actions to  give  everyone  the  keys  to  success  within  the  Group,  both from  an  operational  standpoint  and  with  the  desire  to  share the corporate culture.\n\n## 4.3.2.3. Training and development of employees throughout their careers\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  always  considered  the  development  of  its employees as one of the main drivers of its performance and its transformation.  The  Group  aims  to  provide  the  most pertinent and up-to-date training and development solutions everywhere in the world, in order to develop the potential and employability  of  employee  throughout  their  lives,  as  well  as prepare tomorrow's leaders.\n\nHuman development is strategic. It enables the Group to be recognised as a school of excellence and contributes to the attraction,  engagement  and  retention  of  employees.  The Covid-19  crisis  has  accelerated  the  transformations  of  the business  and  amplified  the  need  for  support  and upskilling (2) . This exceptional  situation  has  been  an  accelerator  in transforming learning methods and technologies.\n\nEach  Learning  team's  task  is  to  contribute  to  L'Or\u00e9al's competitive advantage through four levers:\n\n- \u00b7 support  the  development of talent  with  a  particular  focus on each stage of their career;\n- \u00b7 anticipate changes in jobs and the need for critical skills for the future;\n- \u00b7 implement  large-scale  upskilling  programmes  to  support transformations of the business and  their respective challenges;\n- \u00b7 nurture the sense of belonging to the Group by stimulating the sharing of corporate culture and passion for the Beauty business.\n\n## Learning in the context of Covid-19\n\nEmployee health and safety have always been a priority  for L'Or\u00e9al.  To  support  this  goal  during  the  Covid-19  crisis,  the mandatory e-learning #SafeTogether was deployed Groupwide. This  e-learning  module  was  created  very  quickly in-house  by  a  community  of  L'Or\u00e9al  doctors  and  nurses  and was distributed globally in May  2020 to encourage compliance with good hygiene standards or rules.\n\nNearly 50,000 employees, as well as service providers, took this module,  which  was  available  in  13  languages.  L'Or\u00e9al  also made  this e-learning programme available to other companies  and  consumers  via  the  digital  platform  of  its partner    Crossknowledge.  In  2020,  it  was  adopted  by  16 companies and this enabled us to train nearly 20,000 people outside the Group.\n\nThe Learning Never Stops campaign was deployed in February 2020 in  China,  followed  by  the  est  of  the  World  in  March,  to maintain the upskilling  of  employees  confined  in  their  homes via  weekly newsletters .  Three  crucial  topics  were  offered  to employees: 'Taking care of yourself and those close to you', 'Working remotely' and 'Managing a team remotely'.\n\nThe methods  for deploying trainings were profoundly transformed during the Covid-19 crisis by moving decisively to 'remote' learning and micro-learning formats:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's e-learning platform, MyLearning.com, counted over  68,000  regular  users  (+20%  compared  to  2019) representing more than 580,000 e-learning hours (compared  to  200,000  hours  in  2019,  up  +190%).  This exceptional  acceleration  was  built  on  the  following successes:\n- \u00b7 more  than  7,000  learners  enrolled  in  the Massive  Open Online Courses (MOOCs)  from  Coursera  with  an impressive  certification  rate  of  41%  representing  more than 60,000 hours of learning in 2020 (+120% over 2019),\n- \u00b7 in the context of the 'L'Or\u00e9al Remote' programme, mini courses on remote work and remote management were available, and\n- \u00b7 Particularly relevant business content further strengthened already  available  solutions  (e-commerce,  consumer behaviours  with  regard  to  the  brands  and  usage  of technology,  sustainable  development,  critical  skills  in digital, beauty tech , etc.);\n- \u00b7 a remote 'live' training programme was set up very rapidly using  the  functionalities  of  the  Microsoft  Teams  platform, totalling more than 980,000 hours of training (3) (up nine-fold compared to 2019).\n\n4",

The programme, which has benefitted nearly 50,000 employees, is  gradually  evolving  to  support  the  development  of  new  skills that are essential to building new competitive advantages for the Group, around two major components:\n\n- \u00b7 consolidating new skills necessary for the digital transformation (e-commerce, precision advertising, analytics, etc.); and\n- \u25cf integrating  digital  competencies  in  all  of  the  Group's training plans.\n\nThe  Covid-19  health  crisis  led  to  the  emergence  of  new training formats, especially for e-commerce and marketing. It has  reached  more  employees  with  remote  learning  formats that guarantee the strategic quality of the content (over 6,700 employees were trained in the 'Fundamentals of e-commerce' in 48 countries).\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme.  The  first  training  phase  for  teams  consists  of  a learning  course  on  the  essential  concepts  relevant  for  all employees, that is entitled Green Steps .  The  programme has four  components:  climate  change,  water,  biodiversity  and natural  resources.  For  each  of  these  four  environmental  and social  challenges,  the  training  gives  an  understanding  of  the overall  subject,  the  challenges  for  L'Or\u00e9al,  our  goals  for  2030 as  well  as  how  they  can  be  achieved.  This  programme  is offered  in  different  formats:  e-learning  modules  as  well  as webinars  with  Group  experts  and  podcasts.  Rolled  out  in France and internationally,  it  is  already  highly  successful  with 96%  of  the  subsidiary  CEOs,  whose  role  will  be  critical  in  the next steps, having already finished this course. At the request of  the  Group's  Executive  Committee,  all  L'Or\u00e9al  employees must have validated their training by June 2021.\n\nA true revolution in working methods and leadership has been accomplished  in  four  years  thanks  to  the  Simplicity    project, thus demonstrating the Group's great agility. All the principles and  methods  promoted  by  Simplicity  have  proved  to  be particularly effective to boost the engagement of teams. The results  of  the  'Pulse'  engagement  survey  show  significant progress  on  all  levers  of  Simplicity,  allowing  L'Or\u00e9al  to outperform Korn Ferry standards, that measures  team engagement,  by  8  points  and  by  4  points  for  the  quality  of support provided to them.\n\nThe three major advances of this year were:\n\n- \u00b7 a  second  wave  of  a Leadership  Survey for  the  top 300  executives  covering  nine  exemplary  practices  of Simplicity,  the  results  of  which  are  taken  into  account  for awarding a bonus;\n- \u00b7 the  launch  of  a Leaders  Modeling  Feed-Back campaign: 50%  of  the  Group's  Executive  Committee  teams  have already integrated these rituals in their daily practice; and\n- \u00b7 the rituals and tools resulting from agile methods adapted to  remote  work  were  deployed  to  over  7,500  managers worldwide via webinars.\n\n## The Learning governance of the Group\n\nFaced  with  the  transformations  of  the  business,  the  Learning Departments  of  the  Divisions  and  'M\u00e9tiers'  work  in  close collaboration  with  the  global  Operational  Department  to anticipate the critical skills of the future. This leads to the set-up of  roadmaps  for  upskilling  in  critical  areas  of  expertise (marketing,  commerce,  research,  operations,  management, personal  development,  HR,  finance,  IT,  etc.)  based  on  the analysis of gaps, and for deploying learning solutions for largescale upskilling in all regions of the world.\n\nTheir close collaboration with the Learning Departments of the Zones  (based  in  Asia  Pacific,  Europe,  North  America,  Latin America and Africa  Middle  East)  identifies  the  most  relevant learning  solutions.  The  Learning  Departments  of  the  Zones have a critical role in the activation and deployment of these solutions  and  participate  in  creating  regional  offers  adapted to the specific features of their zone.\n\nParticular attention is paid to the 'key programmes' related to the strategy and culture of the Group, such as Leadership and the ways of working .\n\n## Rewards for L'Or\u00e9al's learning strateyg\n\nIn  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  won  two  awards  for  the  quality  of  its training,  awarded  by  the  Brandon  Hall  Group (1) . For  our innovative learning activities in China:\n\n- \u25cf the  first  prize  was  for  the  best  advancement  in  Business Strategy and Technological Innovation for the activation of online  learning  during  the  global  'Learning  Never  Stops' campaign (China);\n- \u25cf second  place  for  the  best  advance  in  Unique  Training Technology for user experience with the SPARK application (China);\n- \u25cf second  place  was  for  the  best  advancement  in  Mobile Learning Technology for the SPARK application (China);\n- \u25cf first prize was for the optimal use of mobile learning in 2020 thanks to the ACCESS mobile application of the Professional Products Division; and\n- \u25cf third place was for the best use of social and collaborative learning with the Ready Learner One campaign.\n\n4",

Creating conditions for a positive and attractive work environment\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme: an accelerator of social progress\n\nThroughout its history, L'Or\u00e9al has aimed to offer its employees security and protection to enable them to work with peace of mind.  L'Or\u00e9al's Share  &  Care programme  follows  on  from  a long  tradition  of  social  progress  and  caring  of  the  individual. The Company makes, and will continue to make, a difference by putting people at the centre of its concerns, its organisation and therefore its development.\n\nThe  Group  has  thus  set  a  goal  to  create  an  attractive  work environment  in  which  all  employees  can  thrive  at  both  a professional and personal level.\n\nWith  its L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has universalised its social model in a manner that is consistent with its global dimension.  This is a strong commitment that reflects the Company's vision that sustainable growth necessarily goes hand in hand with a high level of social performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  programme  was  launched  in  2013  and  implemented collaboratively  in  all  the  subsidiaries.  The  Group's  ambition  is three-fold:\n\n- \u00b7 establish a common base of social protection, i.e. minimum guarantees in all the subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 become one of the top performers in each local market, by going  beyond  the  common  base  whenever  local  best practices offer more; and\n- \u00b7 make  each  subsidiary  a  'social  innovation  laboratory'. Through local initiatives, the subsidiaries are encouraged to set  up  initiatives  adapted  to  the  expectations  of  their employees.\n\nThe  essential  components  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care programme  have  now  been  deployed  in  all  Group subsidiaries.\n\n## The four pillars of the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme\n\nThis  large-scale  social  programme  consists  of  commitments revolving  around  four  pillars  implemented  in  all  countries: welfare  schemes,  health,  parenthood  and  quality  of  life at work.\n\n| Pillars                       | Objectives                                                                                                                        | Main commitments achieved in all countries (1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Protect (welfare schemes)     | Providing employees and their families  with financial support in the event of  unexpected life events.                           | A lump sum payment, or pension, equivalent to 24 months' salary in the event of natural or accidental death.

The  new  measures include  the  introduction  of  a  minimum  paternity  leave  of 10  days  fully  paid,  the  strengthening  of  flex  work  schedules, telecommuting  and  flexible  working  hours,  wherever  local practices  so  allow,  or  the  expansion  of  employee  welfare schemes.\n\nOther improvements are being studied for a third stage of the programme intended  to  strengthen  the  protection  of  health and parenthood everywhere in the world with the implementation of a paternity/co-parent leave of at least six weeks paid at 100%, a global telecommuting policy ( L'Or\u00e9al Remote ) and measures enhancing well-being in the workplace.\n\n## Assessment tools of the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  transparency  and  reliability,  the  entire programme is regularly subject to measures and assessments to verify that it has been implemented in accordance with the objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 self-assessment and definition of the action plan through a reporting  tool:  the Follow-up-Tool , completed  by  each subsidiary annually;\n- \u00b7 internal audit: Internal Audit plans in the subsidiaries include detailed verification of the programme's implementation;\n- \u00b7 external audit: certain key indicators are audited within the scope of the annual external audit.\n\n## The ILO is a partner in the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme attracted the attention of the ILO (International Labour Organization) in the context of its  study  on  the  contribution  by  major  companies  to  the expansion of social protection all over the world.\n\nA  close  collaboration  was  developed.  As  a  result,  the  ILO launched  the  Global  Business  Network  for  Social  Protection Floor  in  October  2015.  This  process  allows  acting  collectively and  mobilising  to  create  a  basic  set  of  social  protection measures for everyone. L'Or\u00e9al is a founding member of the new  business  network  created  by  the  ILO  to  promote  social protection all over the world.\n\n## Flexible work organisation\n\nIn  each  subsidiary,  work  is  organised  according  to  local environment and the activity is performed in compliance with legal and contractual obligations. In several subsidiaries, both work  organisation  and  working  time  are  part  of  collective agreements.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  believes  that  work  flexibility  is  a  key  element  in attractiveness. Launched in 2017, the second stage of L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care increased work flexibility with the implementation of  teleworking  and  flexible  working  time.  At  the  end  of  2020, 60  of  the  64  subsidiaries  of  the  Group  had  established teleworking  policies  and  55  subsidiaries  had  set  up  flexible working time.\n\nEmployees  from  all  categories  have  chosen  this  option  of part-time work. In 2020, there were 5,888 part-time employees, 5,321 of whom were women and 567 were men.\n\n4",

In  countries  where  freedom  of association  and  the  right  to  collective  bargaining  are restricted  or  non-existent,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  other modes  of  dialogue  with  its  employees  that  allow  them  to report their possible cncernso.\n\nIn  the  context  of  this  general  principle,  the  social  climate  at L'Or\u00e9al  is the fruit of an  ongoing  dialogue  between Management,  employees  and  their  representatives, in accordance with trade union rights in each country and with a  neutral  attitude  with  regard  to  the  various  trade  union organisations.\n\nEmployee representative institutions are in place in most of the European  subsidiaries,  in  several  Asian  subsidiaries  (China, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Japan), in Africa (South  Africa,  Kenya  and  Morocco),  in  North  America  and South America (Canada, United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), and also in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n- \u25cf In  total,  86% of  the  Group's  employees work in subsidiaries where  there  are  employee  representative  councils.  45% of  the  Group's  employees  are  covered  by  a  collective agreement  and  97%  of  them  are  covered  by  company collective agreements.\n\nAn  agreement  signed  in  1996  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and  French and  European  trade  unions  led  to  the  establishment  of  the Company's Instance Europ\u00e9enne de Dialogue Social / European  Works  Council.  This  council  leads  discussions  and formal  meetings  with  its  members  about  the  Group's  current situation  and future perspectives, on the basis of an agenda prepared  with  the  Liaison  Secretariat.  This  council  covers approximately  30,600  employees  in  26  member  countries  of the European Economic Area.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's social policy permits the signing of a certain number of collective agreements every year. In 2020, 133 agreements were signed in France and 126 agreements were signed in the rest of the world. In total, the number of agreements in force at 31 December 2020 was 775, 476 of which were in France. 123 agreements in force cover health and safety, in whole or in part.\n\nThese agreements primarily cover work organisation, remuneration and working conditions (working hours, quality of life  at  work,  professional equality, telecommuting, health and safety, etc.). They contribute to the proper functioning and to the performance  of  the  Group  since  they  strenghten employee participation and dialogue with their representatives.\n\nprotection  of  emails,  protection  of  Internet  access  via access gateway in the cloud and two-factor authentication of users.\n\nIn  the  context  of  crisis  management,  this  protection  was even  reinforced  primarily  to  fighting  phishing  threats, notably  with  an  additional  verification  of  URL  links  in messages,  as  well  as  highlighting  emails  from  external sources.\n\n## 4.3.2.5. Offering a motivating and competitive remuneration system\n\n## The principles of the remuneration policy\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al's  remuneration  policy  has  the  objective  of contributing to the achievement of the Group's objectives and is  an  integral  part  of  its  development  strategy.  L'Or\u00e9al  wants to attract and foster the loyalty of talented employees, propose motivating  career  paths  and  encourage  its  employees' performance  and  commitment,  while  accompanying  the evolution of jobs and business.\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  social  and  economic  performance  are  indeed closely linked. The Group ensures that all employees receive at least  the  minimum  salary  set  by  local  law  or  applicable collective  agreements.    In  most  of  the  countries,  L'Or\u00e9al's lowest  base  salaries  are  much  higher  than  the  national minimum wages in force.\n\nAs  from  2020,  a  process  to  monitor  remunerations  has  been implemented to ensure that the Group's permanent employees receive a living wage, i.e. a salary that covers their basic  needs,  calculated  in  line  with  the  best  practices  and with the support of independent experts.\n\nA 'total package' approach is used. It offers each employee a competitive remuneration package , consisting of a range of components (basic pay, variable pay, long-term remuneration) and employee benefits.\n\nThe  Group  is  implementing  a  remuneration  policy that combines  external  competitiveness  with  internal  equity,  and rewards both individual and collective performances. Employees share in the Company's results through collective profit  sharing  schemes  depending  on  results  and  rolled  out worldwide.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  is  structured  under  a  charter  and  is implemented by a network of Rewards experts present in the different countries. External surveys are conducted every year with  specialist  firms  to  ensure  that  L'Or\u00e9al's  positioning  is appropriate in relation to the local reference market.\n\nFinally,  L'Or\u00e9al's  ambition  is  for  all  employees  to  understand their remuneration and how it is determined. The Group makes sure  that  it  communicates  clearly  and  transparently  on  this subject.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's remuneration  policy  is  based  on  an  annual performance assessment system for employees (MAP) applied in all the  Group's  subsidiaries.  It  makes  it  possible  to communicate on the methods for determining remuneration, the process and the decisions made. The Group's subsidiaries are  encouraged to provide employees, once a year, with a document showing the change in their remuneration and its various components with clarity and transparency.",

This  plan  was  also  recognised  by  the  French  Federation  of Employees  and  Former  Employee  Shareholder  Associations (FAS), which awarded L'Or\u00e9al the CAC All Tradable Grand Prix in 2018.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  intended  to  offer  a  new  opportunity  for employees  to  support  the  growth  of  the  company  and participate  in  its  strategic  project,  by  launching  a  new employee  share  ownership  plan.  As  in  2018,  the  plan  was designed to collectively envision and unite L'Or\u00e9al employees worldwide (1) to the Group's growth objective, by enhancing a feeling  of  belonging,  engagement  and  solidarity.  Eligible employees  had  the  possibility  of  purchasing  shares  with preferential  conditions  including,  where  permitted  by  local law,  a  20%  discount  on  the  share  reference  price  with  an employer matching share contribution of up to 4 free shares.\n\nOnce again, the plan was internationally a big success with a 35% subscription rate, similar to the first plan, which represents a  high  level  compared  to  companies  that  have  set  up employee shareholding plans (2) .\n\nPlan deployed in 57 countries in 2020 - six more than in 2018.\n\n## Plans for the conditional grant of shares to employees (ACAs)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  sets  up  long-term  remuneration  plans  in  favour  of  its employees and corporate officers in an international context, in the form of grants of performance shares.\n\nThese grants serve a dual purpose:\n\n- \u00b7 motivate  and  associate  those  who  make  significant contributions to future increases in the Group's results; and\n- \u00b7 strengthen involvement and the feeling of belonging of its beneficiaries  by  fostering  long-term  loyalty  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nThe  vesting  of  these  shares  is  subject  to  the  achievement  of performance targets and the beneficiary's continued presence  in  the  Company.  To  ensure  consistency  with  the Group's strategic objectives, the choice of beneficiaries and the  vesting  criteria  are  determined  by  a  specific  policy  (see Section 5.4. 'Long-term incentive plans' of this document). The Board  of  Directors,  subject  to  the  opinion  of  the  Human Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee,  carries  out  the conditional grant of shares and lays down the applicable rules.\n\n50%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  14  October  2020  plan  are women. More than 3,600 employees, representing 10% of the managers  around  the  world,  nearly  55%  of  whom  are  in international subsidiaries, benefit from at least one stock option plan  or  one  conditional  grant  of  shares  plan  (ACAs),  as  at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Profit sharing schemes\n\nFor  many  years,  L'Or\u00e9al's  policy  has  been  to  associate employees  in  the  results  of  the  Company  with  the  aim  of strengthening their feeling of belonging and their motivation. In the  context  of  the  profit-sharing  schemes  in  place, \u20ac368 million were redistributed to L'Or\u00e9al's employees in 2020 on the basis of the 2019 results.\n\nIn 1968, an employee profit sharing agreement ('participation') was  signed  in  France,  followed  by  another  agreement ('int\u00e9ressement')  in  1988,  and  these  agreements  have  been constantly renewed since then.\n\nSince  2001,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  a Worldwide  Profit Sharing Programme in all the Group's subsidiaries in which the employees  do  not  benefit  from  legal  or  contractual  profit sharing schemes. The amounts paid within this framework are calculated  locally  on  the  basis  of  the  turnover  and  profit  of each subsidiary, as compared to the budgeted targets.\n\n| Amounts paid under  these programmes  (in \u20ac million)   |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total (1)                                              |    296 |    310 |    368 |\n\n- (1) Profit sharing schemes.\n\n## Employee benefit and pension schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  wants  to  make  sure  that  its  employees  benefit  from competitive  pension  and  welfare  schemes  in  all  countries. Since  2002,  a  Supervisory  Committee  for  Pension  and Employee  Welfare  schemes  ensures  the  implementation  of these schemes in subsidiaries and the monitoring of L'Or\u00e9al's Pension and Employee Benefits policy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitments  with  regard  to  welfare  schemes  are part  of  the  'Protect'  pillar  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care programme.  In  all  subsidiaries, L'Or\u00e9al guarantees  the payment  of  a  lump  sum,  or  equivalent  pension,  equal  to  a minimum of 24 months' salary  in  the  event  of  death  or  total permanent disability, or more where local practice is higher.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The performance of  managers  of  the  main  funds  established,  as  well  as  the financial  stability  rating  of  custodians,  are  regularly  reviewed by the Supervisory Committee.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al does not propose company pension plans in countries which do not have an appropriate legal framework or longterm investment instruments and in countries where there is a satisfactory  public  social  security  system.  The  Supervisory Committee  remains  attentive  to  changes  in  local  situations and, when required, additional complementary schemes are put in place.\n\n## Overview of the Pension and Employee Welfare schemes in France\n\n## Pension schemes\n\nTo  supplement  the  pensions  provided  for  by  the  compulsory French  pension  scheme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  the supplementary pension schemes described below:\n\n## Defined contribution scheme\n\nIn  September  2003,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a  'defined  contribution pension scheme'.\n\nAll  categories of employees are beneficiaries of this scheme, after  one  year  of  employment,  which  is  financed  jointly  by L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  employee,  and  which  makes  it  possible  for everyone to build up pension savings. As from 1 January 2016, contributions  have  been  increased  on  Brackets  A,  B  and capped at half of Bracket C.\n\nThis scheme entitles beneficiary pensioners to a lifelong annuity calculated after they claim their pension rights with the Social Security pension system, calculated on the basis of the capital formed by the contributions paid and the financial income on such  contributions  at  the  end  of  the  employee's  career,  as well as the annuity option selected. The employer's commitment  is  limited  to  the  payment  of  the  contributions stipulated.\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has also set up several differential or additive defined benefit schemes with conditional entitlements, in order to take into  account  the  important  developments  impacting  these schemes  and  with  the  aim  of  arriving  at  a  coherent  system between  the  different  pension  schemes  that  exist  in  the Company.\n\nOrder No. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 transposing EU Directive of 16 April 2014 no longer allows the acquisition of additional new rights  in  schemes  open  on  20  May  2014  for  employment periods after 31 December 2019. In this context, L'Or\u00e9al froze the  rights at 31  December  2019  and  will  finalise  the establishment  of  a  substitution  scheme  for  vested  rights  in compliance with Order no. 2019-697 for employment periods as  from  1  January  2020,  following  the  publication  of  the circular  on  23  December  2020.  This  scheme  is  considered  as the continuation  of  the  old  scheme  because  of  the consistency in terms of population and benefits.\n\nThe  'Supplementary  pension  scheme  for  Former  Senior Managers'  (Retraite  suppl\u00e9mentaire  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens Cadres Dirigeants) concerns retirees who have held positions as  senior  managers  for  a  minimum  of  10  years,  hired  or promoted  to  this  position  as  from  1  January  2016,  who  end their  career  in  the  Company.  This  is  an  additional  defined benefit pension scheme which grants entitlement to payment of  a  life  annuity.  The  reference  salary  taken  into  account  for calculation  of  the  pension  is  the  fraction  of  the  salary  which exceeds six times the French annual social security ceiling. The basis  for  calculation  of  the  supplementary  pension  is  the average of the revalued reference salaries for the best three full years of activity out of the seven calendar years prior to the end of their career. The supplementary pension is 1.36% of the calculation  base  per  year  of  service  within  the  Group  until 31 December 2019, up to a maximum of 25 years. Any retiree who so wishes will be able to choose an option of a surviving spouse pension.\n\nAccess to the 'Retirement Income Guarantee for former senior managers'  (Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens Cadres  Dirigeants)  was  closed  on  31  December  2015.  This scheme,  created  on  1  January  2001,  was  open  to  former senior  managers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  who,  in  addition  to  fulfilling  the requirement of having ended their career with the Company, met the condition of having had the status of senior manager for  at  least  ten  years  at  the  end  of  their  career.  It  provides entitlement to payment to beneficiary retirees of a life annuity, as  well  as,  after  their  death,  the  payment,  subject  to conditions,  to  their  spouse  and/or  ex-spouse(s)  of  a  surviving spouse  pension  and,  to  the  children,  of  an  orphan  pension. The calculation base for the Income Guarantee is the average of  the  salaries  for  the  best  three  years  out  of  the  seven calendar years prior to the end of the senior manager's career at L'Or\u00e9al. The Income Guarantee is calculated on the basis of the number of years of professional service in the Company until  31  December  2019,  capped  at  25  years,  each  year leading  to  a  progressive  and  regular  increase  of  1.8%  in  the level  of  the  Guarantee.  The  Income  Guarantee  cannot exceed 50% of the calculation base or exceed the average of the fixed part of wages. A gross annuity and gross lump sum equivalent are then calculated, taking into account the sum of the annual pensions accrued by beneficiaries as a result of their professional activity and assuming that their age is 65. The life  annuity  is  the  result  of  the  conversion  into  an  annuity  at beneficiaries' age on the date they apply for their pension of the  gross  lump  sum  equivalent,  less  the  amount  of  all payments  due  as  a  result  of  termination  of  the  employment contract, excluding any paid notice period and paid holiday, and  less  all  salaries  paid  under  any  early  retirement  leave. Around 330 senior managers are eligible for these schemes if they  fulfil  all  conditions  after  ending  their  career  with  the Company.\n\nAccess to the 'Pension Cover for Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture' (Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de  Conjoncture)  has  been  closed  since  31  December  2000. This  former  scheme  granted  entitlement  to  payment  to beneficiary retirees,  after  having  ended  their  career  with  the Company, of  a  life  annuity  as  well  as,  after  their  death,  the payment  under  certain  conditions  to  the  spouse  and/or  exspouse(s) of a surviving spouse pension and, to the children, of an  orphan  pension.  The  calculation  base  for  the  Pension Cover is the average of the salaries for the best three years out of  the  seven  calendar  years  prior  to  the  end  of  the beneficiary's career at L'Or\u00e9al. The Pension Cover  is calculated on the basis of the beneficiary's number of years' service, with a ceiling of 40 years, it being specified that at the date  of  closure  of  the  scheme,  on  31  December  2000,  the minimum length of service required was 10 years. The Pension Cover may not exceed 40% of the calculation base, plus 0.5%",

Around  120  Senior  managers  (active  or retired) are eligible for this scheme subject to the requirement, for  those  in  active  employment,  that  they  fulfil  all  the conditions after having ended their career with the Company.\n\n## Collective Retirement Savings plan (PERCO)\n\nSince  2003,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  proposed  that  employees  make savings with a view to their retirement within the scope of the PERCO. If 100% of the Profit Sharing is placed in the PERCO for five  consecutive  years,  an  employer's  contribution  of  \u20ac600 gross  is  paid  (capped  at  \u20ac4,600/year  total  PERCO  employer contributions). Each year, employees may also transfer 10 days of  saved  leave  time  in  the  PERCO,  with  an  additional employer contribution of 20%.\n\n## Pre-retirement arrangements\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  pays  close  attention  to  its  employees'  retirement conditions. The existing arrangements are, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 early  retirement  leave  ('cong\u00e9  de  fin  de  carri\u00e8re',  CFC): this  early  retirement  arrangement  consists  of  exempting employees from the requirement to perform their activities, while  maintaining  their  remuneration  (up  to  a  limit  of \u20ac10,342  gross/month)  as  well  as  profit  sharing,  incentives and paid leave. The CFC may range from 3 months for 20 years' seniority to 9 months for 30 years' seniority and more; and\n- \u00b7 retirement  compensation  ('indemnit\u00e9  de  d\u00e9part  \u00e0  la retraite', IDR): the scale set by collective agreement is more favourable than that of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries.  Thus,  when  they retire,  employees  may  benefit  from  retirement  indemnities ranging  from  2  months'  salary  for  5  years'  service  to 8 months' salary for 40 years of service. In order to increase the special leave prior to retirement, employees may opt to convert all or part of their retirement indemnities into time, or  may  choose  to  receive  payment  of  all  or  part  of  the retirement indemnities, which will be made at the time they leave the Company.\n\nThese  commitments  are  guaranteed  by  external  financial cover  aimed  at  gradually  building  up  funds  derived  from premiums paid to external organisations.\n\n## Employee Welfare schemes in France\n\nIn addition to the compulsory guarantees provided for by the collective  bargaining  agreements,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up,  in France,  under  an  agreement,  an  Employee  Welfare  scheme providing additional collective guarantees to its employees.\n\nAll  these  guarantees  are  based  on  the  gross  income  up  to eight times the French annual social security ceiling, except for the Education Annuity which is limited to up to four times the ceiling. They are generally financed on Brackets A, B and C of income, except for the Education Annuity which is based on Brackets  A  and  B,  and  the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  which  is based on Brackets B and C.\n\nThis  Employee  Welfare  scheme  provides  guarantees  in  the event of:\n\n- \u00b7 incapacity: to all employees, 90% of their gross remuneration limited to 8 social security caps, at this level net of charges, after the first 90 days of work stoppage; in the event of disability: to all employees, a fraction that is a function of the level of disability, rising to 90% of their gross remuneration  limited  to  8  social  security  caps,  up  to  this amount net of charges;\n- \u00b7 in the event of death;\n- \u00b7 for  all  employees,  the  payment  of  a  Lump  Sum  Death Benefit,  increased  depending  on  the  employee's  family status. The amount of this Benefit is doubled in the event of accidental death;\n- \u00b7 for  the  employees  affiliated  with  the  benefit  scheme  for managers  and  employees  governed  by  Article  36  of  the AGIRC convention, the payment of a Spouse Pension to the surviving  spouse.  This  ensures  that  the  spouse  has  an income  similar  to  the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  paid  for supplementary  retirement  contributions  on  the  portion  of remuneration  greater  than  the  annual  cap  on  social security if death had occurred at the age of 65; and\n- \u00b7 for all employees, the payment of an Education Annuity to each  dependent  child,  according  to  an  age-based schedule.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  the  Lump  Sum  Equivalent  for  these guarantees may not exceed \u20ac2.3 million per event.\n\n## Minimum guaranteed lump sum death benefits\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has established an additional guaranteed Lump Sum Death  Benefit  that  supplements,  where  applicable,  for  all employees, the Lump Sum Death Benefit in an amount equal to three years' average income. The total amount of the risk capital  needed  to  fund  the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  and Education  Annuity,  the  Lump  Sum  Death  Benefits  and  the minimum guaranteed Lump Sum Death Benefit is capped.\n\n## Healthcare expenses\n\nThe healthcare scheme is compulsory for all the employees of L'Or\u00e9al and its French subsidiaries. Employees have the option of including their family members  in  these  schemes. Contributions are generally individual. The contribution by the employee is partly financed by the Company.\n\n## 4.3.2.6. Promoting Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity and Inclusion are strategic challenges for the Group, whose objective is to have teams that reflect this diversity and to  offer  them  an  inclusive  work  environment,  in  order  to respond to the aspirations  of  consumers  around  the  world  in their  infinite  diversity.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  defined  four  pillars  to continue to make progress on the challenges of Diversity and Inclusion:\n\n- 1. Gender : achieve gender parity at all levels and functions of the  company;  contribute  to  the  establishment  of  more inclusive environments in favour of the LGBTQIA+ community everywhere in the world; engage against any type of harassment or violence, particularly sexual harassment and gender-based violence;\n- 2. Disability: accelerate the inclusion of people with disabilities, internally, with a minimum target in all countries. The  Group  also  adopts  an  inclusive  approach  towards consumers, suppliers and all stakeholders;\n- 3. Socio-economic  and  multicultural  origins: increase  the diversity  of  socio-economic  and  cultural  origins  in  the Group's teams; and\n- 4. Age and generations: a  new  pillar  launched  in  2020,  with the  goal  of  promoting  dialogue  and  cooperation  among employees of different generations, both for seniors and for young graduates.\n\nThe Group's Diversity and Inclusion policy is also reflected in an approach  with  its  suppliers  (see  section  4.3.3.5  'Solidarity Sourcing'  of  this  document),  consumers,  local  communities, NGOs  and  associations  dedicated  to  inclusion  on  each continent.\n\n4",

In  its  Code  of  Ethics,  the  Group  commits  not  to  harm  the dignity of human beings or present degrading stereotypes in its advertising.  It  is  also  sensitive  to  possible  reactions  from different religious, ethnic, cultural or social groups.\n\n## Gender equity: professional parity and equality for women and men\n\nAchieving  real  gender  equality,  up  to  the  most  strategic positions,  is a  key  challenge  for  L'Or\u00e9al,  both  to  promote a culture  of  inclusion  and  strengthen  its  ability  to  innovate. The  Group  therefore  ensures  that  all  jobs  are  accessible  to women and men, both at the level  of  recruitment  and  with\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al and gender balance\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, women account for:\n\n- \u00b7 69% of the total workforce;\n- \u00b7 64% of managers;\n- \u00b7 47% of expatriates in place;\n- \u00b7 49% of key positions; (2)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  chose  to  have  its  gender  equality  practices  and policies audited and relies on two independent organisations to measure and assess the situation of each subsidiary: Gender Equality  European  &  International  Standard  (GEEIS)  and Economic Dividend for Gender Equality (EDGE).\n\nSince  2010,  the  Group's  head  office  in  France  and  23  of  its countries  have  been  awarded  the  GEEIS  label,  and  are audited  every  two  years  by  Bureau  Veritas  to  measure  the progress  achieved.  The  countries  currently  certified  are: Austria,  Belgium,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  Czech  Republic,  Estonia, Finland,  France,  Germany,  Hungary,  Ireland,  Italy,  Latvia,\n\nregard  to  opportunities  for  career  development.  Special attention is given to pivotal periods such as parenthood (see Section 4.3.2.4. ' L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care ').\n\nThe  diversity  and  gender  balance  policy  deployed  in  the Group includes, in particular, an objective for gender equality in  strategic  positions  by  2023  (280  positions  with  the  greatest responsibility,  the  'TOP  280').  General  Management  reports annually to the Board of Directors on this policy and the results obtained during the previous financial year.\n\nSince  March  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  published  its  'Index  of professional  gender  equality',  which  is  calculated  using  five indicators  defined  by  the  'Professional  Future'  law.  This  2021 Group Index is at 96% for all of L'Or\u00e9al's French entities.\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  collaborated  with  the  INED  (National Institute  for  Demographic  Studies)  to  conduct  an  annual analysis  of  the  differences  in  remuneration  between  women and men working in France. The aim is to guarantee identical pay  for  people  with  the  same  level  of  skills  and  the  same classification.  The  median  pay  gap  in  France  narrowed  from 10% in 2007 to 0% in 2019 for all categories (1) .\n\nIn  addition  to  the  INED  analysis  in  France,  in  2020  L'Or\u00e9al launched  a  new  tool  based  on  the  'EDGE  Unexplained Gender  Pay  Gap  Methodology'  to  calculate  and  measure salary equality for women and men. This tool was launched as a  pilot  in  15  countries  (representing  70%  of  the  global workforce) in 2020: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France,  Germany,  India,  Indonesia,  Italy,  Mexico,  Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's goal is to eliminate any 'unexplained' gender pay gap.\n\n- \u00b7 67% of employees promoted;\n- \u00b7 59% of international brand directors \u2611 ;\n- \u00b7 49%  of  positions  of  greater  responsibility  within  L'Or\u00e9al SA; (3)\n- \u00b7 54%  in  positions  of  greater  responsibility  within  the Group; (4)\n- \u00b7 26% of Executive Committee members; and\n- \u00b7 58% of members of the Board of Directors.\n\nLithuania, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs  of  today,  7  other  countries  rely  on  the  EDGE  certification process. Subsidiaries are audited by Flocert or Intertek in order to  be  certified.  L'Or\u00e9al  USA  was  the  first  country  to  earn  the label  in  2014.  The  countries  currently  certified  are:  Australia, Brazil, Canada, United States, India, Russia, and the Philippines.\n\nAs of today, 59% of the workforce was covered by one of the two audit certifications of the Group's practices and policies on gender equality.\n\nIn 2020, a total of 30 countries \u2611 continue to be EDGE or GEEIS certified.",

        "page_content": "Policies, performance indicators and results\n\n## Being a company that is committed against gender-based violence\n\nIn 2018, L'Or\u00e9al was the first company to join the 'One In Three Women'  network,  the  first  European  network  of  companies committed to fighting violence against women in the private sphere (1) .  Its  aim  is  to  create  and  test  measures  to  combat violence  against  women  and  to  support  the  employees concerned, through specialised NGOs.\n\nConcrete actions were taken in 2020 with the 'One in Three Women' network, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 during the Covid-19 crisis, L'Or\u00e9al supported the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale  Solidarit\u00e9  Femmes  (FNSF),  through  a  national awareness  campaign  (digital  billboards  or  advertisements on  the  metro  and  radio).  Internally,  L'Or\u00e9al  asked employees to support the FNSF with a micro-donation;\n- \u00b7 an e-learning was created to raise employee awareness;\n- \u00b7 on  November  25, International  Day  for  the  Elimination  of Violence  against  Women,  the  'One  in  Three  Women' network launched a podcast, in which L'Or\u00e9al participated to describe its commitments and actions.\n\nAfter having committed to support the ILO's adoption of the first international convention against violence and harassment in  the  workplace in 2019 along with the NGO, CARE, L'Or\u00e9al established a policy on domestic violence in 2020. The rollout of this policy is planned for early 2021.\n\nWhen  it  was  launched  in  2018,  the  #StOpE  initiative  against so-called  'ordinary'  sexism  in  the  workplace,  led  by  L'Or\u00e9al France with AccorHotels and EY, brought together 30  companies  and  organisations  that  signed  a  commitment under  the  patronage  of  the  French  Minister  for  Equality between Women  and  Men  and  the  Fight Against Discrimination.  Today,  114  organisations  take  part  in  this initiative  and  have  implemented  at  least  one  of  the  eight priority actions  identified.  An  e-learning  was  developed collaboratively by 7 companies in the network.\n\n## Contributing to the establishment of more inclusive environments in favour of the LGBTQIA+ community\n\nWith a presence on all continents, L'Or\u00e9al contributes to the establishment  of  more  inclusive  environments  for  LGBTQIA+ community (2) .\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  one  of  the  sponsors  of  the  LGBTI Standards  of  Conduct  established  by  the  United  Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights since 2018;\n- \u00b7 In 2019, a policy for co-parent was implemented in France and the United States, with the same rights established for paternity leave.  Other countries followed and this policy will be integrated into the new version of the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme in 2021;\n- \u00b7 In 2020, L'Or\u00e9al published its Employee Human Rights Policy; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al USA again received the maximum score of 100 on the  2020  Corporate  Equality  Index  of  the  Human  Rights Campaign Foundation, which reflects its commitment.\n\n## Promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities\n\nFor more than 15 years, L'Or\u00e9al has applied a global policy to include  people  with  disabilities  within  the  Company.  In  2020, the Group employed 1,381 people with disabilities, i.e . 1.6% of the total workforce. L'Or\u00e9al has renewed its target of having at  least  2%  employees  with  disabilities  by  2025  in  countries without  specific  local  regulations.  The  disability  pillar  of L'Or\u00e9al's  Diversity  and  Inclusion  policy  covers  the  following five priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Recruitment:  L'Or\u00e9al  promotes  the  recruitment  of  people with disabilities in all countries;\n- \u00b7 Declaration of disability: create the conditions for employees to declare their disability, so that the company can adapt positions, jobs and support;\n- \u00b7 Digital  accessibility:  any  new  digital  platform  must  now meet this objective;\n- \u00b7 Employee awareness: internal communication and training are  closely  linked  to  the  success  of  the  Disability  pillar  of L'Or\u00e9al's Diversity policy; and\n- \u00b7 Sharing best practices: collaboration with experts, associations  and  NGOs  recognised  on  the  subject  is  an important  element  in  advancing  inclusion  within  and outside the Group. An active member of the ILO since 2010, L'Or\u00e9al  was  one  of  the  first  signatories  of  the  Global Business and Disability Network Charter in 2015.\n\nIn November 2020, L'Or\u00e9al signed The Valuable 500 charter, a private  sector,  inter-company  initiative  on  the  national  and international markets to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\n## Reinforcing multicultural and socio-economic diversity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's goal is to reflect the diversity of the markets in which it operates, at all levels and in all functions. Particular attention is  therefore paid to the diversification of recruitment pools, to ensuring equal opportunities in terms of professional development, and to raising the awareness of employees and management on this subject.\n\n- \u25cf 167:  Number  of  nationalities  (in  the  global  workforce) distributed among the 68 countries.\n\nSince 2015, L'Or\u00e9al has supported the Equal@Work network of the European Network Against Racism (ENAR), which helps to ensure progress on this important issue.\n\nSince  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  an  active  member  of  the  Tent Partnership for Refugees, a global network of 140 companies that  support  refugees.  This  partnership  allows  L'Or\u00e9al  to strenghten the socio-economic and multicultural diversity of its teams, and to attract candidates concerned.\n\n## Training employees in Diversity and Inclusion\n\nIn order to support these initiatives, L'Or\u00e9al trains its employees in  Diversity  and  Inclusion  by  organising  'Diversity  Training Workshops'. At the end of 2020, over 65,000 employees had participated  in  these  sessions.  In  the  context  of  Covid-19,  a virtual  version  of  the  workshop  was  made  available  in  2020 with a 'Train the Trainer' module.\n\n4",

Since its launch, more than 570 of the Group's employees, both men and women, have taken part in  this  programme.  The  Group  wanted  to  go  further  by partnering with Danone to create editions in Asia in 2014 (EVE Asia-Pacific), and Africa (EVE Africa) since 2017.\n\nOn 'MyLearning', the Group's internal platform dedicated to training, a page devoted to the issues of Diversity and Inclusion was created in 2020.\n\nIn 2020,  the  Group  set  up  an  e-learning  module  on unconscious bias, which is today available in 7 languages. 95% of recruiters have also received virtual training on this issue.\n\n## Awards obtained in 2020\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  been  recognised  on  several  occasions  for  its excellence in the area of Diversity and Inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  was  again  recognised  by  the  Bloomberg  GenderEquality Index acknowledging the most advanced companies in the area of gender equality;\n- \u25cf In  March  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  ranked  first  in  Europe  -  out  of 255  companies  listed  on  the  stock  market  -  in  a  study conducted  by  Equileap  and  financed  by  the  European Commission on Gender Equality; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al ranks in the top 10 of the top 100 companies in the 2020 Refinitiv Global Diversity and Inclusion Indxe.\n\n## 4.3.3. Human rights policy\n\n## 4.3.3.1. A commitment of the entire organisation\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment to Human Rights is based in particular on  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  United Nations Guiding principles on Business and Human Rights and the  Fundamental  Conventions  of  the  International  Labour Organization,  although  these  conventions  have  not  all  been ratified by all the countries where L'Or\u00e9al operates.\n\nThe Group completed a generic review of the Human Rights issues  related  to  its  operational  activities  and  commercial relationships, and identified four groups of impacted stakeholders that inform the Group's Human Rights policy:\n\n- \u00b7 the human rights of our employees;\n- \u00b7 the human rights of our suppliers's employees;\n- \u00b7 the human rights of consumers; and\n- \u00b7 the human rights of communities.\n\nIn  order to achieve its goals in Human Rights and face these risks, L'Or\u00e9al has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact  since  2003,  and  is  committed  to  respecting  all internationally recognised Human Rights. A specific partnership was  also  signed  in  2019  with  the Danish  Institute  for  Human Rights to support the Group in the implementation of Human Rights. This commitment  to  respecting  Human  Rights  is supported each year at the highest level of the Company by its  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, by the Chief Ethics Officer and the Chief Sustainability Officer, who also chairs the Group's Human Rights Committee. Aware of the scale of the challenge  throughout  its  entire  value  chain,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set ambitious  goals  to  respect  Human  Rights  with  regard  to  its consumers  (see  section  4.3.3.2.  'Measures  taken  in  favour consumers'  of  this  document),  its  employees  (see  section 4.3.3.3. 'Measures taken in favour of L'Or\u00e9al employees' of this document),  its  suppliers's  employees  (see  section  4.3.3.4. 'Measures  taken  to  respect  employees  of  the  Group's suppliers  in  the  context  of  their  working  conditions'  of  this document), local communities (see section 4.3.3.5. 'Measures taken in favour of local communities' of this document) and for  women in particular (see section 4.3.3.6. 'Measures taken to  promote the rights  of  women'  of  this  document),  through various internal or public documents.",

Measures taken in favour of consumers\n\n## Product quality and safety: a priority\n\nA chapter of L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics is devoted to product quality and safety.\n\nConsumer  safety  is  an  absolute  priority  for  L'Or\u00e9al:  assessing safety  is  central  to  any  new  product  development  process and a prerequisite before any new product can be brought to the market.\n\n100%  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Group's  products  are  subject  to  a  rigorous safety assessment.\n\nThe  Worldwide  Safety  Evaluation  Department  specifically evaluates the safety of raw materials and finished products. It establishes the toxicological profile of the ingredients used and the  tolerance  of  the  formulas  before  they  are  launched  on the market. The same safety standards are applied worldwide to ensure that consumers from across the globe have access to products of identical quality. L'Or\u00e9al goes one step further in  safety  assessments  by  monitoring  the  potential  adverse effects  that  may  arise  once  the  product  is  on  the  market through  its international cosmeto-vigilance  network.  This network  collects,  validates  and  analyses,  using  recognised rigorous methodologies, the adverse effects related to the use of  a  product.  This  allows  for  appropriate  corrective  measures to be taken where necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn responding to questions that civil society may ask regarding certain  substances  and  their  effects  on  health  and  the environment, three points summarise L'Or\u00e9al's position:\n\n- \u00b7 vigilance with regard to any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u00b7 co-operation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u00b7 precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\n(1)\n\nThe launch of the website 'Au coeur de nos produits' (1) ( Inside our  products )  in  2019  is  testimony  to  the  Group's  desire  for increased transparency on this issue.\n\nFinally, production quality standards define rules governing the quality of products, for all stages from creation to production and distribution. Almost all plants are ISO 9001 certified for their production  and  follow  the  Best  Manufacturing  Practices  in accordance with the ISO 22716 standard.",

        "page_content": "## L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## The product safety assessment process\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  a  process  to  ensure  that  all  products developed  by  the  Group,  whatever  the  geographical location  of  the  laboratory  in  charge  of  the  project,  are subject to the same level of rigorous safety evaluation. The assessments by the Worldwide Safety Evaluation unit, based on a multidisciplinary scientific approach, are carried out at all  stages  of  the  life  cycle  of  the  products.  This  approach enables  L'Or\u00e9al  to  meet  the  safety  requirements  of  the national regulations in force in all the countries in which its products are put on sale, testifying to their safety of use. A safety assessment is conducted for each product launched on the market.\n\nThe product safety evaluation is based on the evaluation of each  ingredient  that  enters  into  the  composition  of  the product and the finished product itself. It is carried out on the  basis  of  existing  safety  data  and  the  latest  scientific knowledge, and takes into consideration the conditions of use of the product.  If necessary,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts additional safety studies in qualified laboratories all over the world.  The  results  of  these  studies  are  interpreted  by experienced  scientists  who  are  specially  trained  in  safety issues with regard to cosmetic ingredients and products.\n\nFurthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al's  ethical  principles,  rooted  in  both scientific  rigour  and  responsiveness  to  societal  concerns, lead to a pre-emptive approach whereby formulations are evolved  by  removing  and/or  replacing  substances  on  the basis of new data.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's added value, in terms of the safety assessment of ingredients  and  finished  products,  lies  in  its  investment  for nearly 40 years in the development of predictive methods and  tissue  engineering,  and  their  international  regulatory recognition.  For  many  years,  the  Group  has  thus  been investing  in  science  and  technology  to  create  new evaluation  tools  which  are  used  every  day  by  safety assessors.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also works  closely with all the international stakeholders  involved  in  relevant  industries  in  order  to progress  the  development  of  alternative  cross-disciplinary solutions in the field of safety assessment.\n\nThis  longstanding  commitment  means  that  since  1989,  or 14  years  before  regulations  required,  the  Group  no  longer carries  out  animal  testing  in  laboratories  for  any  of  its products.  Equally,  L'Or\u00e9al  no  longer  tests  its  ingredients on  animals.  L'Or\u00e9al  no  longer  tolerates  any  exceptions  to this rule and this applies worldwide. The Group also does not delegate  responsibility  for  doing  so  to  anyone  else. Some health  authorities  may  nevertheless  decide  to  carry out animal testing themselves for certain cosmetic products and  this  is  still  the  case  in  China.  For  more  than  10  years, L'Or\u00e9al has been the company most committed to getting Chinese  authorities  and  scientists  to  recognise  alternative methods  and  changing  cosmetic  regulations  to  achieve the  complete  and  final  elimination  of  animal  testing. A  a  result,  since  2014,  some  products  manufactured  and marketed  in  China  such  as  shampoos,  shower  gels  and certain make-up products are no longer tested on animals.\n\nIn  fact,  L'Or\u00e9al's products continually evolve as and when technological  innovations  occur,  but  with  the  constant desire  to  guarantee  the  highest  level  of  safety  for  both consumers and professionals.\n\n4",

They include: \u25cf La Roche-Posay with its action against skin cancer: more than 110 million people have committed to having their moles checked to prevent melanoma since the campaign was launched in 2014, and the brand has funded more than 500,000 free examinations of moles in 40 countries; \u25cf L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel  with  its  action  to  prevent  musculoskeletal  disorders:  more  than  35,000 downloads  of  the  app  that  trains  hairdressers  on  stretches  and  warm-up  exercises  to  prevent musculoskeletal problems. As  health  authorities  are  increasingly  concerned  about  the  eating  disorders  affecting  some  young women, L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics states that the Group will not work with models who clearly present a major behavioural disorder.

The Group's principles governing the processing of personal data have been disseminated all over the world  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all  employees  about  respect  for  ethical  principles,  and  legal  and regulatory  requirements  in  the  matter.

'Creating  the  conditions  for  a  positive  and  attractive  work environment' of this document).\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  all  employees  receive  at  least  the minimum salary set by local law or the applicable collective agreements, and that they receive a living wage (1) that covers their basic needs, calculated in line with best practices.\n\nLastly, L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiaries must comply with applicable local legislation  and  the  minimum  set  of  core  rules  designed  to prevent  serious  Human  Rights  violations.  The  details  and implementation  of  these  rules  is  described  in  L'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance  Plan  (see  section  3.4.  'Vigilance  plan'  of  this document) which also explains the Group's organisation in the area of Human Rights.\n\n## 4.3.3.4. Measures taken in favour of employees of the Group's suppliers in the context of their working conditions\n\nL'Or\u00e9al seeks out suppliers that share its ethical commitments, namely  with  regard  to  the  Human  Rights  and  working conditions of their employees.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's commitments are communicated to all suppliers via the general terms of purchase. Moreover, suppliers identified in the  Group's  risk  mapping  must  sign  an  ethical  commitment letter; some  may  also  be  audited.  The  details and implementation of this Buy & Care programme are described in L'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance Plan in section 3.4. 'Vigilance plan' and 4.3.1.3.2. 'Within the supply chain' of this document.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al wants to carry this goal beyond the Group. This is why the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  includes  a  new demanding  commitment:  ensuring  that  all  employees  of strategic  suppliers  are  paid  at  least  the  level  of  a  'living' wage. Calculated by region and aligned with the best local practices,  these  new  standards  must  allow  employees  to cover  their  basic  needs  and  those  of  their  family  for  decent housing,  food,  education  and  any  other  needs.  In  many countries, this 'living' wage goes beyond the legal minimums.",

While being a company committed to demonstrating strong corporate citizenship, L'Or\u00e9al makes a contribution to many local projects.\n\nThis ambition was reflected in a commitment in the Sharing Beauty With All programme: to allow more than  100,000  people  from  underprivileged  or  poor  communities  to  access  work  by  the  end  of  2020. This means that L'Or\u00e9al supports more people outside the Company than there are employees in the Group.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  created  its  global  Solidarity  Sourcing  programme  in  2010.  Its  aim  is  to  use  the Group's  purchasing  power  to  serve  social  inclusion  by  dedicating  part  of  its  purchases  to  suppliers providing access to work and a sustainable income for people who are generally excluded from the labour market, economically vulnerable communities, including small businesses and those that have trouble accessing major contractors.\n\nThe Solidarity  Sourcing programme  concerns  for  example:  fair  trade  producers,  companies  which employ people with disabilities, social insertion enterprises or companies owned by minorities (when this is permitted by national legislation).\n\nSolidarity Sourcing offers a novel purchasing approach due to its global, holistic nature:\n\n- \u25cf the programme is deployed in all geographic zones;\n- \u25cf it  concerns  all  areas  of  purchases  (raw  materials,  packaging,  subcontracting,  promotional  items and indirect retail, etc.); and\n- \u25cf it comprises an environmental component for the projects that require it.\n\nThe ambition of the programme is to associate economic performance with a positive corporate social responsibility footprint.\n\nGlobal beneficiaries of the Programme included 2,472 people with a disability in 30 countries in 2020. This number of beneficiaries tripled in six years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, as part of the Solidarity Sourcing programme, 81,138 economically or socially vulnerable\n\npeople gained permanent employment.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Solidarity Sourcing programme enabled 81,138 people from underprivileged or poor communities all over the world to gain access to work or to keep a job and receive a decent income. This represents an additional 10,226 people (14%) compared with 2019 on a like-for-like basis. Solidarity  Sourcing has  379  projects  up  and  running  in  568  local  initiatives  in  57  countries,  with  the support of 72 third parties.\n\nThis  programme  has  offered  the  opportunity  for  the  Group's  purchasers  to  enrich  their  jobs  by contributing to improving the lives of thousands of people involved in the production of the goods and services  purchased.  As  a  result,  in  2020,  165  buyers  were  involved  in  a Solidarity  Sourcing project, an increase of 18% compared to 2019.\n\nIn  addition,  L'Or\u00e9al  encourages  its  strategic  suppliers  to  implement  programmes  inspired  from  the Solidarity  Sourcing  programme  for  their  own  purchases.  In  2020,  22%  of  these  suppliers  have  thus applied a similar programme. L'Or\u00e9al pledged that 20% of them would be involved in the project by the end of 2020: this goal was achieved.\n\nIn 2020, 22% of strategic suppliers were involved in the Group's Solidarity Sourcing programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FOCUS on the Group's solidarity purchases in France\n\n77  projects  of  the  global  Solidarity  Sourcing  programme  support  employment  in  France  (1  in  5 projects).  France,  the  birthplace  of  the  Group,  is  the  country  that  undertakes  the  highest  number  of Solidarity Sourcing projects (out of 57 countries in which the programme operates) and the fifth country in number of beneficiaries behind Burkina Faso, Indonesia, Madagascar and the United States.\n\nIn 2020, solidarity purchases in France represented 2,509 full-time jobs. The number of jobs generated by the Solidarity Sourcing programme in France was up 6% compared with 2019 (147 jobs), thanks in large part to the mobilisation of Group purchasing managers and 67 suppliers.\n\nThese projects cover a wide range of purchases, including cardboard, glass and plastic packaging, POS advertising materials, and services, packaging and logistics:\n\n- \u25cf nearly 28% of the beneficiaries are people with disabilities (693 jobs); and\n- \u25cf more than half of the beneficiaries are in zones classified as vulnerable (1,306 jobs). These are areas classified  as  'Rural  Revitalisation  Zones'  (ZRR)  and  'Sensitive  Urban  Zones'  (QPV).  These  jobs, located on the sites of 22 Group suppliers, cover production needs (glass bottles, tubes, cardboard boxes, subcontracting) or services related to our business.\n\nOther solidary purchase projects in France mainly concern support for Living Heritage Enterprises (EPV), SMEs,  older  workers  facing  hiring  discrimination,  women  entrepreneurs,  women  who  are  victims  of domestic violence, people being integrated into society, and a bio-solidarity cooperative.",

Tax policy\n\nConcurrently  with  the  commitments  of  the  Code  of  Ethics, L'Or\u00e9al has defined its principles of tax policy in the Group by considering the contribution of taxation as an integral part of Corporate  Social  Responsibility,  which  constitutes  a  way  to participate  positively  to  the  development  of  the  country where the Group is present.\n\nLa fiscal policy of the L'Or\u00e9al Group  rests  on  three components:  Compliance,  Transparency  and  Legitimacy,  as defined  in  the  Internal  Tax  Charter  prepared  and  distributed around the world.\n\nWithin  the  Operational  Finance  Department,  the  Group  Tax Department  composed  of  business  experts  (intra-group transactions,  customs,  reporting,  compliance  and  M&A)  and geographic  experts  monitors  compliance  with  the  Tax  Policy and its Governance.\n\n## Compliance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al completes its tax declarations and pays its taxes by the deadlines in compliance with the laws and regulations in the countries  in  which  the  Group  operates.  Special  vigilance  is required  on  compliance  with  the  rules  related  to  the  fight against fraud and tax evasion.\n\nBecause  of  its  global  presence  (79  countries),  the  Group  is subject  to  different  tax  regulations.  The  Group  is  located  in countries where it conducts a real operational and commercial  activity.  If  applicable,  the  Group's  presence  in certain so-called 'tax haven'  countries  is justified for operational reasons and the development of its activity, and not for tax purposes.\n\nThe  Tax  Department  and  the  Finance  Departments,  assisted where applicable by external advisors, monitor changes in tax regulations  to  ensure  that  the  Group  complies  with  these regulations.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al ensures that transactions between Group companies are  carried  out  in  compliance  with  the  principle  of  full competition  as  defined  by  the  Organisation  of  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and satisfies the new declaration obligations (Declaration country by country) via a an electronic transmission to the French tax authorities.\n\n## Transparency\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  establishes  and  maintains  relations  with  Tax  and Customs  Authorities  based  on  transparency  pursuant  to  the Group's  'zero  tolerance'  rule  on  corruption.  L'Or\u00e9al  also develops  a  constructive  relationship  with  tax  and  customs authorities,  a  relationship  based  on  the  principle  of  mutual respect.\n\nWhere permitted to do so by the States, L'Or\u00e9al has joined the cooperative  compliance  programmes  launched  by  tax authorities: for example, L'Or\u00e9al entered into a relationship of trust with the French tax authorities on 3 February 2020.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  may  contribute  to  the  analysis  of legislative  changes  at  the  request  of  tax  and  customs authorities  or  the  professional  associations  requested  for  said changes.\n\n## Legitimacy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  legitimately  applies  the  most  relevant  tax  treatment, in accordance  with  the  economic  reality,  operational objectives and the laws in force.\n\nIn  an  evolving  international  tax  environment,  the  positions taken  by  the  Group  may  be  questioned  and  subject  to  tax audits by the local tax authorities. If there is disagreement with a  Tax  or  Customs  Authority,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  able  to  legitimately defend its interpretation of the law, prove its good faith and, as needed, bring the disputes to court.\n\nA  regular  review  of  tax  risks  carried  out  by  the  Group's  Tax Department in contact with the local financial teams enables the  risks  to  be  assessed,  resulting,  if  applicable,  to  the recognition of a tax provision. The main tax risks are reported to  the  General  Management  and  presented  to  the  Audit Committee.\n\n4",

Scope of consolidation\n\nThe  employees  indicated  and  their  breakdown  correspond to the total headcount (1) .\n\nEmployees  in  the  Retail  Excellence  4,  Thermes  de  La  Roche Posay, Saint Gervais Mont Blanc and Ecole OA entities, a total of  461  employees,  are  included  in  the  total  workforce.  The different  distributions  of  these  employees  are  calculated  in proportion  to  the  distribution  of  France  employees.  They  are excluded  from  the  indicators  on  diversity,  minimum  salaries and the number of collective agreements. Retail Excellence 4 is also excluded from the training indicators.\n\n## 4.5.1.2. Indicators\n\nThe indicators chosen are those used in the management of employees and of the social aspects of the  Company. They reflect the results of the Human Resources policy.\n\n## 4.5.1.3. Data\n\nFour methods are used to collect data for the defined scope:\n\n- \u00b7 most  of  the  data  are  collected  using  the  dedicated 'Country  Reporting'  intranet,  available  in  all  countries  in which  there  is  a  L'Or\u00e9al  subsidiary.  The  system  covers several  topics:  employees,  training,  absenteeism,  labour relations, the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme, remuneration, diversity, recruitment, freedom of association and profit sharing. At the beginning of each financial year, the  local  Human  Resources  Directors  provide  the  required data for the previous year;\n- \u00b7 other data are collected by each department concerned ( i.e. Training,  Recruitment)  using  dedicated  systems  which follow the same operational and dissemination approach;\n- \u00b7 if information is not consolidated for the entire scope of the Cosmetics  Division,  it  can  be  extrapolated  from  the available  results  for  the  entities  connected  to  the  local Information Systems (IS), provided that the scope covered by such entities is representative; and\n- \u00b7 lastly,  the  specific  data  relating  to  'managers'  and  other specific  populations  (expatriates,  key  positions,  etc.)  are gathered  from  the  'CAROL'  online  career  monitoring system, deployed in all Cosmetic Divisions subsidiaries.\n\nThe number of employees trained is calculated on the basis of all types of training format and length.\n\nConcerning  the L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care indicator  relating  to healthcare coverage, the best practices in the countries are regularly  evaluated  in  each  country  in  which  the  Group  is present.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been put in place. They are reviewed each year, taking into account  the  Statutory  Auditors'  recommendations  and  the monitoring  objectives  for  subsequent  years:  updating  the indicators to be monitored, improving their definition and their communication, monitoring and control process.\n\n## 4.5.2. Health and safety data\n\n## 4.5.2.1. Scope of consolidation\n\nThe  safety  indicators  relate  to  all  sites:  plants,  distribution centres,  administrative  sites,  research  centres  and  stores, as well as sales forces.\n\nSafety reporting covers 99.6% of the plants, distribution centres, administrative sites, research centres, sales forces and stores.\n\nAt  year-end  2020,  172  administrative  sites  and  research centres, sales forces and stores participated in the reporting.\n\nTo  achieve  better  monitoring  of  accident  history  by  type  of site, safety reporting from administrative sites has been refined in recent years by being  split into three categories: administrative  sites  with  only  one  strictly  administrative  staff; sales  forces  for  travelling  staff;  stores  for  in-store  beauty consultants managed by L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  safety  indicators  of  the  plants,  distribution  centres, administrative  sites  or  research  centres  sold  or  closed  during the financial year are reported in full up to the date they exit the scope. The plants, distribution centres, administrative sites or  research  centres  that  join  the  Group  have  a  maximum period of two years to integrate the environmental and safety reporting  systems.  In  accordance  with  this  rule,  the  data  for one  site  recently  reporting  to  the  Group  are  not  included in the 2020 EHS reporting: the Cosmeurop plant in France.\n\n## 4.5.2.2. Indicators\n\nThe indicators applied are those used in the management of the  Group's  sites.  They  reflect  the  results  of  the  Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy. In 2020, a change in the definition of the MESUR indicator led to a postponement of the audit of the corresponding data until 2021.\n\nHours worked reports the time during which the staff is exposed to  professional  risks,  including  remote  work  or  equivalent. They  include  overtime  hours.  However,  they  do  not  include holidays and days of absence (illness, paid holidays).\n\n## 4.5.2.3. Data\n\nThe following method is used to collect data for the defined scope:\n\nThe health and safety data are collected using the dedicated site reporting intranet system, available in all countries in which there  is  a  L'Or\u00e9al  subsidiary.  The  required  data  are  reported every month by the local managers.\n\nWhen the data are compiled, each site or zone must validate the accuracy of all the data provided.",

The systems are reviewed each year, taking into  account  the  Statutory  Auditors'  recommendations  and monitoring  objectives  for  subsequent  years:  updating  the indicators  to  be  monitored,  improving  their  definition,  and enhancing  the  communication,  monitoring  and  control process.\n\nIn rare cases,  certain  data  already  published  for  the preceding year may be modified when inaccuracies or errors are discovered after the end of the financial year. These data are monitored and included in the annual consistency review. They are included in the reported figures each year.\n\n## 4.5.3. Environmental data\n\n## 4.5.3.1. Scope of consolidation\n\nThe environmental indicators cover all sites: plants, distribution centres, administrative sites and research centres.\n\nEnvironmental reporting covers 99.4% of the plants, distribution centres,  administrative  sites  and  research  centres  with  more than 50 people for these last two types of site.\n\nThe environmental indicators of the plants, distribution centres, administrative  sites  or  research  centres  sold  or  closed  during the financial year are reported in full up to the date they exit the scope. The plants, distribution centres, administrative sites or  research  centres  that  join  the  Group  have  a  maximum period of two years to integrate the environmental and safety reporting  systems.  In  accordance  with  this  rule,  the  data  for one  site  recently  reporting  to  the  Group  are  not  included  in the 2020 EHS reporting: the Cosmeurop plant in France.\n\nThe  indicators  do  not  take  into  account  the  impacts  of exceptional incidents or events caused externally (construction,  extension  work,  etc.)  not  linked  to  the  site's activity in terms of water and energy consumption and waste production. Similarly, in the special case where a subcontractor  is  located  geographically  on  the  sites,  its impacts are not taken into account.\n\nIn  order  to  cover  all  of  the  Group's  impacts,  environmental reporting was extended to the Group's administrative sites and research  centres  in  2016.  In  2020,  85  administrative  sites  and research centres participated in the reporting. Some sites that share  their  premises  with  other  companies  are  unable  to obtain  certain  information:  100%  of  these  sites  provided information on energy consumption and CO2 emissions, 96% of the  sites  reported  their  water  consumption  and  93%  of  the sites reported their quantity of waste.\n\n## 4.5.3.2. Indicators\n\nThe indicators chosen are those used in the management of the  Company's  sites.  They  reflect  the  results  of  the  Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy.\n\nActivity: the activity of L'Or\u00e9al sites is measured on the basis of units  produced  for  industrial  sites  and  hours  worked  for administrative sites and research centres.\n\nThe  production  units  included  are  the  equivalent  units produced on site or affected by occasional subcontracting.\n\nHours worked are the hours performed on site, thus excluding telecommuting hours.\n\nGreenhouse gases: The Group's CO2 emissions are calculated in  accordance  with  the  concepts  defined  by  the  GHG protocol, and monitored according to the Market-Based CO2 indicator.\n\nWith  the  desire  for  comparability,  the  data  on  CO2  emissions for the 2005 baseline provided have been updated in light of these  rules  (recalculated  on  the  basis  of  a  constant  scope). The  calculation  of  the  2005  baseline  is  based  on  the  2003 emission  factors  of  local  electricity  suppliers  -  when  they  are available.  When  the  emission  factors  are  not  available,  IEA (International  Energy  Agency)  and  eGRID  emission  factors (1) , available  in  2006,  corresponding  to  IEA  factors  for  2003  and EPA (2) (eGRID) factors for 2000, are used. For the estimates for the following years, the emission factor used follows the GHG Protocol rules: in general, the factor provided by the supplier, which  is  the  most  accurate;  if  it  is  not  known,  the  regional emission  factor  is  used  or  failing  this,  the  IEA  emissions  factor (the 2018 IEA edition with the 2016 emission factor for emissions since 2019).\n\nRemarks  concerning  the  level  of  uncertainty  depending  on the Scopes in question:\n\nScopes 1 and 2: The level of uncertainty at the Group level is approximately 1% for  plants  and  distribution  centres,  and  5% for administrative sites and research centres.\n\nScope 3: The highest level of uncertainty in a greenhouse gas assessment concerns the Scope 3 estimate given the number and nature of the data necessary for calculating it (emission factors for the energy used to heat the water necessary for the usage phase of our rinse-off  products  all  over  the  world,  the quantity  of  water  necessary  for  rinsing,  CO2  emissions  of  our raw materials and packaging suppliers, distances travelled for transportation, etc.).\n\nBecause  measurement  of  the  global  CO2  impact  of  the Group's business activities is essential information in light of the commitments made to fight climate change, efforts are made year  after  year  to  increase  the  reliability  of  these  data.  The level  of  uncertainty  of  the  Group's  Scope  3  emissions  is estimated to be between 20% and 30%.\n\n4",

This  margin  of  uncertainty  with  regard  to Scope 3 is a reality  for  all  companies,  and  does  not  make  it possible to consider this data as an adequate benchmark or method of performance assessment.\n\nEffluents: For  industrial  sites,  the  Chemical  Oxygen  Demand (COD)  covers  the  volumes  of  effluents  leaving  the  site, whether or not they have been treated on the site.\n\nBiodiversity: Biodiversity  inventories  that  describe  the  actual situation of the sites in terms of species and habitats present in the  zone  studied  must  be  carried  out  by  a  certified organisation  at  least  every  three  or  five  years  with  specific interim follow-ups.\n\nWaste: L'Or\u00e9al  includes  everything  in  its  transportable  waste that comes out of a plant or a distribution centre and which is not a finished or semi-finished product (the following examples are  included  for  a  plant:  raw  material  packaging  or packaging  components,  sludge  from  effluent  treatment plants, broken pallets, etc.).\n\nIn order  to  improve  the  system  of  waste  performance monitoring  and  exhaustively  record  the  waste  generated  by the  use  of  returnable  packaging,  a  system  of  recording returnable  packaging  at  source  was  put  in  place  in  2014. L'Or\u00e9al thus records the weight of its returnable packaging at source  in  transportable  waste,  with  each  of  the  sites  being responsible  for  maximising  the  number  of  rotations.  The recording of the weight of returnable packaging at source is a measure  intended  to  encourage  rotation  of  this  returnable packaging and contributes, through its reuse, to increasing its useful life.\n\nSites that no longer send any waste for destruction or to landfill are considered to have attained a 100% recovery rate.\n\nThe  material  recovery  index  corresponds  to  the  quantity  of waste,  reused  or  recycled,  divided  by  the  total  amount  of waste generated, excluding returnable packaging at source, including  the  returnable  packaging  in  rotation,  excluding waste sent to landfill due to regulatory obligations.\n\nThe  recovery  index  corresponds  to  the  quantity  of  waste recovered,  whether  material  or  energy,  divided  by  the  total amount of waste generated excluding returnable packaging at source, including returnable packaging  in  rotation, excluding waste sent to landfill due to regulatory obligations.\n\nTo obtain a more accurate understanding of the recovery and material  recovery  indices,  these  indicators  are  calculated excluding the transport pallets that would otherwise represent a significant share of the returnable packaging in rotation.\n\n## 4.5.3.3. Data\n\nThe collection of data for the defined scope uses the following method:  environmental  data  are  collected  using the dedicated intranet-based site reporting system, available in all countries  where  L'Or\u00e9al  has a  subsidiary.  The  required  data are reported every month by the local managers.\n\nWhen the data are compiled, each site or zone must validate the accuracy of all the data provided.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been  put  in  place.  They  are  reviewed  each  year  by  the Statutory  Auditors  and  modified  taking  into  account  their recommendations  and  monitoring  objectives  for  subsequent years: updating the indicators to be monitored, improving their definition  and  the  communication,  monitoring  and  control process.\n\nIn rare cases,  certain  data  already  published  for  the preceding year may be modified when inaccuracies or errors are discovered after the end of the financial year. These data are monitored and included in the annual consistency review. They are included in the reported figures each year.\n\n## 4.5.4. Human Rights data\n\n## 4.5.4.1. Scope of consolidation\n\nDepending  on  the  indicators,  the  scope  covers  the  L'Or\u00e9al parent company, France or the Group. The scope is specified for  each indicator.  The  subsidiaries  Retail  Excellence  4  and Logocos are excluded from e-learning data.\n\n## 4.5.4.2. Indicators\n\nThe  indicators  chosen  are  those  within  the  scope  of  the applicable  regulations,  with  in  particular  the  aim  of  data comparability.\n\n## 4.5.4.3. Data\n\nThe following methods are used to collect data for the defined scope:\n\n- \u00b7 the  data  relating  to  Ethics  and  Human  Rights  for  L'Or\u00e9al subsidiaries  is  collected  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Ethics Officer  using  the  Annual  Ethics  Reporting  platform.  The scope  is  aligned  with  individual  company  data  unless otherwise indicated for each indicator in the report;\n- \u00b7 Human  Rights  data  for  the  employees  of  the  Group's suppliers  are  consolidated  by  the  Purchasing  Department and collected during social audits by an independent and accredited third party that carries out the audits and shares the data collected as well as the audit reports; and\n- \u00b7 the other data  are  collected from the corporate departments  concerned  (Corporate  Social  Responsibility Department, Worldwide Safety Evaluation, Risk Management  and  Compliance  Department  and  the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation).\n\n## 4.5.5. Innovating sustainably data\n\n## 4.5.5.1. Scope of consolidation\n\nThe  calculation  is  performed  using  a  scope  restricted  to products  created  or  renovated  by  L'Or\u00e9al's  design  centres and produced by the Group's plants or by subcontractors. The products of brands for which the quantity of data available is sufficient, i.e. those that were acquired/created before 2013, are taken into account.",

Indicators\n\nRegarding  the  'Percentage  of  products  analysed  with  an improved social or environmental profile (as a %)' indicator: a created or renovated product is included in the indicator if its profile has been improved according to the SPOT methodology. This methodology ensures that the performance of  each driver is  aggregated using the planetary boundaries method for the environmental component, and L'Or\u00e9al's own methodology  for  the  social  component  to  ensure  overall improvement  in  the  environmental  and  social  profile.  The indicator  includes  products  for  which  only  the  formula  is deteriorated but recognised as natural.\n\nWith regards to the indicator 'Percentage of new or updated products with an improved environmental profile due to a new\n\nformula with a reduced  environmental  footprint': the improvement  is  assessed  by  calculating  its  environmental footprint using the SPOT methodology only using the scope of the  new  formula  compared  to  the  average  rating  of  the product  family  in  question  or  to  the  previous  formula  in  the case of an updated formula, for an equivalent use. It concerns products with a created or renovated formula, but also new products with an existing formula in new packaging.\n\nWith regards to the indicator 'Percentage of new or updated products  with  an  improved  environmental  profile  thanks  to new packaging with a reduced environmental footprint': the improvement  is  assessed  by  calculating  the  environmental footprint using the SPOT methodology only over the scope of the  new  packaging  compared to the average rating of the product family in question or to the previous packaging in the case  of  updated  packaging,  for  an  equivalent  use.  It  only concerns products for which the packaging has been created or renovated.\n\nConcerning  the  'Percentage  of  created  or  renovated products with  an  improved  social  profile  thanks  to  a  positive social  impact'  indicator:  the  indicator  corresponds  to  the percentage  of  created  or  renovated  products  including  in particular raw materials and packaging items obtained under the  Solidarity  Sourcing  programme.  It  also  includes  products providing information to consumers about product performance, best practices in terms of sustainable development  or  those  whose  accessibility  and  use  by  older people or people with disabilities is favoured.\n\n4",

In  addition,  we  have  implemented  a  system  of  quality  control  including documented policies  and  procedures  regarding  compliance  with  the  ethical  requirements,  French  professional  standards  and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Responsibility of the statutory auditor appointed as independent third party\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- \u00b7 the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 the fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks, hereinafter the 'Information.'\n\nHowever,  it  is  not  our  responsibility  to  provide  any  conclusion  on  the  company's  compliance  with  other  applicable  legal  and regulatory  provisions,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  duty  of  vigilance,  anti-corruption  and  taxation  nor  on  the  compliance  of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe performed our work in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code defining the conditions under which  the  independent  third  party  performs  its  engagement  and  the  professional  guidance  issued  by  the  French  Institute  of Statutory  Auditors  ( Compagnie  nationale  des  commissaires  aux  comptes )  relating  to  this  engagement  and  with  ISAE  3000 ( Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information) .\n\nWe  conducted  procedures  in  order  to  assess  the  Statement's  compliance  with  regulatory  provisions,  and  the  fairness  of  the Information:\n\n- \u00b7 we familiarized ourselves with the Group's business activity and the description of the principal risks associated.\n- \u00b7 we assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector.\n\n4",

L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY Statutory auditor's reports\n\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement covers each category of information stipulated in section III of Article L. 225-102-1 governing social and environmental affairs, as well as in the second paragraph of Article L. 22-10-36 regarding the respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion.\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement provides the information required under article R. 225-105 II of the French Commercial Code, where  relevant  with  respect  to  the  principal  risks,  and  includes,  where  applicable,  an  explanation  for  the  absence  of  the information required under article L. 225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of principal risks associated with all the entity's activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with its business relationships, its products or services, as well as its policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks.\n- \u00b7 we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- \u00b7 assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and\n- \u00b7 corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important and which are presented in annex 1 ; concerning certain risks (corruption, human rights), our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the others risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities.\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all companies within the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16, with the limits specified in the Statement.\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information.\n- \u00b7 We carried out, for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes and which are presented in annex 1 that in our judgment were of most significance:\n- \u00b7 analytical  procedures  that  consisted  in  verifying  the  correct  consolidation  of  collected  data  as  well  as  the  consistency  of changes thereto;\n- \u00b7 substantive  tests,  on  a  sampling  basis,  that  consisted  in  verifying  the  proper  application  of  definitions  and  procedures  and reconciling data with supporting documents. These procedures were conducted for a selection of contributing entities which are presented in annex 2 and covered between 20% and 26% of the consolidated data for the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of the company.\n\nWe believe that the procedures we have performed, based on our professional judgment, are sufficient to provide a basis for a limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work engaged the skills of eight people between September 2020 and February 2021 .\n\nTo  assist  us  in  conducting  our  work,  we  referred  to  our  corporate  social  responsibility  and  sustainable  development  experts. We conducted around twenty interviews with people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our work, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the non financial statement does not comply with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, 17 February 2021 One of the statutory auditors,\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Moulin PartnerSustainable\n\nJulien Rivals Development Partner",

The  financial  statements  will  not  become  final  until  they have  been  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of shareholders to be held on 20 April 2021.\n\nThe Group did not anticipate any standards or interpretations not mandatorily applicable in 2020.\n\n## Closing context - Covid-19\n\nThe year 2020 saw lockdown measures in several countries in which  L'Or\u00e9al  operates.  Against  this  backdrop,  business slowed and the Group introduced very strict measures in terms of  operational  budget  discipline,  with  a  freeze  on  the worldwide  headcount, a  freeze  on  travel,  a  reduction  in non-essential  spending,  and  a  thorough  review  of  business drivers and investments.\n\nWith the spread of the Covid-19 virus, one of L'Or\u00e9al's absolute priorities  was  to  offer  the  Group's  aid  and  support  wherever possible. Thus, across the globe, L'Or\u00e9al chose to help its small professional customers and perfumeries by deferring  payment of  accounts  receivable  in  view  of  their  cash  flow  difficulties, until  their  business  activity  resumes.  Most  of  the  credit  risk  is covered by insurance policies. Among other measures, for the most exposed suppliers, L'Or\u00e9al shortened payment terms.\n\nHealth measures were also put in place. Due to their entirely exceptional nature during the first  half  of  the  year,  the  costs incurred  by  these  measures  have  been  classified  as Other operating income and expenses. L'Or\u00e9al also included in this category costs incurred during the first half of the year by the total suspension of activity related to the lockdowns imposed by  local  authorities.  This  covered  very  specific  time  periods. These  non-recurring  costs  correspond  to  the  exceptional financial  impact  borne  by  the  Group  over  clearly  defined lockdown periods (see note 4). These two types of costs in no way represent the total  effect  of  the  significant  slowdown  in Group activity due to the Covid-19 impact.\n\nIn  addition,  during  the  first  half  of  the  year,  the  Group  secured a  syndicated  loan  for  \u20ac3.6  billion  euros,  half  of  which  was cancelled during the second half of 2020. At 31 December 2020, this loan remained unused.\n\n## Amendments and interpretations applied in 2020: IFRS 16 'Leases'\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group completed its analysis of the IFRS Interpretation Committee (IC) decision dated 26  November  2019.  This  decision  relates  to  the  duration  of certain leases (indefinite term or short initial  contractual term which  is automatically  renewable)  as  well  as  to  the depreciation period for fixtures and  fittings that are inseparable from the leased asset. This decision does not have a significant impact at the Group level.\n\nThe Group applied the amendment to IFRS 16, adopted by the European  Union  on  12  October  2020,  relating  to  Covid-19related rent relief reducing lease payments due on or before 30 June 2021. The amendment allows changes in terms of rent relief  to  be  recognized  immediately  in  income  rather  than spread over the term of the contract.\n\nThe impact is not material at the Group level.\n\n5",

We calculate it using the zero interest rate coupons received per currency  and  per  maturity  tranche,  plus  the  Group  credit spread.\n\n\u20ac millions\n\n\u20ac millions\n\n| ASSETS                                                 |       | EQUITY & LIABILITIES      | EQUITY & LIABILITIES   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                        |       | Equity                    | -82                    |\n| Other intangible assets/ property, plant and equipment | -92   | Deferred tax liabilities  | -10                    |\n| Right-of-use assets                                    | 2,005 | Non-current lease debt    | 1,751                  |\n| Deferred tax assets                                    | 19    | Other current liabilities | -129                   |\n| Other current assets                                   | 2     | Current lease debt        | 404                    |\n| TOTAL                                                  | 1,934 | TOTAL                     | 1,934                  |\n\n## Change in accounting policy applied at 1 January 2019: Application of IFRIC 23\n\nThe application since 1 January 2019 of IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments' has led to the reclassification of uncertain tax provisions as Non-current tax liabilities.\n\n## Change in accounting policy applied at 1 January 2018: IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'\n\nThis standard took effect on 1 January 2018.\n\nThe main change identified concerns the Group's relationships with distributors with respect to which the view was taken that the distributor acted as agent and not as principal. Net sales are  now  recognised  upon  sale  of  products  to  the  end customer.\n\nThe  standard  is  applied  retrospectively  by  recognising  the cumulative  effect  of  the  initial  application  in  equity  on 1  January  2018.  The  impact  of  this  new  accounting  policy  is not material on the income statement, and in 2018 resulted in a \u20ac28.2 million increase in net sales, offset by a corresponding increase in expenses.\n\nThis  change  resulted  in  a  \u20ac12.9  million  reduction  in  equity, offset  by a  \u20ac5.2  million  increase  in  inventories, a  \u20ac1.7  million increase in deferred assets and \u20ac19.8 million in other liabilities.\n\n## 1.1. Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with international accounting standards requires that  the  Group  make  a  certain  number  of  estimates  and assumptions that may affect the value of the Group's assets, liabilities, equity and net profit (loss).\n\nThese estimates and  assumptions  mainly  concern  the measurement  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets, operating  lease  terms,  provisions,  non-current  tax  liabilities, pension obligations, deferred taxes and share-based payments.  Estimates  used  by  the  Group  in  relation  to  these different  areas  are  made  based  on  information  available when the accounts are prepared and are described in detail in each specific associated note.\n\n## 1.2. Scope and methods of consolidation\n\nAll companies included in the scope of consolidation have a financial year ending 31 December or close their accounts on that date.\n\nAll  companies  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  the  parent company L'Or\u00e9al have been fully consolidated.\n\nGroup  companies  that  are  jointly  controlled  with  a  limited number of other shareholders under a contractual agreement are  consolidated  under  the  equity  method  in  accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nAssociates  over  which  the  Group  has  a  significant  influence have been accounted for by the equity method.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  selected  the  simplified  retrospective  approach,  and has  measured  the  right  of  use  of  almost  all  its  leases  by determining their book value from the lease start date.\n\n- \u00b7 95% of the capitalised leases are property leases, including country head offices, stores and distribution centres. Other types  of  leases  involve  vehicle  fleets,  traditional  handling equipment and packaging tools and equipment.\n- \u00b7 Low  value  leases  and  leases  that  ended  in  2019  are  not included in the scope.\n- \u00b7 On initial recognition, deferred tax is recognised.\n- \u00b7 The restated balance sheet at 1 January 2019 is as follows:",

        "page_content": "## 1.3. Translation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at closing exchange  rates. Income  statement  items are translated at average exchange rates for the year.\n\nThe resulting translation difference attributable to the Group is entered  directly  under  equity  under  the  item  Cumulative translation adjustments, while the translation difference attributable to non-controlling interests is recognised under the Non-controlling interests item.\n\n## NOTE 2. Main events of the period\n\n## 2.1. Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\n## 2.1.1. Year 2020\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn  31  March  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  finalised  the  acquisition  of  the Mugler  and  Azzaro  brands  and  perfumes  belonging  to  the Clarins  group  for  a  cash  amount  of  \u20ac1.3  billion,  net  of  cash acquired.\n\nThis acquisition has been fully consolidated since that date.\n\nOn  18  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  announced  the  acquisition  of  US skincare  brand  Thayers  Natural  Remedies.  The  brand  will  be integrated into L'Or\u00e9al's Consumer Products Division.\n\nThe  distribution  strategy,  initially  focused  on a   network  of natural  products  stores,  has  evolved  into  a  multi-channel approach that today includes mass-market retailers, specialised retailers, drug stores and online distribution. In 2019, Thayers generated sales of US$44 million. The acquisition was completed on 31 July  2020  and  has  been  fully  consolidated since that date.\n\nThe cost of these new acquisitions represented \u20ac1.7 billion. The total amount of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from  these  acquisitions  provisionally  amounted  at  their acquisition dates to \u20ac1,464.1 million for Azzaro and Mugler and \u20ac303.4 million for Thayers.\n\nIn 2020, these acquisitions represented \u20ac275.7 million in full-year net sales and \u20ac34.9 million in full-year operating profit.\n\n## Sale\n\nOn 4 February 2020, after some strategic thinking to ensure the best  possible  development  for  the  Roger  &  Gallet  brand, L'Or\u00e9al announced it had entered into exclusive negotiations with the French investment holding company Impala to sell this brand.\n\nFounded  in  Paris  in  1862,  Roger  &  Gallet  emerged  from  the world of Apothecary Perfumery inspired by the French art de vivre.  Part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  since  2008  following  the  acquisition  of Yves  Saint  Laurent  Beaut\u00e9,  Roger  &  Gallet  offers  a  rich catalogue of fragrances in a range of perfumes, toiletries and skincare. In 2018, the brand generated sales of \u20ac52 million.\n\nOn  29  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  French  investment  holding company Impala announced that they had finalised the sale of the Roger & Gallet brand.\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1.4. Valuation of goodwill in foreign currencies\n\nGoodwill  generated  on  foreign  companies  is  considered  to form part of the assets and liabilities of the foreign company, and is  therefore  expressed  in  the  entity's  functional  currency and translated  using  the  closing  exchange  rates  in  effect  at the  closing  date.  Goodwill  recorded  before  1  January  2004 continues to be recorded in euros.\n\n## 2.1.2. Year 2019\n\n## Acquisition\n\nL'Or\u00e9al did not make any significant acquisitions in 2019.\n\n## 2.1.3. Year 2018\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn 16 March 2018, L'Or\u00e9al announced the acquisition of 100% of ModiFace, a Canadian-based global leader in augmented reality  and  artificial  intelligence  applied  to  beauty.  This acquisition  is  part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Group's  digital  acceleration strategy, one  of  the  pillars of which  is to equip  its 35  international  brands  with  the  most  innovative  beauty experience  and  service  technologies.  Founded  by  Parham Aarabi  in  Toronto  in  2007,  ModiFace  has  developed  cutting edge technology for the 3D virtual try-on of makeup, colouring and assessment of skin by using proprietary face tracking and colour  rendering  expertise.  ModiFace  employs  close  to 70  engineers,  researchers  and  scientists  who  have  published over  200  scientific  articles  and  registered  some  30  patents. This acquisition has been fully consolidated since 15 March 2018.\n\nOn 2  May  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  announced  the  acquisition  of  100% of  Nanda Co. Ltd.,  the  Korean  lifestyle,  makeup  and  fashion company founded by Kim So-Hee in Seoul in 2004. Stylenanda, which  started  in  the  fashion  segment,  has  since  become  a company  built  around  the  3CE  makeup  brand,  which  now accounts for over 70% of its business. With \u20ac127 million in net sales in 2017 and close to 400 employees, the Company now operates  in  Korea  and  Japan,  and  has  expanded  its commercial footprint to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.  Stylenanda  is  a  very  popular  brand  with  millennials both  in  Korea  and  China.  It  is  sold  using  a  multi-channel distribution model that includes e-commerce, beauty retailers, department  stores  and  duty  free  shops.  The  acquisition  was completed  on  20  June  2018  following  regulatory  clearance and has since been fully consolidated.\n\nOn  25  May  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  completed  the  acquisition  of  Pulp Riot, the professional hair colour brand launched by David and Alexis  Thurston  in  the  United  States  in  June  2016.  Since  its launch, Pulp Riot has transformed the professional market by creating avant-garde content, and by using social media to inspire  and educate stylists worldwide. Pulp Riot currently has over  675,000  followers  on  Instagram.  With  net  sales  of US$11 million in 2017, Pulp Riot is distributed in the United States, primarily by SalonCentric. The brand has also started its global roll-out.  This  acquisition  has  been  fully  consolidated  since  25 May 2018.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nOn  1  August  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  announced  the  signing  of  an agreement  to  acquire  the  German  company  Logocos Naturkosmetik AG, a pioneer in natural cosmetics with brands such  as  Logona  and  Sante.  All  this  company's  brands  are vegan and certified organic with a product range made from plant  extracts  and  natural  ingredients  derived  from  organic farming. Founded  in  1978  by  a  naturopath,  Logocos Naturkosmetik is based in Hanover, Germany, and has close to 340  employees.  In  2017,  it  had  net  sales  of  \u20ac59  million generated  in  Germany  and  other  European  countries.  The acquisition  was  completed  on  17  October  2018  following regulatory clearance and has since been fully consolidated.\n\nOn 1 August 2018, L'Or\u00e9al made a firm offer to Holding STRP (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Thermes de La Roche-Posay) shareholders to buy out all of the shares in the company. The plan provides for the prior  sale  of  the  hotel  business  to  the  current  shareholders  of Holding  STRP  and  exclusive  negotiation  rights  for  L'Or\u00e9al. Founded  in  1921,  STRP  is  the  first  thermal  centre  in  Europe exclusively  dedicated  to  the  treatment  of  skin  conditions. In 2017, the thermal business saw over 7,500 patients per year, generating  net  sales  of  \u20ac3.6  million.  The  acquisition  was completed  on  13  December  2018  following  regulatory clearance and has since been fully consolidated.\n\nThe cost of these new acquisitions represented \u20ac805.1 million. The  total  amount  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets resulting from the acquisitions amounted to \u20ac601.8 million and \u20ac160.4 million, respectively.\n\nIn 2018, these acquisitions represented \u20ac219.9 million in full-year net sales and \u20ac39.9 million in full-year operating profit.\n\n## 2.2. Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation in the cash flow statement\n\nFor  2020,  these  changes  mainly  related  to  the  Azzaro-Mugler and Thayers Natural Remedies acquisitions.\n\nThe impact of acquisitions is not material for 2019.\n\nIn 2018, they mainly related to the acquisitions of Stylenanda, Pulp  Riot,  ModiFace,  Logocos  and  the  La  Roche-Posay thermal centre.\n\n## 2.3. Situation in Argentina\n\nArgentina has been considered a hyperinflationary economy since  1  July  2018  and  L'Or\u00e9al  has  applied  the  provisions  of IAS  29  'Financial  Reporting  in  Hyperinflationary  Economies' from that date.\n\nUnder  IAS  29,  the  non-monetary  items  in  the  balance  sheet and income statement have been adjusted using a general price  index,  such  that  they  are  stated  in  terms  of  the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period, and translated at the closing exchange rate. Argentina accounts for less than 1% of the Group's net sales.",

Operating items - Segment information\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Net sales\n\nNet  sales  are  recognised  when  the  goods  have  been transferred to the customer.\n\nSales  incentives,  cash  discounts  and  product  returns  are deducted  from  net  sales,  as  are  incentives  granted  to distributors or consumers resulting in a cash outflow, such as commercial  cooperation,  coupons,  discounts  and  loyalty programmes.\n\nIncentives  granted  to  distributors  and  consumers  are recorded as a deduction from net sales when the following two conditions are met at the same time: the service is not separable from the sale of the product and it is not possible to  reasonably  estimate  the  fair  value  of  the  cost  of  the service.\n\nSales  incentives,  cash  discounts,  provisions  for  returns  and incentives granted to customers are recorded simultaneously to the recognition of the sales if they can be estimated in a reasonably reliable manner, based mainly on statistics  compiled  from  past  experience  and  contractual conditions.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThe  cost  of  goods  sold  consists  mainly  of  the  industrial production  cost  of  products  sold,  the  cost  of  distributing products to customers including freight and delivery costs, either directly or indirectly through  depots,  inventory impairment costs, and royalties paid to third parties.\n\n## Research and innovation expenses\n\nExpenditure  during  the  research  phase  is  charged  to  the income  statement  for  the  financial  year  during  which  it  is incurred.\n\nExpenses incurred during the innovation phase  are recognised as Intangible assets only  if  they  meet  all  of  the following criteria set out in IAS 38:\n\n- \u00b7 the  project  is  clearly  defined  and  the  related  costs  are separately identified and reliably measured;\n- \u00b7 the technical  feasibility of the project has  been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the intention and ability to complete the project and to use  or  sell  the  products  resulting  from  the  project  have been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the resources necessary to complete the project and to use or sell it are available;\n- \u00b7 the  Group  can  demonstrate  that  the  project  will generate  probable  future  economic  benefits,  as  the existence  of  a  potential  market  for  the  production resulting  from  the  project,  or  its  internal  usefulness  has been demonstrated.\n\nIn view of the very large number of innovation projects and uncertainties  concerning  the  decision  to  launch  products relating  to  these  projects,  L'Or\u00e9al  considers  that  some  of these capitalisation criteria are not met.\n\n## Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nThese  expenses  consist  mainly  of  expenses  relating  to  the advertisement and promotion of products to customers and consumers. They are charged to the income statement for the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nThese expenses relate mainly to sales teams and sales team management, marketing teams and administrative services, as  well  as  general  expenses  and  the  costs  and  expenses of free shares.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating  profit  consists  of  gross  profit  less  research  and innovation  expenses,  advertising  and  promotion  expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  on  the balance  sheet  at  their  purchase  price.  They  are  not remeasured.\n\nAssets financed by lease contracts are recognised as assets on  the  balance  sheet  under Right-of-use  assets . The corresponding debt is recognised as a liability under Lease debt .\n\nInvestment subsidies are recorded as liabilities under Other current liabilities .\n\nThe  components  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are recorded  separately  if  their  estimated  useful  lives,  and therefore their depreciation periods, are materially different.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  using  the straight-line method, over the following useful lives:\n\n| Buildings                                       | 10-40 years   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Industrial machinery and equipment              | 5-15 years    |\n| Point-of-sales advertising: stands and displays | 3 years       |\n| Other property, plant and equipment             | 3-10 years    |\n\nDepreciation  and  impairment  losses  are  recorded  in  the income statement according to the use of the asset.\n\nIn  view of their nature, property, plant and equipment are considered to have a value of zero at the end of the useful lives indicated above.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method.\n\nA  provision is made  for  obsolete  and  slow-moving inventories  on  the  basis  of  their  probable  net  realisable value,  estimated  on  the  basis  of  historic  and  projected data.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## 5.4. Post-employment benefits, termination benefits and other long-term employee benefits\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  Group  operates  pension,  early  retirement  and  other employee benefit schemes depending on local legislation and regulations.\n\nFor obligatory state schemes and other defined-contribution schemes,  the  Group  recognises  in  the  income  statement contributions payable when they are due. No provision has been set aside in this respect as the Group's obligation does not exceed the amount of contributions paid.\n\nThe characteristics of the defined benefit schemes in force within the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 French  regulations  provide  for  specific  length-of-service awards  payable  to  employees  on  retirement.  An  early retirement  plan  and  a  defined  benefit  plan  have  also been set  up.  In  some  Group  companies  there  are  also measures providing for the payment of certain healthcare costs for retired employees. These obligations are  partially  funded  by  an  external  fund,  except  those relating to healthcare costs for retired employees;\n- \u00b7 for foreign subsidiaries with employee retirement schemes or other specific obligations relating to defined benefit  plans,  the  excess  of  the  projected  benefit obligation over the scheme's assets is also recognised by setting  up a  provision  for  charges  on  the  basis  of  the actuarial value of employees' vested rights.\n\nThe charges recorded in the income statement during the year include:\n\n- \u00b7 additional  rights vested  by  employees  during  the accounting period;\n- \u00b7 the  impact  of  any  change  to  existing  schemes  on previous years or of any new schemes;\n- \u00b7 the change in the value of the discounted rights over the past year;\n- \u00b7 income on external funds calculated on the basis of the discount rate applied to the benefit obligation.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used to calculate these obligations take into account the economic conditions specific to each country or Group company. The main weighted average assumptions for the Group are as follows:\n\n| In %                          | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2019   | 31.12.2018   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Discount rate (commitment)    | 1.1%         | 1.6%         | 2.6%         |\n| Discount rate (service cost)* | 1.4%         | 1.9%         | 2.9%         |\n| Salary increases              | 3.4%         | 3.5%         | 3.6%         |\n\n|                                        | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020                | 31.12.2019   | 31.12.2019   | 31.12.2019                | 31.12.2018   | 31.12.2018   | 31.12.2018                |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n|                                        | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application of final rate | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application of final rate | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application of final rate |\n| Expected rate of health care inflation | 5.3%         | 4.2%         | 2027                      | 5.7%         | 4.2%         | 2027                      | 5.7%         | 4.2%         | 2023                      |\n\nThe discount rates are obtained by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds having maturity dates equivalent to those of the obligations.\n\nBond quality is assessed by reference to the AA-/Aa3 minimum rating provided by one of the three main credit-rating agencies.\n\nThe latter two items represent the interest component of the pension  costs.  The  interest  component  is  shown  within  Net financial  income  on  the  Other  financial  income  and expenses item.\n\nTo  determine  the  discounted  value  of  the  obligation  for each  scheme,  the  Group  applies  an  actuarial  valuation method  based  on  the  final  salary  (projected  unit  credit method). The obligations and the fair value of plan assets are assessed each  year  using  length-of-service, life expectancy,  staff  turnover  by  category  and  economic assumptions (such as inflation rate and discount rate).\n\nThe  Group  applies  a  simplified  granular  approach  to calculate its service cost for the period. Under this simplified approach,  two  different  discount  rates  are  used  to calculate the obligation and the service cost based on the duration of the future cash flows relating to each of these items.  Financial  costs  are  calculated  by  applying  the discount rate used for the obligation to plan assets and by applying the differential interest rate to service cost for the period.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arising  on  post-employment defined benefit obligations are recognised in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses in relation to other benefits such as jubilee awards and long-serve bonuses are immediately charged to the income statement.\n\nThe  liability  corresponding  to  the  Company's  net  defined benefit obligation regarding its employees is recorded in the balance  sheet  on  the  Provisions  for  employee  retirement obligations and related benefits line.\n\n5",

Share subscription or purchase options - Free shares - Employee shareholding plan\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment',  the  value  of  options  or  free  shares  granted  as calculated  at  the  grant  date  is  expensed  in  the  income statement  over  the  vesting  period,  which  is  generally  five years for purchase options and four years for free shares.\n\nThe fair value of free shares corresponds to the value of the share at the grant date, less dividends expected to be paid\n\nduring the vesting period. The cost of the additional 2-year holding period applicable to French residents, for plans prior to 1 January 2016, is determined based on the interest rate granted to the employee, considered equivalent to the rate which would be granted by a bank to a private individual customer with an average financial profile.\n\nThe impact of IFRS 2 on profit for the period is booked on the Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  item  of  the income statement at Group level, and is not allocated to the Divisions or geographic zones.\n\n## a) Share subscription or purchase options\n\nThe table below sets out data concerning the option plan in force at 31 December 2020.\n\n|            |                   |                                     | Exercise period   | Exercise period   |                |\n|------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Grant date | Number of options | Number of options not yet exercised | from              | to                | Exercise price |\n| 22.04.2011 | 1,470,000         | 57,397                              | 23.04.2016        | 22.04.2021        | \u20ac83.19         |\n\nThis plan has a five-year exercise period and had performance-related conditions for members of the Management Committee.

In  order  to mitigate the effects of atypical phenomena, the volatility used corresponds to the average between implied volatility at the\n\ngrant date and historic volatility over the expected life span of the option. The expected life span has been adjusted to take account of behavioural assumptions relating to the beneficiaries.\n\n5",

The  shares  will  be  allocated  to employees on 3 November 2025 provided they are still with the Group on that date.\n\nThe  IFRS 2   expense  measuring  the  benefit  offered  to employees is calculated with reference to the fair value of the discount offered on the non-transferable shares.\n\nThe  capital  was  increased  on  3  November  2020  by  452,967 shares.\n\nThe IFRS 2 expense for free shares granted amounted to:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac7.8  million  for  French  employees  based  on  a  subscription price of \u20ac223.25 per share; and\n- \u00b7 \u20ac0.6  million  for  employees  outside  France.  This  cost  is amortised over the vesting period and corresponds to the share reference value adjusted for the expected dividends over the vesting period, namely \u20ac254.84 per share.\n\nIn June 2018, Group employees had the opportunity to join a Shareholding Plan based on a traditional format with discount and matching contribution.\n\nThe subscription price was set at \u20ac162.52, representing 80% of the  average share price over the 20 trading sessions  prior  to the  decision  by  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer setting  the  subscription  period  from  4  June  to  18  June  2018 during  which  423,916  shares  were  subscribed.  This  number does not include the subscription reserved for a Trustee under the laws of England and Wales, as part of a Share Incentive Plan established for Group employees in the UK, with the final number  of  shares  subscribed  determined  at  4,514  in November 2018.\n\nThe  IFRS  2  expense  for  free  shares  recognised  for  the  2020 financial  year  amounted  to  \u20ac1.3  million  and  corresponds  to the cost relating to employees outside France.\n\n5",

Income tax\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  income  tax  charge  includes  the  current  tax  expense payable by each consolidated tax entity and the deferred tax expense. Deferred tax is calculated whenever there are temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and  their  basis  for  consolidated  accounting purposes, using the balance sheet liability method.\n\nThe  restatement  of  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  lease contracts results in the booking of deferred tax.\n\nDeferred  tax  includes  irrecoverable  taxation  on  estimated or confirmed dividends.\n\nDeferred tax is measured using the tax rate enacted at the closing date and which will also apply when the temporary differences reverse.\n\n## 6.1. Detailed breakdown of income tax\n\n| \u20ac millions   | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Current tax  | 1,219.9 | 1,699.7 | 1,241.3 |\n| Deferred tax | -10.1   | -42.5   | 43.0    |\n| INCOME TAX   | 1,209.8 | 1,657.2 | 1,284.3 |\n\n## 6.2. Analysis of tax charge\n\nThe income tax charge may be analysed as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                 | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Profit before tax and associates           | 4,776.5 | 5,411.4 | 5,183.7 |\n| Theoretical tax rate                       | 26.37%  | 26.21%  | 26.25%  |\n| Expected tax charge                        | 1,259.7 | 1,418.1 | 1,360.6 |\n| Impact of permanent differences            | 31.4    | 64.4    | 28.8    |\n| Impact of tax rate differences             | -129.9  | -161.6  | -148.3  |\n| Change in unrecognised deferred taxes      | 1.7     | 2.3     | -3.2    |\n| Impact of non-current tax liabilities  (2) | 108.2   | 346.7   | 51.2    |\n| Other  (1)                                 | -61.3   | -12.7   | -4.8    |\n| GROUP TAX CHARGE                           | 1,209.8 | 1,657.2 | 1,284.3 |\n\nThe expected tax charge reflects the sum of pre-tax profit for each  country,  multiplied  by  the  normal  taxation  rate.  The theoretical tax rate reflects the total expected tax charge as a\n\npercentage of pre-tax profit. The impact of any reduced tax rates existing in certain countries in addition to the normal tax rates is included on the line Impact of tax rate differences.\n\nDeferred tax assets generated by tax loss carryforwards are only recognised to the extent it is probable that the entities will  be  able  to  generate  taxable  profit  against  which  they can be utilised.\n\nUnder the French system of tax  consolidation,  the  taxable profits of some  French  companies  are  offset  when determining  the  overall  tax  charge,  which  is  payable  only by  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  parent  company  of  the  tax  Group.  Tax consolidation systems also exist outside France.\n\nUncertain tax positions  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet under  'Non-current  tax  liabilities'.  These  correspond  to  an estimate of tax risks and litigation related to income tax for the various countries in which the Group operates.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 7.2. Other intangible assets\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nIntangible  assets  are  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  at cost. Intangible assets identified following an acquisition as well  as  internally  generated  intangible  assets  are  also included in this item.\n\n## a) Intangible assets acquired through business combinations\n\nThey  mainly  consist  of  brands,  customer  relationships  and formulas and patents.\n\nWith  regard  to  brands,  the  use  of  the  'discounted  cash flow' method is preferred to enable the value in use to be monitored  more  easily  following  the  acquisition.  Two approaches have been adopted to date:\n\n- \u00b7 premium-based approach: this method involves estimating the portion of future cash flows that could be generated by the brand, compared with the future cash flows that the activity could generate without the brand;\n- \u00b7 royalty-based  approach:  this  involves  estimating  the value of the brand by referencing the levels of royalties demanded for  the  use  of  similar  brands.  It  is  based  on sales forecasts drawn up by the Group.\n\nThese  approaches  are  based  on  a  qualitative  analysis  of the brand in order to ensure that the assumptions selected are  relevant.  The  discount  rate  used  is  based  on  the weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  the  target acquired. Terminal growth  rates are consistent with available market data (generally 2.5% for Europe and 3% for the rest of the world, except in specific cases).\n\nA brand may have a finite or an indefinite useful life span.\n\nLocal  brands  which  are  to  be  gradually  replaced  by  an international brand already existing within the Group have a finite useful life span.\n\nThey  are  amortised  over  their  useful  lives  as  estimated  at the date of acquisition.\n\nInternational brands are brands which have an indefinite life span. They are tested for impairment at least once a year during the fourth quarter, and whenever an adverse event occurs. Adverse events may result among other things from an increase in  market  interest  rates  or  from  a  decrease  in actual  net  sales  or  operational  profit  compared  to forecasts.\n\nThe impairment test consists of calculating the recoverable amount of the brand based on the model adopted when the acquisition took place.\n\nCustomer  relationships  refer  to  relations  developed  with customers  either  through  contractual  arrangements  or  by non-contractual  means  through  constant  revenue  streams resulting from the target's competitive position or reputation in its market.\n\nThe useful life of a customer relationship is limited and varies depending  on  the  estimated  attrition  rate  of  existing customers at the time of the acquisition.\n\nThe Group may decide to identify and value patents and formulas that it intends to develop.\n\nThe value of a patent or a formula is assessed on the basis of  the  future  profits  expected  from  its  ownership  in  the future, in accordance with the royalty-based approach.\n\nThe amortisation period applicable to patents corresponds to  the  period  during  which  they  enjoy  legal  protection. Formulas,  which  are  not  protected  by  legal  means,  are amortised over a maximum period of 5 years.\n\n## b) Internally generated intangible assets\n\nThese mainly consist of software.\n\nInnovation costs of software for internal use are capitalised for the programming, coding and testing phases. The costs of substantial updates and upgrades resulting in additional functions are also capitalised.\n\nCapitalised  innovation  costs  are  amortised  from  the  date the software is made available in the entity concerned and over its probable useful life, which, in most cases, is between 5 and 8 years.",

Impairment tests on intangible assets\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nGoodwill is not amortised. It is tested for impairment at least once  a  year  during  the  fourth  quarter  or  whenever  an adverse  event  occurs.  Adverse  events  may  result  among other things from an increase in market interest rates or from a  decrease  in  actual  net  sales  or  operational  profit compared to forecasts.\n\nImpairment tests consist of comparing the carrying amount of assets including goodwill with the recoverable amount of each  Cash  Generating  Unit.  A  Cash  Generating  Unit corresponds  to  one  or  more  worldwide  brands.  A  Cash Generating Unit can contain several brands depending on organisational  criteria  and  particularly  when  distribution circuits and commercial/management  structures are pooled. Recoverable values are determined on the basis of discounted operating cash flow forecasts covering a period of  10  years  (the  period  considered  necessary  for  the strategic positioning of an acquisition) and a terminal value. The  cash  flows  are  determined  in  the  currencies  of  the\n\ncountries in question and are translated, in the same way as the  net  carrying  amounts  to  which  they  are  compared, at  the  estimated  exchange  rate  for  the  following  year. The discount rate used for these calculations is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),  which amounted to 7.3% in 2020, to 6.8% in 2019 and 6.9% in 2018 for  amounts  in  euro,  adjusted  where  appropriate  by  a country  risk  premium  according  to  the  geographic  zones concerned. The discount rates are post-tax rates applied to post-tax  cash  flows,  and  result  in  recoverable  amounts identical to those obtained by applying pre-tax rates to pretax  cash  flows.  The  assumptions  adopted  in  terms  of  sales growth and terminal values are reasonable and consistent with  the  available  market  data  (generally  2.5%  for  Europe and 3% for the rest of the world for terminal values except in specific cases).\n\nThe  use  of  discounted  cash  flow  forecasts  is  preferred  in order  to  determine  recoverable  amounts,  unless  details  of similar recent transactions are readily available.\n\nImpairment charged against goodwill cannot be reversed.\n\n5",

new consumer  habits  (in  particular  e-commerce)  but  without calling into question the prospects for growth and profitability over  future  years  of  the  business  plans.  No  impairment  of goodwill or other intangible assets was recorded for the 2020 financial year.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, a 1% increase in the discount rate on all the  Group's  Cash  Generating  Units  would  lead  to  an impairment loss risk of around \u20ac58.0 million.\n\nA 1% decrease in the terminal growth rate on all the Group's Cash Generating Units would lead to an impairment loss risk of around \u20ac30.0 million.\n\nThe  terminal  growth  rate  is  consistent  with  market  data, i.e. 2.5% for Europe and 3% for the rest of the world.",

Financial assets and liabilities - Cost of debt\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Finance costs, net\n\nNet  financial  debt  consists  of  all  current  and  non-current financial borrowings  and  debt,  less  cash  and  cash equivalents.\n\nNet finance costs consist of income and expenses arising on the  items  making  up  net  financial  debt  during  the accounting  period,  including  gains  and  losses  on  the corresponding  interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  rate hedges.  As  interest  rate  derivatives  are  fully  effective,  no ineffectiveness impacts finance costs.\n\n## Borrowings and debt\n\nBorrowings  and  debt  are  valued  at  amortised  cost  based on an effective interest rate.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principle  of  fair  value  hedge accounting,  fixed-rate  borrowings  and  debt  swapped  at a floating rate are valued on the balance sheet at market value.  The  resulting  changes  in  value  are  recorded  as finance costs and are offset by changes in the value of the related interest rate swaps.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  debt  is  determined  by  the discounted  cash  flow  method  using  bond  yield  curves  at the closing date, allowing for the spread corresponding to the Group's risk class to be taken into account.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  floating-rate  debt  is  a  reasonable approximation of its fair value.\n\nMedium- and long-term borrowings and debt are recorded under Non-current liabilities. Short-term borrowings and debt as  well  as  the  current  portion  of  medium-  and  long-term borrowings and debt are presented under Current liabilities.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  in  bank accounts,  units  of  cash  unit  trusts  and  liquid  short-term investments with a negligible risk of changes in value and a maturity  date  of  less  than  three  months  at  the  date  of acquisition.\n\nInvestments  in  shares  and  cash,  which  are  held  in  an account  blocked  for  more  than  three  months,  cannot  be recorded  under  cash  and  are  presented  under  Other current assets.\n\nBank overdrafts considered to be financing are presented in Current borrowings and debt.\n\nThe money-market unit trusts are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. As such, they are valued in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value  at  the  closing date.  Any  related  unrealised  gains  are  accounted  for  in Finance costs, Net in the income statement.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  bank  deposits  is  a  reasonable approximation of their fair value.\n\n5",

As  such,  they  are  valued  on  the basis  of  their  fair  value,  and  unrealised  losses  and  gains\n\nare  accounted  for  through  equity  on  the  line  Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe fair value of listed securities is determined on the basis of the  share  price  at  the  closing  date.  For  unlisted  securities, in  the  absence  of  specific  events,  their  acquisition  cost is deemed to be the best possible estimate of fair value.\n\nLong-term  loans  and  receivables  are  considered  to  be assets generated by the business. As such, they are valued at amortised cost. If there is an indication of a loss in value, a provision for impairment is recorded.\n\n## 9.1. Borrowings and debt\n\nThe Group takes out bank loans to cover its medium-term financing needs and issues short-term marketable instruments in France and commercial paper in the US to cover its financing needs in the short term.

Derivatives and exposure to market risks\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nDerivative  instruments  entered  into  to  hedge  identifiable foreign exchange and interest rate risks are accounted for in accordance with hedge accounting principles.\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts and options are put in place  in  order  to  hedge  items  recorded  in  the  balance sheet (fair value hedges) and cash flows on highly probable future commercial transactions (cash flow hedges).\n\nAll foreign exchange hedging instruments are recorded on the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  including  those which relate to purchases and sales in the next accounting period.  Hence  changes in  the  fair  value  of  these  hedging instruments is recorded as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes  in  the  market  value  linked  to  variations  in  the time value of forwards used as hedges are recognised in equity  and the amount accumulated in equity impacts the income statement at the date on which the hedged transactions are completed;\n- \u00b7 changes  in  the  market  value  linked  to  variations  in  the spot rate between the inception of the hedge and the closing  date  are  charged  to  equity,  and  the  amount accumulated  in  equity  impacts  income  statements  at the  date  on  which  the  transactions  hedged  are completed.  Any  remaining  hedge  ineffectiveness  is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nIn accordance with hedge accounting, unrealised exchange gains and losses relating to unsold inventories are deferred  in  the  inventories  item  in  the  balance  sheet. Similarly, if a currency hedge has been taken out in respect of fixed assets purchased with foreign currency, these assets are  valued  in  the  balance  sheet  on  the  basis  of  the hedging rate.\n\nThe  Group  may  decide  to  hedge  certain  investments  in foreign  companies.  Exchange  gains  or  losses  relating  to these hedges are directly charged to consolidated equity, under the item Cumulative translation adjustments.\n\nWith regard to interest rate risk, fixed-rate debt and financial loans  hedged  by  interest  rate  swaps  are  valued  in  the balance  sheet  at  their  market  value.  Changes  in  the  fair value  of  these  items  are  recorded  as  finance  costs  and offset  by  adjustments  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related hedging derivatives. Floating-rate debt and financial loans are valued at cost, which corresponds to their market value. The swaps or caps which hedge these items are valued in the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  with  changes  in value  recorded  directly  through  equity  on  the  Other comprehensive income item.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  interest  rate  derivative  instruments  is  their market  value.  This  market  value  is  calculated  by  the discounted cash flow method at the interest rate effective at the closing date.\n\nTo manage its exposure to currency and interest rate risks arising in the course of its normal operations, the Group uses derivatives negotiated with counterparties rated investment grade.\n\nIn accordance with Group rules, currency and interest rate derivatives are set up exclusively for hedging purposes.\n\n## 10.1. Hedging of currency risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  currency  risk  on  commercial transactions  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  and  on  highly probable future transactions.\n\nThe Group's policy regarding its exposure to currency risk on future commercial transactions is to hedge, before the end of the  year,  a  large  part  of  the  currency  risk  for  the  following year,  using  derivatives  based  on  operating  budgets  in  each subsidiary.\n\nAll  the  Group's  future  foreign  currency  flows  are  analysed in detailed  forecasts  for the coming  budgetary  year. Any currency risks identified are hedged by forward contracts or  options  in  order  to  reduce  as  far  as  possible  the  currency exposure  of  each  subsidiary.  The  term  of  the  derivatives is aligned  with  the  Group's  settlements.  Exchange  rate derivatives are negotiated by FINVAL or, in exceptional cases, directly  by  the  Group's  subsidiaries.  Such  transactions  are supervised by the Group's Treasury department.\n\nAs  a  non-financial  corporation,  FINVAL  is  subject  to  the European  Market  Infrastructure  Regulations  (EMIR).  Published by  the  European  Commission  in  September  2012,  EMIR  is aimed at moving OTC markets towards a centralised model, thereby  enhancing  market  transparency  and  regulatory oversight  and  decreasing  systemic  risk  using  a  guarantee mechanism.  As  the  Group's  companies  must  borrow  and invest their cash in their own currency, the exchange rate risks generated by managing their own cash and debt are almost non-existent.\n\nOwing to the Group's policy of currency risk hedging a large part of annual requirements for the following year before the end  of  the  current  year,  the  sensitivity  of  profit  or  loss  to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  at  31  December  is marginal.  The  impact  of  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates on  the  foreign  exchange  cash  flow  hedges  reserve  is described in note 11.3.\n\n5",

Foreign exchange gains and losses also include the following items relating to derivative instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in market value linked to variations in the spot rate between the inception of the hedge and the date when the hedged transactions are completed;\n- \u00b7 residual  ineffectiveness  linked  to  excess  hedges  and recognised  directly  in  the  income  statement  under  other foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  for  \u20ac13.3  million, -  \u20ac9.2  million  and  -  \u20ac4.3  million  in  2020,  2019  and  2018, respectively.\n\nThese  amounts  are  allocated  to  the  appropriate  operating expense items. They are broken down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                   |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of sales                                |    6.4 | -161.9 |   13.2 |\n| Research and innovation expenses             |   -2.1 |   16.5 |   -6.2 |\n| Advertising and promotion expenses           |    1.2 |  -25.5 |    1.9 |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses |    0.9 |  -19.3 |    1.6 |\n| FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES            |    6.4 | -190.1 |   10.4 |\n\n## 10.3. Hedging of interest rate risk\n\nThe Group did not have any interest rate hedging instruments at 31 December 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## 10.4. Sensitivity to changes in interest rates\n\nAn increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have had a  direct  positive  impact  of  +\u20ac56.4  million  on  the  Group's  net finance costs at 31 December 2020, compared with a direct positive impact of +\u20ac45.3 million at 31 December 2019 and a direct positive impact of +\u20ac28.3 million at 31 December 2018. This calculation  allows  for  cash,  cash  equivalents  and derivatives,  and  assumes  that  total  net  debt/cash  remains stable  and  that  fixed-rate  debt  at  maturity  is  replaced  by floating-rate debt.\n\nThe impact of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates on the fair value  of  the  Group's  fixed-rate  financial  assets  and  liabilities, after  allowing  for  any  interest  rate  derivatives,  can  be estimated  at  -\u20ac1.0  million  at  31  December  2020  compared with  -\u20ac0.9  million  at  31  December  2019  and  -\u20ac0.4  million  at 31 December 2018.\n\n## 10.5. Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group has financial relations with international banks rated investment  grade  by  specialised  agencies.  The  Group  thus considers that its exposure to counterparty risk is low.\n\nFurthermore,  the  financial  instruments  used  to  manage exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  risk  are  issued  by  leading international banking counterparties.\n\n## 10.6. Liquidity risk\n\nThe  Group's  liquidity  risk  can  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  its outstanding  short-term  debt  under  its  short-term  marketable instruments  programme.  Should  these  bank  facilities  not  be renewed,  the  Group  would  have  confirmed  undrawn  credit lines of \u20ac5,363.0 million at 31 December 2020. These lines were not subject to any covenants.\n\n## 10.7. Shareholding risk\n\nNo cash has been invested in shares.\n\nAvailable cash is invested with top-ranking financial institutions in  the  form  of  non-speculative  instruments  which  can  be drawn in very short periods. At 31 December 2020, marketable securities consist mainly of unit trusts (note 9.2.).\n\nAt  31  December  2020,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac9,304.5 million (note 9.3.). A change of plus or minus 10% in the market price of these shares relative to  the  market  price  of  \u20ac78.70  on  31  December  2020  would have an impact of plus or minus \u20ac930.4 million before tax on Group equity.\n\nThe initial share price for Sanofi shares was \u20ac34.12.\n\nThe shares are valued based on their fair value, and unrealised losses  and  gains  are  accounted  for  through  equity  in  the Other comprehensive income item.\n\n5",

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities resulting from foreign exchange and/or interest rate hedging transactions entered into with the Group's  counterparty  banks  are  not  offset  in  the  balance sheet since they are FBF (French Banking Federation) or ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements that only provide for offsetting in the event of default by one of  the  parties  to  the  agreement.  Accordingly,  they  do  not meet the offsetting criteria set out in IAS 32.\n\nHad  the  agreements  been  offset  at  the  level  of  each counterparty bank, assets and liabilities would have decreased  by  \u20ac75.5  million,  \u20ac48.8  million  and  \u20ac65.5  million  in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.",

Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  set  up  to  cover probable outflows for the benefit of third parties without any equivalent  consideration  being  received  by  the  Group  in return.  They  mainly  relate  to  restructuring  costs,  industrial, environmental  and  commercial  risks  relating  to  operations such as breach  of  contract, product returns, and employee-related risks.\n\nThese provisions are estimated on the basis of the most likely assumptions or by using statistical  methods, depending on the nature of the risks.\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recorded  either  as Non-current liabilities or  as Current liabilities ,  depending on their type. Provisions for liabilities or disputes which must be settled  within  12  months  of  the  closing  date,  and  those linked  to  the  normal  operating  cycle  (such  as  product returns), are recorded as Current liabilities.

Contingent liabilities and material ongoing disputes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is party to several material disputes, described below:\n\n## 12.2.1. Tax disputes\n\n## Brazil - IPI indirect tax base challenged\n\nIn  January  2015,  decree  8.393/2015  stated  that  commercial companies in Brazil would be liable for the indirect IPI tax on certain products as from 1 May 2015. L'Or\u00e9al is challenging the legal  grounds  of  this  decree  and  its  application.  In  light  of changes in market practices and a favourable change in the opinion  of  its  advisers,  since  1 January  2018  L'Or\u00e9al  has recognised the IPI collected under income and the provision that had been funded was accordingly reversed in 2018.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding  the indirect IPI tax for financial years 2008  and  2011  to 2015 totalling \u20ac505 million, including interest and penalties. The Brazilian tax authorities are questioning the ex-works sales price to  the  commercial  arm  used  to  calculate  the  IPI  tax  base. After consulting with its tax advisors, L'Or\u00e9al considers that the Brazilian tax  authorities'  position  is  unfounded  and  has challenged these notices. L'Or\u00e9al continues its legal proceedings with the tax and legal authorities.\n\nIn  light  of  the  negative  developments  in  administrative  court decisions  on  the  same  matter  for  other  Brazilian  groups, L'Or\u00e9al funded a provision to partially cover this risk using the average prices applied by its subsidiaries as a basis for tax and not its whole third party net sales.\n\n## India - Advertising, marketing and promotional costs challenged\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  several  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding financial years 2007/08  to  2015/16  for  the  most  part concerning the tax deductibility of advertising, marketing and promotional  expenses  for  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac162.4  million, including  interest  and  penalties.  After  consulting  with  its  tax advisors,  L'Or\u00e9al  decided  to  contest  these  notices  and continues  the  legal  proceedings  with  the  administrative  and legal authorities.\n\n## Europe - Mutual agreement procedures\n\nMutual  agreement  procedures  were  instigated  vis-\u00e0-vis  the Italian, French and Spanish tax authorities in order to eliminate double  taxation  following  disagreements  between  these authorities.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 12.2.2. Investigations carried out by the competition authorities\n\nThe  national  competition  authorities  in  several  European countries have launched investigations targeting the cosmetics industry in particular.\n\n## a) Europe (excluding France)\n\nIn Greece, in its decision passed down on 4 October 2017, the Greek competition authority condemned L'Or\u00e9al Hellas to pay a  fine  of  \u20ac2.6  million  for  carrying  out  anti-competitive practices in 2005-2006. L'Or\u00e9al Hellas refuted all allegations of having  engaged  in  anti-competitive  practices  with  other luxury  cosmetics  manufacturers.  The  Greek  Administrative Court of Appeal quashed this decision on 5 November 2018. The  Greek  competition  authority  lodged  an  appeal  in cassation  against  this  decision  on  28  January  2019  and  a hearing before the Council of State, which was postponed on numerous  occasions,  was  finally  held  on  17  November  2020. The decision should be handed down at the end of 2021.\n\nIn  Germany,  after  the  German  competition  authority  filed a lawsuit  in  2008  in  the  area  of  personal  care  products,  which was  definitively  closed  in  2015,  distributors  filed  a  lawsuit seeking damages against L'Or\u00e9al Germany which has resulted in dismissals by the courts at this stage. These proceedings are still ongoing. L'Or\u00e9al Germany is contesting the merits of these claims and denies that any damages occurred.\n\n## b) France\n\nIn  France,  on  18  December  2014,  the  French  competition authority handed down a fine of \u20ac189.5 million against L'Or\u00e9al in  the  hygiene  products  sector  for  events  that  took  place  in the early 2000s. On 27 October 2016, the Paris Court of Appeal upheld the first instance decision. L'Or\u00e9al refutes all accusations  of  concerted  practices  with  its  competitors  and regrets that the French competition authority did not take into account  the  highly  competitive  French  market  in  household and  hygiene  products  as  illustrated  by  the  number  of manufacturers and retailers present on the market, the large choice  of  products  available  to  consumers,  and  the  high degree of innovation and number of product launches.\n\nFollowing an appeal lodged by L'Or\u00e9al, on 27 March 2019, the Court  of  Cassation  partially  overturned  the  ruling  relating  to the amount of the fine imposed on L'Or\u00e9al. On 18 June 2020, the  Second Court of Appeal confirmed the initial amount of the  fine.  L'Or\u00e9al  lodged  a  second  appeal  with  the  Court  of Cassation  against  this  ruling.  The  decision  should  be  handed down at the end of 2021.\n\n- It  should  be  noted  that  since  the  appeal  and  cassation appeal  do  not  entail  a  stay  in  the  judgement,  the  fine provisioned at the end of 2014 was paid on 28 April 2015.\n- At  31  December  2020,  the  provision  was  maintained  in liabilities and the payment recognised in Other current assets.\n\nFollowing this ruling, the distributors filed lawsuits for damages against L'Or\u00e9al. These proceedings are in initial stages. L'Or\u00e9al contests  the  merits  of  these  claims  and  denies  that  any damages occurred.\n\nA provision has been set aside for all disputes still in progress at 31  December  2020  amounting  to  \u20ac189.5  million  at  year-end, unchanged from \u20ac189.5 million at end-2019 and \u20ac189.5 million at end-2018.\n\nAt  the  present  time,  no  other  exceptional  events  or  disputes are  highly  likely  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  earnings, financial situation, assets, or operations of the Company or the L'Or\u00e9al Group.",

STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## (For the year ended 31 December 2020)\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English  speaking  readers.  This  report  includes  information  specifically  required  by  European  regulations  or  French  law,  such  as information  about  the  appointment  of  Statutory  Auditors.  This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## L'OR\u00c9AL\n\n14 rue Royale\n\n75008 Paris, France\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  Annual  General  Meeting,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying consolidated financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  and  of  the  financial position  of  the  Group  at  31  December  2020  and  of  the  results  of  its  operations  for  the  year  then  ended  in  accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code ( Code  de  commerce )  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  ( Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  Statutory  Auditors,  for  the  period  from 1 January 2020 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the health emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and financing, and have led to greater uncertainties as to their future prospects. Some of those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on their internal organisation and the performance of audits.\n\nIt  is  in  this  complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgement,  were  the  most  significant  in  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to  the  opinion  we  formed  as  expressed  above.  We  do  not  provide  a  separate  opinion  on  specific  items  of  the  consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Description of risk\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\n## Measurement of intangible assets\n\nSee Note 7.1. - Goodwill, Note 7.2. - Other intangible assets, Note 7.3. - Impairment tests on intangible assets, and Note 4 - Other operational income and expenses, to the consolidated financial statements\n\nAt  31  December 2020, the net carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible  assets  recognised  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements totalled \u20ac13,870 million, representing 32% of assets. These assets consist primarily  of  goodwill  and  non-amortised  brands  with  indefinite  useful lives, recognised following business combinations.\n\nWhenever there is an indication of impairment, or at least once a year, the Group verifies that the carrying amount of these assets is not greater than  their  recoverable  amount  and  does  not  present  a  risk  of impairment (impairment test).\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  each  Cash  Generating  Unit  (CGU)  is determined  on  the  basis  of  discounted  operating  cash  flow  forecasts covering a period of 10 years (the period considered necessary for the strategic  positioning  of  an  acquisition)  and a  terminal  value.  The  main assumptions taken into account in the measurement of the recoverable amount concern:\n\n- \u25cf growth in sales and margin rate;\n- \u25cf a perpetual growth rate for calculating the terminal value; and\n- \u25cf discount  rates  based  on  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital, where necessary adjusted by a country risk premium.\n\nThe impairment tests performed did not lead to the recognition of any impairment losses in 2020.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of these assets to be a key audit matter because  of  their  relative  materiality  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  because  the  calculation  of  their  recoverable  amount requires  a  high  degree  of  judgement  from  Management  in  terms  of projecting  future  cash  flows  and  determining  the  main  assumptions  to be used.\n\nWe obtained the impairment tests and sensitivity analyses prepared by Management.  We  assessed  the  sensitivity  analyses,  in  particular  by comparing them to our own sensitivity analyses, to determine the nature and scope of our procedures.\n\nWe assessed, in particular, the quality of the process for drawing up and approving budgets and forecasts and, for the impairment tests that we deemed the most sensitive,  the  reasonableness  of  the  main  estimates made and, more specifically:\n\n- \u25cf the consistency of projected sales and margin rates with the Group's past performance and the economic and financial context in which the  Group  operates,  including  the  impacts  of  the  Covid-19  health crisis;\n- \u25cf the  corroboration  of  the  growth  rates  used  with  analyses  of  the performance  of  the  global  cosmetics  market,  taking  into  account specific  features  of  the  local  markets  and  distribution  channels  in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf the discount rates applied to future cash flows, by comparing their inputs  with  external  references,  with  the  guidance  of  our  valuation experts;\n- \u25cf the analyses of the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to the key main assumptions used, as described by Management in Note 7.3 to the consolidated financial statements, and to our own analyses.\n\nWe verified the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of provisions for liabilities and charges (excluding provisions for product returns), non-current tax liabilities and contingent liabilities\n\nSee  Note  6  -  Income  tax  and  Note  12  -  Provisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  -  Contingent  liabilities  and  material  ongoing  disputes,  to  the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Group is exposed to various risks arising in the ordinary course of its business, particularly tax risks, industrial, environmental and commercial risks  relating  to  operations  (excluding  provisions  for  product  returns), employee-related risks and risks related to antitrust investigations.\n\nWhen  the  amount  or  due  date  of  a  liability  can  be  estimated  with sufficient reliability, provisions are recorded for these risks. When this is not the case, the Group provides disclosures on contingent liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contingent liabilities and material ongoing disputes reported in Note 12.2.1 include tax disputes in Brazil and India, for which the tax authorities are claiming \u20ac505 million and \u20ac162 million, respectively.\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  (excluding  provisions  for  product returns)  amounted  to  \u20ac929  million,  and  non-current  tax  liabilities  to \u20ac398 million at 31 December 2020.\n\nWe deemed the determination and measurement of these items to be a key audit matter given:\n\n- \u25cf the h igh d egree  of  judgement  required  from  Management  to determine  which  risks  should  be  provisioned  and  measure  with sufficient reliability the amounts of these provisions;\n- \u25cf the  potentially  material  impact  of  these  provisions  on  the  Group's profit.\n\nIn  order  to  identify  and  gain  an  understanding  of  all  of  the  existing disputes and liabilities as well as the corresponding judgements made, we made inquiries with General Management and the Legal and Tax Departments at all levels of the organisation, in France and abroad. We corroborated the list of identified disputes with the Group's risk mapping, as  presented  by  the  Legal  Department  to  the  Audit  Committee,  and the information provided by the principal law firms acting for the Group, which we questioned on the matters.\n\nRegarding  the  most  significant  disputes  for  which  a  provision  was recorded, we assessed the quality of Management's estimates by taking into  consideration  the  data,  assumptions  and  calculations  used.  We carried out a retrospective review by comparing the amounts paid out with the provisions recorded in recent years.\n\nWith  the  guidance  of  our  experts  in  the  field  where  applicable,  we carried out the following procedures:\n\n- \u25cf we examined the procedural aspects and/or the legal or technical opinions  prepared  by  the  lawyers  or  external  experts  selected  by Management in order to assess the merits of the decision to record a provision;\n- \u25cf on the basis of the information provided to us, we critically assessed the estimated ranges of risk level and verified that the measurements used by Management fall within these ranges;\n- \u25cf when appropriate, we verified the consistency of the methods used for these assessments.\n\nRegarding contingent liabilities, with the guidance of our experts in the field  where  applicable,  we  examined  the  procedural  aspects  and/or the  legal  or  technical  opinions  prepared  by  the  lawyers  or  external experts  selected  by  Management  in  order  to  assess  the  merits  of  the decision not to record a provision.\n\nWe verified the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 2020 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nStatutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  taken  by  users  on  the  basis  of  these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify  and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and  perform  audit  procedures  in  response  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  made  by Management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assess the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  Statutory  Auditors  are  responsible  for  the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed thereon.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit Committee.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, 17 February 2021 The Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Anne-Claire Ferri\u00e9\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Moulin\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 1. Accounting principles\n\nThe  Company's  annual  financial  statements  are  prepared in accordance with French law and regulations (French Chart of Accounts) and generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n## 1.1. Sales\n\nThese  are  comprised  of  sales  of  goods  (net  of  returns  from distributors and rebates and discounts) and services (including technological assistance fees).\n\n## 1.2. Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nExpenses  relating  to  the  advertisement  and  promotion  of products  to  customers  and  consumers  are  recognised  as expenses  for  the  year  in  which  the  advertisement  or promotional initiative takes place.\n\n## 1.3. Research and innovation costs\n\nResearch and innovation costs are recognised in expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## 1.4. Income tax\n\nThe  Company  has  opted  for  the  French  tax  group  regime. French companies included in the scope of tax consolidation recognise an income tax charge in their own accounts on the basis of their own taxable profits and losses.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al, as the parent company of the tax group, recognises as  tax  income  the  difference  between  the  aggregate  tax charges recognised by the subsidiaries and the tax due on the basis of consolidated taxable profit or loss of the tax group.\n\n## 1.5. Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at purchase cost, including acquisition costs.\n\nTechnical  merger  losses  are  allocated  to  the  corresponding underlying assets and amortised where appropriate.\n\nThe value of newly acquired trademarks is calculated based on  a  multi-criteria  approach  taking  into  consideration  their reputation and their future contribution to profits.\n\nIn  accordance with regulation No. 2004-06 on assets, certain trademarks  have  been  identified  as  amortisable  regarding their estimated useful life.\n\nNon-amortisable trademarks are tested for impairment at least once a year on the basis of the valuation model used at the time  of  their  acquisition.  An  impairment  is  recorded  where appropriate.  Initial  trademark  registration  costs  are  recorded as expenses.\n\nPatents are amortised over a period ranging from two to ten years.\n\nBusiness goodwill is not amortised. It is impaired whenever the present value of future cash flows is less than the book value. Business goodwill is subject to impairment tests at least once a year, even when there is no evidence of an impairment loss.\n\nSoftware of material value is  amortised  using  the  straight-line method  over  its  probable  useful  life,  generally  between  five and  seven  years.  It  is  also  subject  to  accelerated  tax-driven amortisation, which is recognised over a 12-month period.\n\nOther intangible assets are usually amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years.\n\nNotes to the financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al SA\n\n## 1.6. Tangible assets\n\nTangible  assets  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost,  including acquisition expenses.\n\nThe useful lives of tangible assets are as follows:\n\n|                                    | Length      |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Buildings                          | 20-50 years |\n| Fixtures and fittings              | 5-10 years  |\n| Industrial machinery and equipment | 10 years    |\n| Other tangible assets              | 3-10 years  |\n\nBoth  straight-line and  declining-balance  depreciation  is calculated  over  the  actual  useful  lives  of  the  assets concerned. Exceptionally, industrial machinery and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over a period of ten years, with all additional depreciation classified as accelerated tax-driven depreciation.\n\n## 1.7. Financial assets\n\n## 1.7.1. Financial investments\n\nThese items are recognised in the balance sheet at purchase cost excluding incidental expenses.\n\nTheir value is assessed annually by reference to their value in use,  which  is  mainly  based  on  the  current  and  forecast profitability  of  the  subsidiary  concerned  and  the  share  of equity  owned.  If  the  value  in  use  falls  below  the  net  book value, an impairment is recognised.\n\n## 1.7.2. Other financial assets\n\nLoans  and  other  receivables  are  valued  at  their  nominal amount. Loans and other receivables denominated in foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at the  end  of  the  financial  year.  If  necessary,  impairments  are recognised against these items to reflect their value in use at the end of the financial year.\n\nTreasury shares acquired  in connection  with  buyback programmes to be cancelled is recognised in other long-term investments.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, other long-term investments are compared with their probable sale price and a provision for impairment recognised where appropriate.\n\n## 1.8. Inventories\n\nInventories  are  valued  using  the  weighted  average  cost method.\n\nAn  impairment  is  made  for  obsolete  and  slow-moving inventories on the basis of their probable net realisable value, estimated on the basis of historic and projected data.\n\n## 1.9. Trade accounts receivable and other receivables\n\nTrade  accounts  receivable  and  other  receivables  are recorded  at  their  nominal  value.  Where  appropriate,  an impairment is recognised based on an assessment of the risk of non-recovery.\n\n6",

Marketable securities cash and cash equivalents\n\nMarketable  securities  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost  and are valued at the end of the financial year at their probable sale price.\n\nTreasury shares held that is specifically allocated to employee stock option and free shares plans recognised in marketable securities.\n\nNo  discount  is  granted  on  the  exercise  price  of  the  options. Provided that the shares are purchased at a lower price than the  exercise  price,  no  impairment  is  required.  However,  an impairment  is  recognised  in  the  event  of  a  decline  in  the market price,  representing  the  difference  between  the  book value of the treasury shares and the average share price in the month preceding the reporting date.\n\nA  provision  for  liabilities  and  charges  in  respect  of  shares  of Treasury  shares  allocated  to  free  share  plans  for  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A. parent  company  employees  is  recognised  over  the  period during  which  the  rights  to  the  free  shares  vest.  Shares  of Treasury shares allocated to free share plans for employees of Group  subsidiaries  are  written  down  in  full.  However,  the subsidiaries  concerned  will  bear  most  of  the  cost  of  granting these free shares.\n\n## 1.11. Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recognised  to  cover probable outflows of resources to third parties, without receipt of  equivalent  consideration  by  the  Company.  They  relate mainly  to  commercial  and  financial  contingencies  and litigation (subsidiaries\u2026) and to Administration and employeerelated contingencies.\n\nThese provisions are estimated on the basis of the most likely assumptions  or  by  using  statistical  methods,  depending  on their type.\n\n## 1.12. Accounting for foreign currency transactions and exchange rate hedges\n\nAll receivables and  payables  denominated  in  foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rates  prevailing at the end of the financial year.\n\nExchange rate hedging instruments are contracted to hedge commercial transactions recognised in the balance sheet and future transactions that are considered to be highly probable. Gains  and  losses  generated  by  these  instruments  are recognised symmetrically with the gains and losses arising on the hedged items, in the same aggregate as profit and loss. Option  premium  income/discounts  are  recognised  in  profit and loss when the hedged item is recognised.\n\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedges are classified as isolated  open  positions.  These  are  recognised  at  their  fair value  in  the  balance  sheet,  and  offset  an  'Unrealised exchange gains or losses' account.\n\nTranslation  differences  on  operating  assets  and  liabilities  and related  hedging  instruments  are  also  recognised  in  the balance sheet as 'Unrealised exchange gains or losses'.\n\nA  provision  is  recognised  if  the  sum  of  these  unrealised exchange gains  and  losses  shows  a  potential  exchange  loss based  on  the  overall  exchange  position,  calculated  on  a currency-by-currency  basis.  The  overall  foreign  exchange position excludes translation differences of hedging instruments and hedged items.\n\nIn accordance  with  French  accounting  standards,  the potential  gain  resulting  from  the  overall  foreign  exchange position is not recognised as income in the income statement.\n\nHedges have already been taken out in respect of forecasted operating transactions for the next financial year. The impact of  such  hedges  on  profit  or  loss  will  be  recorded  during  the same accounting period as the transactions hedged.\n\n## 1.13. Accounting for interest rate instruments\n\nIn the case of interest-rate hedges, for gains and losses arising on  interest  rate  swaps  and  caps,  hedging  financial  liabilities are recorded on a pro rata basis symmetrically with the gains and losses on the items hedged.\n\n## 1.14. Employee retirement obligations and related benefits\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al parent company  operates  pension,  early retirement  and  other  benefit  schemes  for  employees  and retirees depending  on  local  legislation  and  regulations. Directors  and  corporate  officers  are  regarded  as  employees for  all  additional  benefits  relating  to  their  remuneration,  and are  therefore  covered  by  the  same  employee  benefit schemes.\n\nThese obligations are partially funded by an external scheme where  the  funds  are  gradually  built  up  through  contributions paid.  The  contributions  are  expensed  as  incurred  under  the Other purchases and external charges item.\n\nThe  related  obligations  are  measured  using  an  actuarial valuation  method  based  on  final  salaries.  The  method  takes account  of  length  of  service,  life  expectancy,  turnover  by category  of  personnel  and  economic  assumptions  such  as inflation and discount rates.\n\nNo  provision  is  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  for  net unfunded  obligations,  which  are  shown  in  off-balance  sheet commitments.\n\nOnly  obligations  in  respect  of  long-service  awards  are  no longer  recognised  as  an  off-balance  sheet  commitment; instead, a provision is recognised in the balance sheet based on an actuarial valuation of the obligation.",

STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## (For the year ended 31 December 2020)\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English  speaking  readers.  This  report  includes  information  specifically  required  by  European  regulations  or  French  law,  such  as information  about  the  appointment  of  Statutory  Auditors.  This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## L'OR\u00c9AL\n\n14, rue Royale\n\n75008 Paris, France\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  Annual  General  Meeting,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  and  of  the  financial  position  of  the Company at 31 December 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code ( Code  de  commerce )  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics (Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  Statutory  Auditors,  for  the  period  from 1 January 2020 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the health emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and financing, and have led to greater uncertainties as to their future prospects. Some of those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on their internal organisation and the performance of audits.\n\nIt  is  in  this  complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in our audit of the financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed as part of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n6",

Investments and intangible assets are initially recognised at purchase cost.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the value in use of a given item falls below its net carrying amount.\n\nAs described in Notes 1.5 and 1.7 to the financial statements, the value of  these  items  is  assessed  annually  by  reference  to  their  value  in  use, which is based on:\n\n- \u25cf for investments: the current and forecast profitability of the subsidiary concerned and the share of equity owned.\n- \u25cf for  intangible  assets,  excluding  software  and  intangible  assets  in progress: discounted future cash flows.\n\nIn order to estimate the value in use of these items, Management must use  judgement  to  project  future  cash  flows  and  determine  the  main assumptions to be used.\n\nGiven the materiality of investments and intangible assets in the balance sheet  and  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  certain  components  of  the calculations, including the forecasts used to calculate value in use, we deemed  the  measurement  of  these  items  to  be  a  key  audit  matter, carrying a risk of material misstatement.\n\nWe examined the methodology employed by management to estimate the  value  in  use  of  investments  and  intangible  assets  (excluding software and intangible assets in progress).\n\nOur  audit  work  consisted  primarily  in  verifying,  on  the  basis  of  the information  provided  to  us,  that  the  estimated  values  determined  by Management  were  based  on  an  appropriate  measurement  method, and  in  assessing  the  quality  of  these  estimates  by  taking  into consideration the data, assumptions and calculations used.\n\nWe primarily focused our audit work on the investments and intangible assets with a value in use close to their net carrying amount.\n\nWe  assessed  the  reasonableness  of  the  main  estimates  and,  more specifically:\n\n- \u25cf the  consistency  of  projected  sales  and  margin  rates  with  past performance and the economic and financial context;\n- \u25cf the  corroboration  of  the  growth  rates  used  with  analyses  of  the performance  of  the  global  cosmetics  market,  taking  into  account specific  features  of  the  local  markets  and  distribution  channels  in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf the discount rates applied to future cash flows, by comparing their inputs  with  external  references,  with  the  guidance  of  our  valuation experts.\n\n## Measurement of provisions for liabilities and charges and contingent liabilities\n\nSee  Note  1.11  on  accounting  policies,  Note  18  -  Provisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  (excluding  subsidiaries  and  holdings)  and  Note  24.3 Contingent liabilities\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  subject  to  legal  proceedings  and  tax,  customs  and administrative audits arising in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThese  provisions  are  recorded  so  that  L'Or\u00e9al  can  meet  its  likely payment obligations to third parties with no corresponding consideration for the Company in return. They mainly relate to business and financial risks  and  disputes,  as  well  as  risks  with  authorities  and  staff-related  risks. These  provisions  are  estimated  by  taking  into  account  the  most  likely assumptions or by using statistical methods based on their nature.\n\nMaterial provisions mainly concern the dispute with the antitrust authority and the risks with the authorities mentioned in Note 18.\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  amounted  to  \u20ac791  million  at 31 December 2020. We deemed the determination and measurement of these items to be a key audit matter given:\n\n- \u25cf the high degree of judgement required from Management to determine which risks should be provisioned and measure with sufficient reliability the amounts of these provisions;\n- \u25cf the potentially material impact of these provisions on the Company's profit.\n\nIn  order  to  identify  and  gain  an  understanding  of  all  of  the  existing disputes and liabilities as well as the corresponding judgements made, we made inquiries with General Management and the Legal and Tax Departments.  We  corroborated  the  list  of  identified  disputes  with  the Group's  risk  mapping,  as  presented  by  the  Legal  Department  to  the Audit  Committee,  and  the  information  provided  by  the  principal  law firms acting for L'Or\u00e9al SA, which we questioned on the matters.\n\nRegarding  the  most  significant  disputes  for  which  a  provision  was recorded, we assessed the quality of Management's estimates by taking into  consideration  the  data,  assumptions  and  calculations  used.  We carried out a retrospective review by comparing the amounts paid out with the provisions recorded in recent years.\n\nWith  the  guidance  of  our  experts  in  the  field  where  applicable,  we carried out the following procedures:\n\n- \u25cf we examined the procedural aspects and/or the legal or technical opinions  prepared  by  the  lawyers  or  external  experts  selected  by Management in order to assess the merits of the decision to record a provision;\n- \u25cf on the basis of the information provided to us, we critically assessed the estimated ranges of risk level and verified that the measurements used by Management fall within these ranges;\n- \u25cf when appropriate, we verified the consistency of the methods used for these assessments.\n\nRegarding contingent liabilities, with the guidance of our experts in the field  where  applicable,  we  assessed  the  merits  of  the  decision  not  to record a provision.",

Based on this work, we attest to the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nConcerning  the  information  given  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Article  L.22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code relating to those items the Company has deemed liable to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, we have verified its consistency with the underlying documents that were disclosed to us. Based on this work, we have no matters to report with regard to this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn  accordance  with  French  law,  we  have  verified  that  the  required  information  concerning  the  acquisition  of  investments  and controlling  interests  and  the  identity  of  the  shareholders  and  holders  of  the  voting  rights  has  been  properly  disclosed  in  the management report.\n\n6",

Accordingly,  this  report  does  not  contain  a conclusion on the compliance of the presentation of the financial statements to be included in the annual financial report referred to in paragraph I of Article L.451-1-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ) with this format.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed Statutory Auditors of L'Or\u00e9al by the Annual General Meeting of 29 April 2004.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s were in the seventeenth consecutive year of their engagement.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with French accounting principles, and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements,  Management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems,  as  well  as,  where  applicable,  any  internal  audit  systems  relating  to  accounting  and  financial  reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  in  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  made  by Management and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assess the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory  Auditors  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  they  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or  are  inadequate,  to  issue  a  qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- \u00b7 evaluate  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assess  whether  these  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",

Depending on the choice made by the Board of Directors in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  1  above,  the General Management is carried out either by the Chairman, or by a natural person, appointed by the Board of Directors and bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer (1) .\n- 3. The  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  granted  with  the  most extensive  powers  to  act  in  all  circumstances  on  behalf  of the  Company.  He  exercises  these  powers  within  the limitations of the object of the Company, and subject to the powers expressly granted by law to Shareholders' Meetings.\n- The Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its relations with third parties. The Company is bound even by actions  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  which  are  outside the  object  of  the  Company,  unless  the  Company  can prove that the third party was aware that the action was outside the object of the Company, or that the third party could not be unaware of this in view of the circumstances, it  being  stated  however  that  the  mere  publication  of  the Articles of Association does not constitute such proof.\n- 4. On  the  proposal  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  whether this  office  is  assumed  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors or by another person, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more natural persons in charge of assisting the Chief Executive Officer, with the title of Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors  determines  the  extent  and  duration  of  the powers granted to the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.'\n\n## 7.1.9. Financial year (Article 14 of the Articles of Association)\n\n'Each fiscal  year  shall  have  a  duration  of  twelve  months,  to begin  on  1  January  and  to  end  on  31  December  of  each year.'\n\n## 7.1.10. Statutory distribution of profits (Article 15 of the Articles of Association)\n\n- A. 'From  the  distributable  profits,  the  following  amounts  shall be withheld, in the following order:\n- 1. The amount required to pay the 'primary dividend' to the shareholders  equal  to  five  percent  (5%)  of  the  amounts paid up on the unredeemed securities in accordance with calls  for  funds,  provided  however  that  (where  the  profits for  a  given  year  do  not  allow  such  dividend  to  be  paid) the  shareholders  shall  not  be  entitled  to  claim  such dividend from out of the profits of subsequent years.\n- 2. From  the  available  remainder,  the  Ordinary  General Meeting, upon a proposal by the Board of Directors, shall have the authority to resolve to withhold the amounts that it deems appropriate (and even the entire amount of such available  remainder),  either  to  be  carried  forward  to  the next fiscal year, or to be paid into a 'prudential fund' or into one or more ordinary, extraordinary or special reserve funds.  Such  reserve  fund(s),  which  shall  not  bear  any interest, may  be  distributed  to  the  shareholders,  or\n\nInformation relating to the Company\n\n- allocated  to  complete  the  5%  primary  dividend  for  the shareholders, in the event of insufficient results during one or more fiscal years, or to acquire and to cancel shares in the  Company,  or  to  redeem  in  whole  or  in  part  such shares.\n- 3. The remaining balance (if any) shall be divided up among all the shareholders, without any discrimination, and each share shall entitle its holder to receive the same income.\n- However, any shareholder who can prove at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  payment  of  the dividend paid for such financial year, will be entitled to a preferential dividend on the shares that are thus registered, equal  to  10%  of  the  dividend  (initial  dividend  and additional dividend) paid on the other shares, including in the event of payment of the dividend in new shares, the preferential dividend thus paid being rounded down to the nearest lower cent, if necessary.\n\nSimilarly, any shareholder who can prove, at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  completion  of  an increase  in  capital  carried  out  through  capitalisation  of reserves,  profits  or  share  premiums  by  the  distribution  of bonus shares, shall be entitled to an increase in the number of  free  shares  to  be  distributed  to  him,  equal  to  10%;  this number being rounded down to the nearest lower unit in the event of fractional share rights.\n\n- The new shares created in this manner shall be ranked, for the  purposes  of  calculating  the  rights  to  the  preferential dividend  and  to  the  increased  share  allocations,  the  old shares from which they result.\n- 4. The  number  of  shares  eligible  for  these  preferential dividends may not exceed 0.5% of the share capital at the closing  date  of  the  past  financial  year,  for  the  same shareholder.\n- B. The losses (if any) shall be charged to the retained earnings from  preceding  fiscal  years  or  to  the  reserve  funds,  and  the balance  shall  be  booked  into  a  special  'carry  forward' account.'\n\n## 7.1.11. Annual General Meeting\n\nAnnual  General  Meetings  are  governed  by  all  the  legal provisions  and  regulations  laid  down  in  this  connection.  It  is specified that, in accordance  with  Article  12  of  the Company's Articles of Association, if the Board of Directors so decides when the General Meeting is called, any shareholder may take part in the meeting by videoconference or by any other  telecommunication  or  remote  transmission  means including the Internet, under the conditions stipulated by the applicable regulations at the time it is used. If this decision is taken, it is communicated in the meeting notice published in the Bulletin des Annonces L\u00e9gales Obligatoires (B.A.L.O).\n\nSince  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  29  April  2004,  double voting rights have been eliminated. Applying the provisions of French law No. 2014-384 of 29 March 2014, the Annual General Meeting  of  22  April  2015  confirmed  that  each  share  entitles the holder to only one vote at General Meetings.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances linked to the Covid-19 epidemic, the Board of Directors decided to postpone to 30 June 2020 the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting initially scheduled for 21 April 2020 at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s in Paris (2) , in hopes of\n\n7",

The  decision  to  hold  this  Meeting  behind  closed doors was announced on 12 May 2020 (1) , the date on which the Board of Directors so decided. This press release also specified the identity of two companies as scrutineers (T\u00e9thys and Nestl\u00e9), which are the two shareholders holding the largest number of votes and having accepted this duty, as they would have been under ordinary law (2) .  In  this  context,  via  a  press  release  issued on  25  March  2020 (3) ,  shareholders  were  invited  to  vote  by correspondence using the voting form or via the Internet on the Votaccess  secure  voting  platform,  or  to  give  a  proxy  to  the Chairman of the General Meeting or to any other individual or legal entity of their choice.\n\nThe Meeting was  broadcast  live on the 'www.lorealfinance.com' website, in accordance with the recommendations of the French Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s  Financiers) ,  and  the  webcast  is  available  at  lorealfinance.com.

Presentation of the stock option plans for the purchase or subscription of shares and plans for conditional grants of shares to employees (ACAs)\n\n## Policy\n\nFor several years L'Or\u00e9al has set up long-term incentive plans in  favour  of  its  employees  and  corporate  officers  in  an international  context,  in  the  form  of  grants  of  performance shares.\n\nThese grants serve a dual purpose:\n\n- \u00b7 motivate  and  associate  those  who  make  significant contributions to future increases in the Group's results; and\n- \u00b7 strengthen  involvement  and  the  sense  of  belonging  of  its beneficiaries  by  fostering  long-term  loyalty  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nUntil  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  exclusively  granted stock  options  to  the  senior  managers  and  corporate  officers whom  L'Or\u00e9al  wished  to  reward  for  their  performance  and their  important  role  in  business  development  and  in  the Group's current and future projects, wherever they might be located.\n\nIn  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  enlarged  its  policy  by introducing a mechanism for the conditional grants of shares to employees (ACAs).\n\nThe objective was:\n\n- \u00b7 to provide a long-term incentive offering greater motivation to  all  those  who  received  stock  options  only  occasionally or in limited numbers; and\n- \u00b7 to reach  out  to a   broader  population  of  potential beneficiaries,  particularly  internationally,  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nIn  2011,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  make  ACAs the  primary  vehicle  for  its  long-term  incentive  policy  by extending the grant of shares to the main senior managers of the  Group  who  until  then  had  only  received  stock  options: thus,  except  for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer who received stock options only, the main senior managers of L'Or\u00e9al,  including  the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee, received  a  mix  of  stock  options  and  conditional  grants  of shares in order to encourage both their entrepreneurship spirit and to reward their performance in the medium to long term. Other  eligible  employees  were  incentivised  by  conditional grants of shares only.\n\nIn  2012,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  proposal  of  the  Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, went one step further in this policy and decided to replace the grant of stock options by  conditional  grants  of  shares  (ACAs)  for  all  beneficiaries including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nSince  2013,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  proposal  of  the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, has continued  this  policy  to  make  conditional  grants  of  shares (ACAs),  to  the  exclusion  of  any  other  long-term  incentive instrument.\n\nThe  plans  are  proposed  by  General  Management  to  the Board of Directors which decides, after receiving the opinion of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, with regard  to  the  opening  of  these  plans  and  the  applicable conditions and rules.\n\nSince  2009,  these  grants  are  made  after  publication  of  the financial statements  for  the  previous  financial  year,  in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation.\n\nThe decision with regard to each individual grant is, in every case,  contingent  upon  the  quality  of  the  performance rendered  at  the  time  of  implementation  of  the  plan  with particular  attention  being  paid  to  the  main  talents  for  the future. According to the eligibility criteria linked to the position held  by  the  beneficiary  and  the  size  of  the  entity  or  the country  in  which  the  beneficiary  works,  to  ensure  worldwide fairness, these grants are made every year, every two years or every three years.\n\nThe  General  Management  and  the  Board  of  Directors  stress the importance that is given to bringing together the interests of the beneficiaries of stock options and conditional grants of shares and those of the shareholders themselves.\n\nThe beneficiaries (employees, directors and corporate officers) share with the shareholders the same confidence in the strong steady growth of the Company with a medium and long-term vision.  This  is  why  stock  options  were  granted  for  a  period  of 10 years including a five-year vesting period, and conditional grants of shares for a period of four years followed, for France up until the 2015 plan, by a 2-year holding period during which these shares cannot be sold.\n\nThe Board of Directors calls the attention of the beneficiaries of stock  options  and  conditional  grants  of  shares  to  the regulations  in  force  concerning  persons  holding  'inside information'. The beneficiaries of stock options and conditional  grants  of  shares  undertake  to  read  the  Stock Market  Code  of  Ethics  is  attached  to  the  stock-options  and ACAs plan rules from which they benefit and to comply with the provisions thereof.\n\n## Number of beneficiaries\n\n50%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  14  October  2020  plan  are women. More than 3,600 employees, representing 10% of the managers  around  the  world,  nearly  55%  of  whom  are  in international subsidiaries, benefit from at least one stock option plan  or  one  conditional  grant  of  shares  plan  (ACAs),  as  at 31 December 2020.",

Mr Agon waived 200,000 of these options. He therefore benefits from 200,000 stock options under the plan decided by the Board of Directors at its meeting of 22 April 2011.\n\nThere were 57,397 outstanding options granted by the Board of Directors under the authorisations approved by the Annual General Meetings and not yet exercised at 31 December 2020, at an average price of \u20ac83.19, namely 0.01% of  the  559,871,580  shares composing the share capital at such date.\n\n7",

Plan for the Conditional Grants of Shares (ACAs)\n\n## 7.4.3.1. Authorisation of the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of 30 June 2020\n\nThe Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of 30 June 2020 gave the Board of Directors the authorisation to carry  out  free  grants  of  existing  shares  and/or  shares  to  be issued  to  employees,  directors  and  corporate  officers  of  the Company and of its  French  or  foreign  subsidiaries  under  the conditions  of  Article  L.  225-197-2  of  the  French  Commercial Code.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting set the period of validity of the authorisation, which may be used on one or more occasions, at 26 months.\n\nThe  total  number  of  free  shares  granted  in  this  manner  may not represent more than 0.6% of the share capital recorded on the date of the Board of Directors' decision.\n\nThe  number  of  free  shares  granted  to  the  Company's corporate  officers  may  not  represent  more  than  10%  of  the total  number  of  free  shares  granted  during  a  financial  year pursuant to this resolution.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  determine  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries  of  the  free  grants  of  shares  and  the  number  of free shares granted to each of them as well as the conditions to  be  met  in  order  for  the  shares  to  finally  vest,  and  in particular the performance conditions.\n\nThese performance conditions will take into account:\n\n- \u00b7 partly,  growth  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  comparable  cosmetics  sales  as compared  to  those  of  a  panel  of  its  biggest  direct competitors; and\n- \u00b7 partly, growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit.\n\nThe Board of Directors indeed considers that these two criteria, assessed  over  a  long  period  of  three  financial  years  and applied to several plans, are complementary, in line with the Group's  objectives  and  its  specificities  and  likely  to  promote balanced,  continuing  growth  over  the  long  term.  They  are demanding  but  remain a  source  of  motivation  for  the beneficiaries. The grant of such shares to their beneficiaries, for all or part of the shares granted, will become final and binding subject to the other conditions set at the time of grant being met, at the end of a minimum vesting period of four years.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to sales, in order for all the free shares granted to be finally vested for the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting  period,  the  growth  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  like-for-like sales  must  outperform  the  average  growth  in  sales  of  the panel  of  competitors.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases. If  L'Or\u00e9al's  comparable  growth  in  net  sales  is  less  than  the average growth in sales of the panel of competitors over the period, no share will be allocated for this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all  the  free  shares  granted  to  finally  vest  for  the  beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, a level of growth defined by the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for  confidentiality  reasons, must  be  achieved  or  exceeded.  Below  this  level,  the  grant decreases. If the operating profit does not increase in absolute value  over  the  period,  no  share  will  be  fully  vested  for  this criterion.\n\nThe  grant  of  these  shares  to  their  beneficiaries  will  become final  prior  to  the  expiry  of  the  above-mentioned  vesting periods in the event of disability of the beneficiary corresponding  to  classification in the second  or  third categories provided for in Article L. 341-4 of the French Social Security  Code  ('Code  de  la  s\u00e9curit\u00e9  sociale'),  and  such shares will be freely transferable in the event of disability of the beneficiary  corresponding  to  classification  in  the  abovementioned categories under the French Social Security Code. Pursuant  to  Article  L.  225-197-3  of  the  French  Commercial Code,  in  the  event  of  the  death  of  the  beneficiary,  his/her heirs may request the allocation of the shares within six months from the date of death. These shares are freely transferable.\n\nThe Board of Directors will be able to provide for vesting and holding  periods  which  are  longer  than  the  minimum  periods set above.\n\nThe  mechanism  for  the  Conditional  Grant  of  Shares  to employees complies with the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance and in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 any  conditional  grants  of  shares  to  the  corporate  officers will  be decided by the Board of Directors after assessment of their performance;\n- \u00b7 final  vesting  of  all  or  some  of  the  shares  will  be  linked  to performance  conditions  to  be  met  that  are  set  by  the Board;\n- \u00b7 corporate officers will be obliged to retain 50% of the shares that  are  definitively  granted  to  them  at  the  end  of  the vesting period in registered form until the termination of their duties; and\n- \u00b7 executive  corporate  officers  may  not  be  granted  any shares at the time of their departure.",

Conditional grants of shares granted within the framework of the authorisation of 30 June 2020 (ACAs plan of 14 October 2020)\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  proposals  made  by  the  General Management  and  examined  by  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided, at its  meeting on 14 October 2020, to make a conditional grant of shares within the scope of the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 30 June 2020.\n\nThe  share  capital  at  14  October  2020  was  composed  of 559,278,611  shares,  and  3,355,671  shares  could  therefore  be issued.\n\nThe Board of Directors used this authorisation at its meeting of 14 October 2020 by granting 713,660 shares to 2,208 beneficiaries.\n\nThis is a free grant of shares to be issued.\n\nVesting of the shares is subject to a dual condition:\n\n- \u00b7 presence: the shares granted will only vest after a period of four years at the end of which the beneficiary must still be an employee of the Group (except in the cases provided by the law or the Plan rules);\n- \u00b7 performance:\n- \u00b7 vesting  of  all  or  part  of  50%  of  the  shares  granted  will depend on the growth in comparable cosmetics sales for financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023 compared with those of a panel of L'Or\u00e9al's biggest direct competitors made of  Unilever,  Procter  &  Gamble,  Est\u00e9e  Lauder,  Shiseido, Beiersdorf,  Johnson  &  Johnson,  Henkel,  LVMH,  Kao  and Coty, and\n- \u00b7 vesting  of  all  or  part  of  50%  of  the  shares  granted  will depend on growth in the Group's consolidated operating profit, over the same period.\n\nThe  calculation  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  arithmetic average of the performances for 2021, 2022 and 2023.\n\nLong-term incentive plans\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to sales, in order for all the free shares granted to be finally vested by the beneficiaries at the end  of  the  vesting  period,  L'Or\u00e9al  must  outperform  the average growth in sales of the panel of competitors. Below this level,  the  grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales is less than the average growth in sales of the panel of competitors over the period, no share will be allocated for this  criterion.  The  Board defines a threshold, not made public for  confidentiality  reasons,  below  which  no  share  will  finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all  the  free  shares  granted  to  finally  vest  for  the  beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, a level of growth defined by the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for  confidentiality  reasons, must  be  met  or  exceeded.  Below  this  level,  the  grant decreases. If the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee  is responsible  for  communicating  to  the  Board  of  Directors  the level  of  indicators  recorded  for  the  years  to  be  used  for  the calculation  of  the  performance  conditions.  The  Board  of Directors  records,  at  the  appropriate  time,  the  level  of performance  achieved  on  which  the  number  of  shares  that finally vests depends.\n\nThe data recorded year after year to determine the levels of performance  achieved  are  published  in  sections  7.4.3.5 'Shares finally vested under the 20 April 2017 ACA Plan' and 7.4.3.6.  'Tables  monitoring  performance  conditions  for  the ACAs plans that are currently in progress'.\n\nThe  vesting  of  the  first  200  conditional  shares  (ACAs)  is  not subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions except for the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee,  including  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 7.4.3.3. Shares granted to the ten employees other than directors or corporate officers to whom the largest number of shares have been granted\n\nThe  total  number  of  shares  granted  in  2020  to  the  ten employees  other  than  directors  or  corporate  officers  who received the largest number of shares was 111,250 shares.\n\n7",

INFORMATION POLICY\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of  its  financial information  and  takes  steps  to  ensure  it  maintains  a  regular dialogue with its shareholders and  with French and international  investors.  Beyond  its  legal  obligations,  it  has a whole range of information and communication tools: printed and digital media on the L'Or\u00e9al Finance website, shareholder events  and  meetings  either  organised  physically  or  virtually, investor conferences  and  roadshows,  which  are  made available to all stakeholders to give them  a  better understanding of L'Or\u00e9al's business model and the potential of the beauty market.\n\n## 7.6.1. Additional communications media\n\nKeen on transparency and accessibility of information, in 2020, in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis, L'Or\u00e9al's Financial Communications  Department  shared  a  wealth  of  complete financial and non-financial information with the entire financial community via communication tools, with a high emphasis on digital:\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al makes two exhaustive and complementary annual publications available: the Annual Report and the Universal Registration Document can be consulted and downloaded at www.loreal-finance.com.\n- \u00b7 The www.loreal-finance.com website contains a complete set of all financial and non-financial information. Its content and  ergonomics  evolve  regularly  to  provide  quicker  and easier access to information.\n- \u00b7 The  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance  mobile  application,  available  on  the App Store and Google Play, which was entirely revamped in  2020,  makes  it  possible  to  keep  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance  news close to hand. Downloaded more than 57,000 times since it was created, it is  highly  appreciated  by  professionals  and individual shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The  Letter  to  Shareholders  and  e-newsletters  make  it possible  to  keep  shareholders  and  subscribers  regularly informed of all major events in the life of the Group.\n- \u00b7 Re-issued  in  2020,  the  shareholder  brochure  'Take  part  in the  L'Or\u00e9al  adventure'  describes  the  Company's  business model and explains the advantages of registered shares to answer  questions  that  shareholders  may  have  about  this shareholding method.\n- \u00b7 Testifying to the loyalty of the shareholders who support the Group's development over the long term, more and more shareholders are showing an interest in becoming registered  shareholders.  Thanks  to  preferential  dividends and  the  numerous  advantages  related  to  this  method  of shareholding,  becoming  a  registered  shareholder  enables the  Group's  shareholders  to  be  known  to  the  Group,  to have systematic and regular access to information, and to be closely involved in the Company's development.\n\n## 7.6.2. A large number of shareholder events for regular and detailed dialogue\n\nIn  2020,  in  the  context  of  the  health  crisis  and  to  protect  the health  of  all  our  stakeholders,  shareholders  and  investors, employees of L'Or\u00e9al, all events were maintained and some were transformed to digital format to maintain the relationship and dialogue. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Financial  Communications  Department  organised  a financial  information  meeting  and  telephone  conferences intended  for  analysts  and  institutional  investors,  to  which journalists specialising in the cosmetics sector were invited. The  presentations  of  the  Group's  financial  results  and  the business activities of the Operational  Divisions were broadcast live online on the financial website www.lorealfinance.com.  All  the  information  presented  was  made available on this site, on the day of its publication, when the annual and half-yearly results were published, as well as at investor conferences or Capital Market Days.\n- \u00b7 The  Annual  General  Meeting  was  broadcast  live,  then  on replay,  in  French  and  English,  on  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance website.  For  several  years,  shareholders  have  had  the option  to  vote  remotely  via  the  Votaccess  platform.  This year,  in  order  to  respect  shareholder  democracy  and encourage  dialogue  with  shareholders,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a dedicated email address to receive, in the days preceding the  Annual  General  Meeting (1) ,  all  their  questions  to  be made directly to Management. This broadcast was viewed by around 5,000 shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Meetings  with  shareholders,  usually  organised  in  different forms in several large regional cities in France and the Paris region,  in  collaboration  with  the  French  Individual  Investor and Investment Club Federation ( F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Investisseurs  Individuels  et  des  Clubs  d'Investissement  F2iC ),  the  Association  of  Investor  Relation  Managers  in France  ( Cercle  de  Liaison  des  Informateurs  Financiers  en France  -  CLIFF ),  shareholder  associations  and  financial newspapers were organised in web conference format.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al participated in the second edition of 'Investir Day', a  100%  digital  version,  on  23  and  30  November  2020; it generated  more  than  10,000  views  by  shareholders, students or investors. At this event, presentations were given by Christophe  Babule ,  Chief  Administrative  and  Finance Officer  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  on 'L'Or\u00e9al:  a  Sustainable  Finance' , Alexandra Palt ,  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  and Executive  Vice-President  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Foundation,  on 'L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment to Sustainable Development' and, finally, Lubomira Rochet ,  Chief Digital Officer of L'Or\u00e9al on 'Digital, fuel for growth' .\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  also  organised  and  participated  in  an  online meeting  with  students  from  French  business  schools,  in partnership  with  AXA  and  Orange,  around  a  challenge  in awareness and training in the Stock Market on the theme 'And what meaning do you give to your shares?'.",

As  a  representative  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  individual shareholders, this Committee actively participates, through its reflections and  work, in the development  and enhancement of the Group's financial communication and acts as an  ambassador;  in  2020,  the  Consultation Committee met three times.\n- \u00b7 The Investor Relations Department (IRD) organises numerous meetings throughout the year with institutional  investors  of the main international financial marketplaces. In 2020, they met with a total of more than 600 investors.\n\n## 7.6.3. 2021 Financial Calendar\n\n| 11.02.2021    | 2020 Annual results                        |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 15.04.2021    | 1 st  quarter 2021 sales                   |\n| 20.04.2021    | Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting |\n| July 2021*    | First-half 2021 sales and results          |\n| October 2021* | Sales at 30 September 2021                 |\n\n- * The precise date will be indicated on the website www.loreal-finance.com.\n\n## 7.6.4.

Ordinary part\n\n## Resolutions  1,  2,  3:  Approval  of  the  annual  (parent  company  and  consolidated)  financial statements for 2020, allocating the company's net income and setting the dividend\n\n## EXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nHaving reviewed the Reports of the Board of Directors and the Statutory Auditors, the Annual General Meeting is called on to approve:\n\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements for 2020, with an income statement showing net income of \u20ac4,158,826,992.71 in 2020, compared with \u20ac4,105,828,765.28 for 2019; and\n- \u00b7\n- the 2020 consolidated financial statements. The details of these financial statements are set out in the 2020  Annual  Financial  Report  and  the  main  data included in the package  containing the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  proposes  to  the  Annual  General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7 an  ordinary  dividend  of  \u20ac4  per  share,  representing  an increase of +3.9% over the dividend for the previous year. The rate of distribution of the ordinary dividend (ordinary dividend  paid/net  income  diluted  per  share  excluding non-recurring  items,  attributable  to  owners  of  the Company)  would  be  54,8%  in  2020.  Over  the  last  five financial years, this rate was:\n\n| Year                  | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rate of  distribution | 50.2%  | 51.1%  | 53.4%  | 54.4%  | 49.7%  |\n\n## First resolution: approval of the 2020 parent company financial statements\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  in  accordance  with  the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the Reports of the Board of Directors and the Statutory Auditors, approves the Report of the Board of Directors  and  the  2020  parent  company  financial  statements, as  presented,  and  the  transactions  reported  in  these  financial statements  and  summarised  in  these  Reports,  showing  net income of \u20ac4,158,826,992.71 versus \u20ac4,105,828,765.28 for 2019.\n\n- \u00b7 a preferential dividend per share of \u20ac4.40, corresponding to a 10% increase over the ordinary dividend. This  amount is  rounded down to the nearest euro cent, pursuant  to  Article  15  of  the  Company's  Articles  of Association.\n- The  preferential  dividend  will  be  granted  to  the  shares held  in  registered  form  since  31  December  2018  at  the latest, and which continuously remain in registered form until the dividend payment date in 2021. The number of shares  eligible  for  this  preferential  dividend  may  not exceed,  for  the  same  shareholder,  0.5%  of  the  share capital at the closing date of the previous financial year.\n\nIf  the  Annual  General Meeting approves this proposal, the ex-dividend  date  for  the  dividends  (both  ordinary  and preferential)  will  be  27  April  2021  at  zero  hour,  Paris  time, and they will be paid on 29 April 2021.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  ordinary  dividend  and  the  preferential dividend  is  eligible  for  the  tax  deduction  provided  for  in Article  158.3  2\u00b0  of  the  French  General  Tax  Code,  which  is applicable in the event that an individual beneficiary opts to  tax  his  or  her  income  from  movable  assets  on  the progressive scale of income tax.\n\n## Second resolution: approval of the 2020 consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Reports  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  Statutory  Auditors,  approves  the  2020 consolidated  financial statements  and  the  transactions included  in  these  financial  statements  and  summarised  in these Reports.\n\n## Third resolution: allocation of the Company's net income for 2020 and setting of the dividend\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, on the proposal of the Board of Directors, decides to allocate  the  net  income  for  the  2020  financial  year, amounting to \u20ac4,158,826,992.71 as follows:\n\nNo allocation to the legal reserve which already represents over one-tenth of the share capital\n\n\\_\n\n| Amount allocated to the shareholders as dividend* (including preferential dividend)   | \u20ac2,261,674,177.20   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Balance that will be allocated to the 'Other reserves' item                           | \u20ac1,897,152,815.51   |\n\n- * Including a primary dividend equal to 5% of the amounts paid up on shares, i.e. the total amount of the share capital.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "This amount is calculated on the basis of the number of shares forming the capital at 31 December 2020 and will be adjusted to reflect:\n\n- \u00b7 the number of shares issued between 1 January 2021 and the date of payment of this dividend following the exercise of  stock  options  or  the  final  vesting  of  new  free  shares granted and giving entitlement to such dividend; and\n- \u00b7 the  final  number  of  shares  eligible  for  the  preferential dividend, taking into account sales or transfers to a bearer account  between 1  January  2021  and  the  date  of payment of the dividend.\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  therefore  sets  the  ordinary dividend at 4 euros per share and the preferential dividend at 4.40 euros per share. The preferential dividend will be granted to the shares held in registered form since 31 December 2018 at the latest, and which continuously remain in registered form until  the  dividend  payment  date,  it  being  specified  that  the number  of  shares  giving  entitlement  to  such  a  preferential\n\ndividend  cannot  exceed  0.5%  of  share  capital  for  any  one shareholder.  The  ex-dividend  date  for  the  dividends  (both ordinary  and  preferential)  will  be  27  April  2021  at  midnight (Paris time) and they will be paid on 29 April 2021.\n\nIn the event that, at the time of payment of the dividend, the Company  holds  treasury  shares,  the  distributable  profit corresponding to the unpaid dividend due to the holding of such shares would be allocated to the 'Other reserves' item.\n\nFor individuals domiciled in France, the dividend is subject to income  tax  at  a  flat  rate  but  may  be  taxed,  at  the shareholder's option, at a progressive rate. In such a case, the dividend  is  eligible  for  the  tax  deduction  provided  for  in Article 158.3 2\u00b0 of the French General Tax Code.\n\nThe table below shows the amount of the dividends distributed that  were  fully  eligible  for  the  tax  deduction  provided  for  in Article  158.3  2\u00b0  of  the  French  General  Tax  Code,  for  the  last three financial years:\n\n|                                 | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Ordinary dividend per share     | \u20ac3.55  | \u20ac3.85  | \u20ac3.85  |\n| Preferential dividend per share | \u20ac0.35  | \u20ac0.38  | \u20ac0.38  |",

Independence of Directors\n\nEvery  year  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee proposes to the Board of Directors that the situation of each of  the  Directors  with  regard  to  their  independence  be reviewed on a case-by-case basis according to the criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe  review  of  the  independence  of  these  Directors  was carried  out  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  basis,  in particular,  of a  study  of  the  relationships  existing  between the  Company  and  the  companies  in  which  the  Directors hold offices.\n\nIf  the Annual General Meeting approves the appointments and renewals that are proposed by the Board of Directors, the number of Independent Directors would be 7 out of 14, i.e. an  independence  rate  of  50%  (the  two  Directors representing  the  employees  are  not  taken  into  account under the AFEP-MEDEF Code).\n\n## Fourth resolution: appointment of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Director\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors,  appoints  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as  a  Director  for  a term of four years.\n\nHis term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2025  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\n## Fifth resolution: Appointment of Mr Alexandre Ricard as Director\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors,  appoints  Mr  Alexandre  Ricard  as  a  Director  for  a term of four years.\n\nHis term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2025  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\n## Sixth resolution: Renewal of the term of office of Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers as Director\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors,  renews  the  term  of  office  as  a  Director  of  Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers for a term of four years.\n\nHer term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2025  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\n## 3.2. Balanced gender representation on the Board of Directors\n\nIf  the Annual General Meeting approves the appointments and renewals submitted to it, the number of women on the Board  of  Directors  would  be  7  out  of  the  14  Directors appointed  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting, i.e. a percentage  representation  of  women  of  50%  (the  two Directors  representing  the  employees  are  not  taken  into account pursuant to the French Commercial Code).\n\n## 3.3. Length of office and minimum number of shares held\n\nThe term of office of the Directors appointed by the L'Or\u00e9al Annual  General  Meeting  is  four  years  or  less  to  allow a scheduled renewal of  the  terms  of  office  of  Directors.  The term  of  office  of  a  Director  who  is  not  appointed  by  the Annual General Meeting is four years.\n\nDirectors  appointed  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  must each  hold  a  minimum  of  500  L'Or\u00e9al  shares:  at  least 250  shares  on  the  date  of  his/her  election  by  the  Annual General Meeting, and the balance no later than 24 months after this appointment. The complete list of the duties of the Directors  is  provided  in  section  2.2.2  of  the  2020  Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Seventh resolution: Renewal of the term of office of Mr Paul Bulcke as Director\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors, renews Mr Paul Bulcke's term of office as a Director for a term of four years.\n\nHis term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2025  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\n## Eighth resolution: Renewal of the term of Ms Virginie Morgon as Director\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors,  renews the term of office as Director of Ms Virginie Morgon for a term of four years.\n\nHer term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2025  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.",

        "page_content": "## Resolution 15: Approval of the agreement on the status of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus whose employment contract will be suspended as from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer\n\n## EXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, the L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors, on 14 October  2020,  announced  its  intention  to  dissociate  the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to appoint Mr Jean-Paul Agon as Chairman of the Board, and to appoint Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  the  current  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer and employee of L'Or\u00e9al, as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThis  new  governance  will  take  effect  on  1  May  2021,  by decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  meeting  held following the Annual General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al shareholders on 20 April 2021, which is also called to appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Director.\n\nThe  Code  of  Corporate  Governance  for  listed  companies established jointly by the AFEP and MEDEF to which L'Or\u00e9al refers,  recommends, but does not require, that companies should put an end to combining an employment contract with a corporate office (\u00a7 22.1). L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors shares the objectives of this recommendation which aims at avoiding  the  possibility  of  concurrently  obtaining  benefits both  from  the  employment  contract  and  the  corporate office and at prohibiting any interference with the possibility of removing directors and corporate officers ad nutum .\n\nThe Board of Directors notes that if, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF  recommendation,  his  employment  contract with L'Or\u00e9al were to be terminated, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus would lose the status he acquired as a result of the 34 years he spent working for the Group as an employee.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  does  not  wish  for  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus, having accepted the office of Chief Executive Officer after a 34-year career with L'Or\u00e9al, to be deprived of  the  benefits  to  which  he  would  have  continued  to  be entitled had he remained an employee.\n\nThe Board of Directors believes that the objective pursued by the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation can be fully achieved by maintaining the suspension of the employment contract and clearly separating the benefits related to the corporate office from those relating to the employment contract.\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will  receive  a  fixed  remuneration, a variable  remuneration  and  performance  shares  for  his corporate office.\n\nThe Board of Directors decided not to allocate any indemnity in the event of termination of the corporate office.\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  his  suspended  employment contract  during  the  term  of  corporate  office,  and depending on the reasons for such termination, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus  would  only  be  paid  termination  indemnities, except  in  the  event  of  gross  misconduct  or  gross negligence,  or  retirement  indemnities  in  the  event  of voluntary retirement or at the Company's request pursuant to the suspended employment contract. These indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the employment contract and in strict application of the French National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  Chemical Industries  and  the  Company-level  agreements  applicable to all L'Or\u00e9al's managers, are due in any event pursuant to the  public  policy  rules  of  French  labour  law.  They  are  not subject  to  any  condition  other  than  those  provided  for  by the  French  National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for Chemical  Industries  or  the  above-mentioned  Companylevel  agreements.  The  same  applies  to  the  non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will  continue  to  benefit,  under  his suspended  employment  contract,  from  the  'Garantie  de Ressources des Retraites Anciens Cadres  Dirigeants' (Retirement Income Guarantee for Former Senior Managers) scheme closed to new members effective from 31 December 2015. The Income Guarantee is calculated on the  basis  of  the  number  of  years  of  professional  service  in the  Company  up  to  31  December  2019,  up  to  a  limit  of 25 years. Generally, after 31 December 2019, no new rights will  be  granted  under  this  scheme  pursuant  to  Order  no. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 concerning supplementary professional  retirement  schemes,  which  stipulated  the closure of all defined benefit schemes governed by Article L.  137-11  of  the  French  Social  Security  Code.  The  main features of this scheme are described in section 4.3.2.5. of the Board of Directors' L'Or\u00e9al's 2020 Universal Registration Document. In this specific case, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus has reached since 2012 the 25-year cap for professional activity in  the  Group  stipulated  by  the  scheme  and  therefore  has not  benefited  from  any  new  rights  to  additional  annuity since this date.\n\nIn  respect  of  his  employment  contract,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for  the  Chemical  Industries,  in  the  event  of  termination  of the employment contract, the indemnity due in consideration  of  the  non-compete  clause  would  be payable monthly for two years on the basis of two-thirds of the monthly fixed remuneration attached to the suspended employment contract unless Mr Nicolas Hieronimus were to be released from application of the clause. This clause does not apply  in the event  of  voluntary  retirement  or compulsory  retirement  on  the  Company's  initiative:  no consideration for non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\nRemuneration  in  respect  of  the  corporate  office  will  in  no event be taken into consideration in the calculation of all benefits that may be due under the employment contract described above.\n\nThe reference remuneration to be taken into account for all rights  attached  to  the  employment  contract  and,  in particular,  for  the  calculation  of  the  aforementioned pension  scheme,  will  be  based  on  the  amount  of remuneration at the date of suspension of the employment contract in 2021. This reference remuneration is \u20ac1,750,000 of fixed remuneration and \u20ac1,850,000 of variable remuneration. This remuneration will be revised annually by applying  the  revaluation  coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state pension fund (Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse).\n\nThe  seniority  applied  will  cover  his  entire  career  within  the Group, including the years spent as a corporate officer.\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus is  also  treated  in  the  same  way  as  a senior manager during the term of his corporate office, which will  allow  him  to  continue  to  benefit  from  the  additional social  protection  schemes  and,  in  particular,  the  defined contribution pension scheme, and the employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees. These elements are set out in the remuneration policy  submitted  for  the  approval  of  the  Annual  General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al shareholders on 20 April 2021.\n\n8",

The amount of the capital  increases  that  may  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of the twentieth and twenty-first resolutions would be charged against the total ceiling of 40% of the capital stipulated in the  seventeenth  resolution  approved  by  this  Annual General Meeting.\n\n- 2. decides to cancel, in favour of the employees, directors, corporate  officers  and  eligible  former  employees,  of  the Company  and  of  its  French  and  foreign  affiliates  as defined  by  Article  L.  225-180  of  the  French  Commercial Code  and  Article  L.  3344-1  of  the  French  Labour  Code, who are  members  of  an  Employee  Savings  Scheme,  the shareholders'  preferential  subscription  rights  to  the  shares or  securities  giving  access  to  the  Company's  capital;  it being  specified  that  the  subscription  of  the  shares  or securities  giving  access  to  the  Company's  capital  issued on the basis of this resolution may be carried out through any  employee  investment  fund  and,  in  particular,  a 'structured' employee investment fund within the meaning of the regulations of the French financial markets authority ( Autorit\u00e9  des  March\u00e9s  Financiers ),  or  any  other collective body authorised by the regulations;\n- 3. sets the period of validity of this delegation of authority at 26  months  as  from  the  date  of  this  Annual  General Meeting, and notes that this delegation renders ineffective the  unused  portion  of  any  prior  delegation  for  the  same purpose; it being specified that in the event of filing of a public  offer  by  a  third  party  with  regard  to  the  shares  of the  Company, the  Board  of  Directors  will  not  be  able  to use this authorisation during the public offer period without the prior authorisation of the General Meeting;\n\n8",
