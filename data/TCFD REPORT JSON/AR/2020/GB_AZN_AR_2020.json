It was also a remarkable year for AstraZeneca as we pursue our growth through innovation strategy. Under the excellent leadership of our CEO, Pascal Soriot, our focus on execution delivered signi/ficant advances, while we also build the capabilities to progress in a rapidly changing world and respond to the pandemic.\n\n## A year of pandemic\n\nThe pandemic has impacted the lives of us all. Many employees at AstraZeneca have been working from home but others have continued to work in our laboratories and factories, ensuring the continued supply of our medicines to patients. I am grateful to them, and all those who worked so hard to ensure the safety of our places of work and the wellbeing of employees.\n\nYour Board took the decision early in the pandemic to conclude our agreement with the University of Oxford to develop, manufacture and supply their potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19. It was a decision that was aligned to our Purpose and a practical way in which we were able to help in a time of health crisis.\n\n## Operating sustainably\n\nOur decision to develop and supply the vaccine at no pro/fit during the pandemic was not taken lightly and brings scrutiny to what we do and how we do it. However, how we do things is as important as what we do, including operating in a sustainable way. Our commitment to sustainability includes our Ambition Zero Carbon target which is our contribution to help tackle the climate crisis. I am also pleased that this Annual Report contains our /first statement on the progress we are making against the requirements of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\n## Financial sustainability\n\nOf course, if we are to continue to deliver our pipeline of innovative medicines to patients around the world, we need to be /financially sustainable. In this regard, our results in 2020 were in line with guidance. We also improved pro/fitability, while the strategy of sustainable growth through innovation brought numerous further bene/fits for patients. This performance enabled the Board to reaf/firm its commitment to our progressive dividend policy by keeping the full-year dividend per share at $2.80.\n\nOur patient-centric strategy, focus on innovation and capital-allocation priorities remain unchanged, with sustainable growth in revenue, pro/fit and cash generation set to continue. Consequently Total Revenue is expected to increase by a low-teens percentage in 2021, accompanied by faster growth in Core EPS to $4.75 to $5.00.\n\nOur guidance does not include any revenue or pro/fit impact from sales of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, or any impact from the proposed acquisition of Alexion which we believe could accelerate the combined company's strategic ambitions and will improve pro/fitability and strengthen cash /flow. I will write to you later in the year with more information about this proposed transaction, ahead of the shareholders' general meeting at which your approval to go ahead with it will be sought.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nAt the AGM this April, Genevi\u00e8ve Berger and Graham Chipchase intend to retire from the Board. By then, each will have served as a Non-Executive Director for nine years. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them for their service to AstraZeneca and valuable contributions to the Board's work. We will\n\n## $2.80\n\nFull-year dividend of $2.80 per share (2019: $2.80)\n\nmiss their input and collegiality, although they each have very able successors for two of their key roles. Nazneen Rahman has taken over responsibility from Genevi\u00e8ve for overseeing sustainability matters on behalf of the Board and Philip Broadley will succeed Graham as the senior independent NonExecutive Director.\n\nI will also have served as a Director for nine years by April 2021. Typically, non-executive directors would step down after that period in line with UK corporate governance best practice. However, your Board believes it would be in the best interests of shareholders for me to continue to serve as Chairman, to lead the Board's oversight of completion of the proposed acquisition of Alexion, and has asked me to seek re-election at the AGM. I am honoured and happy to accept the Board's request.\n\nDuring 2020, the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Board continued to consider carefully plans for succession to the senior Board roles of Chairman, CEO and CFO. We have a clear understanding of the way in which we intend to sequence succession over a sensible period of time. In the meantime, I could not be prouder of leading AstraZeneca at such an important time in its history.\n\nLeif Johansson Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

The announcement of our proposed acquisition of Alexion is further evidence of our intention to drive long-term value creation for shareholders and make an even bigger difference to the lives of patients.\n\n## Delivering our strategic priorities\n\nAs demonstrated throughout this Annual Report, the value we delivered in 2020 was made possible through the progress we made against all our strategic priorities and across the whole organisation:\n\n- 1.  Deliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership: We delivered strong results in 2020, despite the adverse impact of the pandemic, with Product Sales up 10% (11% at CER) to $25,890 million. Sales grew in all regions, while Total Revenue from our New Medicines 1 improved by 33% (33% at CER) to $13,950 million.\n- 2.  Accelerate Innovative Science: We had remarkable pipeline and regulatory performances in 2020, with 29 approvals of new medicines or life-cycle management indications in major markets. Despite the occasional setback, which is to be expected, we also had 14 data or regulatory designations for accelerated, priority or other expedited review in major markets.\n- 3.  Be a Great Place to Work: 2020 brought focus to our inclusion and diversity activities, while employee survey results con/firmed we remained a great place to work. We also made good progress with our ambition of leading in sustainability.\n- 1 Tagrisso , Imfinzi , Lynparza , Calquence , Enhertu , Koselugo , Farxiga , Brilinta , Lokelma , roxadustat, Fasenra , Bevespi and Breztri .\n\nBuilding a sustainable company includes building /financial sustainability. In 2020, that meant results in line with guidance given throughout the year and more than half of Total Revenue coming from our New Medicines.\n\n## COVID-19 and living our Values\n\nI am proud of everyone in AstraZeneca who achieved so much in the face of the biggest health crisis the world has encountered in more than a generation. I am even more proud of the fact that, despite the pandemic, employees worked tirelessly to ensure the safety of patients, and their continued access to care and medicines. We also focused on protecting our staff and critical operations. Working with partners across the world, we played a leading role in the process of scienti/fic innovation to combat the virus and contributed more broadly to society, including with emergency relief.\n\nWhile delivering our growth through innovation strategy and responding to the pandemic may seem different challenges, the key to our success is the same in both: being true to our Purpose and living our Values.\n\n## We follow the science\n\nOur response to the pandemic was led by science and included our landmark agreement with the University of Oxford for the global development, production and supply of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca . We committed to doing this at no pro/fit during the pandemic and to providing the broad and equitable supply of billions of vaccine doses around the world. We continue to work around the clock to deliver these as speedily as possible while retaining the highest of quality standards.\n\nOur response to the pandemic also included the repurposing of our existing compounds and the development of our potential long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination against the virus, AZD7442.\n\nAs soon as the gene sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was published in January 2020, our teams worked rapidly to screen thousands of antibodies and, in just 99 days, identi/fied a combination of two potent neutralising antibodies that is designed to reduce the risk of resistance developed by the virus and engineered to increase the durability of the therapy for six to 12 months following a single administration. By running all our usual early development processes in parallel rather than sequentially, we were able to start Phase I trials of AZD7442 in August and Phase III trials in October, thereby reducing to months processes that normally take years.\n\n## We put patients first\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we put patients /first by working closely with investigators to /find solutions and by accelerating the use of digital health technologies in R&D to keep our clinical trials running. For example, we were able to continue more than 80% of our studies. We did so by moving to new ways of working and using digital solutions, such as electronic consent, remote data collection and using devices to collect patient data from home. Our teams also helped patients continue to receive their treatment. For example, we made more than 2,400 shipments to patients' homes in more than 60 studies across 35 countries.",

In the case of chronic kidney disease (CKD), only 12% of cases are currently diagnosed and we are working with digital partners to increase awareness, expand early diagnosis and transform CKD management.\n\nIn the case of respiratory diseases, where patients are at greater risk if they contract COVID-19, it can typically take seven years for severe asthma to be diagnosed and treated. We therefore use digital tools, such as chatbots which, in 2020, helped more than 200,000 patients self-diagnose and seek specialist consultation. We are also working with healthcare systems to remove barriers to better care and accelerating homecare: the number of patients self-administering Fasenra more than doubled in 2020, offering them a safer way to manage their condition in the context of a higher vulnerability to COVID-19.\n\n## We are entrepreneurial\n\nDuring the year, by changing the way we work, we were able to serve an estimated 200,000 new cancer patients against a background that saw a 40% drop in the number of patients who would typically be diagnosed with cancer. Partnering closely with health authorities, we delivered nearly 20 new launches across our major markets, including patient-friendly dosing of Imfinzi in the US and Europe that halved the number of hospital visits needed by patients.\n\nAdditionally, we sought to reduce the impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes by, for example, launching a 'New Normal, Same Cancer' campaign, which we co-created with seven leading global patient coalitions, to encourage patients whose care had been interrupted to re-engage with the healthcare system. We also transformed the patient experience by enabling continuity of care and connectivity between healthcare practitioners and patients with the accelerated launch of HAYA, our fully-integrated oncology patient care management platform. It has been launched in Europe and will be deployed more widely as a result of the positive response.\n\n## We play to win\n\nFor us, playing to win in 2020 meant working hard to manage our global supply chain /flows and inventory in order to protect the supply of medicines to our patients. That included the challenging management of more than 1,300 global logistics routes and moving available product as close to the patient as possible, as borders closed or restrictions were put in place around the world. It also involved staff temperature monitoring and carrying out more than 22,000 COVID-19 assessments to ensure all our operations sites could remain open.\n\nAs a result of our efforts, we delivered 91 on-time launches during the year, including the successful launch of Imfinzi in China early in the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nOverall, our actions allowed us to achieve outstanding stock availability levels of 99.5% throughout our global markets.\n\n## We do the right thing\n\nDoing the right thing ensures that we are a great place to work, both through how each of us contributes to the enterprise and, more broadly, to society. That includes embracing the power of diversity and leading the way to avoid a climate catastrophe. Inclusion and diversity foster creativity, generate innovation and drive performance. In 2020, that was exempli/fied by colleagues from across AstraZeneca coming together to create a comprehensive plan to address racial equity issues that include the design and enrolment into clinical trials, as well as how to attract, retain and develop ethnic minority talent.\n\nAmbition Zero Carbon is our /flagship commitment to help reduce our carbon footprint - for our health and the health of the planet. To achieve this, we are following a greenhouse gas hierarchy of avoiding, reducing, substituting and, only if necessary, compensating for our greenhouse gas emissions. We are making good progress, which includes sourcing 99.9% of our imported electricity globally from renewable sources in 2020.\n\n## Appreciation and looking ahead\n\nIn closing, I want to thank my colleagues on the SET and across AstraZeneca. In particular, I want to congratulate Jeff Pott who, in addition to his role as General Counsel, has taken over as Chief Human Resources Of/ficer from Fiona Cicconi. Fiona left at the end of 2020 to undertake a similar role at an iconic technology company and I want to thank her for her leadership in making us a great place to work.\n\nOur performance in 2020 marked a signi/ficant step forward for AstraZeneca. We delivered double-digit revenue growth to leverage improved pro/fitability and cash generation. The consistent achievements in the pipeline, accelerating performance of our business and the success of the COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated what we can achieve. The proposed acquisition of Alexion is intended to accelerate our commercial and scienti/fic evolution even further.\n\nThanks to the focus on an industry-leading pipeline and consistent execution, I am con/fident that we will deliver more progress for patients and sustained, compelling results.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPascal Soriot\n\nChief Executive Officer",

By 2050, the number of people aged 60 and above is expected to reach 2.1 billion; and 80% will be living in developing regions.\n\nAs the number of older people grows faster than the number of people in all younger age groups, so does the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).\n\n## Increasing burden of chronic disease\n\nWhile communicable diseases continue to pose a threat, especially in emerging markets, chronic and NCDs are increasing with the impact of urban lifestyle choices, including smoking, diet and a lack of exercise.\n\nDisability caused by NCDs, rather than early death, has become an increasingly large share of the global disease burden.\n\n## Digital and technical breakthroughs\n\nData management in healthcare is moving beyond storing data, to focusing on extracting insights on population health management and value-based care to improve health outcomes and personalised healthcare.\n\nInnovations in technology are allowing people to monitor their own health and become active participants in managing their healthcare. For example, Internet of Things (IoT) applications and technologies are in/fluencing patient engagement strategies and improving patient interactions with healthcare systems.\n\n## The impact of COVID-19 on a changing world\n\nCOVID-19 has highlighted challenges and accelerated change within the healthcare sector. It has left people living with NCDs more vulnerable and highlighted the need for health systems to better respond to those diseases. It has also accelerated the adoption of digital and social tools as HCPs sought virtual channels to continue patient engagement.\n\nAdditionally, the pandemic has encouraged the development and use of localised supply chains, particularly around medical supplies and pharmaceuticals.\n\n## 54%\n\nApproximately 54% of people worldwide now live in cities, up from 30% in 1950\n\n(Source: UN and Grayline Group)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNCDs kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally\n\n41m\n\n(Source: IQVIA)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n70% of patients in US, EU, and Asia deferred or cancelled scheduled treatment early in the global pandemic\n\n## 70%\n\n(Source: Accenture)\n\n## Estimated world population (UN, bn)\n\n|   2100 |   11.2 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2050 |    9.7 |\n|   2030 |    8.5 |\n|   2020 |    7.8 |\n\n## Disabilities caused by NCDs (as % of the total disease burden)\n\n|   2019 |   34 |\n|--------|------|\n|   1990 |   21 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe digital health market is expected to increase nearly six times in size by 2026 to nearly $640 billion\n\n## $640bn\n\n(Source: Global Market Insights)\n\n## Patients treated via telehealth\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Opportunities and challenges for the sector\n\nIn addition to global trends, the pharmaceutical sector faces a number of opportunities and challenges, as set out below. The strategy section of this Annual Report includes an overview of how we are responding to this environment.\n\n## Innovation\n\nScienti/fic innovation is critical to addressing unmet medical need but enhancing R&D productivity is a constant challenge for the sector.\n\nR&D models are therefore changing in an effort to be more productive. For example, scienti/fic and technological breakthroughs in the next generation of therapeutics have the potential to help accelerate innovation and are leading to new treatment options. Such advances include new scienti/fic modalities, such as ProTACs, in vivo biologics and cell therapy; new technologies, such as OMICs; and new biology, such as the microbiome. These have already resulted in signi/ficant numbers of FDA Priority Reviews and Breakthrough Therapy Designations.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nPublic expectation of safe, effective and high-quality medicines is re/flected in a highly regulated biopharmaceutical industry. Increased health authority scrutiny and requirements for more testing and documentation may prolong the approval process for new medicines. However, government policies and regulations have been implemented by health authorities to stimulate innovation in drug development and accelerate patient access to transformative medicines. Facilitated review pathways relying on reference agency assessments have been introduced by regulatory authorities in many developing countries to expedite patient access to medicines. Continued advances in the harmonisation of international regulatory requirements will contribute to faster access to new medicines for patients and promote public health.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated health authority consideration and implementation of innovative approaches that may transform drug development in the future. These approaches include: decentralised trials; digital health technology applications in the conduct of clinical trials to facilitate remote patient monitoring and eConsent; the use of real-world data/evidence in regulatory decision making; risk-based oversight of manufacturing facilities; expedited review and approval pathways; remote data and site monitoring; remote audits and inspections; and heightened collaboration between global health authorities.\n\nThere are uncertainties and challenges, including how the UK will work with the EU regulatory system following the UK's exit from the EU in 2020 and the approach the UK will take to establish its own regulatory system outside the EU. Additionally, the relocation of the EMA from London to Amsterdam has created some disruption and delay to regulatory processes. China continues to evolve its regulatory requirements at a rapid pace, impacting drug development for that country and globally.\n\nInnovation can also be accelerated through the use of large volumes of data from disease biology and genomics, which is driving precision medicine, while advances in data management and integration can improve the speed and quality of clinical trials. Additionally, a better understanding of disease biology can assist the delivery of new medicines and new approaches to health, including improved methods of prevention.\n\nThe release of the EU Health Strategy in November 2020 is the /first step of an initiative to build a 'European Health Union'. This strategy will form the basis of the new pharmaceutical legislative framework targeted for 2023 that will de/fine how the EU pharmaceutical industry will be regulated. In addition, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation which is intended to create a favourable environment for conducting clinical trials while maintaining high standards for patient safety, is expected to be implemented by the end of 2021.\n\nIdenti/fication of Medicinal Products (IDMP) international standards, intended to uniquely identify medical products to facilitate public safety through the exchange of information in the context of pharmacovigilance and supply chain traceability, are under consideration by global health authorities. EMA regulations require adoption of IDMP standards, presenting a signi/ficant challenge to industry as the requirements are complex.\n\nThe regulatory requirements for biosimilar medicines are better de/fined, but signi/ficant regulatory policies are still evolving, including transparency of data regarding the level of evidence to support approval of biosimilarity labelling claims, standards for interchangeability and pharmaceutical substitution, and traceability of pharmacovigilance reports through naming conventions that permit differentiation of medicines.\n\nIncreased transparency of data used for regulatory decisions in the EU and Canada requires public disclosure of patient-level data, signi/ficantly increasing regulatory burdens to ensure privacy laws are met during disclosure. Increased transparency policies continue to be evaluated by regulatory authorities globally.\n\n- For more information, see Our Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand Key Performance Indicators from page 18.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\nAccelerate Innovative Science\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Risk from page 254.\n\n' Continued  advances in the harmonisation of international regulatory requirements will contribute to faster access to new medicines for patients and promote public health.'\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccelerate Innovative Science\n\nFor more information, see Risk from page 254.

        "page_content": "## Healthcare in a Changing World continued\n\n## Pricing of medicines\n\nThere is continuing downward pressure on pricing and reimbursement in many markets, including the US and China. We continue to see examples where healthcare services (including pharmaceuticals) are highly regulated by governments, insurers and other private payers through various controls on pricing and reimbursement. Implementation of costcontainment reforms and shifting market dynamics are further constraining healthcare providers, while dif/ficult economic conditions burden patients who have out-of-pocket expenses relating to their medicines. Pharmaceutical companies are now expending signi/ficant resources to demonstrate the economic as well as the therapeutic value of their medicines.\n\nThe need and desire for payers to manage healthcare expenditure has been heightened by the shift over the last decade from a primary care to a specialty care focus. Specialty medicines are used for the treatment of complex, chronic or rare conditions, such as cancers, and pricing for these products re/flects the higher value they bring to patients and payers, as well as the smaller patient numbers as a result of targeted treatment options.\n\nPricing controls and transparency measures remain a priority in key markets such as China, where the National Reimbursement Drug List was updated in December. According to the Chinese National Healthcare Security Administration, 119 medicines will be added to the NRDL from March 2021 with an average price reduction of 50%.\n\n## Loss of exclusivity and genericisation\n\nPatent protection for pharmaceutical products is /finite and after protection expires, payers, physicians and patients gain greater access to generic alternatives (both substitutable and analogue) in many important drug classes. These generic alternatives are primarily lower priced because generic manufacturers are largely spared the costs of R&D and market development. As a result, demand for generics is high. For prescriptions dispensed in the US in 2020, generics constituted 85.3% of the market by volume (2019: 84.8%).\n\nGeneric competition can also result from patent disputes or challenges before patent expiry. Increasingly, generics companies are launching products 'at risk', for example, before resolution of the relevant patent litigation. This trend, which is likely to continue, creates signi/ficant market presence for the generic version while the litigation remains unresolved. Given the unpredictable nature of patent litigation, some companies have settled such challenges on terms acceptable to the innovator and generic manufacturer.\n\nBiologics typically retain exclusivity for longer than traditional small molecule pharmaceuticals, with less generic competition.\n\nAlso in China, value-based procurement (VBP), was expanded in 2019, placing downward pressure on the pricing of medicines and products that have lost exclusivity in the VBP.\n\nIn Europe, governments continue to implement and expand price control measures for medicines, and the EU has committed to introducing a harmonised health technology assessment (HTA) review. In other markets, there has been a trend towards rigorous and consistent application of pricing regulations, including reference pricing and group/alliance purchasing.\n\nThere is also pressure on pricing in the US. For example, federal and state policymakers are considering legislative and regulatory efforts to lower drug prices and to implement transparency measures. President Biden has conceptually supported proposals aimed at prescription drug pricing that include allowing the government's Medicare programme to negotiate costs, limiting launch prices through the use of international reference pricing and other tools, encouraging importation and limiting price increases beyond in/flation. The Democrat majority in Congress increases the potential for drug pricing legislation and executive authorities could also become a vehicle for policies. This environment could create further downward pressure on pricing.\n\n' Pharmaceutical companies are now expending significant resources to demonstrate the economic as well as the therapeutic value of their medicines.'\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership\n\nFor more information, see Risk from page 254.\n\n## 85.3%\n\nFor prescriptions dispensed in the US in 2020, generics constituted 85.3% of the market by volume (2019: 84.8%)\n\nLink to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership\n\n- For more information, see Intellectual property from page 65.",

        "page_content": "## Trust\n\nOrganisations are no longer valued or trusted solely on the quality of products and services, and /financial performance. It also depends on their engagement with employees, customers, communities and society as a whole, as well as the way in which they address sustainability issues, such as the environment or human rights. Therefore, to be trusted, companies need to address both how their operations are impacted by these issues and how their operations impact stakeholders. For example, the shift in focus of healthcare systems to prevention and early intervention, as well as treatment, presents an opportunity for the sector to enter into health management. But if it is to do so successfully, healthcare professionals and patients need to trust that the industry has their best interests at heart.\n\nHistorically, the pharmaceutical industry has faced challenges in building and maintaining its reputation and the trust of its stakeholders. This was as a result of improper sales and marketing practices by some companies and related inquiries and investigations carried out by government and regulatory authorities in connection with, for example, the selling of opioid pain relievers and improper pricing practices, including price gouging.\n\nThe industry's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the quick mobilisation of resources to develop a vaccine appears to have contributed to a slight increase in public trust. To build on this, the sector will need to commit to affordable access, be transparent, and measure outcomes in trials that have real-world implications.\n\n## Reshaping of the sector\n\nThe pharmaceutical market is highly competitive and, while our peers face similar challenges and opportunities, they approach them in different ways. Some companies have pursued a strategy focused on branded prescription pharmaceuticals. Others have diversi/fied by acquiring or building branded generics businesses or consumer portfolios, or have looked to geographic expansion, especially in Emerging Markets. Companies are also focused on improving R&D productivity and operational ef/ficiency. Across the industry, mergers and acquisitions, business development deals (including licensing and collaborations) and competition for business development opportunities have continued.\n\nCompanies are also adopting more 'patient-centric' approaches that encompass all aspects of disease management - prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. In particular, the speed of technological change is rapidly transforming current business models. Existing and new entrants to the industry, for example from the technology sector, are focusing on patient outcomes rather than just products and services, and prediction and prevention rather than just diagnosis and treatment. They are driving innovative thinking around how to\n\nThere is also increasing recognition and concern about healthcare disparities by race, region, and socioeconomic status, in particular, the growing prevalence of NCDs and the human symptoms of climate change. An emphasis on public health, screening and early intervention that is designed with the engagement of civil society, patient organisations and government is critical.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to recognise that by exacerbating social, economic and demographic inequalities, climate change is further undermining progress on public health.\n\nTo address these challenges, companies are seeking to operate in a way that meets stakeholders' expectations by, for example:\n\n- > embedding a culture of ethics and integrity\n- > adopting higher governance standards\n- > setting ambitious sustainability targets\n- > partnering across sectors\n- > improving relationships with employees, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nimprove health through technology and how to improve patient satisfaction through a heightened focus on user experience. Patients are becoming more engaged and willing to take greater control of their own health. These non-traditional companies are applying their years of experience in environments where products change all the time to the healthcare industry. New entrants have a great opportunity to improve healthcare and partner with researchers and manufacturers to more effectively develop and commercialise treatments. This may also entail new ways of competing.\n\nIf new approaches such as outcomes-based pricing are to be successful, companies will need to develop systems that capture outcomes data linked to the use of their medicines. The sustainability and growth of a more patient-centric pharmaceutical industry is predicated on organisations being able to take full advantage of these breakthroughs in digital and other technologies.\n\nMore generally, to be successful, companies will need to be able to respond to the pressures and demands made on them by patients and caregivers, health authorities, payers, policymakers and others.\n\n' Organisations are no longer valued or trusted solely on the quality of products and services, and financial performance.'\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBe a Great Place to Work\n\nFor more information, see Ethics and transparency from page 73.\n\n- ' ...the speed of technological change is rapidly transforming current business models.'\n\n## Link to strategy\n\nGlobal, science-led, patient-focused pharmaceutical company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Risk from page 254.",

Accelerate Innovative Science\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2.   Deliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership\n\n## 1. Accelerate Innovative Science\n\n## 1a. Advancing our scientific knowledge to extend the possible\n\n2020 was another exceptional year for our science, with our pipeline producing overwhelmingly positive news for patients. This included 53 regulatory events, either submissions or approvals for our medicines in major markets. That performance is backed by a healthy pipeline of high potential medicines, with a record number of 36 pipeline progression events, either NME Phase II starts or Phase III investment decisions, indicating our ability to deliver longer-term sustainable growth.\n\n## Development pipeline\n\nDuring 2020, we delivered clinical trial data and submissions that resulted in 29 approvals for new medicines in the US, EU, China and Japan. As shown in the table opposite, our pipeline includes 171 projects, of which 145 are in the clinical phase of development. We are making signi/ficant progress in advancing our late-stage programmes through regulatory approval with 24 NME or major life-cycle management (LCM) regulatory submissions in the US, EU, China and Japan during 2020. At the end of the year, we had 10 NME projects in pivotal trials or under regulatory review (covering 16 indications), compared with eight at the end of 2019.\n\nAlso in 2020, 18 NMEs progressed to their next phase of development and 22 projects were discontinued: 12 for poorer than anticipated safety and ef/ficacy results and 10 as a result of a strategic shift in the environment or portfolio prioritisation.\n\n## Accelerating our pipeline\n\nWe are prioritising our investment in speci/fic programmes, focusing on scienti/fic innovation. As a result, we had numerous positive trial readouts in 2020 including the presentation of scienti/fic rationale that resulted in 14 Regulatory Designations for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3.  Be a Great Place to Work\n\nBreakthrough Therapy, Priority Review or Fast Track for new medicines which offer the potential to address unmet medical need in certain diseases. We also secured Orphan Drug Designation for the development of six medicines to treat very rare diseases.\n\n- For more information, see Therapy Area Review from page 30 and Research & Development from page 53.\n\n## 1b. Harnessing data and technology to accelerate change\n\nAs outlined in Information technology and information services resources on page 66, a programme of digital transformation is helping deliver our strategic priorities. During 2020, we leveraged our capabilities and technologies to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19 and maintain care for patients. This included building integrated, remote care solutions that helped release capacity in hospitals by providing services such as home delivery of medicines, self-administration and telemedicine consultation. Internally, we deployed MS Teams to more than 77,000 employees and contract workers within eight days.\n\nFor healthcare practitioners (HCPs), we ensured continued day-to-day engagement by rolling out a number of technologies to more than 15,000 employees across 71 countries in less than two weeks. We did not fully replace our traditional face-to-face interactions, but identi/fied what approach added most value. We also arranged webcasts for HCPs to share knowledge and clinical insights from experts in treating COVID-19.\n\nMany of our commercial launches and congresses moved to digital. For example, Imfinzi in China was the /first medicine ever to be launched virtually, engaging nearly 6,000 HCPs.",

Leading in science and healthcare to create value and growth\n\nProduct Sales grew by 10% (11% at CER) to $25,890 million. This total included $2 million of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca Product Sales. Growth was driven primarily by the performance of new medicines across Oncology and BioPharmaceuticals, including Tagrisso and Farxiga .\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 included reduced sales of Pulmicort in China on lower nebulisation-centre visits and reduced elective surgery, and less use globally of infused and injectable medicines, such as Imfinzi and Fasenra . A decline in the number of hospitalisations for the treatment of heart attacks adversely impacted sales of Brilinta . Some medicines, however, may bene/fit from shifts in patient care and behaviours, including oral medicines such as Calquence .\n\nAdditional investment in new medicines continued to fuel our growing Oncology and BioPharmaceuticals therapy areas. Tagrisso 's future was enhanced with its /first regulatory approval in early, potentially-curative lung cancer and further national reimbursement in China in advanced disease.

In the US, Product Sales increased by 12% and in Europe by 16% (15% at CER). Japan sales increased 2% (1% at CER).\n\nA strong performance in China was limited by the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on sales of Pulmicort and the pricing effect of the China volume-based procurement programme on Brilinta , Losec and Arimidex .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Financial Review from page 82.\n\n## 2b. Recognising patients as people first and putting them at the heart of what we do\n\nThe healthcare landscape is evolving rapidly and we are working to make an impact across the entire healthcare system and better address current and future patient needs. We understand that putting patients /first, or patient centricity, makes a real difference to the lives of people living with various diseases. In committing to patient centricity, we listen to their experiences and embed their insights to innovate and strengthen the way we work. By working across AstraZeneca, from R&D to commercial development, and with external partners in the broader healthcare environment, we believe we can deliver the healthcare experience and outcomes that people care about most so that they can enjoy ful/filling lives.\n\nOur work with and for patients recognises the entire patient network - caregiver, family, friends, co-workers, HCPs and others - as partners. We use their diverse experiences, values and expertise to better understand needs at all points during the patient journey - from prevention and awareness, diagnosis, treatment and post- treatment to wellness.\n\nWe swiftly adapted the way we work to address the challenges caused or exacerbated by COVID-19 in order to meet the needs of diverse patients and patient communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on how our patient-centric approach drove our response to the pandemic, see COVID-19 pandemic on page 28.",

Enabling our people to make a difference\n\nIn 2020 we made progress across the three pillars of our People Strategy. To ensure we continue to perform as an enterprise team, we removed performance ratings and shifted our focus to coaching, development and contribution. We saw a four percentage point increase in our employee survey question addressing effective collaboration between teams. To support our employees' lifelong learning, we made a substantial investment in a global online learning platform providing on-demand access to a comprehensive library of educational resources.\n\n## Performance indicators\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribution to the enterprise\n\nThis priority is built on three pillars: performing as an enterprise team, commitment to lifelong learning and development, and championing of inclusion and diversity.\n\n- For more information, see People from page 68.\n\n## Contribution to society - Leading in sustainability\n\nThe Leading in sustainability performance indicators measure the progress of our environmental, social and governance practices. They are representative indicators of each of the three priorities for our sustainability approach - to broaden access to healthcare, to protect the environment, and to foster ethics and transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Sustainability from page 72.\n\nWe have updated our Values to clearly re/flect our commitment to inclusion and diversity, developed a comprehensive plan to ensure that the actions we take to address racial equity are meaningful and sustainable, with long-term impact, and saw signi/ficant progress in the representation of women in senior roles.\n\nWe are committed to supporting our employees through the personal challenges presented by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and were encouraged that 91% of employees stated they are getting the support they need during this time.\n\n## 3b.

        "page_content": "## Performance in 2020\n\n## continued\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nAstraZeneca's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was consistent with our Values of following the science, putting patients first and doing the right thing.\n\n## Our priorities\n\nOur priorities were driven by the needs of patients, caregivers and communities. To respond effectively, we partnered with governments, international organisations, HCPs, industry and non-pro/fit organisations. Our response had the following objectives:\n\n- > Help ensure the safety of patients and their continued access to care and medicines.\n- > Protect critical operations to ensure the continued supply of our medicines to patients who need them.\n- > Ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees.\n- > Contribute to the process of scienti/fic innovation to combat the virus.\n- > Contribute more broadly to society, including emergency relief.\n\n## Patient safety and continuity of care\n\nIn addition to healthcare systems, signi/ficant support for patients, their caregivers and communities comes from the charitable and non-pro/fit sector. Yet more than 90% of these organisations were negatively impacted in 2020 and one quarter expected to close down within the next 12 months if the situation did not change. Therefore, in addition to our longstanding support, in 2020 we pledged to maintain our support to these groups, including additional /financial commitments to dozens of patient advocacy groups and professional societies across the globe to prioritise continuity of care during the pandemic.\n\nIn addition, we helped medical professionals, which included being lead donor of the COVID Impacts Cancer Initiative - an emergency initiative that was launched by the American Society of Clinical Oncology to establish a registry for its members to share data on how the pandemic impacted cancer care and patient outcomes. It also provided patients and providers with information and resources on cancer and its relationship with COVID-19.\n\nThe pandemic will have longer-lasting implications for healthcare systems. Hence, in November, we launched our Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience with the World Economic Forum and the London School of Economics. Working with academia, local governments and other institutions around the world, the partnership will work to identify practical solutions to strengthen the resilience and sustainability of healthcare systems.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we continued to progress our pipeline and, fuelled by digital technologies, we closely monitored our clinical trials, adapting and responding on a study-by-study basis to maintain continuity wherever possible. We redesigned trials to protect patients and avoid disruption by increasing the use of initiatives like homebased treatments and remote monitoring.\n\n## Continued supply of medicines\n\nThe pandemic placed challenges on global supply chains, in particular for the highly integrated pharmaceutical sector. We monitored the situation closely, working with national authorities and agencies, activating business continuity plans and managing inventory to ensure manufacturing and supply continuity. We also monitored logistics channels to safeguard the ef/ficient /flow of medicines and maintained our quality standards. This enabled us to continue to deliver our medicines during the pandemic and respond effectively to the growth in global demand for some medicines. There were no meaningful disruptions to the supply of our medicines during the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Operations from page 62.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing of employees\n\nWe are committed to providing safe working environments for our employees and suppliers. Throughout the pandemic, our employees adapted to new ways of working and a secure digital platform was rolled out to more than 77,000 employees and contract workers in eight days so that most, including some laboratory staff, could work from home. In locations where employees were able to return to of/fices, and at our sites where manufacturing staff and critical frontline workers remained in our workplaces, additional health and safety measures were put in place, including temperature screenings, physical distancing and mandatory mask-wearing.\n\nAt key sites, we launched internal PCR and antibody assessments and we carried out more than 50,000. We provided support and guidance to employees with suspected or con/firmed COVID-19 and performed contact tracings among our site-based employees whenever a colleague tested positive. We also launched toolkits for employees and leaders, including advice on working effectively from home while maintaining wellbeing.\n\nTo ease the challenges for employees of having their children at home, in May we launched 'MyClassroom' in the UK, a programme of virtual classroom sessions. In addition, we assisted our key workers, who work at manufacturing sites, laboratories, and distribution centres, or who directly support our sites, in /finding places at nurseries and with registered childminders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see People from page 68.\n\n## Research and development\n\nIn 2020, our R&D teams focused on researching new ways to tackle the virus. This included initiating new clinical trials to investigate our new and existing medicines to see how they might protect organs from damage or suppress the body's overactive immune response and turn off the cytokine storm in severely ill patients. We used our scienti/fic expertise in infectious disease and proprietary antibody discovery technology to identify novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies as a potential preventative or treatment approach to COVID-19 disease. A clinical candidate, AZD7442, was selected in just 99 days. It is now in Phase III clinical trials.\n\nAs a longer-term preventative approach, in April 2020, we concluded an agreement with the University of Oxford for the global development, production and supply of their potential vaccine for COVID-19, now known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca . We committed to doing this at no pro/fit during the pandemic and to providing the broad and equitable supply of billions of doses.\n\nTo date, up to 60,000 participants have been recruited into clinical trials and, following publication of high-level results in The Lancet , COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca received its /first approval for emergency use in the UK on 30 December 2020. It now has conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use approval in more than 50 countries. We are working with our supply partners to optimise the manufacturing process and ensure that the vaccine is produced at the scale and pace required while retaining the highest quality standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see R&D and Other Medicines and COVID-19 from pages 53 and 47.\n\n## Contribution to society\n\nAs mentioned above, charities struggled to keep their programmes going in 2020. In March, we therefore reaf/firmed our commitment to the non-pro/fit organisations we support around the world, allowing them to divert grants towards pandemic-related activities, delay projects and defer reporting. In all, we provided more than $15 million in COVID-19 donations to patient advocacy groups, health charities and relief agencies, supporting 340 non-pro/fit organisations in 78 countries.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, and faced with a critical shortage of protective medical equipment, we donated emergency supplies and resources to support health systems around the world. We donated nine million face masks to 49 countries, collaborating with the World Economic Forum's COVID Action Platform, created with the support of the WHO, to identify countries in greatest need and with Direct Relief to distribute across the US, with a focus on medically unserved communities. We also donated surgical gloves, monitors, medicines and other medical supplies.",

We also provided disaster relief funds to Direct Relief, Americares and Project Hope and pre-positioned medicines with Direct Relief to expedite relief work.\n\nMore broadly, we shared our employee toolkits externally for other organisations to use and repurpose. By January 2021, they had been downloaded more than 6,000 times.\n\nWe updated our Global Volunteering Policy, extending the amount of leave for medically trained employees, and encouraged volunteering more generally to relieve exhausted health systems and support communities. In 2020, 894 employees volunteered 17,397 hours.\n\nFor more information, see Community investment from page 78.\n\n## Impact on the business\n\nAstraZeneca faced a number of challenges arising from the pandemic. These included:\n\n- > Reduced levels of patient screenings, diagnoses, testing and elective procedures.\n- > Less face-to-face engagement with HCPs for commercial /field sales teams.\n- > Additional costs and procedures related to COVID-19, such as facilities cleaning, face masks and COVID-19 assessments.\n- > An increase in Distribution Expense.\n- > An impact on initiation, ongoing recruitment and follow-up in some clinical trials, primarily in the early stage.\n\nCOVID-19 has had a direct impact on some of our medicines, including reduced sales of Pulmicort in China on fewer nebulisationcentre visits and reduced elective surgery, and less use globally of infused and injectable medicines, such as Imfinzi and Fasenra . Other medicines, however, may bene/fit from shifts in patient care and behaviours, including oral medicines such as Calquence .\n\nOther impacts include savings on expenses and travel with, for example, a one-third reduction in business miles driven and a reduction in greenhouse gases from /flying of more than 80%.\n\nWe believe it remains prudent to assume that additional delays will arise as a consequence of the pandemic. However, despite a delayed global recovery, we believe AstraZeneca is well-placed to manage these challenges. The unprecedented environment has also provided multiple opportunities to explore more ef/ficient ways of working, which have the potential to provide long-term bene/fits to patients and to the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe project drew on AstraZeneca and GSK's drug discovery and technology expertise, as well as the University's interdisciplinary research capabilities. Volunteers from all three organisations and our technical partners set up the facility in record time at the University's Anne McLaren building.\n\nThey installed innovative robotics and automation, implemented an entire supply chain and ensured that the testing facility was both resilient and efficient.\n\nWe also improved the testing process by combining molecular biology expertise with automation, building capacity to process thousands of samples per day.",

We also continued to invest in new medicines through collaborations and acquisitions.\n\nFull details are given in the Development Pipeline from page 245, and for highlights from the progress our Oncology pipeline made in 2020 against our KPIs, see opposite.\n\n## 2020 review - strategy in action\n\nWe are striving to make cure a reality for the millions of people across the world living with cancer every day. Our focus is on some of the most hostile and hard-to-treat cancers including breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, certain blood cancers and gastrointestinal cancers. By understanding the complexities of these cancer types, we can truly achieve life-changing bene/fits for patients.\n\n2020 saw strong continued growth, underpinned by the performance of our new oncology medicines and our established products while our pioneering late-stage pipeline dominated news /flow in each of our four strategic tumour types.\n\n## Lung cancer\n\nAstraZeneca is committed to transforming the treatment of lung cancer with a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action.\n\nOur strategy in lung cancer focuses on detecting and treating patients as early as possible, revolutionising care to give patients the best chance of cure. We also continue to advance research in metastatic disease, bringing new solutions to patients that meaningfully extend survival in advanced\n\nAlong with the entire healthcare community, we faced extremely challenging circumstances, but also unique opportunities to evolve in ways that will have a positive, lasting impact. We moved quickly to launch a range of strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, embracing our responsibility to ensure continuity of care for our current patients, while maintaining our momentum around screening and early diagnosis. For example:\n\n- > 80% of late-stage Oncology clinical trials continued with minimal delays or disruptions.\n- > We partnered with global patient coalitions to launch New Normal, Same Cancer , a programme to raise awareness regarding the impact of COVID-19 and call for patients to contact their doctor and return to cancer care services.\n- > In Brazil, we worked with our collaborator to introduce at-home testing for cancers with EGFR mutations, which has been replicated in other countries.\n- > In Russia, retrospective lung cancer screening allowed COVID-19 scans to be analysed using AI to determine if signs of lung cancer were present.\n\n## 80%\n\nof late-stage Oncology clinical trials continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our response to COVID-19, see COVID-19 pandemic from page 28.\n\nlung cancer settings using precision medicine and combination approaches.\n\nIn 2020, Tagrisso remained our top-selling medicine, as we continued its global rollout for 1st-line advanced EGFRm NSCLC and secured the /first global approval in the adjuvant setting in the US in December 2020, based on the unprecedented disease-free survival bene/fit demonstrated in the ADAURA Phase III trial.\n\nTagrisso also continues to be investigated in the Stage III, unresectable setting (LAURA), in the neoadjuvant resectable setting (NeoADAURA), in combination with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (FLAURA2), and in combination with potential new medicines to address resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (SAVANNAH, ORCHARD).\n\nImfinzi continued its strong commercial performance in 2020, supported by new approvals in 51 countries in the extensivestage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) setting including the US, Japan and the EU, and accelerating growth in the Stage III NSCLC setting in markets outside the US. Imfinzi is also being tested in the limited-stage SCLC setting following concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) (ADRIATIC).",

        "page_content": "## Therapy Area Review Oncology continued\n\nImfinzi is the current global standard of care for the treatment of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC based on the PACIFIC trial, and we remain focused on bringing Imfinzi to other early lung cancer settings where cure is possible. In 2020, Imfinzi continued to demonstrate unprecedented overall survival in Stage III NSCLC with an estimated 50% of patients surviving four years compared to 36% for placebo after CRT in updated data from the PACIFIC trial.\n\nWe recognise that, for some, cancer has become a secondary priority to the COVID-19 pandemic. Imfinzi was approved for a new four-week, /fixed-dose regimen in Stage III NSCLC and advanced bladder cancer in the US, and was approved in January 2021 in this dosing for Stage III NSCLC patients in the EU. The new dosing regimen helps simplify and improve treatment by enabling continuity of care while minimising the risk of exposure to infection in the healthcare setting.\n\nIn May 2020, we received US Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Enhertu in HER2mutant metastatic NSCLC. In the interim results of the DESTINY-Lung01 Phase II trial, Enhertu demonstrated meaningful clinical activity for patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC, with a con/firmed objective response rate of 61.9%. Additionally, an interim analysis presented in January 2021 at the World Conference on Lung Cancer showed preliminary evidence of anti-tumour activity for Enhertu in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic NSCLC as well.\n\nIn July 2020, we entered a new global development and commercialisation agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for datopotamab deruxtecan, Daiichi Sankyo's TROP2-directed ADC for the potential treatment of multiple tumour types, including lung cancer. In December 2020, we announced two new trials exploring the potential of this ADC: the pivotal Phase III TROPION-Lung01 trial versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC without actionable genomic alterations, and the Phase II TROPION-Lung05 trial in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with actionable genomic alterations previously treated with a kinase inhibitor and platinum chemotherapy.\n\nSavolitinib, a selective inhibitor of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET) receptor tyrosine kinase, is being investigated with Hutchison China MediTech Limited (Chi-Med), both as a monotherapy and in combination, and is showing promising signs of clinical ef/ficacy in patients with MET gene alterations in lung cancer and gastric cancer. It also showed promise in the TATTON Phase Ib expansion cohort when combined with Tagrisso in patients with EGFRm MET-ampli/fied NSCLC; this combination has been taken into a large Phase II trial, SAVANNAH, which is ongoing.\n\n## Breast cancer\n\nBy continuing to understand the complexities of breast cancer and directly addressing patients' greatest unmet medical needs, we hope to rede/fine breast cancer care.\n\nFollowing approval of Enhertu in the US in December 2019, we are continuing to work with regulators in other markets to expand its availability for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In March 2020, Enhertu was approved in Japan. We have also submitted an application for approval in the EU, for which we received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in December 2020. We also continue to expand the access to Lynparza for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in more than 67 countries.\n\nOther agents in development for breast cancer include: camizestrant (AZ9833), a next-generation oral selective oestrogen receptor degrader (SERD), which recently entered into Phase III development for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer, and capivasertib (AZD5363), an AKT (also known as Protein kinase B) inhibitor, in Phase III development for advanced or metastatic TNBC or hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. Datopotamab deruxtecan is also in development for TNBC in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo.\n\n## Ovarian cancer\n\nWe are committed to changing the way advanced ovarian cancer is treated in the 1st-line setting. Our focus in ovarian cancer is centred on Lynparza , which is our /first and best-in-class oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. We have a global collaboration with MSD to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza .\n\nThe positive results from the Phase III PAOLA-1 trial showed Lynparza as 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab demonstrated a substantial progression free survival (PFS) bene/fit for patients with homologous recombination de/ficiency (HRD)-positive advanced ovarian cancer. One in two women with advanced ovarian cancer has an HRD-positive tumour and represents a broader patient group than in the SOLO-1 trial, which had already demonstrated the signi/ficant bene/fit of extending PFS much earlier. The goal of 1st-line treatment is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible, with the intent of achieving complete remission or cure, and these data have the potential to change clinical practice in how women with advanced ovarian cancer are treated.\n\nLynparza is being evaluated in combination with adavosertib (AZD1775), our WEE1 inhibitor, in recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers. Adavosertib is also being evaluated as monotherapy in the Phase II ADAGIO trial in uterine serous carcinoma.\n\n## Blood cancers\n\nLeveraging our strength in solid tumours, we have established haematology as one of four key oncology disease areas of focus. Our approach to tackling the diversity and complexity of blood cancers is to identify highly promising mechanisms in our pipeline and align them with the greatest unmet medical need.\n\nCalquence is our irreversible oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, now approved in over 50 markets. In November 2020, the European Commission approved Calquence for adult patients with CLL. The approval was based on positive results from the interim analyses of two Phase III clinical trials. The ASCEND trial compared Calquence with rituximab combined with idelalisib or bendamustine in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The ELEVATE-TN trial evaluated the safety and ef/ficacy of Calquence , alone or in combination with obinutuzumab, compared with chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated CLL. Together, the trials showed that Calquence , in combination with obinutuzumab, or as a monotherapy, signi/ficantly reduced the relative risk of disease progression or death versus the comparator arms in both 1st-line and relapsed or refractory CLL.\n\nPositive data from the ACE-CL-003 trial demonstrated that Calquence , in combination with venetoclax and either obinutuzumab or rituximab, in CLL patients resulted in high complete response and undetectable minimal residual disease after a median follow-up of 23.2 months with a tolerable safety pro/file.\n\nWe also made progress in our haematology early-phase clinical programme, with MEDI2228, an investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted ADC being explored for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nThe blood cancer pipeline also includes ceralasertib (AZD6738), an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor being investigated in combination with Calquence in CLL, and in combination with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. AZD2811 an aurora kinase B inhibitor is in development as monotherapy in Phase II in acute myeloid leukaemia.",

        "page_content": "## Prostate cancer\n\nWe are pushing the boundaries of science, aiming to provide precision medicines matched to the patients who can bene/fit most from them.\n\nIn 2020, Lynparza became the /first and only PARP inhibitor to improve overall survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer.\n\nBased on /final results from the PROfound Phase III trial of Lynparza in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), it has been approved in the US for men with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC and in the EU and Japan for patients with BRCAm mCRPC.\n\nThe potential bene/fits of Lynparza in mCRPC will continue to be tested in the Phase III PROpel trial that will assess the combination of Lynparza with abiraterone in 1st-line mCRPC.\n\nCapivasertib (AKT inhibitor) is being evaluated in combination with abiraterone in the Phase III CAPItello-281 trial for metastatic hormonesensitive prostate cancer and PTEN de/ficiency.\n\n## Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary cancers\n\nWe have a number of ongoing trials testing our medicines in gastrointestinal cancers, notably in gastric and bladder cancers rare but life-threatening diseases. In 2020, we announced results from two key trials - DESTINY-Gastric01 and DANUBE.\n\nThe positive results from the DESTINYGastric01 Phase II trial of Enhertu versus chemotherapy was the /first time that a HER2-directed medicine showed an improvement in survival for previously treated HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer patients. Based on these results and the signi/ficant unmet clinical needs of these patients, we achieved several regulatory milestones, including US BTD, US Orphan Drug Designation (ODD), US Priority Review and approval in Japan. Additional trials are ongoing and planned for Enhertu in gastric cancer as well as colorectal cancer.\n\nResults from the Phase III DANUBE trial showed Imfinzi , alone and in combination with tremelimumab, versus standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy in the 1st-line treatment of patients with unresectable, Stage IV bladder cancer, failed to meet either of its primary endpoints of overall survival. Secondary analyses suggested that this combination has clinical activity, which is enhanced in patients with tumours that have high PD-L1 expression.\n\nWe continue to test Imfinzi extensively in bladder cancer and in other gastrointestinal (GI) cancer settings. Data from the Study 22 Phase II trial presented in May, showed Imfinzi plus tremelimumab demonstrated promising clinical activity and tolerability in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This combination was granted ODD in the US for HCC. In addition, tremelimumab was granted orphan designation for HCC in the EU, and Imfinzi was granted ODD in the US for biliary tract cancer.\n\n## Head and neck cancer\n\nIn February 2021, the KESTREL Phase III trial did not meet the primary endpoint of improving overall survival for patients treated with Imfinzi versus the EXTREME treatment regimen, a standard of care, in the 1st-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whose tumours expressed high levels of PD-L1. Also, the combination of Imfinzi plus tremelimumab did not indicate an overall survival bene/fit in 'all-comer' patients, a secondary endpoint.\n\n## Paediatric cancers\n\nHistorically, attention and research are not directed to paediatric cancers, even though they may be fatal and there is signi/ficant unmet medical need. In 2020, Koselugo became the /first and only medicine approved in the US for the treatment of paediatric patients two years of age and older with neuro/fibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable PN. NF1 is a rare and debilitating genetic condition. Some 30-50% of patients with NF1 experience PN - tumours growing inside their nerve sheaths. The approval was based on results from the Phase II SPRINT Stratum 1 trial coordinated by the National Cancer Institute Centre for Cancer Research, Paediatric Oncology Branch.\n\nKoselugo , which is part of a collaboration with MSD, is also being investigated in a Phase III trial for the treatment of adult patients with NF1 symptomatic and/or progressive, inoperable PN.\n\n## Our robust pipeline across cancers\n\nWe follow the science, without fear of failure, wherever it takes us, in pursuit of the best medicines. It is through this relentless quest for innovation that we have created one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry; encompassing molecules and modalities designed to kill cancer cells preferentially, at every stage of the disease.\n\nOur pipeline continues to expand and progress across cancers, including:\n\n- > AZD7648, a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor which could be an innovative new way to target alternative DDR dependencies.\n- > Ceralasertib (AZD6738), an ATR serine/ threonine protein kinase inhibitor is being evaluated in Phase I/II trials in solid tumours and haematological malignancies as monotherapy and in combination with other targeted therapies, including Lynparza in TNBC.\n- > AZD1390, a blood-brain barrier penetrant inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia, mutated (ATM) is in Phase I for brain tumours.\n- > AZD2811, an aurora kinase B inhibitor in development as monotherapy in Phase II for SCLC.\n- > MEDI2228, a BCMA-directed ADC being investigated in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.\n- > MEDI5752, a novel bispeci/fic antibody designed to target PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints on immune cells, is being studied in a range of solid tumours.\n- > MEDI0457, a human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, currently being tested in combination with Imfinzi in HPV-positive HNSCC.\n- > Monalizumab, our /first-in-class humanised anti-NKG2A antibody, is being investigated in HNSCC, colorectal cancer and haematological malignancies. Monalizumab is being tested in the INTERLINK-1 Phase III trial in HSNCC in combination with cetuximab.\n- > AZD5153, a bromodomain-4 inhibitor in Phase I for solid tumours.\n- > In our cell death portfolio, AZD5991 (MCL1 inhibitor) and AZD4573 (CDK9 inhibitor), are being investigated in haematological malignancies.\n\n## Established portfolio\n\nIn 2020, our established Oncology brands Faslodex , Zoladex and Iressa - performed well, with growth in Zoladex and moderate sales decreases of Faslodex and Iressa .\n\nFaslodex showed a slower decline than expected, largely led by growth in combination use with CDK4/6 inhibitors and slower generic competition in the EU. Decline in the second half of the year was primarily driven by generic competition in the US.\n\nIressa sales continued to decline due to generic entries in select markets, the uptake of Tagrisso in 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC, and the pricing impact on Iressa from centralised procurement in China.\n\nZoladex double-digit growth was based on increased access to medical castration and ovarian suppression, as well as earlier detection and diagnosis in prostate and breast cancers, predominantly in China and Emerging Markets.",

Our efforts are built on global randomised clinical trials that are as close as possible to clinical practice and real-world evidence (RWE) research. These help us gather vital insights into patient needs and clinical practice, and develop treatments that meet the requirements of both patients and HCPs.\n\nOur ambition is as follows:\n\n- > Cardiovascular: to reverse atherosclerosis to halt morbidity and prolong life.\n- > Heart failure (HF): to eliminate HF as the /first cause of hospitalisations, and cure HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).\n- > Renal: to eliminate dialysis.\n- > Metabolism: to eliminate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as a cause of liver failure and cure diabetes.\n\nWith our existing medicines and those in late-stage development, we are already delivering life-changing results in the four CVRM disease areas and their complications:\n\n- > Cardiovascular: Brilinta\n- > Heart failure: Farxiga , Lokelma\n- > Renal: Lokelma , Evrenzo (roxadustat ), Farxiga\n- > Metabolism: Brilinta , Farxiga , Bydureon .\n\nWe additionally have a pipeline of more than 25 therapies and therapy combinations and believe we have a comprehensive portfolio of potential medicines that might combat these life-threatening conditions.\n\nBeyond our research, we also invest in strategic partnerships to better educate stakeholders about these diseases and improve patient access to healthcare worldwide.\n\n(34% at CER)",

The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has updated the Forxiga label to include data that demonstrate a statistically signi/ficant reduction in the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) or cardiovascular (CV) death, versus placebo, in adults with type-2 diabetes and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors.\n\nNASH prevalence is growing and is a major public health burden. We are looking at how we can accelerate and broaden our portfolio in NASH. Our GLP-1 glucagon dual peptide, cotadutide, was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for NASH and we continue to progress our novel precision medicine programme with AZD2693, an antisense oligonucleotide.\n\n## Heart failure\n\nAs part of our efforts to prevent, treat and cure HF as a leading cause of death, we are developing treatments that include earlier intervention across interconnected conditions such as type-2 diabetes. As indicated above, the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial provided evidence of Farxiga 's effectiveness in the prevention of HF, and in cardio-renal protection. Meanwhile the landmark Phase III DAPA-HF trial, showed that Farxiga reduced the risk of CV death and the rate of hospitalisation from HF in patients with HFrEF with and without type-2 diabetes. The FDA, EMA, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, and China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved Farxiga for the treatment of HFrEF patients with and without type-2 diabetes and it is under review in several other regions.\n\nDuring the period, the Group obtained results from the DETERMINE-preserved and DETERMINE-reduced function and symptom trials, evaluating Farxiga as a treatment for HFpEF and HFrEF, respectively. These trials had the same primary endpoints. In the DETERMINE-reduced trial, Farxiga demonstrated a statistically signi/ficant reduction in HF symptoms, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)-Total Symptom Score, versus placebo. This trial did not, however, show a change from baseline in the distance walked in six minutes, and the KCCQ-Physical Limitation Score. The DETERMINE HFpEF trial did not meet any of the three aforementioned endpoints. No new safety concerns were identi/fied.\n\nOur extensive clinical programme includes several more Phase III trials for the potential cardio-renal bene/fits of Farxiga , DAPA-CKD, and DELIVER. These will explore its effectiveness in addressing areas of high unmet medical need in HF and CKD. The large randomised DELIVER Phase III trial, evaluating Farxiga in HFpEF, is expected to read out in the second half of 2021.\n\nHF patients are often prescribed life-saving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), which lead to elevated potassium levels. These patients have an increased risk of developing hyperkalaemia, which can be life threatening if left untreated. Lokelma is a treatment for hyperkalaemia which was launched in the US and EU in 2019. Data from the Phase II PRIORITIZE-HF trial, designed to evaluate the bene/fits and risks of using Lokelma to initiate and intensify RAASi therapy in HF patients, is anticipated in 2021.\n\nWe continue to explore opportunities in HFpEF, including investigation of AZD4831 (MPO), and initiation of a Phase II trial with verinurad (currently also being investigated for CKD). We also have a Farxiga combination with AZD9977, a mineralocorticoid receptor modulator, moving into Phase II in heart failure. This is one of the /first of several Farxiga combinations moving into mid-stage development across CVRM indications with the aim of extending the life cycle of Farxiga .\n\nWe are also rapidly progressing our research efforts in the /fields of stem cell and cellular regeneration of tissues with the potential to treat life-threatening cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure.\n\n## Cardiovascular disease\n\nIn working towards our objective of eliminating CV residual risk and stopping disease progression, we believe we are already making a difference in patients with CAD, including those who are at high risk of experiencing a /first heart attack or stroke, with the approval of the expanded indication in the US, based on the THEMIS trial.\n\nStrokes remain a signi/ficant cause of mortality and disability, and a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be a warning of a future stroke - these individuals are at a high risk of a subsequent CV event. Detailed results from the Phase III THALES trial, as published in The New England Journal of Medicine , showed Brilinta , taken with aspirin for 30 days, reduced the rate of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death by 17% (ARR, 1.1%; HR 0.83 95% CI 0.71, 0.96, p=0.02), compared to aspirin alone in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke or TIA. The FDA approved Brilinta for the reduction of subsequent stroke in patients who experienced an acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA.\n\nOur development strategy is focused on targeting the drivers of in/flammation and dyslipidaemia in order to improve blood /flow to vital organs. AZD8233, our PCSK9 inhibitor, focuses on preventing long- and short-term tissue damage by tackling LDL cholesterol. Raised LDL cholesterol is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths worldwide each year. Whilst PCSK9 is a well-validated target for lowering LDL cholesterol it has been a hugely challenging target to inhibit with small molecules. We entered into an agreement with Dogma Therapeutics to develop the /first potential small molecule, orally bioavailable PCSK9 inhibitor, for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWe are also exploring MEDI6570 (LOX1), that prevents tissue damage following a cardiovascular event, and addressing macro- and microvascular dysfunction resulting from the widespread systemic in/flammation of major and minor blood vessels.",

        "page_content": "## Renal diseases\n\nCKD is a progressive disease that can eventually lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), with the potential for dialysis and serious life-threatening complications. To help transform the lives of more patients, we are investigating the potential of roxadustat, Lokelma and Farxiga to manage these complications and reduce disease progression.\n\nIn August 2020, we presented detailed results from the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD Phase III trial showing that Farxiga on top of standard of care reduced the composite measure of worsening of renal function or risk of CV or renal death compared to placebo in patients with CKD Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion. The results were consistent in patients both with and without type-2 diabetes. The trial also met all secondary endpoints, including signi/ficantly reducing death from any cause compared to placebo.\n\nRoxadustat is an oral hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor that has the potential to transform the lives of people living with anaemia of CKD, both on dialysis and not on dialysis.\n\nRoxadustat is currently approved in China and Japan under the name Evrenzo for the treatment of anaemia in CKD in non-dialysis dependent (NDD) and dialysis-dependent adult patients.\n\nPeople living with CKD are at an increased risk of developing hyperkalaemia. Lokelma , a highly selective, oral potassium-removing agent, was approved for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in Japan in March 2020, and received label updates in the US, EU and China to include patients with hyperkalaemia on chronic and stable haemodialysis in April, May and November 2020, respectively.\n\nIn order to help address the unmet medical need in CKD, we are exploring the clinical science behind our medicines with DELIGHT, an exploratory Phase II/III trial, also part of the DapaCare programme. The trial evaluates the potential albuminuria-lowering effect of Farxiga in the treatment of CKD and type-2 diabetes.\n\nOur vision for the future is to stop progression of ESKD. We accelerated MEDI3506 into Phase II for diabetic kidney disease and AZD5718 (FLAP) for CKD, and continue to investigate new molecules such as MEDI8367 and AZD2373. AZD2373 targets the mRNA for APOL1 and has shown encouraging results in preclinical models. Several variants of the APOL1 gene evolved in sub-Saharan West Africa providing protection from Trypanosoma infections, but people carrying two copies of these variants have an increased risk for\n\ndeveloping CKD. APOL1 knockdown through ASOs is being explored with the aim of being a precision medicine in CKD and, if successful, would provide a novel treatment option for patients with APOL1-mediated CKD.\n\nOur GLP-1 glucagon dual peptide, cotadutide, has started Phase II trials, also in diabetic kidney disease. We have a Farxiga combination moving into Phase II for CKD indications with a selective endothelin A antagonist, zibotentan, otherwise known as AZD4054.\n\nWe are now using AI and large data sets to identify novel targets, and as part of our collaboration with BenevolentAI, we identi/fied our /first novel AI-generated CKD target.\n\n## Beyond research\n\nWe have made a long-term investment to improve CVRM patient care through a multi-disciplinary programme called Accelerate Change Together (ACT).\n\nACT on HF aims to improve the lives of HF patients by reducing HF hospitalisations by half and improving /five-year survival rates by 20% by 2024. The initiative seeks to elevate HF as a healthcare priority, increase diagnosis rates and improve management of patients. In partnership with the World Heart Federation (WHF), we are raising awareness of HF and the need to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HF. Through our support for WHF's /flagship global public health platform, World Heart Day, we are also raising awareness of all causes of cardiovascular disease and championing heart health for everyone.\n\nACT on CKD seeks to transform kidney health and reduce the number of patients developing kidney failure by 20% by 2025. We aim to achieve this by raising awareness of kidney disease, expand early diagnosis and transform management of CKD. In partnership with the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) we intend to raise awareness of CKD and enhance education on the importance of early diagnosis among the general public, patients, healthcare professionals and policymakers worldwide.\n\nThe ACT programmes are already running in over 40 countries.\n\nWe have also entered into strategic collaborations with healthcare innovators to further explore our understanding of CVRM diseases, with the aim of harnessing data, new technologies and digital health to transform the lives of patients and clinical practice.\n\nIn March, we entered into a multi-target collaboration with Silence Therapeutics to discover, develop and commercialise small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular, renal, metabolic and respiratory diseases. The collaboration will harness Silence's established mRNAi GOLD\u2122 (GalNAc Oligonucleotide Discovery) Platform, bringing an exciting new modality into our drug discovery toolbox.\n\nIn August 2020, we announced our collaboration with two distinct digital health innovators, Eko Health and Us2.ai, in order to leverage the use of digital health solutions to facilitate the management of HF to more patients. The collaborations aim to drive practice-changing solutions for HF screening, diagnosis and management through the use of arti/ficial intelligence (AI) and technology to enable earlier and more accurate prediction of HF risk and CV complications.\n\nIn the same month, we entered into a collaboration with RenalytixAI to develop and launch precision medicine strategies for CVRM diseases. Together, we will use an AI-enabled in vitro diagnostic platform to help identify previously hidden high-risk patient groups and accelerate patient identi/fication and recruitment for clinical trials. The /first stage of the collaboration is now under way.\n\nWe are continuing our collaboration with the NHS through Imperial College Health Partners (London, UK) who are leading Discover-NOW, the Health Data Research Hub for real world evidence (RWE). Together, we are exploring the potential of RWE, with new tools and technologies to transform clinical care pathways, resulting in better management and prevention of various long-term conditions such as type-2 diabetes and HF. This programme has huge potential to revolutionise how we are partnering with health systems and academic bodies to deliver the right care to the right patients at the right time.\n\nWe also invest in programmes to improve patient access to healthcare. Some of our most notable programmes include Healthy Heart, which addresses hypertension and the increasing burden of CV disease (see page 74 for more information); and One Brave Idea, which aims to understand the molecular events surrounding the earliest transition from wellness to disease in coronary heart disease.",

Our portfolio addresses the different drivers of this complex, heterogeneous disease. Fasenra is a mAb approved in 59 countries indicated in patients with severe,\n\neosinophilic disease. It binds directly to and near-complete depletion of eosinophils\n\nIL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid via apoptosis (programmed cell death).

In its pivotal Phase III trial, tezepelumab, compared to placebo, signi/ficantly reduced the exacerbation rate in a broad population of severe asthma patients who are underserved by currently available biologic treatments.\n\n- > Our early portfolio is positioned to help more patients with uncontrolled disease by tackling alternative pathways not covered by current therapies and developing small molecules and new inhaled modalities with greater ease of use with the potential to enable greater access for patients. MEDI3506 (anti-IL-33 mAb) and AZD0449 (inhaled-JAK inhibitor) are two highly differentiated and promising early-stage medicines.",

Our early COPD research looks beyond in/flammation with assets such as MEDI3506.\n\n## 2020 pipeline highlights\n\n## Life-cycle phases - R&D\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| New molecular entity (NME)  Phase II starts/progressions           | Product                                                                                                                                           | Disease                                                                                                                                           | Disease                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | None                                                                                                                                              | Disease  -

In immunology, our understanding of the imbalanced immune system in chronic lung diseases is being applied to immune-mediated in/flammatory diseases that share key common pathways. Our ambition in immunology is to achieve disease control and ultimately clinical remission in targeted disease areas where the unmet medical need remains high.\n\nIn our mid- to late-stage portfolio, we are advancing /five franchises with multi-disease potential across three key main pathways in epithelial damage, eosinophilia and type 1 interferon. Our potential multi-disease franchises in immunology include Fasenra , which is targeting seven diseases beyond respiratory disease, tezepelumab, MEDI3506, anifrolumab and brazikumab (an anti-IL-23), recently brought back to AstraZeneca and currently being developed for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\nThe progress we are making in immunology complements our announcement to acquire Alexion (subject to regulatory clearances and approval by shareholders of both companies) and accelerate our ambition to become a leader in immunology in areas with high unmet medical need.\n\n## Respiratory infectious diseases\n\nWe have signi/ficant heritage in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), having developed and launched Synagis , used for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by RSV in high-risk infants. See Infection on page 49 for more information.\n\nSynagis is the current standard of care for high-risk infants and we are building on its ef/ficacy by advancing nirsevimab, an extended half-life RSV mAb. It is being developed as a passive immunisation with the potential to provide immunity directly and offer immediate protection against RSV for a broader group of infants. Nirsevimab is being developed in conjunction with our collaborator Sano/fi. See below for more information.",

Our early research in respiratory includes opportunities in idiopathic pulmonary /fibrosis (IPF) and chronic cough. Regulatory submissions were also made in the US, EU and Japan for anifrolumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nFull details of our pipeline are given in the Development Pipeline from page 245 and highlights from the progress of our Respiratory & Immunology pipeline made in 2020 against our KPIs are shown on previous page.\n\n## 2020 review - strategy in action Asthma\n\nIn 2020, we continued our leadership in transforming care across disease severities to address the signi/ficant unmet medical needs of this disease. The majority of patients are uncontrolled and there are 176 million asthma attacks each year.\n\nAt the foundation of asthma care, Symbicort continued its volume and value market leadership as the number one ICS/LABA combination globally 20 years after launch. The main drivers of growth were in Emerging Markets, particularly in China, launch of an authorised generic in the US, repeat prescribing in the /first quarter due to COVID-19 and approvals of the antiin/flammatory reliever indication, which has now been achieved in 35 countries.\n\nThe epithelium is the first line of defence for our body; interactions between the airway epithelium and viruses, allergy or pollution can result in the release of epithelial cytokines, driving inflammation. We are pioneering research on the role of three epithelial cytokines: thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin IL-33, and IL-25. These key cytokines activate multiple downstream innate and adaptive immune responses involved in asthma, COPD, atopic dermatitis and chronic kidney disease. AstraZeneca is bringing forward tezepelumab, a potential first-in-class human mAb that inhibits the action of TSLP, and which has completed its Phase III pivotal trial in severe asthma and MEDI3506, a mAb that inhibits IL-33 and which is in Phase I in COPD, Phase II in asthma, Phase II in atopic dermatitis and COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur second anti-in/flammatory reliever, which we are developing for US patients is PT027, a /fixed-dose combination of budesonide (an ICS) and albuterol, a short-acting beta2agonist (SABA). Results from two Phase III trials in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, conducted by our co-development collaborator, Avillion, are expected to read out in 2021.\n\nBreztri , our triple therapy, is also being studied in asthma and the Phase III pivotal trials, KALOS was initiated in January 2021.\n\nIn severe asthma, where our aim is to eliminate both asthma attacks and chronic use of oral corticosteroids, we are on track to be the leader in biologic medicines and address the different drivers of this complex, heterogeneous disease. Our /first respiratory biologic, Fasenra , reached more than 70,000 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, retaining its position as the leading novel biologic in new-to-brand prescriptions in key markets around the world. The rapid adoption of the Fasenra Pen in several markets was in part driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping patients out of hospital and able to manage their treatment at home. Approximately 40% of patients now self-administer Fasenra . A signi/ficant increase in enrolment in our patient support programme, Connect 360, was seen in 2020 further supporting self-care in response to COVID-19. More than 30,000 patients across 29 countries have enrolled in this programme.\n\nIn October 2020, we announced high-level results from the PONENTE Phase IIIb open-label trial, which showed OCSdependent asthma patients across baseline blood eosinophil counts receiving Fasenra were able to eliminate the use of maintenance OCS. On the /first primary endpoint, 62% (95%\n\nCI: 58.2-66.1) of patients achieved complete elimination of daily OCS use. On the second primary endpoint, 81% (95% CI: 77.2-83.7) of patients achieved complete elimination or were able to reduce their daily OCS dose to 5mg or less when further reduction was not possible due to adrenal insuf/ficiency. Both primary endpoints were sustained for at least four weeks while maintaining asthma control.\n\nIn November 2020, we announced with our collaborator Amgen the positive high-level results from the NAVIGATOR Phase III registrational trial which met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to standard of care (SoC) demonstrating a statistically signi/ficant and clinically meaningful reduction in the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks in the overall patient population, compared to placebo when added to SoC. SoC was medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS.\n\nIn the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microlitre, the trial also met the primary endpoint, with tezepelumab demonstrating a statistically signi/ficant and clinically meaningful reduction in AAER. Similar reductions in AAER were observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 150 cells per microlitre.\n\nIn December 2020, we announced that the SOURCE Phase III trial of 150 patients did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically signi/ficant reduction in the daily OCS dose, without loss of asthma control, with tezepelumab compared to placebo in patients with severe, OCS-dependent asthma.

Full results from the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.\n\n## Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps\n\nFasenra is also in development for other respiratory diseases driven by eosinophils. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is characterised by persistent in/flammation of the nasal passages and sinuses accompanied by benign growths called nasal polyps, which can block nasal passages and lead to breathing problems, reduction in the sense of smell, nasal discharge, sleep disturbance and other adverse effects on quality of life. High-level results from the OSTRO Phase III trial showed that Fasenra compared with placebo met both co-primary endpoints by demonstrating a statistically signi/ficant improvement in the size of nasal polyps and in nasal blockage in patients with CRSwNP.\n\n## COPD\n\nThe focus with our triple combination therapy, Breztri , is on treating the underlying in/flammation of the disease and reducing COPD exacerbations, which are often under-reported and undertreated, despite causing irreversible lung damage and disease progression. Evidence supporting the bene/fits of triple therapy is driving the growth of its class, and we expect it to be the largest class of medicines in COPD in the future.\n\nIn 2020, we achieved approval for Breztri in the US and EU and launched Breztri in China and the US. We have delivered strong launches, speci/fically in China with Breztri , signi/ficantly outperforming competition and capturing the majority of market share. In the US, Breztri has performed better than the competitor's launch. In December 2020, Breztri was included in China's NRDL which will further support growth.\n\nIn June 2020, The New England Journal of Medicine published results from the Phase III ETHOS trial which demonstrated a statistically signi/ficant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with two different types of dual-combination therapies ( Bevespi and PT009 - an ICS/LABA combination). As an additional analysis in a key secondary endpoint, Breztri showed a 49% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality compared with Bevespi (unadjusted p=0.0035*). The trial also demonstrated bene/fit in a second dose of our /fixed triple-combination therapy: at half of the budesonide dose, (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate 160/14.4/9.6mcg), a dose that is not licensed for use.\n\nIn May 2020, it was announced that Circassia would hand back marketing rights for dual-combination therapy Duaklir and monotherapy Tudorza to AstraZeneca.\n\n- * Re: unadjusted p-value: The p-value is considered unadjusted, due to an endpoint in the Type I error control testing hierarchy not reaching significance.\n\n## Immunology\n\nWe made signi/ficant advances in immunedriven diseases.\n\nSLE is the most common type of lupus and a debilitating, chronic immune-driven disease. Only one new medicine has been approved for SLE in the last 60 years, and there is an urgent medical need to bring new medicines to patients. Patients often rely on prolonged use of OCS, which can increase the risk of permanent organ damage and other poor health outcomes. Anifrolumab is a developmental mAb that inhibits the activity of type I interferons and suppresses the activation of B and T cells that contribute to the cycle of tissue destruction and in/flammation seen in SLE.\n\nIn the second half of 2020, we received regulatory submission acceptances for anifrolumab from the FDA, EMA and PDMA Japan for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe SLE. Our submissions were based on results from the two TULIP Phase III trials and the MUSE Phase II trial, in which a reduction in disease activity and OCS use, and improvement in lupus skin activity were observed with anifrolumab added to standard therapy compared to placebo and standard therapy. Anifrolumab has a wellcharacterised safety pro/file, based on the safety and tolerability /findings across all three trials.\n\nAt the European League Against Rheumatism annual conference, we presented pooled analysis from the TULIP trials showing the consistent clinical bene/fits of anifrolumab across multiple measured patient subgroups, including age, sex, age at onset and race, compared to placebo. At the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting, we presented pooled analysis that showed 40% of patients treated with anifrolumab plus standard therapy had a sustained reduction in OCS use without experiencing a disease /flare through 52 weeks versus placebo plus standard therapy (17.3%).\n\nEosinophils are white blood cells and part of the immune system that, when working normally, help /fight disease and infection. Having too many activated eosinophils may contribute to disease pathology and the self-perpetuating cycle of in/flammation and damage across a range of debilitating diseases. Fasenra is being investigated in seven Phase II and Phase III trials in eosinophil-driven diseases beyond the three respiratory diseases of severe asthma, COPD and CRSwNP. First subjects have been dosed in trials for atopic dermatitis,\n\nchronic spontaneous urticaria, eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome. We have also initiated Phase III trials in bullous pemphigoid and eosinophilic gastritis/ eosinophilic gastroenteritis.\n\nWe recovered the global rights to brazikumab (formerly MEDI2070), mAb targeting IL-23, from Allergan. Brazikumab is a mAb that binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and is in development for CD and UC alongside development of a companion diagnostic. Brazikumab selectively blocks the IL-23 immune signal, reducing intestinal in/flammation. With current biologic medicines, 40% to 55% of patients have no response to therapy, and 65% to 80% of patients do not experience a full remission. Brazikumab is currently in a Phase IIb/III programme in CD and a Phase II trial in UC, and we will work to bring this potential new treatment option to patients as quickly as possible.\n\n## Respiratory infectious diseases\n\nIn July, The New England Journal of Medicine published the Phase IIb trial in which nirsevimab showed a signi/ficant reduction in medically-attended LRTI and hospitalisations caused by RSV in healthy preterm infants compared with placebo. Nirsevimab has a more ef/ficient dosing regimen than Synagis (which requires monthly injections for /five months to cover a typical RSV season) and demonstrated for the /first time that a single-dose mAb can signi/ficantly reduce medically-attended RSV LRTI, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in infants throughout the full RSV season, compared with placebo.\n\n## Early science\n\nCompounds in early-stage development include: MEDI3506 (Phase I in COPD and Phase II in asthma; Phase II in atopic dermatitis and COVID-19), a mAb that inhibits IL-33, a key upstream epithelial cytokine that is functionally distinct from TSLP; AZD0449 (Phase I), a potential /first-in-class inhaled JAK-inhibitor being developed for a broad population of asthma patients, intended as a step-through therapy between ICS therapy and biologics.\n\nIn our early research and development, we are also advancing the science of other chronic respiratory diseases with great unmet medical need, including IPF and chronic cough. In August 2020, we announced a licensing agreement with Redx Pharma for RXC006 an oral small molecule, preclinical porcupine inhibitor. We will move RXC006 into clinical development targeting /fibrotic diseases including IPF, a chronic, progressive, irreversible and usually fatal interstitial lung disease for which there are limited treatment options available. The porcupine inhibitor targets multiple disease drivers which may offer a competitive advantage over other investigative treatments for IPF.",

FluMist Quadrivalent/ Fluenz Tetra continues to be licensed in multiple markets, including the US, Canada, EU, Israel and Hong Kong, and it remains a central part of the UK and Finnish paediatric national in/fluenza vaccination programmes.\n\nFor the 2020-21 /flu season, AstraZeneca will deliver its highest volume of /flu vaccine supply to date, re/flecting our ongoing, longstanding commitment to global public health and /flu prevention. Speci/fically, we have increased the volume of available vaccine doses globally by more than 150 percent over the previous year due to higher demand and statements from global health authorities urging increased /flu vaccination for the 2020-21 season due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This includes more than eight million doses delivered to support the childhood vaccinations through the UK's national immunisation programme during the 2019-20 season. In addition, we participate in both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine for Children programme and Vaccine for Adult programme, which are federally funded programmes that ensure under or uninsured children and adults have access to vaccines at little or no cost. We also have an ongoing agreement with the WHO to donate and supply stock at reduced prices in the event of an in/fluenza pandemic.\n\nIn June 2020, Public Health England published provisional end of season vaccine effectiveness (VE) data for the 2019-20 season in the UK. In children two to 17 years old, adjusted VE with Fluenz was 45.4% against all circulating strains and 30.5% against circulating A/H3N2 strains. VE data against the A/H1N1pdm09 strain was not available due to low strain circulation during the season. These latest data support the real-world effectiveness demonstrated by Fluenz Tetra and reinforce the public health importance of in/fluenza vaccination as the most effective way to prevent in/fluenza disease.\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common seasonal virus and the most prevalent cause of LRTI among infants and young children. Since its initial approval in 1998, Synagis has become the global standard of care for RSV prevention and helps protect at-risk babies against RSV. Measures to combat COVID-19, including national and local lockdowns and stay at home orders, have likely led to signi/ficantly lower rates of RSV transmission, creating decreased demand and impacting sales for preventative options like Synagis . These COVID-19 impacts varied across markets.\n\n## Neuroscience\n\nWe are progressing MEDI7352, a bispeci/fic molecule which targets both nerve growth factor and tumour necrosis factor alpha, in both painful diabetic neuropathy in Phase II and osteoarthritis pain in Phase IIb. Also in Phase I is MEDI0618, an anti-PAR2 (proteaseactivated receptor 2) antibody which we are also developing for osteoarthritis pain and migraine and AZD4041, a selective orexin 1 receptor antagonist, which is being developed for substance use disorder in a collaborative effort between AstraZeneca, Eolas Therapeutics and NIH.\n\nWe continue our collaboration with Takeda on MEDI1341 for Parkinson's disease, which is in Phase I.\n\nWe have a collaboration with Lilly on MEDI1814, an antibody selective for amyloidbeta 1-42 that is currently in Phase I as a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe commercial rights to the sale and distribution of Synagis in more than 80 countries outside the US, held by AbbVie since 1997, will revert to AstraZeneca upon the expiry of the current agreement on 30 June 2021. In general, the Group will solely distribute and promote the medicine outside the US from 1 July 2021. The agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, for the rights to Synagis in the US, was unaffected by this decision.",

Both parties shared a commitment to delivering it in a broad, equitable and timely way, and at no pro/fit during the pandemic.\n\n## Technology\n\nThe vaccine was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech, and is a nonreplicating, recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine containing the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the virus if it later infects the body. The adenoviral vector vaccine is infected into 'producer' cells derived from a human cell line created more than 50 years ago, which rapidly divides, making copies of the potential vaccine and producing large amounts of the viral vector vaccine. After cell manufacture, the vaccine product is /filtered and puri/fied and undergoes a number of quality checks before the '/fill and /finish' stage where the vaccine is packaged into multi-dose vials.\n\n## Clinical development programme\n\nThe programme of global clinical development for COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (AZD1222) is under way to measure ef/ficacy, safety and immune response in up to 60,000 participants across a broad age range and diverse racial, ethnic and geographic groups.\n\nPhase II/III trials are ongoing in the UK, US and Brazil, and Phase I/II trials are underway in South Africa, Japan and Kenya.\n\nRegulators have clear and stringent ef/ficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine, including any potential COVID-19 vaccine. To progress the assessment of promising vaccines such as AZD1222 more /flexibly, rolling reviews of data were implemented by many regulatory authorities such the European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and Anvisa in Brazil. We are also seeking Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization (WHO) for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries.\n\n## Published clinical data\n\nThe primary analysis of the Phase III clinical trials led by the University of Oxford with AZD1222 in the UK, Brazil and South Africa was announced on 3 February 2021. It con/firmed that COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is safe and effective at preventing COVID-19 and that it protects against severe disease, hospitalisation and death.\n\nThe primary analysis for ef/ficacy was based on 17,177 participants. Results demonstrated vaccine ef/ficacy of 76% three weeks after the /first dose, with protection maintained to the second dose. With an inter-dose interval of 12 weeks or more, vaccine ef/ficacy increased to 82%.\n\nData continues to accumulate, including the upcoming /final analysis and further follow-up, re/fining the ef/ficacy reading and characterising vaccine ef/ficacy over a longer period of time.\n\n## Authorisation and supply\n\nThe /first authorisation for the vaccine occurred on 30 December 2020, when the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) authorised COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca for emergency supply in the UK for the active immunisation of individuals 18 years or older. The vaccine received conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) in the European Union on 29 January, 2021. By February 2021, the vaccine had been granted a CMA or emergency use approval in more than 50 countries spanning four continents, including Brazil, India, and South Africa, for the active immunisation of adults.\n\nWe are continuing to work with governments and regulatory bodies to bring the vaccine to more people across the world as quickly as possible.\n\nIn February 2021, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca for use in individuals 18 years of age and older, with a preferred dosing interval of eight to 12 weeks.\n\nWe are committed to supplying the vaccine at no pro/fit during the pandemic and we will make it available to low-income countries at no pro/fit in perpetuity. So far, we have built supply capacity for billions doses with agreements spanning more than 180 countries and multiple parallel supply chains across the world. Global manufacturing capacity is in place to begin mass supply on regulatory approval.\n\nThe pace and complexity of development has brought some challenges, including initially lower-than-expected yields at some manufacturing sites. We continue to work urgently with our supply partners to optimise this process to ensure the vaccine is produced at the scale and pace required while retaining the highest quality standards.",

        "page_content": "As part of our equitable access strategy, AstraZeneca concluded an Advance Purchase Agreement with Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, to supply 170 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca to the COVAX Facility for countries around the world. Combined with committed supply of the vaccine from our licensing partner, the Serum Institute of India, this represents hundreds of millions of doses to COVAX.\n\nSupply of the vaccine is facilitated by the fact that it can be stored at 2-8\u00baC, enabling easy use within existing healthcare settings such as care homes and pharmacies, and in low-income countries.\n\n## AZD7442 (potential LAAB combination)\n\nIn addition to our work on a potential vaccine, we are researching potential preventative and treatment options. This includes the development of a combination of two novel coronavirus-neutralising long-acting antibodies (LAABs), AZD7442, which is being studied as a potential preventative option for people exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected with the virus.\n\nThe two LAABs in AZD7442 were derived from convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020, AstraZeneca optimised the antibodies with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding. The half-life extended LAABs should afford six to 12 months of protection from COVID-19 and the reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease - a phenomenon in which virus-speci/fic antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.\n\nIn a Nature publication, the LAABs were shown in pre-clinical experiments to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.\n\nSeveral Phase III clinical trials of AZD7442 in more than 6,000 participants at sites in and outside the US are under way and additional trials are planned. PROVENT began in November and is evaluating the safety and ef/ficacy of AZD7442 to prevent infection for up to six months in approximately 5,000 participants. STORM CHASER started in December to evaluate postexposure prophylaxis in approximately 1,100 participants. We are also evaluating AZD7442 in a late-stage trials for the treatment of COVID-19, including the Phase III TACKLE trial in non-hospitalised patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and the National Institutes of Health-sponsored ACTIV-3 trial in hospitalised patients.\n\nWe have received support of around $486 million from the US Government for the development and supply of AZD7442 under an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).\n\n## Other new and existing medicines\n\nAs well as developing preventative approaches against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in 2020 we initiated clinical trials to investigate AstraZeneca's new and existing medicines to treat the infection by suppressing the body's overactive immune response or protecting from serious complications, such as organ failure.\n\nFor example, we assessed Calquence (acalabrutinib), approved in a number of countries for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in the suppression of the cytokine storm that in/flames the lungs and other organs of some COVID-19 patients. The CALAVI Phase II trials for Calquence in patients hospitalised with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 did not meet the primary ef/ficacy endpoint of increasing the proportion of patients who remained alive and free of respiratory failure.\n\nIn the DARE-19 Phase III trial, we are assessing whether Farxiga could potentially reduce organ failure. Farxiga is being evaluated in combination with ambrisentan in the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust's TACTIC-E Phase II trial.\n\nWe also joined the UK Government's ACCORD proof-of-concept clinical-trial platform, to speed the development of medicines for patients with COVID-19, evaluating the use of IL-33 mAb MEDI3506 in suppressing the overactive immune response that can characterise COVID-19. We are also supplying Pulmicort and Symbicort to externally sponsored research programmes.\n\n## In the longer term\n\nFrom the /first quarter 2021, AstraZeneca intends to report the performance of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca separately.\n\n## Our products\n\nWhile this Therapy Area Review concentrates on our key marketed products, many of our other products are crucial to our business in certain countries in Emerging Markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our potential new products and product life-cycle developments, see the Therapy Area pipeline tables on pages 32, 38, 44 and 48 and the Development Pipeline table from page 245.

By accelerating key elements of our clinical and digital innovation programmes, more than 80% of our clinical trials continued. Maintaining and improving the experience of patients was a particular priority.\n\nOur uni/fied approach across our R&D organisations in 2020 was guided by our 5R (right target, right patient, right tissue, right safety, right commercial potential) framework which champions quality over quantity. This focus on quality is exempli/fied by our research publications in 'high-quality' and 'high-impact' journals, a critical aspect for accelerating innovative science, and recruiting and retaining the best people. In 2020, our scientists published 123 manuscripts in 'high-impact' peer-reviewed journals, each with an impact factor exceeding 15 (Thomson Reuters 5yr IF score). The increase from the (revised) number of 111 in 2019, continues to re/flect the drive to share our science, which also resulted in 890 publications in total, increasing from 870 in 2019.\n\nIn order to advance our scienti/fic knowledge we are committed to investing in and embedding four key areas, which will help us in our aspiration to create the greatest and swiftest impact on disease. More information on these areas is provided below and in the case studies in this Annual Report, see pages 11, 23, 56 and 67.\n\n## Enhancing our understanding of disease\n\nWe are determined to advance our understanding of disease biology to uncover novel drivers for the diseases we aim to treat, prevent and, in the future, even cure. Selecting the right target remains the most important decision we make in the drug discovery process and we are investing in multiple approaches to improve this.\n\nOur Centre for Genomics Research (CGR) is aligning genetic variants with clinical, biomarker and other disease-associated characteristics or phenotypes to provide new disease insights. One recent study using a cloud-based platform analysed more than three billion datasets within 24 hours and identi/fied more than 8,700 disease associations within 330 distinct genes. This type of analysis has provided new disease understanding and resulted in the selection of new targets into our Respiratory & Immunology (R&I) discovery portfolio for idiopathic pulmonary /fibrosis (IPF).\n\nTo support the validation of novel targets, we continue to build complex models of disease. For example, we are working to improve CRISPR gene editing accuracy and speci/ficity, and develop an inducible CRISPR system for rapid and sustainable creation of cellular and animal disease models. We are pairing these approaches with bioinformatics and arti/ficial intelligence to analyse the data generated from screening to help improve target identi/fication.\n\nWe are also progressing our understanding of epigenomics and the potential of modulating epigenetic processes to deliver the next generation of cancer therapies. Many haematological and paediatric cancers are driven through epigenetic aberrations and we are focused on a next generation of epigenetic cancer therapeutics.\n\n## Designing the next generation of therapeutics\n\nIn our quest to transform disease, we are continuing to design new ways to target the drivers of disease and create the next generation of therapeutics. At the end of 2020, 30% of our early pipeline consisted of new drug modalities including oligonucleotide, antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and cell therapy approaches.\n\nFollowing our 2019 collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo to develop and commercialise the ADC, now known as Enhertu , our commitment to these next-generation therapeutics continued with our 2020 collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo to develop and commercialise DS-1062, a potential best-in-class, second generation TROP2-targeted ADC. For more information, see Business development on page 63.\n\nOur growing oligonucleotide platforms offer a range of new opportunities through the speci/fic inhibition of protein expression. Antisense oligonucleotide approaches include AZD2373, developed in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, which aims to reduce podocyte injury, decrease proteinuria and slow renal function decline in patients with APOL1 nephropathy. The oligonucleotide platform was supplemented in 2020 with a collaboration with Silence Therapeutics, which aims to discover, develop and commercialise small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics.\n\nWe formed cross-functional Cell Therapy departments in 2020 to harness and maximise the therapeutic potential of existing and emerging technology platforms, including stem cell technologies and new modalities. In Oncology R&D, we are rapidly building a new CAR-T portfolio, focused on the potential of lymphocytes as powerful, living drugs. The most advanced of our BioPharmaceuticals R&D stem cell programmes is in collaboration with Procella Therapeutics AB and aims to treat heart failure patients using human ventricular progenitor (HVP) cells which have demonstrated therapeutic potential by forming heart muscle de novo in preclinical models.\n\n## Better predicting clinical success\n\nIn our efforts to improve our ability to predict the clinical success of our candidate drug molecules, we are adopting a range of cutting-edge technologies. We are developing advanced cellular models of disease, such as a bone marrow 'organ-chip' that replicates clinically-observed toxicities, as well as a renal micro-organoid model which allows high-throughput drug screening and, potentially, regenerative medicine.\n\nMass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is now embedded as an advanced imaging technology to help interrogate complex disease pro/files, such as the /first mechanistic description of how metabolites generated by the gut microbiome can play a role in neurological conditions like Parkinson's or new insights into the mechanism of nutrient sensing and utilisation in lung metastasis and colorectal cancer.\n\nBreaking new ground in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) monitoring, in 2020 we initiated a trial to evaluate treatment outcomes in patients with lung cancer through detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) following surgery. The trial, in collaboration with ArcherDX, Inc., is designed to identify patients with high risk of recurrence and enable early interventions to improve long-term survival/ curative intent. It is anticipated that two-year DNA (ctDNA) monitoring will identify nearly 80% of patients prior to clinical relapse.",

        "page_content": "## Business Review Research & Development\n\n## continued\n\n## Pioneering new approaches to engagement in the clinic\n\nWe continue to design and conduct our clinical trials to support better experiences for patients and increase ef/ficiencies in clinical practice. Our digital transformations include new tools to improve the way we work, such as Control Tower which provides real-time access to trial information at a site level, Merlin to enable rapid and effective decisions for clinical trial recruitment, and Clinical Supply Chain to monitor global stocks of clinical-grade material. The expedited launch of eConsent in 2020 enabled remote sharing and review capabilities of informed consent with patients and is further helping to get new trials under way safely and quickly. We have also ensured continuity for clinical trial patients by facilitating the shipments of study drugs direct to patient homes, replacing some site visits with home visits to maintain patient safety, and accelerating remote data collection and home-based measurements wherever possible during the pandemic.\n\nThese advances have led to the launch of some of the fastest clinical trials in our history. For example, /first patients in the Phase II CALAVI trial to assess the potential of the BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib, in COVID-19 disease were dosed in under three months, representing a new standard for engagement in the clinic.\n\nDuring the year, we also initiated our /first fully virtual trial in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, decentralising both study recruitment and support. Working closely with regulatory authorities, we designed and initiated a trial that integrated high-quality patient data from routine clinical care and registries, with the requirements of a rigorous clinical trial. This approach has the potential to deliver robust safety and ef/ficacy data, while reducing patient burden and streamlining trial delivery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Therapy Area Review from page 30.\n\n## Bioethics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Bioethics' refers to the range of ethical issues that arise from the study and practice of biological and medical science. We are committed to working in a transparent and ethical manner across all our bioethics subject matter areas. Our Global Standard on Bioethics sets out our principles which apply to all our scienti/fic activities, whether conducted by us or by third parties acting on our behalf. The following sections summarise our activities in the main areas, and our Global Standard on Bioethics is available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\nOur Bioethics Advisory Group (BAG) is sponsored by the Chief Medical Of/ficer and oversees the operation of the Global Standard on Bioethics. BAG met eight times in 2020. BAG continued to be involved with ethical discussions on traditional topics, for example, animal research and human biological samples as well as emerging topics, for example, Arti/ficial Intelligence. In 2020, BAG expanded its scope to include guidance on employee testing for SARS-CoV-2, potential employee screening for early cancer detection, employee participation in AstraZeneca clinical trials and governance decisions in the exception process for payments to participants for involvement in AstraZeneca research.\n\n## Clinical trials\n\nWe believe that transparency enhances the understanding of how our medicines work and bene/fit patients. We publish information about our clinical research, as well as the registration and results of our clinical trials - regardless of whether or not they are favourable - for all products and all phases, including marketed medicines, drugs in development and drugs where development has been discontinued. In February 2020, AstraZeneca was recognised as a leader by The Lancet as having 100% compliance to registration and results, posting laws on clinicaltrials.gov for a cohort of studies analysed (March 2018 to September 2019).\n\nIn 2020, we conducted a range of clinical trials across regions as shown in the charts on the right. This broad span helps to ensure that study participants re/flect the diversity of patients for whom our medicines are intended and identi/fies the patients for whom the medicine may be most bene/ficial. Our global governance process provides the framework for ensuring a consistent, high-quality approach worldwide. Protecting participants throughout the trial process is a priority and we have strict procedures to help ensure that participants are not exposed to unnecessary risks.\n\nAll our clinical trials are designed and /finally interpreted in-house. Some are conducted by contract research organisations (CROs) on our behalf and we require these organisations to comply with our global standards.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, we shared anonymised individual patient-level data from 160 studies with 59 unique research teams and responded to 199 requests from external researchers using our portal, www.vivli.org to request our clinical data and reports to support additional research. We publish Anonymized Clinical Data Packages for products in compliance with regulations in Canada and the EU, as well as share them with approved quali/fied researchers where they contribute to successful data-sharing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nneeds. In 2020, we continued to participate in the industry-wide portal, www.trialsummaries.com where we publish Trial Result Summaries in easy-to-understand language and translate these to the local language for all sites where a study is conducted. As of 31 December 2020, we published Trial Result Summaries for 173 AstraZeneca trials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see our website,\n\nwww.astrazeneca.com, or our clinical trials website, www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com.\n\n## Clinical trial diversity\n\nOur belief is that increasing the diversity of principal investigators and site staff will foster trust between healthcare providers and their communities, and that this will help to increase patient diversity within our clinical trials. In support of this belief, in 2020 we launched an educational programme globally to train staff at clinical research sites with limited experience of clinical trials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDenotes sustainability information independently assured by Bureau Veritas",

        "page_content": "## Research use of human biological samples\n\nThe use of human biological samples, such as solid tissue, bio/fluids and their derivatives, plays a vital role in developing a deeper understanding of human diseases.\n\nWe are committed to minimising the use of fetal tissue by exploring technological alternatives. Fetal tissue is used to provide invaluable data to advance novel treatments for serious diseases of unmet medical need and only when no other scienti/fically reasonable alternative is available. In 2020, two additional new research proposals that include use of human fetal tissue (hFT), or cells derived from hFT, were approved; one was required to meet regulatory requirements. Four projects using hFT had progressed as at 31 December 2020 and three projects are ongoing. An additional three projects using human embryonic stem cells (hESC) were approved in 2020, resulting in 13 projects using 24 different hESC lines or derived cells having been approved as at 31 December 2020. Seven projects are ongoing.\n\n## Animal research\n\nTechnology has not yet advanced to the stage where all animal use can be eliminated from research and development. In addition, some animal studies are required by international regulators before medicines progress to human trials. Animal studies therefore remain a small, but necessary, part of the process of developing new drugs.\n\nAnimal research use varies depending on many interrelated factors, including our amount of pre-clinical research, the nature and complexity of the diseases under investigation and regulatory requirements. We believe that without our active and ongoing commitment to the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Re/finement of animals in research), our animal use would be much greater. In 2020, animals were used for in-house studies 74,684 times (2019: 108,674). In addition, animals were used on our behalf for CRO studies 51,625 times (2019: 35,210). In total, over 94% were rodents or /fish.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see our Sustainability Report available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\n## R&D resources\n\nWe have approximately 10,500 employees in our R&D organisation, working in various sites around the world. We currently have three strategic R&D centres: Cambridge, UK; Gaithersburg, MD, US; and Gothenburg, Sweden. Other R&D centres are located in the UK (Alderley Park and Maccles/field), the US (Waltham, MA and South San Francisco, CA), Japan (Osaka) and China (Shanghai). We also have a site in Poland (Warsaw) that focuses on late-stage development.\n\nDuring 2020, we opened a new of/fice in New York, NY, US with a speci/fic focus on delivery of our Oncology pipeline, particularly in the clinical and medical space. The addition of this new Manhattan-based site ensures that we have an R&D footprint in all four of the nationally recognised top areas for biopharmaceutical innovation in the US.\n\n## Cambridge\n\nCambridge, UK is one of the most exciting bioscience hotspots in the world and it is where we are creating an open and vibrant R&D Centre on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus.\n\nWe believe that the best way to meet today's science challenges is to work openly and collaboratively with the world's best scientists. Being in Cambridge enables us to continue building on the great tradition of innovative thinking to contribute to the advancement of a world-class ecosystem of great science and delivering our Company's science-led strategy.\n\nThe vision for the R&D Centre has been an incredible catalyst for delivering our strategy. It has brought more than 3,500 of our people together in one geographical location and the opening of our R&D Centre this year will enable us to take the next step towards ful/filling our Cambridge vision - to bring our research together under one roof.\n\nAs part of our commitment to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in life sciences, we support a number of initiatives that help biotech entrepreneurs advance their business ideas. Our support is wide-ranging, from connecting entrepreneurs with dedicated business mentors and organising guest lectures to offering internships. We have more than 60 business mentors in Cambridge. To date around 75 start-ups have bene/fited from their experience so far.\n\nThe cost projection for the R&D Centre remains in the region of $1.3 billion (c.\u00a31.0 billion); the programme is well advanced, although the full and potential impact of COVID-19 is yet to be determined. The project continues to be funded out of operational cash /flows.\n\n## Investment\n\nIn 2020, R&D expenditure was $5,991 million (2019: $6,059 million; 2018: $5,932 million), including Core R&D costs of $5,872 million (2019: $5,320 million; 2018: $5,266 million). In addition, we spent $1,454 million on acquiring product rights (such as in-licensing) (2019: $1,835 million; 2018: $476 million). We also invested $35 million on the implementation of our R&D restructuring strategy (2019: $10 million; 2018: $94 million). The allocations of spend by early-stage and late-stage development are presented in the R&D spend analysis table below.\n\n## R&D spend analysis\n\n|                                         | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Discovery and  early-stage  development | 36%    | 36%    | 37%    |\n| Late-stage  development                 | 64%    | 64%    | 63%    |",

In most countries, we sell our medicines through wholly owned local marketing companies. We also sell through distributors and local representative of/fices. We market our products largely to primary care and specialty care physicians.\n\nTotal Revenue, comprising Product Sales and Collaboration Revenue, increased by 9% in 2020 (10% at CER) to $26,617 million. Product Sales grew by 10% (11% at CER) to $25,890 million, driven primarily by the performances of the new medicines across Oncology and BioPharmaceuticals, including Tagrisso and Farxiga .\n\nTotal Revenue included $2m of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca Product Sales within Other Medicines; from the /first quarter of 2021 AstraZeneca intends to report the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca performance separately.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a signi/ficant impact on every aspect of life in 2020, AstraZeneca. The largest direct impacts of COVID-19 on the our portfolio of medicines included reduced sales of Pulmicort in China on fewer nebulisation-centre visits and reduced elective surgery, and less use globally of infused and injectable medicines, such as Imfinzi and Fasenra .\n\nThere was also a decline in the number of hospital admissions around the world for the treatment of heart attacks and lower levels of elective percutaneous coronary intervention, adversely impacting sales of Brilinta .\n\nSome medicines, however, may bene/fit from shifts in patient care and behaviours, including oral medicines such as Calquence , which saw an element of bene/fit from the substitution from infused-chemotherapy regimens.\n\nAdditional investment in new medicines continued to fuel our growing Oncology and BioPharmaceuticals therapy areas.

Treatments that are targeted and effective as well as innovative and personalised, can lower healthcare costs by reducing the need for more expensive care, preventing more serious and costly diseases and increasing productivity. We are committed to a pricing policy for our medicines based on four principles:\n\n- > We determine the price of our medicines while considering their full value for patients, payers and society. The agreement on price involves many national, regional and local stakeholders, re/flecting factors such as clinical bene/fit, cost-effectiveness, improvement to life expectancy and quality of life.\n- > We aim to ensure the sustainability of both the healthcare system and our research-led business model. We believe we share a collective responsibility with healthcare providers and other stakeholders to work together to enable an ef/ficient healthcare system for patients today and support a pipeline of new medicines for patients tomorrow.\n- > We seek to ensure appropriate patient access to our medicines. We work closely with payers and providers to understand their priorities and requirements, and play a leading role in projects to better align the speci/fications of regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) agencies or other organisations that provide value assessment of medicines.\n\n- > We pursue a flexible pricing approach that re/flects the wide variation in global healthcare systems. We have developed patient access programmes that are aligned with a patient's ability to pay and a healthcare system's ability to respond. We are committed to the appropriate use of managed entry schemes and the development of real-world evidence and we are investigating innovative approaches to the pricing of medicines, such as payment for outcomes received by the patient and healthcare system.\n\nWe have outlined our commitment to optimising affordability and accessibility in our Affordability Statement that can be found on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\nBy way of example of our approach, we apply Tiered Pricing Principles globally. This de/fines price levels commensurate with affordability based on a country's ability to pay. We believe that this approach to pricing is sustainable and fair, and that it will increase access and improve patient outcomes in Emerging Markets.\n\nMore generally, we remain committed to working with payers to explore novel and /flexible ways to assess and pay for medicines towards our shared goal of delivering the outcomes that matter for patients through innovative and personalised treatments. We are collaborating with payers to conclude outcomes- and value-based reimbursement that improves patient outcomes. By the end of 2020, we had entered into more than 100 such innovative value-based agreements across our three main therapy areas.\n\nWe understand that our medicines will not bene/fit patients if they are unable to afford them which is why we offer a number of patient assistance programmes that can help increase patients' access to medicines and reduce their out-of-pocket costs. Through these programmes, we support qualifying patients in a variety of ways, including through discounts and/or product donations. Outside the US, we generally provide these programmes in markets with limited or no public reimbursement system, no coverage beyond the most basic therapies, or where the possibility of public reimbursement is unlikely, or only after an extended period.\n\n## US\n\nAs the sixteenth largest prescription-based pharmaceutical company in the US, we have a 2.7% market share of US pharmaceuticals by sales value. In 2020, Product Sales in the US increased by 12% to $8,638 million (2019: $7,747 million).\n\nThe US healthcare system is complex with multiple payers and intermediaries exerting pressure on patient access to branded medicines through regulatory rebates in government programmes and voluntary rebates paid to managed care organisations and pharmacy bene/fit managers for commercially insured patients, including Medicare Part D patients. In the Medicare Part D programme, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are also statutorily required to pay a percentage of the patient's out-ofpocket costs during the 'coverage gap' portion of their bene/fit design.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, the overall measurable reduction in our pro/fit before tax for the year due to discounts on branded pharmaceuticals in the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap and an industry-wide HealthCare Reform Fee was $590 million (2019: $547 million; 2018: $432 million; 2017: $119 million).\n\nIn the US, there is signi/ficant pricing pressure driven by payer consolidation, restrictive reimbursement policies and cost control tools, such as exclusionary formularies and price protection clauses. Many formularies, employ 'generic /first' strategies and/or require physicians to obtain prior approval for the use of a branded medicine where a generic alternative exists. These mechanisms can be used to limit use of branded products and pressure manufacturers to reduce net prices. In 2020, 85.3% of prescriptions dispensed in the US were generic (2019: 84.8%). In addition, patients continue to see changes in the design of their health plan bene/fits and may experience increases, in both premiums and out-of-pocket payments for branded medications. There is a growing trend towards high-deductible health plans which may require patients to pay the full list price until they meet certain out-of-pocket thresholds.\n\nOngoing scrutiny of the US pharmaceutical industry, focused largely on affordability, has been the basis of multiple policy proposals in the US. Over the course of 2020, Congress and the Trump Administration issued several proposals designed to increase generic competition, reform coverage and reimbursement of drug therapies, reduce list prices and out-of-pocket costs, limit price increases, and increase regulatory rebate liability, among other topics. While the attention of Congress necessarily shifted in order to respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency, we expect a focus on drug pricing proposals to continue into 2021. AstraZeneca is actively supporting solutions that provide access and affordability while continuing to support scienti/fic innovation.\n\nIn addition, lawmakers at both the federal and state levels have sought increased drug pricing transparency and have proposed and implemented policies that include measures relating to the submission of proprietary manufacturer data, establishment of price parameters that are indexed to certain federal programmes, and reporting of changes in pricing beyond certain thresholds.\n\nThough widespread adoption of a broad national price control scheme in the near future is unlikely, we continue to comply with new state-level regulations in this area. We recognise the sustained potential for substantial changes to laws and regulations regarding drug pricing that could have a signi/ficant impact on the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWe offer a number of resources and programmes in the US that can help increase patients' access to medication and reduce their out-of-pocket costs.\n\n- For more information, see Community investment on page 76.\n\n## Europe\n\nThe total European pharmaceutical market was worth $211 billion in 2020. We are the thirteenth largest prescription-based pharmaceutical company in Europe (see Market de/finitions on page 280) with a 2.0% market share of pharmaceutical sales by value.\n\nIn 2020, Product Sales in Europe increased by 16% at actual rate of exchange (15% at CER) to $5,059 million (2019: $4,350 million). We continued to launch and saw sustained performance of innovative medicines, in particular with Tagrisso , Imfinzi , Lynparza , Forxiga and Fasenra . Oncology sales in Europe grew by 36% (35% at CER), driven by increased use of Tagrisso for the treatment of patients in the 1st-line EGFR7-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting, as well as continued strong levels of demand in the 2nd-line setting. Imfinzi sales re/flect a growing number of reimbursements. Lynparza sales bene/fited from the increasing levels of reimbursement and BRCA-testing rates. Forxiga sales growth of 36% (35% at CER) was accompanied by Fasenra sales increase of 72% (70% at CER). With the increased focus on /flu vaccination programmes, FluMist sales saw a signi/ficant increase of 135% (126% at CER).\n\nDespite the overall growth, we experienced a decline in Iressa sales due to the uptake of Tagrisso , coupled with the ongoing impact of divestments, mainly Losec and Seroquel XR .\n\n## Established Rest of World (ROW)* Japan\n\nJapan remains an attractive market for innovative pharmaceutical companies, positioned as the third largest pharmaceutical market for R&D-driven companies. In 2020, there was continued pressure on healthcare spend and, being an even year, the biennial government-induced price control measurements were in place.\n\nTotal Revenue in Japan was $2,620 million, positioning AstraZeneca as the sixth largest prescription-based pharmaceutical company with a 3.5% value market share of pharmaceutical sales by value.\n\nResults have been driven by strong performance from Oncology brands Tagrisso , Imfinzi and Lynparza as well as Fasenra , Breztri and Forxiga .\n\nWe successfully launched Lokelma in May and Imfinzi for SCLC in August. Forxiga was approved for heart failure treatment in November and Lynparza was approved in three new indications in December (advanced ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers).\n\n## Canada\n\nProduct Sales in Canada increased by 29% at actual rate of exchange (31% at CER) in 2020. This was primarily driven by strong sustained growth of our New Medicines, particularly Imfinzi , Tagrisso , Lynparza and Fasenra coupled with Symbicort sales bene/fiting from the regulatory approval to use the product as an anti-in/flammatory reliever as-needed in mild asthma coupled with improved adherence related to COVID-19.\n\nDecline of Onglyza was accompanied by the impact of divestments, particularly Losec . There continues to be pricing pressure from both public and private payers. We remain committed to exploring innovative value-based pricing solutions that bene/fit patient outcomes.\n\n## Australia and New Zealand\n\nOur sales in Australia and New Zealand increased by 8% at actual rate of exchange (10% at CER) in 2020. This was primarily due to growth in key brands such as Symbicort (which bene/fited from a strong LABA/ICS class growth from the impact of the bush/fires earlier in the year and then COVID-19), Tagrisso , Lynparza and Forxiga . These were supplemented by strong growth in Fasenra in its /first full year after reimbursement and an earlier than expected Pharmaceutical Bene/fits Scheme (PBS) listing of Imfinzi . The decline in older, non-patent protected brands such as Crestor and Nexium continued but were more than offset by the growth brands. Australia remains a predominantly HTA-reimbursed market with products aiming to be reimbursed needing to show a clear level of cost effectiveness and bene/fit to patients versus existing standard of care. Within this context, the Group's pipeline of new assets and indications provide good opportunities for continued future growth.\n\n- * Established ROW comprises Australia and New Zealand, Canada and Japan.\n\nRevenue has been kept /flat versus 2019 ($2,591 million) outperforming the negative market growth despite challenges linked to COVID-19, regular biennial price cut in April, repricing for Imfinzi and Faslodex , and generic entry for Symbicort (December 2019) and Pulmicort (January 2020).",

As outlined in Healthcare in a changing world from page 12, these countries represent a major growth opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry due to high unmet medical need and sound economic fundamentals. Emerging Markets are not immune, however, to economic downturn. Market volatility is higher than in Established Markets, and various political and economic challenges exist. These include regulatory and government interventions. In selected markets, governments are encouraging local manufacturing and investment by offering more favourable market access conditions and pricing is increasingly controlled by payers through price referencing regulations in addition to cost effectiveness and cost minimisation approaches.\n\nGrowth drivers for Emerging Markets include new medicines across our Oncology, CVRM and Respiratory & Immunology portfolios. To educate physicians about our broad portfolio, we are selectively investing in sales capabilities where opportunities from unmet medical need exist. We are also expanding our reach through multi-channel marketing and external partnerships.\n\nWith revenues of $8,711 million (2019: $8,171 million), AstraZeneca was the fourth largest multinational pharmaceutical company, as measured by prescription sales, and the second fastest-growing top 10 multinational pharmaceutical company in Emerging Markets in 2020. Despite the impact of COVID-19 across all geographies we saw growth across all major areas including Latin America at 0% (18% at CER), Russia & Eurasia at 26% (39% at CER), Middle East & Africa down 4% (up 1% at CER) and Asia Area at 5% (7% at CER).\n\n## China\n\nIn China, AstraZeneca is the largest pharmaceutical company by value in the hospital sector, as measured by sales. Sales in China in 2020 increased by 10% at actual rate of exchange (11% at CER) to $5,345 million (2019: $4,880 million). Despite the signi/ficant impact of COVID-19 in the /first half of the year especially, we delivered sales growth above the growth rate of the hospital market sector through strategic brand investment, systematic organisational capability improvements and long-term channel expansion programmes in our main therapy areas.\n\nTagrisso, Breztri, Bevespi, Lynparza, Zoladex and Linzess were listed or renewed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). Pricing practices remain a priority for regulators, and new national regulations, in addition to provincial and hospital tenders, continue to put increasing pricing pressures\n\non pharmaceutical companies in China. The introduction of the Generics Quality Consistency Evaluation (GQCE) in 2018 has had an impact on pharmaceutical company budgets and pricing through setting new standards for bioequivalence that generic products must adhere to as part of participation in a process called value-based procurement (VBP) that covers up to 70% of anticipated hospital volumes in all areas. This evaluation is being applied retrospectively, so several existing generic products may fail and be withdrawn which could lead to a consolidation in the sector. This would leave fewer, higher-quality generics in the market thereby putting pressure on any originator brand price premiums and driving a reduction in overall medical costs.\n\nIn 2018, the /first round of VBP, which involved Crestor and Iressa , was announced with implementation from early 2019. In 2020, Losec , Brilinta and Arimidex were included within the latest VBP cycle with none of the AstraZeneca brands successfully winning any of the tendered volumes. Consequently the growth of these brands was signi/ficantly impacted in the latter part of the year. As the implementation of VBP accelerates it is expected that more AstraZeneca brands will be impacted in 2021.\n\nCOVID-19 has had a major effect on growth rates in all channels across China and for AstraZeneca in the Respiratory & Immunology therapy area. In particular, the nebulised brands such as Pulmicort , Fluimucil and Bricanyl were most heavily impacted as nebulisation centres were initially closed; when opened, demand was slow to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe industry-wide growth rate is expected to be 4.4% over the next /five years, following the updates of the NRDL and expanding health insurance coverage. Nevertheless, the healthcare environment in China remains dynamic. Opportunities are arising from incremental healthcare investment, in-licensing, strong underlying demand for our more established medicines and the emergence of innovative medicines such as Lynparza , Breztri and roxadustat.\n\nSeveral initiatives announced in the latter part of 2019 to support transformation of healthcare in China were further progressed in 2020. These included the creation of a global R&D centre in Shanghai. A new AI Innovation Centre, also in Shanghai, will be established to capitalise on the latest digital technology in R&D, manufacturing, operations and commercialisation to help accelerate the delivery of medicines to patients in China and globally. A healthcare investment fund jointly set up with CICC, one of China's leading investment banks, has executed funding agreements with other investors and the initial",

An internet hospital venture with Hillhouse Capital which also includes an in-house pharmacy distribution was executed in 2020 and expected to close in early 2021.\n\n## Emerging market healthcare\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continue to make our medicines affordable to more people on a commercially and socially sustainable basis. As, on average, almost half of healthcare expenditure in emerging markets is paid for by the patient or their families, we base our approach in these markets on an understanding of their economic circumstances and the burden placed on them by healthcare costs.\n\nWe enable our Emerging Markets to deliver better and broader patient access through innovative and targeted equitable pricing strategies and practices which include patient assistance programmes, such as FazBem in Brazil which offer products at a discounted cost.\n\nFor information on our access to healthcare programmes in Emerging Markets and as one of our sustainability priorities, see our Sustainability Report available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\n## Responsible sales and marketing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to employing high ethical standards of sales and marketing practice worldwide, in line with our Code of Ethics and supporting requirements (our policy framework). We maintain a robust compliance programme in our efforts to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and adopted industry codes. As outlined in Global Compliance and Internal Audit Services on page 118, our compliance programme is delivered by dedicated compliance professionals who advise on and monitor adherence to our policy framework.\n\nThese professionals also support our line managers locally in ensuring that their staff meet our ethical standards. A network of nominated signatories reviews our promotional materials and activities against applicable requirements to ensure we abide by the applicable regulations and codes of practice and share accurate, balanced and non-misleading information about our products. Our Internal Audit Services department, in partnership with external audit experts, also conducts compliance audits on selected marketing companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, we identi/fied 14 con/firmed breaches of external sales and marketing regulations or codes (2019: eight). There were 2,113 instances, most of them minor, of non-compliance with our policy framework in our Commercial Business Units, including instances by employees and third parties (2019: 2,597). We removed a total of 108 employees and third parties from their roles as a result of these breaches (a single breach may involve more than one person). We also formally warned 861 others and provided further guidance or coaching on our policies to 2,099 more. The Audit Committee is provided with the breach statistics on a quarterly basis. Further commentary on the more serious breaches and corresponding remediation is also provided to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe total number of incidents has increased since last year, driven by increasing numbers of low impact incidents. This may be attributable to many factors, including the growth in AstraZeneca's employee base, stronger /first-line oversight, more targeted monitoring with data analytics, the strengthening of 'Speak Up' culture and evolving external regulations and enforcement priorities (e.g. data privacy globally and human genetic resources in China). Regardless of cause(s), we see increased reporting of low impact incidents (as opposed to medium or high impact), a positive trend that enables the enterprise to learn and intervene early before non-compliance escalates or leads to systemic issues.\n\n## Anti-bribery and anti-corruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe do not tolerate bribery or any other form of corruption. We conveyed our commitment to ethical behaviour in the 2020 annual Code training, reinforced through anti-bribery/ anti-corruption training materials delivered and made available to relevant employees and third parties, including mandatory, periodic training for selected business units and roles.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nWe are committed to employing high ethical standards when carrying out all aspects of our business globally. Our Code of Ethics (the Code) is based on our Values, expected behaviours and key policy principles. It applies to all Executive and Non-Executive Directors, officers, employees and temporary staff, in all companies within our Group worldwide. It empowers employees to make decisions in the best interests of the Group and the people we serve, now and in the long term, by outlining our commitments in simple terms and focusing on why these commitments matter. The Code is at the core of our compliance programme. It has been translated into approximately 40 languages and guides employees on how to make the best day-to-day choices and how to act in a consistent, responsible way, worldwide. There are two mandatory training courses dedicated to the Code: one is for new starters; the second is the annual training for all employees, reminding them of the key commitments. In 2020, 100% of all active employees completed the annual training on the Code of Ethics.\n\nThe Code includes four high-level Global Policies covering Science, Interactions, Workplace and Sustainability. These Global Policies continue to be complemented by underlying Global Standards, which define the global requirements we follow to deliver our business consistent with the Values, behaviours, commitments and principles embodied in our Code and Global Policies. Our Code and Global Policies, together with relevant Global Standards and Position Statements, are published on our website, www.astrazeneca.com. Our policy framework also includes additional requirements at the global, local and business unit level to support employees in their daily work.\n\nA Finance Code complements the Code and applies to the Chief Financial Officer, the Group's principal accounting officers (including key Finance staff in all overseas subsidiaries) and all managers in the Finance function. This reinforces the importance of the integrity of the Group's Financial Statements, the reliability of the accounting records on which they are based and the robustness of the relevant controls and processes.\n\nBribery and corruption remains a business risk as we launch new medicines in markets across the globe and enter into collaborations, and the risk is a focus of our third-party risk management process, as well as our Business Development due diligence procedures. It is also a focus of our monitoring and audit programmes. The majority of marketing company audits include anti-bribery/ anti-corruption work programmes.",

For the 2020 disclosure period (of 2019 data), totalling $899 million in payments or transfers of value to 174,000 unique covered recipients.\n\nWe continue to monitor the external landscape to ensure that the Company is prepared to meet new obligations and are progressively heading towards increased disclosure in additional markets globally and, in all locations, we are committed to ensuring that payments are justi/fied and reasonable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see our transparency page, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability/ethics-andtransparency.html.\n\n## Operations\n\nOur manufacturing and supply function has continued to support our growth by delivering every new launch on time and in full, and sustaining strong customer service and product lead-time reductions.\n\n2020 marks the completion of the delivery of our Operations 2020 plan designed to enhance supply capabilities to respond better to the expanding patient and market needs. In 2020, we delivered 91 successful market launches and 3 pre-registration launches. We will further evolve our manufacturing and supply capabilities through the launch of our new Operations 2025 plan, aligned to our Company strategy. Our Operations 2025 plan will focus on scaling our capabilities to support the continued growth of our portfolio, combined with leveraging the bene/fits of new manufacturing technology and digital innovation across our end-to-end supply chains.\n\n## Quality, regulation and compliance\n\nWe are committed to high product quality, which underpins the safety and ef/ficacy of our medicines. We maintain a comprehensive quality management system to assure compliance and quality. Similarly, we set strict standards for safety, health and environment at each of our sites. During 2020, our site safety protocols were updated in response to the global outbreak of COVID-19 to reduce the risk of workplace transmission. Manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to rigorous and continuously evolving regulatory standards. They are subject to inspections by regulatory authorities, which are authorised to mandate improvements to facilities and processes, halt production and impose conditions for production to resume.\n\nTo ensure compliance with global Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations, the Operations Quality team continuously reviews and strengthens the Quality Systems at our manufacturing sites through internal audit programmes, external intelligence and sharing learnings between sites. In 2020, these measures helped us successfully achieve zero critical observations from 14 independent inspections. We review observations from these inspections together with the outcomes of internal audits and, where necessary, implement improvement actions.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and compliance with internal policies, laws and regulations. We review and comment upon evolving national and international compliance regulations through our membership of industry associations, including IFPMA, EFPIA and PhRMA.\n\n## Supply chain management\n\nWe need an uninterrupted supply of high-quality materials along our end-to-end supply chains. This includes our active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and, with most of our API manufacturing outsourced, we place great importance on our global external sourcing and procurement organisations and policies, as well as our integrated risk management processes. We purchase materials from a wide range of suppliers and work to mitigate supply risks, such as natural or man-made disasters that disrupt supply chains or the unavailability of raw materials. Contingency plans include using dual or multiple suppliers where appropriate, maintaining adequate stock levels and working to mitigate the effect of pricing /fluctuations in raw materials. During 2020, we activated our business continuity plans to maintain supply of medicines to patients and mitigate against any risk of disruption caused by COVID-19.\n\nAs a consequence of the UK leaving the EU on 31 January 2020, we continued to work both internally and externally with our suppliers on our readiness for the impact of the transition period ending on 31 December 2020, with a view to mitigating the effect on our business.\n\nWe continue to maintain a range of mitigations, including revised logistics channels, additional warehousing, the potential to move clinical trial-related activities, stock building of /final product and manufacturing-related goods, movement of stock locations, and assessment of the opportunity for supplier substitution. While we have continued to make progress in our preparations, it is possible that adverse events, such as border delays, will impact supplier activities. Issue management may therefore play a key element in our ability to maintain safe supply of our medicines and ongoing business operations more generally in 2021. In addition, we have continued to engage with regulators and governments to ensure that they have a clear view on the potential impact on pharmaceutical supply chains.",

        "page_content": "## Supply chain finance\n\nAstraZeneca has a supply chain /finance programme to support the cash /flow of its external supply base. This programme, supported by Taulia Inc. and Greensill Capital, provides suppliers with visibility of invoices and payment dates via a dedicated platform. Suppliers can access this platform free of charge and have /flexibility to select individual invoices for early payment. On election of an early payment, a charge is incurred by the supplier based on the period of acceleration, central bank interest rate and the rate agreed between Taulia Inc. and each supplier. All early payments are processed by Greensill Capital and AstraZeneca settles the original invoice amount with Greensill Capital at maturity of the original invoice due date.\n\nThe programme is live in the US, UK, Sweden, Germany and Australia, with expansion into other countries under review. As of December 2020, the programme had 3,396 suppliers enrolled and a potential early payment balance of $248 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on supply chain financing, see Note 20 on page 207.\n\n## Responsible supply chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvery employee and contractor who sources goods and services on behalf of AstraZeneca is expected to follow responsible business processes, which are embedded into our Global Standard for the Procurement of Goods and Services. All our procurement professionals receive training on our Code of Ethics which contains our expectations on responsible procurement.\n\nWe monitor compliance through assessments and improvement programmes and we will not use suppliers who are unable to meet our standards. Our Global Standard Expectation of Third Parties is published on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability. We conducted a total of 16,197 assessments in 2020 (2019: 15,519).\n\nIn 2020, we conducted 48 audits on high-risk suppliers (external manufacturing partners), seeking to ensure that they employ appropriate practices and controls. 6% of these suppliers fully met our expectations, with a further 94% implementing improvement plans to address minor instances of non compliance. Through our due diligence process, no high-risk engagements were rejected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our Responsible supply chain, see, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\n## Manufacturing capabilities\n\nOur principal tablet and capsule formulation sites are in the UK, Sweden, China, Puerto Rico and the US, with local/regional supply sites in Russia, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, India, Germany, Mexico and Brazil. We also have major formulation sites for the global supply of parenteral and/or inhalation products in the US, Sweden, France, Australia and the UK. Most of the manufacture of APIs is delivered through the ef/ficient use of external sourcing that is complemented by internal capability in Sweden.\n\nIn January 2020, AstraZeneca re-acquired the Reims packing and distribution centre from Avara Reims Pharmaceutical Services. This transaction saw the site and former Avara Reims employees transfer to AstraZeneca. The transition of the Reims site into the AstraZeneca network, including full IT systems integration, remains on schedule for completion in early 2021.\n\nIn September 2019, we announced our intention to exit our manufacturing facility at Wedel in Germany by late 2021, and we remain on track to exit the facility to plan.\n\nFor biologics, our principal commercial manufacturing facilities are in the US (Frederick, MD; Greater Philadelphia, PA), the UK (Speke) and the Netherlands (Nijmegen), with capabilities in process development, manufacturing and distribution of biologics, including global supply of mAbs and in/fluenza vaccines. In Sweden, we have continued to complete extensive quali/fication of our new biologics drug product manufacturing facility. We have commenced GMP manufacturing activity ahead of seeking regulatory approval in 2021 in order to begin commercial supply. In 2020, we announced a long-term supply agreement with Samsung Biologics to provide large-scale commercial manufacturing for drug substance and drug product. This new collaboration enables us to expand our global biologics manufacturing capability into Asia Paci/fic.\n\nAt the end of 2020, approximately 14,300 people were employed at 26 Operations sites in 16 countries.\n\n## Business development\n\nBusiness development, specifically partnering, is an important element of our business. It supplements and strengthens our pipeline and our efforts to achieve scientific leadership.\n\nWe work with others around the world, including academia, governments, industry, scienti/fic organisations and patient groups, as well as other pharmaceutical companies, to access the best science to stimulate innovation and accelerate the delivery of new medicines to target unmet medical need. We currently have more than 800 1 collaborations around the world.\n\nOur business development activity takes many forms and can be broadly grouped into:\n\n- > alliances, collaborations and acquisitions to enhance our portfolio and pipeline in our main therapy areas\n- > divestments of non-priority medicines.\n\n## Alliances, collaborations and acquisitions\n\nWe continue to assess opportunities to make strategic, value-enhancing additions to our portfolio and pipeline in our main therapy areas, including through in-licensing and acquisitions. No company acquisitions were completed in 2020, however, we acquired a preclinical oral PCSK9 inhibitor programme from Dogma Therapeutics. We aim to take the programme forward into clinical development for dyslipidaemia, or abnormal amount of lipids in the blood, and familial hypercholesterolemia, a common genetic condition that causes high cholesterol. PCSK9 is a protein that regulates the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or 'bad' cholesterol in the blood. Increased activity of PCSK9 is associated with high LDL cholesterol. The acquired PCSK9 inhibitors are small molecules that bind directly to a novel part of PCSK9 and have shown to block its activity and lower LDL cholesterol in preclinical models. There are currently no oral PCSK9 inhibitors available to patients or in clinical development. We also acquired MSC-1, an anti-LIF antibody, from Northern Biologics. MSC-1 has completed Phase Ia clinical studies for the treatment of solid tumours.",

        "page_content": "## Business Review Commercial continued\n\nOver the past three years, we have completed more than 123 major or strategically important business development transactions, including some 27 in 2020. Of these transactions, six were completed on behalf of Oncology R&D and six on behalf of BioPharmaceuticals R&D. Five related to preclinical assets or programmes and 12 to precision medicine, genomics or access to genetic data 2 .\n\nCollaboration activities that focus on the development and/or commercialisation of speci/fic medicines are a component of our strategy. This activity can create additional value from our existing and potential medicines and falls broadly into two categories:\n\n- > collaborations that help us access therapy area expertise through AstraZeneca and non-AstraZeneca medicines\n- > collaborations that help us increase the number of patients and the reach of medicines in which we maintain an ongoing interest, but which typically sit outside our main therapy areas.\n\nOf particular note, we announced a global development and commercialisation collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for DS-1062, Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)directed ADC and potential new medicine for the treatment of multiple tumour types. DS-1062 is currently in development for the treatment of multiple tumours that commonly express the cell-surface glycoprotein TROP2. Among them, TROP2 is overexpressed in the majority of NSCLC and breast cancers tumour types that have long been a strategic focus for AstraZeneca. This collaboration re/flects AstraZeneca's strategy to invest in ADCs as a class, the innovative nature of the technology and the successful existing collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo an upfront payment of $1 billion in staged payments: $350 million was paid upon completion, with $325 million to be paid after 12 months and $325 million after 24 months from the effective date of the agreement. AstraZeneca will pay additional conditional amounts of up to $1 billion for the successful achievement of regulatory approvals and up to $4 billion for sales-related milestones.\n\nIn addition, we recovered the global rights to brazikumab (formerly MEDI2070), a mAb targeting IL23, from Allergan. Brazikumab is currently in a Phase IIb/III programme in Crohn's disease (CD) and a Phase IIb trial in ulcerative colitis (UC). AstraZeneca and Allergan terminated the existing license agreement and all rights to brazikumab reverted to AstraZeneca.\n\nWe also entered a strategic collaboration agreement with OM Pharma SA, through which the Company was granted the exclusive right to import, distribute and promote the immunological therapy Broncho-Vaxom (Bacterial Lysates/OM-85) in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). BronchoVaxom can prevent and treat recurrent or acute respiratory infections in patients by boosting host immunity. In China, recurrent respiratory tract infection is a particularly common disease in children, with an incidence rate of c.20%.\n\n## Divestments\n\nWe divest medicines that typically sit outside our main therapy areas and that can be deployed better by other companies, in order to redirect investment and resources in our main areas of focus, while ensuring continued or expanded patient access. For example, in 2020, we divested global commercial rights to Inderal (propranolol), Tenormin (atenolol), Tenoretic (atenolol, chlorthalidone /fixed-dose combination), Zestril (lisinopril) and Zestoretic (lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide /fixed-dose combination) to Atnahs Pharma (Atnahs). The agreement excluded the rights in the US and India, which were previously divested, and in Japan, which were retained by AstraZeneca. The medicines, used primarily to treat hypertension, have lost their patent protection globally. Atnahs made an upfront payment of $350 million to AstraZeneca and AstraZeneca may also receive future sales-contingent payments of up to $40 million between 2020 and 2022. Japan rights to Inderal and Tenormin were subsequently divested to Taiyo Pharma Co. Ltd along with Japan rights to Omepral .\n\nIn 2020, we also sublicensed global rights to Movantik (naloxegol), excluding Europe, Canada and Israel, to RedHill Biopharma (RedHill). Movantik is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC). RedHill made an upfront payment of $52.5 million to AstraZeneca on closing and will make a further non-contingent payment of $15 million in 2021.\n\nIn addition, we completed the divestment of commercial rights to Atacand (candesartan cilexetil) and Atacand Plus (a /fixed-dose combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide) in around 70 countries globally to Cheplapharm. Atacand is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of heart failure (HF) and hypertension. Atacand Plus is approved for the treatment of hypertension. Cheplapharm will pay AstraZeneca a total of $400 million in non-contingent consideration, $250 million of which was received in 2020 and the remainder is due in the /first half of 2021.\n\n## Proceeds\n\nThe resulting revenue from these activities supports our R&D investments in our main therapy areas. Ten new transactions that contribute to Collaboration Revenue or generate income through divestment or out-licensing were completed in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- More information on our partnering activity in 2020 can be found in the Financial Review from page 82 and Notes 1 and 2 to the Financial Statements from page 187.",

        "page_content": "## Intellectual property\n\nOur industry's principal economic safeguard is a well-functioning system of patent and related protection that recognises our efforts and rewards innovation with appropriate protection - and allows time to generate the revenue we need to reinvest in pharmaceutical innovation. Patent rights are limited by territory and duration.\n\nA signi/ficant portion of a patent's term can be spent during R&D, before it is possible to launch the protected medicine. Therefore, we commit signi/ficant resources to establishing and defending our patent and related IP protection for inventions.\n\n## Patent process\n\nWe /file patent protection applications for our inventions through government patent of/fices around the world to safeguard the large investment required to obtain marketing approvals for potential new drugs. As we further develop a product and its uses, these new developments may necessitate new patent /filings. Our competitors can challenge our patents in patent of/fices and/or courts, and we may face challenges early in the patent application process and throughout a patent's life - the grounds for these challenges could be the validity of a patent and/or its effective scope and are based on ever-evolving legal precedents. We are experiencing increased challenges around the world and there can be no guarantee of success for either party in patent proceedings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For information about third-party challenges to patents protecting our products, see Note 29 to the Financial Statements from page 228. For more information on the risks relating to patent litigation and early loss and expiry of patents, see Risk from page 254.\n\nThe basic term of a patent is typically 20 years from the /filing of the patent application with the relevant patent of/fice. However, a product protected by a pharmaceutical patent may not be marketed for several years after /filing due to the duration of clinical trials and regulatory approval processes. Patent Term Extensions (PTEs) are available in certain major markets, including the EU and the US, to compensate for these delays. The term of the PTE can vary from zero to /five years, depending on the time taken to obtain any marketing approval. The maximum patent term, when including PTE, cannot exceed 15 years (EU) or 14 years (US) from the /first marketing authorisation.\n\n## Patent expiries\n\nThe table on pages 251 to 253 sets out certain patent expiry dates and sales for our key marketed products.\n\n## Other exclusivities\n\nRegulatory data protection (RDP or 'data exclusivity') is an important additional form of exclusivity which is separate from, but runs in parallel with, patent exclusivity. RDP arises in respect of data which is required to be submitted to regulatory authorities to obtain marketing approvals for our medicines. Signi/ficant investment is required to generate such data (for example, through conducting global clinical trials) and these proprietary data are protected from use by third parties (such as generic manufacturers) for a number of years in a limited number of countries. The period of such protection, and the extent to which it is respected, differs signi/ficantly among countries and varies depending on whether an approved drug is a small molecule or biologic compound. RDP is an important protection for our products and we strive to enforce our rights to it, particularly as patent rights are increasingly being challenged. The RDP period starts from the date of the /first marketing approval from the relevant regulatory authority and runs parallel to any patent protection.\n\nIf a product takes an unusually long time to secure marketing approval, or if patent protection has not been secured, has expired or has been lost, then RDP may be the sole right protecting a product from being copied. Generic manufacturers, we believe, should not be allowed to rely on AstraZeneca's data to support the generic product's approval or marketing until the RDP right has expired.\n\nIn the US, new chemical entities (NCEs) are entitled to a period of /five years of RDP under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This period of RDP runs parallel to any pending or granted patent protection and starts at the approval of the new application. Further, under the Biologics License Application process, the FDA will grant 12 years' data RDP for a new biologic to an innovator manufacturer. In the EU, the RDP period is eight years followed by two years' market exclusivity.\n\nUnder Orphan Drug laws in the EU and US, market exclusivity is granted to an innovator who gains approval for a pharmaceutical product developed to treat a rare disease. What quali/fies as a rare disease differs between the EU and US. Qualifying Orphan Drugs are granted 10 years' market exclusivity in the EU and seven years' market exclusivity in the US.\n\n## Compulsory licensing and access\n\nCompulsory licensing (where a patent authority imposes a licence on the patentee) is on the increase in certain markets in which we operate. We recognise the right of developing countries to use the /flexibilities in the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (including the Doha amendment) in certain circumstances, such as a public health emergency. We believe this should apply only when all other ways of meeting the emergency needs have been considered and where healthcare frameworks and safeguards exist to ensure the medicines reach those who need them.\n\nMore generally, we are committed to expanding access to healthcare through intellectual property and to providing transparency about where our patents are /filed and enforced. See our Intellectual Property statement on our website, www.astrazeneca.com to learn more about our approach, and to view patent rights for medicines used to treat Index diseases.",

This provides a greater balance in terms of refreshing talent and retaining organisational experience. Most of this hiring has been focused in our Emerging Markets, in particular China, as we continue to reshape our workforce footprint to support our strategic objectives and to position us well for the future. Our data indicates that these recent recruits are performing strongly although, in some areas of the business, retention of this population is challenging.\n\nVoluntary employee turnover decreased to 9.7% (2019: 10.5%). The voluntary employee turnover rate among our high performers increased in 2020 to 7.2% (2019: 7.0%), while the voluntary employee turnover of recent hires increased to 14.7% (2019: 14.4%). We seek to reduce regretted turnover through more effective hiring and onboarding, exit interviews, risk assessments and retention plans.\n\nThe uncertainty faced by individuals and their families following the UK's departure from the EU could have an impact on hiring and retaining staff in some business-critical areas. Consequently, we continue to provide extensive support and information to employees who might be impacted, monitor trends in recruitment and resignation closely, and guide new hires through our recruitment process.\n\n## A culture of high performance\n\nA high-performing workforce underpins our success and, in 2020, our high performers were promoted at twice the rate of the wider employee population. We require every employee to have high-quality objectives, aligned to our strategy, which we monitor closely. To advance our high-performing organisation, in 2020 we took the decision to remove performance ratings and shift our focus to coaching, development and contribution to the organisation.\n\nApproximately 7,000 line managers have participated in development workshops to support this. Managers are accountable for working with their teams to develop individual and team performance targets, and for ensuring employees understand how they contribute to our overall business objectives.\n\nTo support our ambition to be a Great Place to Work, in May 2020 we introduced a global recognition platform, aligned to our Values, to drive engagement, collaboration and to ensure we celebrate our successes and achievements. The initiative has been successful, with 55,000 employees being recognised in 2020.\n\nOur salary and bonus budgets are distributed in line with our principles, allowing us to differentiate reward according to performance clearly. We encourage participation in various employee share plans, some of which are\n\ndescribed in the Directors' Remuneration Report from page 131 and in Note 28 to the Financial Statements from page 225.\n\n## Listening to our workforce\n\nEmployee opinion surveys help us measure employee sentiment and engagement, and progress in our aim of being a great place to work. Comparing our most recent survey (November 2020) to the previous year (November 2019), of the 20 questions common to both surveys, we improved in 18 questions and saw minor decreases for two, although the scores for these two questions were still above 90% favourable. We continue to score highly for questions related to our Purpose and company direction, patient centricity, and employee commitment to AstraZeneca's success. We saw signi/ficant increases in questions around senior leader communication, prioritisation, and being able to challenge decisions and actions not aligned to our Values. We also exceeded our scorecard target for 'I would recommend AstraZeneca as a great place to work'. Importantly, we continue to see positive scores for the proportion of employees who felt 'comfortable to speak up and express their opinion'.\n\nWe also track a set of questions related to\n\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand how well we are supporting our employees through this challenging time. The responses were positive and encouraging, with 91% of employees replying favourably that they are getting the support they need during this time. Our employees were also invited to participate in a crowdsourcing event - COVID-19: Now & Next. Almost half our employees participated and more than 12,000 people from across 47 countries contributed ideas, reactions and comments. For more detail, see from page 18.\n\n## Developing a culture of lifelong learning\n\nWe encourage employees to take ownership of their own development and expect leaders to spend time supporting their employees' development.\n\nIn early 2019, we took a decision to review how we support the learning and development of our people and this continued through 2020. This work involved a substantial investment to develop a culture of lifelong learning and support the up-skilling and re-skilling of our people. This included a new operating model and global team, and the implementation of a global online learning platform providing on-demand access to a comprehensive library of educational resources. Over 600,000 resources have been accessed since launch.\n\n## Developing our people\n\nThrough our 'Leading Enterprise' programme, we have invested heavily in supporting our top 150 senior leaders to develop their resilience,\n\nagility and adaptive leadership skills to be able to lead with purpose through increasingly ambiguous times. Our other differentiated development programmes, such as 'Leading Self', 'Leading People', and 'Leading Business' programmes, continue to impact engagement and retention measures positively. These are supported by 'Employee Essentials' and 'Manager Essentials', which provide a curated set of digital resources to support foundational business skills and manager capability.\n\nOur 'Women as Leaders' programme aims to encourage more women into senior roles. Approximately 800 women had completed the programme by the end of 2020, with continuing feedback that it is providing positive career outcomes for the participants. In addition, we have developed women's networks in most countries, continued to hold empowerment summits in various locations around the world and to support mentoring relationships, for example, introducing mentoring by senior women for emerging talent in Operations.\n\nWe continue to offer our 'Rising Leaders Experience', a development programme aimed at emerging talent who demonstrate the potential to reach senior leadership roles, and in 2020 supplemented this with our 'Accelerate' programme, designed to develop our talent from Emerging Markets.\n\nWe continue to provide a global mentoring programme, with the aim of pairing mentors and mentees in order to encourage personal development and to support the implementation of a culture of lifelong learning. This has been successful, with over 1,700 mentors registered and almost 11,000 mentor-mentee relationships established.\n\nIn 2020, 60% of vacancies across the top three levels of our organisation were /filled internally, re/flecting our long-term commitment to develop high-quality leaders and the rigour of our leadership succession planning.\n\n## Champions of inclusion and diversity\n\nTo foster innovation, we seek to harness different perspectives, talents and ideas, as well as ensuring that our employees re/flect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. We focus on inclusive leadership at all levels, creating a culture where people feel able to speak their mind, as well as building a diverse leadership and talent pipeline. Our Values are supported by a clear set of behavioural statements. In 2020, we updated these statements to re/flect more clearly our commitment to inclusion and diversity.\n\nWe have implemented numerous initiatives across our global population, such as unconscious bias training, and have encouraged and supported the formation of various employee resource groups (such as a neurodiversity network) and updated",

To help ensure that our people feel safe and empowered to speak their mind, we introduced 'Meeting of Minds', a framework for conducting meetings that enables constructive challenge and active listening.\n\nOur Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) Council, chaired by the CEO, continues to inform our strategy. In 2020, we held our /first global 'Power of Diversity' week, a series of events aimed at emphasising and celebrating the importance of inclusion, diversity and creating an environment where our differences are recognised and our uniqueness is valued, across our entire workforce.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nOur commitments include a goal to increase the number of women on our leadership teams. As shown in the gender diversity /figure on this page, women comprise 50.5% of our global workforce. With the appointment of Diana Lay/field in November 2020 there were /five women on our Board (36% of the total) at the end of 2020. Below Board level, the representation of women in senior roles (i.e. roles at Career Level F or above which constitute the six highest bands of our employee population) increased to 46.9% in 2020 (2019: 45.4%), which exceeded our scorecard target of 46.2% for this measure and compares favourably to external benchmarks. Women are also currently promoted at a higher rate than men across all levels of seniority, positively impacting the gender balance.\n\nOur improved representation of women on the Board (36%) and women on the SET and direct reports (43%) exceeds the HamptonAlexander review target of 33% by 2020. The 2020 Hampton-Alexander review rankings will be published in February 2021. We also retained our position in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index in 2020.\n\n## Racial and ethnic diversity\n\nDiversity is integrated into our Code of Ethics and its associated Workforce Global Policy as described on page 61. In addition to the two diversity metrics tracked in the AstraZeneca scorecard (representation of women in senior roles and senior leadership country of origin that is an Emerging Market or Japan), on a bi-annual basis, the Senior Executive Team (SET) and Board are provided with a comprehensive overview of the AstraZeneca workforce, covering a wide range of metrics and measures (including trends around gender diversity, leadership ethnic diversity and age pro/file). The SET is also provided with a quarterly summary of key workforce metrics, including gender diversity and leadership ethnic diversity. Within the US, we track overall ethnic minority representation, ethnic minority representation in senior roles and ethnic minority representation in succession plans.\n\nIn support of our commitment to racial equity, our I&D Council has developed a comprehensive plan to ensure that the actions we take are meaningful and sustainable with long-term impact. Our commitments are aligned to our I&D strategy, and see us making contributions both to our company and society more broadly. They include ensuring that our workforce is representative of the communities in which we operate, taking action at each stage of our talent pipeline to increase representation, and driving change beyond our company by ensuring that we re/flect the diversity of the communities we serve. Within the UK, AstraZeneca has signed up to the Race at Work Charter (working with the Business in the Community organisation) to address the recommendations of the McGregor-Smith Review and the UK Government's response to the review.\n\nTo ensure that our senior leadership re/flects our diverse geographic footprint, we track the country of origin of senior leaders and re/flect this in our diversity targets. In 2020, 18.4% of employees who are either members of the SET, or their direct reports, have a country of origin that is an Emerging Market or Japan (an increase from 5% in 2012, although slightly below our 2020 scorecard ambition of 20%).\n\nThe Parker Review (which was set up by the UK Government in 2017 to focus on the ethnic diversity of FTSE 100 Boards) set a target to have at least one Board member from an ethnic minority background by 2021. AstraZeneca currently has two Board members who identify as belonging to an ethnic minority.\n\nWe are committed to hiring and promoting talent ethically and in compliance with applicable laws. Our Code of Ethics and its supporting Standards are designed to help protect against discrimination on any grounds (including disability) and cover recruitment and selection, performance management, career development and promotion, transfer, training, retraining (including retraining, if needed, for people who have become disabled), and reward. Our Global Standard for Inclusion and Diversity sets out how we foster an inclusive and diverse workforce where everyone feels valued and respected because of their individual ability and perspective. More information on our Standards and Global Policy framework can be found on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\nIn addition to our Global Standard on Inclusion and Diversity, we recently launched two further Global Standards on sexual harassment, and harassment and bullying. Drawing on our commitment to respect each other and uphold equal opportunity, we aim to build a culture where everyone feels safe to speak up. These Standards are reinforced by training and education on the importance of speaking up (which includes challenging\n\n## Gender diversity\n\n## Board of Directors of the Company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSenior Executive Team\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAstraZeneca employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll numbers as at 31 December 2020.",

To that end, we integrate human rights considerations into our processes and practices. We are also committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human traf/ficking in our supply chains or any part of our business. We provide assurance annually to the Audit Committee and our full statement required under section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and Section II (14) of the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 is available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\nWe support the principles set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) standards on child labour and minimum wages. We have been members of the United Nations Global Compact on Human Rights since 2010.\n\nWe measure human rights by means of a labour review survey every two years in all countries where we have a presence. Where local gaps to ILO minimum standards are identi/fied, we put in place local plans to close those gaps where allowed by relevant national legislation. Based on the last report, we have improved our practices to meet a number of standards, including the length of breaks during the working day in Hungary, which means 100% of countries now meet this minimum standard. 100% of countries also now meet the minimum standard for paid holiday. We have increased maternity paid leave up to the minimum standard of 14 paid weeks in Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In addition to these achievements, all countries now have a grievance policy in place and have implemented measures to prevent and deal with any kind of harassment or discrimination in the workplace. Our reporting in this area is assured by Bureau Veritas.\n\nIn 2017, we signed up to the 'Fair Wage' database. These independently produced data were used in our end of 2018 and 2020 surveys to measure against the real earnings of all our employees, and we performed well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information about the assurance provided by Bureau Veritas, see page 275. For more information on our restructuring programme, see the Financial Review from page 82.\n\n## Managing change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn December 2020, we took the decision to transform our customer engagement model in our US business, in order to adapt to changing customer needs, and to deliver against our evolving portfolio of medicines. As a result of these changes, we will remove approximately 500 positions. We are committed to making outplacement services available to support our impacted employees through this period.\n\n- For more information on our restructuring programme, see the Financial Review from page 82.\n\n## Employee relations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe seek to follow a global approach to employee relations guided by global employment principles and standards, local laws and good practice. In July 2019, we established a new Global Function for Employee Relations.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to build and maintain a positive work environment where every employee can feel safe, with the right terms and conditions, productive, motivated and able to speak up. The Board of Directors, in collaboration with our Global Compliance and Employee Relations functions, supports our efforts to create a 'Speak Up' culture to encourage employees to express their opinions and prevent and detect any behaviour not in line with our Values, Code of Ethics and Global Standards. The Audit Committee also checks the sexual harassment and harassment and bullying process activities and cases periodically.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we also work to develop and maintain good relations with local workforces and work closely with our recognised national trade unions. We also regularly consult with employee representatives or, where applicable, trade unions, who share our aim of retaining key skills and mitigating job losses. According to our internal Human Rights survey carried out in 2020, 75% of our employees recognise and have a relationship with trade unions. Where trade unions do not exist in an area of operation, 100% of countries have established arrangements to engage similarly with their workforce.\n\n## Safety, health and wellbeing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe work to promote a safe, healthy and energising work environment for our workforce and partners. Our standards apply globally and are stated in our Code of Ethics as described on page 61 and are available on www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability. We have established and monitor a set of safety, health and wellbeing targets aimed at supporting our workforce and keeping AstraZeneca among the sector leaders in performance. Our performance in this area is in the Sustainability Report and Sustainability Data Summary available on www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability and is assured by Bureau Veritas.\n\n- For more information about the assurance provided by Bureau Veritas, see page 275.\n\n## Safety\n\n## Vehicle collisions\n\n| Year          |   Collisions  per million km 1 | Target not  to exceed   |\n|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2020          |                           2.21 | 3.20                    |\n| 2019          |                           2.84 | 3.39                    |\n| 2018          |                           3.69 | 3.58                    |\n| 2017          |                           4.05 | 3.76                    |\n| 2016          |                           4.66 | 4.00                    |\n| 2015 baseline |                           4.13 |                         |\n\n- 1 AZ overall collisions per million km for 2018 has been revised after amendments from the US Commercial Group.\n\n## Work-related injuries\n\n| Year          |   Reportable injury rate   per million hours  worked/two.superior | Target not  to exceed   |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2020          |                                                              0.63 | 1.25                    |\n| 2019          |                                                              1.11 | 1.37                    |\n| 2018          |                                                              1.32 | 1.50                    |\n| 2017          |                                                              1.48 | 1.60                    |\n| 2016          |                                                              1.57 | 1.69                    |\n| 2015 baseline |                                                              1.78 |                         |\n\nAs shown above, we made further progress against our strategic targets in 2020, achieving a 46% reduction in vehicle collision rate and a 64% reduction in the work-related injury rate from the 2015 baseline.

We operate in a way that broadens access to healthcare and addresses health disparity, minimises the environmental footprint of our products and processes, and ensures that ethics and transparency underpin everything we do.\n\nOur approach to sustainability is aligned with our Purpose, business strategy and stakeholder engagement, allowing us to maximise the bene/fit for our patients, our business, broader society and the planet. As outlined below, we have a global sustainability strategy that integrates sustainability practices throughout our operations and is based on a structured materiality assessment that engages external and internal stakeholders. We measure our progress through annual and long-term targets, and share periodic updates with analysts, institutional investors, and credit and sustainability rating agencies.\n\nWe recognise the connection between enterprise risk management and sustainability management. Enterprise risk management helps inform the sustainability materiality assessment and we have better aligned our risk and sustainability classi/fications. Sustainability is considered throughout our quarterly risk reviews.\n\nWe show performance in our Sustainability Data Summary. Expanded discussion about our sustainability journey is in our 2020 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nSustainability governance frames how we operate. During 2020, Genevi\u00e8ve Berger, Non-Executive Director, oversaw sustainability matters on behalf of the Board. Nazneen Rahman, Non-Executive Director, assumed these responsibilities from January 2021. Our ambition is to be a leader in sustainability by delivering the strategy from the materiality assessment carried out in 2018 and as outlined in our Sustainability Report. Katarina Ageborg, Executive Vice-President, Sustainability and Chief Compliance Of/ficer, and President AstraZeneca AB, Sweden, is responsible for the global strategy, and performance measures are tracked by the SET on the quarterly Company Scorecard.\n\nOur Sustainability Advisory Board comprises /five SET members and four external sustainability experts. In 2020, it provided guidance on strategic direction, recommendations for opportunities, and insights and feedback. Throughout the year, we engaged with employees and external stakeholders, including investors, Ministries of Health, NGOs, patients and suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further examples in this Annual Report include the Young Health Programme (see this page) and Emerging market healthcare (see page 61). More detail on our access programmes can be found in our 2020 Sustainability Report, available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\n## Healthy Lung\n\nThe Healthy Lung initiative aims to support increased awareness and prevention; earlier diagnosis; improved treatment and disease management; and establishing standards of care in line with international best practice for asthma and COPD.\n\nSince inception, Healthy Lung has:\n\n- > Supported the training of more than 103,000 healthcare professionals.\n- > Enabled diagnosis of more than 1.56 million cases of asthma and/or COPD.\n- > Activated more than 2,530 Respiratory Centres.\n- > Aligned 131 national care guidelines and care pathways to international best practice.\n\nThe programme is present in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa.\n\nHealthy Heart Africa (HHA) is AstraZeneca's innovative programme committed to tackling hypertension (high blood pressure) and the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Africa. To achieve this, HHA supports local health systems by increasing awareness of the symptoms and risks of hypertension and by offering education, screening, treatment where appropriate, and control. The programme is currently active in both East and West Africa.\n\nSince launching in Kenya six years ago and subsequently expanding to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda. HHA has:\n\n- > Conducted 16.7 million blood pressure screenings in the community and in healthcare facilities.\n- > Trained more than 7,360 healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and community health volunteers.\n- > Activated more than 820 healthcare facilities in Africa to provide hypertension services.\n- > Identi/fied more than three million elevated blood pressure readings.\n\n## Young Health Programme\n\nThe Young Health Programme (YHP) is a non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention programme focused on young people aged 10 to 24 and delivered in partnership with Plan International UK, Project Hope and more than 30 other not-for-pro/fit organisations around the world. In 2020, UNICEF joined YHP as its newest partner, expanding advocacy activities in Angola, Belize, Brazil, Indonesia, Jamaica and South Africa. Together with UNICEF, YHP aims to reach /five million young people, train 1,000 youth advocates and positively shape public policy around the world through 2025.\n\nIn 2020, we directly reached more than one million young people with health information on NCDs and risk behaviours and trained more than 54,000 peer educators and healthcare workers. We launched new programmes in Bulgaria, Colombia, Egypt, France, Slovenia and the UK and, in line with our goal to support the development of young leaders, we offered 20 scholarships in partnership with One Young World.\n\nA number of YHP countries completed multi-year programme evaluations in 2020 to measure changes in young people's knowledge, attitude and behaviours towards NCDs and NCD risk behaviours. In Kenya, preliminary /findings show substantive changes between baseline (n=470) and /final evaluation (n=424), for example: current smokers decreased from 47.2% at baseline to 5.9% at /final evaluation; young people not meeting the WHO recommendation of fruit and vegetable intake declined from 93.1% at baseline to 37.8 % at /final evaluation; and young people not meeting the WHO recommendation for physical activity declined /fivefold from 71.7% at baseline to 16.3% at /final evaluation. It is our hope that this behaviour change will continue, positively in/fluencing the future health outcomes of these young people.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a signi/ficant impact on young people around the world. We adapted our health education programming to reach more than 2 million young people digitally and, where appropriate, included COVID-19 information. We provided grants to support hygiene and education programmes to UNICEF, Plan International and Project Hope to support their humanitarian relief efforts. We also provided Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with a grant to support a new 18-month research project to understand the challenges and implications of the pandemic on young people living in urban poor communities in 11 cities around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on YHP can be found on its website, www.younghealthprogrammeyhp.com.\n\n## Environmental protection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe follow the science to protect the planet by managing our impact on the environment across our value chain, from R&D activities, our own operations, into our supply chain and customer use of products. Our 2020 targets (against a 2015 baseline) included:\n\n- > Reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint by 50% to 314 ktCO2e.\n- > Limiting the increase in our energy consumption to no more than 6% to 1,938 GWh.\n- > Limiting the increase in our waste generation to less than 24% to 38,173 tonnes.\n- > Reducing water use by 10% to 3.89 million m 3 .\n\nIn 2020, $19 million (2019: $15 million) was invested in natural resource ef/ficiency projects at our manufacturing and R&D sites, and a further $28 million has been committed for 2021.",

This has led to changes in the data from previous years. Our primary GHG footprint KPI is emissions from all Scope 1 and 2 categories. Previously we included select Scope 3 sources, which are now calculated in our Scope 3 reporting. Numbers have been updated for all three years. The majority of adjustments made are not material individually, except for Scope 1 road fleet (Scope 1 reporting boundary adjusted to leased vehicles only, with personal vehicles accounted in Scope 3). The data quoted in this Annual Report are generated from the revised data.\n- 2 The data coverage includes 100% of sites that are both owned and controlled globally.\n- 3 Construction and Demolition data is excluded from waste data.\n- 4 Regular review of the data is carried out to ensure accuracy and consistency. This has led to changes in the data from previous years. Adjustments have also been made due to change in site ownership.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions reduction\n\nWe launched our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy in January 2020 to accelerate all of our decarbonisation plans. This strategy supersedes our previous Operational GHG footprint target that was a combination of Scope 1, 2 and selected Scope 3 sources. We are taking actions to eliminate Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our sites and /fleet by 2025, without carbon credits, and to become carbon negative across our entire Scope 3 value chain by 2030. To support achievement of these goals we joined The Climate Group's energy productivity campaign 'EP100' in 2020 and accelerated our existing commitments to renewable energy, RE100, and having a zero emission marketing /fleet, EV100.\n\nOur new GHG targets exceed the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 degrees celsius, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. Our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been reduced by 60% from our 2015 baseline. Although our Scope 3 emissions sources continue to /fluctuate, we have made progress towards our 2025 science-based targets for these emission sources through strategic developments, including committing to changing the propellants used in our inhalers, improving our switching of freighting of goods from air to sea and rail, and engaging our key suppliers to set science-based targets and renewable energy goals.\n\n- For more information on our pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) therapies, see the Product environmental stewardship section below.\n\n## Energy use\n\nWe recognise that energy ef/ficiency is the key to a sustainable and cost-effective GHG reduction plan. By 2025, we aim to reduce total energy consumption by 10% from our 2015 baseline, double our energy productivity relative to revenue, and substitute 100% of our energy demand with certi/fied renewable sources for power and heat. Our resource ef/ficiency capital fund invested $19 million in resource ef/ficiency projects in 2020, such as LED lighting and utility ef/ficiency at our Maccles/field, UK site. In 2020, our energy use was 1,595 GWh, a decrease of 13% from our 2015 baseline and we achieved 99.9% supply of certi/fied renewable imported power across all our sites worldwide.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on GHG emissions reporting, see Sustainability: Supplementary Information on page 275.\n\n## Waste management\n\nDue to anticipated activity growth across our site network in 2020, we aimed to limit increases in our waste volumes to a 24% increase from our 2015 baseline. In 2020, our total waste was 30,262 metric tonnes, a 2% decrease on 2015. As waste generation is linked to production volumes, our waste reduction ambitions are going to be challenged as our business grows. However, we are focusing on processes to boost our operational ef/ficiency and investing in waste reduction projects to help us reach our target to reduce waste generation by 10% by 2025. While waste prevention is an essential goal, we seek to maximise treatment by material recycling and avoiding land/fill disposal when prevention is impractical.\n\n## Water stewardship\n\nWe recognise the need to use water responsibly and, where possible, to minimise water use in our facilities. In 2020, we targeted a 10% reduction from our 2015 water use. In 2020, our water footprint was 3.44 million m 3 , a 20% reduction from our 2015 baseline. Water reduction and reuse projects throughout our site network have improved the ef/ficiency of water use across our operations. In 2020, we collaborated with WWF to analyse the physical, reputational and regulatory water risks across our global operations to establish how we can strengthen our water stewardship programme.\n\n## Product environmental stewardship\n\nWe are committed to ensuring effective environmental management of our products from pre-launch through to product end-of-life. We work at all stages of a medicine's life-cycle from the design of API production and formulation processes, devices and packaging through to distribution, patient use and /final disposal. We prioritise our efforts guided by our life-cycle assessment (LCA) programme that identi/fies where, in the product value chain, the most signi/ficant environmental impacts occur.\n\nDuring 2020, we /finalised a Product Sustainability Index scoring methodology covering signi/ficant categories of environmental impact. As we roll out this framework across the business, it will ensure that environmental impacts are understood and minimised throughout the development and commercialisation of a product. A key product-related element of our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy, which launched in January 2020, is our commitment to become carbon",

We expect the propellant used in our next-generation pMDI to have an environmental footprint, measured as GWP, that is 90-99% lower than propellants used in existing pMDIs. During 2020, we progressed a project spanning all key functions in the business to investigate alternative low-GWP propellant options from an environmental, technical, regulatory, medical, non-clinical and commercial viewpoint.\n\n## Pharmaceuticals in the environment\n\nWe aim to lead our industry in understanding and mitigating the effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment (PIE). An estimated 98% of pharmaceuticals get into the environment as a result of patient use (excretion or improper disposal). While API discharge from production is only a small proportion of the environmental burden, it is the part we as an industry can deal with directly. We manage the manufacturing discharge of our APIs in a responsible manner to ensure that we do not exceed the safe discharge standards from all of our own manufacturing sites and from at least 90% of key suppliers. We review compliance with these safe discharge standards annually.\n\nAs part of our progress towards our 2025 environmental targets, our 2020 targets included:\n\n- > Safe API discharges for AstraZeneca sites (100%) and globally managed /first-tier suppliers (>90%). Target met.\n- > Management of PIE through our ecopharmacovigilance programme. Target met.\n\nA thorough assessment of the environmental risks resulting from the patient use of all our APIs has indicated that all our medicines currently pose low or insigni/ficant environmental risk and our ongoing ecopharmacovigilance of published data on our APIs has not highlighted any additional risks or changed our safe discharge concentrations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further information on our efforts in these areas, including environmental risk assessment data for our medicines, is available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/ sustainability/environmental-sustainability.\n\n## Contributing to society\n\nWe aim to make a signi/ficant /financial and non-/financial contribution to the communities in which we operate. This comprises our medicines for patients and our focus on sustainability for people and the environment. As a science-led, patient-focused pharmaceutical company, our innovative medicines impact millions of lives annually. But our contribution to society extends beyond this to include our wider efforts to bene/fit people and the planet. Additionally, wherever we work in the world, we aim to make a positive impact on our communities, making /financial contributions, supporting healthcare and STEM education programmes, volunteering, and through product donations.\n\nAs a major investor, employer and taxpayer, we also make a signi/ficant contribution to the economies of all the countries in which we operate. We pay corporate income taxes, customs duties, excise taxes, stamp duties, employment and many other business taxes where applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we collect and pay employee taxes and indirect taxes such as value-added tax.\n\n## Community investment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Global Standard on External Funding encompasses community investment and provides guidance to ensure a consistent, transparent and ethical approach around the world, based on local need. Our activities are focused on healthcare in the community and supporting science education. They include /financial and non-/financial contributions. In 2020, we gave more than $76 million (2019: $72 million) through our community investment activities to more than 1,300 non-pro/fit organisations in 88 countries. The amount includes more than $20 million (2019: $27.4 million) for product donations that were given in support of public health needs and disaster relief. In addition to these community investments, we also donated more than $1.6 billion (2019: $801 million) of medicines in connection with patient assistance programmes around the world, the largest of which is our AZ&Me programme in the US. The increase re/flects a larger number of patients enrolled in our programme and the mix of products donated.\n\n## 25m\n\nOur access to healthcare programmes, including Healthy Heart Africa, Healthy Lung, Phakamisa, and Young Health Programme (YHP), have reached 25 million people (2019: 20.5 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, we gave more than $76 million (2019: $72 million) through our community investment activities to more than 1,300 non-profit organisations in 88 countries\n\n## >$76m",

In 2020, we reached over 1.25 million students and educators with engaging and accessible STEM education, including our Ask a Scientist video series which generated more than 375,000 views, and our virtual STEM festivals achieved registration of over 150,000 STEM enthusiasts around the world. Our signature initiative Generation Health: How Science Powers Us reached more than one million students and has become a steadfast resource for teachers and parents in the US and around the world, as they look for resources to support at-home learning.\n\nWe continue to support Connections for Cardiovascular Health SM (CCH), a programme of the AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation launched in 2010 to address heart health in the US. In 2020, CCH marked its tenth anniversary and launched CCH Next Generation by providing $1.02 million in grants to nine non-pro/fit organisations for programmes that aim to help prevent, better manage and reduce cardiovascular disease.\n\nMaking a positive impact on our communities is also about volunteering.

        "page_content": "## Risk Overview\n\nWe face a diverse range of risks and uncertainties. Those risks that have the potential to have a material impact on our business or results of operations are our Principal Risks.\n\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of the Principal and Emerging risks facing the Group. The table overleaf provides insight into the ongoing Principal Risks, outlining why effective management of these risks is important and relevant to the business, how we are managing them and which risks are rising, falling or have remained static during the past 12 months. The procedures in place to identify emerging risks are explained below.\n\n## Managing risk\n\nOur approach to risk management is designed to encourage clear decision making on which risks we take and how we manage these risks. Fundamental to this process is a sound understanding of every risk's potential strategic, commercial, /financial, compliance, legal and reputational implications.\n\nWe work to ensure that we have effective risk management processes in place to support the delivery of our strategic priorities. This enables us to meet the expectations of our stakeholders and upholds our Values. The Board believes that existing processes provide it with adequate information on the risks and uncertainties we face. Further information can be found in Risk from page 254, which includes a description of circumstances under which Principal and other risks and uncertainties might arise in the course of our business and their potential impact.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nEmerging risks are 'new' risks which may challenge us in the future. They have the potential to crystallise at some point in the future but are unlikely to impact the business during the next year. The outcome of such risks is often more uncertain. They may begin to evolve rapidly or simply not materialise.\n\nWe monitor our business activities and external and internal environments for new, emerging and changing risks to ensure that these are managed appropriately. Annually, we combine input from each SET function and external insight to scan the horizon for emerging risks. A summary of emerging risks is presented for assessment to the Audit Committee and the Board. Emerging risks continue to be monitored as part of our ongoing risk management processes.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nThe identi/fication and assessment of climate risk form part of our existing risk management processes as described below. 'Failure to meet regulatory and ethical expectations on environmental impact, including climate change' has been added to the Group's risk landscape as a standalone enduring risk during 2020, having been included as a\n\nsub-risk within the broader Health, Safety and Environment risk previously. The Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section, (see from page 276), summarises work undertaken to date to understand the potential impact of climate change on our business and outlines future areas of management focus.\n\n## Risk management embedded in business processes\n\nWe strive to embed sound risk management in our strategy, planning, budgeting and performance management processes.\n\nThe Board de/fines the Group's risk appetite, enabling the Group, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, to judge the level of risk it is prepared to take in achieving its overall objectives. The Board expresses the acceptable levels of risk for the Group using three key dimensions. These are: (i) earnings and cash /flow; (ii) return on investment; and (iii) ethics and reputation. Annually, the Group develops a detailed three-year bottom-up business plan and 10-year long-range projection to support the delivery of its strategy. The Board considers these in the context of the Group's risk appetite. Adjustments are made to the plan or risk appetite to ensure that they remain aligned. Our risk management approach is aligned to our strategy and business planning processes. We cross-check /financial risks and opportunities identi/fied through the business planning process and integrate our /findings into the overall risk management reporting. Line managers are accountable for identifying and managing risks and for delivering business objectives in accordance with the Group's risk appetite.\n\nThe SET is required by the Board to oversee and monitor the effectiveness of the risk management processes implemented by management. Within each SET function, leadership teams discuss the risks the business faces. This process provides a Group-wide assessment for the Board, Audit Committee and SET. Quarterly, each SET function assesses changes to these risks, new and emerging risks, and mitigation plans. These are assimilated into a Group Risk Report for the Board, Audit Committee and SET. Supporting tools are in place to assist risk leaders and managers in managing, monitoring and planning for risk. We continue to work on developing our risk management standards and guidelines. Global Compliance, Finance and Internal Audit Services support SET by advising on policy and standard setting, monitoring and auditing, and communication and training, as well as reporting on the adequacy of line management processes as they apply to risk management.\n\nWe have a business resilience framework which governs our ability to prevent or quickly adapt to situations while maintaining continuous business operations and safeguarding our people, processes and reputation. Within this we have business continuity plans to address situations in which speci/fic risks have the potential to severely impact our business. These plans include training and crisis simulation activities for business managers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- More information about our Global Compliance function and the Code of Ethics can be found in the Corporate Governance Report, see page 118, and the Business Review, see page 61.\n\n## Viability statement\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has determined that a three-year period to 31 December 2023 constitutes an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement.\n\nThe Board considers annually and on a rolling basis, a three-year bottom-up detailed business plan. The Board also assesses the company's prospects using a 10-year long-range projection but, given the inherent uncertainty involved, believes that the three-year statement presents readers of this Annual Report with a reasonable degree of assurance while still providing a longer-term perspective.\n\nThe three-year detailed business plan captures risks to the sales and cost forecasts at a market and SET function level. The plan is used to perform central net debt and headroom pro/file analysis. The following scenarios have been applied to this analysis to create a severe but plausible downside combining some of the Principal Risks, see from page 80:\n\n- > Scenario 1 Principal Risks: pricing, affordability, access and competitive pressures; failures or delays in the quality or execution of the Group's commercial strategies. Government action on pricing and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic results in higher than expected pressure on pricing and lower than anticipated growth rates for our medicines.\n- > Scenario 2 Principal Risk: failure or delay in the delivery of our pipeline or launch of new medicines. Assumes no launches of new products.\n- > Scenario 3 Principal Risk: failure to maintain supply of compliant, quality medicines. Major equipment failure or signi/ficant regulatory observation at one of our major manufacturing sites results in a 12-month supply interruption for one of our key oncology products.",

A signi/ficant incident leads to reputational damage in a key market resulting in an ongoing reduction in market share.\n- > Scenario 5 Principal Risks: failure in information technology or cybersecurity; failure to meet regulatory and ethical expectations on commercial practices, including anti-bribery and corruption, and scienti/fic exchanges. Legal or regulatory non-compliance results in the levy of a signi/ficant /fine.\n\nIn addition, the Board has considered more stressed scenarios including restrictions on debt factoring. In each scenario or combination of scenarios above, the Group is able to rely on its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term /fixed income investments, committed credit facilities, leverage its cost base, reduce capital expenditure and take other cash management measures to mitigate the impacts and still have residual capacity to absorb further shocks.\n\nBased on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.\n\nOn 12 December 2020, the Group signed a de/finitive agreement to acquire Alexion subject to regulatory clearance and approval by shareholders of both companies. The deal is anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2021. The Directors have considered the funding requirements together with the forecast proforma /financial performance of the combined entity and have concluded that this transaction does not change the assessment of Viability as outlined above.\n\n## Brexit\n\nOn 23 June 2016, the UK held a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU, the outcome of which was a decision for the UK to leave the EU (Brexit). Following Royal Assent of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act on 23 January 2020 and rati/fication of the Withdrawal Agreement by the European Parliament on 24 January 2020, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and became a third country with a transition period which ran to 31 December 2020.\n\nOn 24 December 2020, the UK Government and European Commission agreed the terms of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement which sets out the relationship between the UK and the EU following the end of the transition period. Entering into this agreement was provisionally approved by the European\n\nCouncil on 29 December 2020 and the associated UK legislation received Royal Assent on 30 December 2020. The European Parliament is due to scrutinise the agreement formally in the coming months prior to providing its consent to it. The agreement comprises a Free Trade Agreement, rules on governance and dispute resolution and, security cooperation. The Free Trade Agreement provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin; maintains a level playing /field in areas such as environmental protection, social and labour rights, tax transparency and state aid, with enforcement and a binding dispute settlement mechanism; and maintains air, road, rail and maritime connectivity but with new customs and passport checks and limitations on haulage operations.\n\nUntil the European Parliament has consented to the European Commission entering into the agreement, there is no clarity on how the new agreement will operate in practice. It is therefore dif/ficult to anticipate the potential impact on AstraZeneca's market share, sales, pro/fitability and results of operations.\n\nThe Group operates from a global footprint and retains /flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. The continuing uncertainty on the impact of the practical implementation of the Trade and Cooperation agreement is expected to increase volatility and may have an economic impact, particularly in the UK and Eurozone.\n\nSince the time of the referendum in 2016, the Group has responded to the evolving situation by engaging proactively with key external stakeholders and establishing a cross-functional internal steering and implementation committee to understand, assess, plan and implement operational actions that may be required to mitigate risks associated with a no deal Brexit.\n\nThese actions have already been implemented based on an assumption that the UK would have left the EU without a deal or extension to the transition period under the Withdrawal Agreement on 31 December 2020 such that the Group has been able to mitigate the risks arising from variable external outcomes to the negotiation. Actions undertaken in this regard include, but are not limited to: engagement with governments and regulators; duplication of release testing and procedures for products for the EU27 in the EU; transfer of regulatory licences; redesign of packaging and labelling; additional inventory builds; changes to logistics plans and shipping routes; customs and duties set up for introduction of or amendment to tariffs or processes; associated IT systems recon/figurations; and banking arrangement changes.\n\nThe Board reviews the potential impact of Brexit regularly as an integral part of its Principal Risks (as outlined overleaf) rather than as a standalone risk. The Board most recently reviewed an update on the Group's Brexit readiness plans at its meeting in December 2020 and continues to assess its impact.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe risk 'failure of critical processes' (see page 262) incorporates the risk of disruption as a result of a pandemic. The Board does not consider this to be a Principal Risk in its own right. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group operations is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with con/fidence and the extent of any adverse impact on Group operations will depend on the global duration, extent and severity of the pandemic. To the extent that the pandemic adversely impacts Group operations and/or performance, the Company expects it to have the effect of heightening certain risks, including Principal Risks, such as those relating to the delivery of the pipeline or launch of new medicines, the execution of the Group's commercial strategy, the manufacturing and supply of new medicines, and reliance on third-party goods and services.\n\nOn 4 May 2020, the Group announced a collaboration with the University of Oxford for the development and distribution of the University's potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Though there are signi/ficant funding /flows associated with this collaboration, /financial risks for the Group are balanced by matching cash out/flows incurred during the development and manufacture of this vaccine with funding to secure supply received from government agencies and other international organisations. Any potential /financial exposure for the Group is limited. The Group has built capacity (which includes both internal and third-party capacity) for the manufacture of approximately 3 billion vaccine doses as a result of this collaboration and has entered into a number of supply agreements around the world. 'Failure to maintain supply of compliant, quality medicines' is one of the Group's Principal Risks disclosed on page 80. A failure to supply the vaccine as expected may lead to a negative reputational impact for the Group.",

Our continued investment in New Medicines was evidenced by the rapid growth of Product Sales in the Oncology and New CVRM therapy areas, which grew by 25% (CER: 26%) and 7% (CER: 8%) respectively. Globally, New Medicines sales, led by Tagrisso and Lynparza in Oncology and Brilinta and Farxiga in New CVRM delivered continued growth of 35% (CER: 36%) and represented 52% of total Product Sales. Within our sales platforms, we continue to see sales growth in Emerging Markets with sales increasing by 6% (CER: 10%), primarily driven by China, which comprised 62% of Product Sales within that region and generated growth of 10% (CER: 10%).\n\nCollaboration Revenue declined by 11% (CER: 11%) to $727 million and included $460 million of milestone payments from the ongoing MSD arrangement on Lynparza and selumetinib and a $94 million share of gross pro/fits arising from our alliance with Daiichi Sankyo for the development of Enhertu .\n\n## Investing in future growth\n\nWe continue to make focussed investments in the business to support our key objectives. Reported R&D expenses decreased by 1% (CER: 1%) to $5,991 million. Core R&D expenses increased by 10% (CER: 10%) to $5,872 million, re/flecting our continued investment in the Oncology pipeline. Reported Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by 3% (CER: 3%) with Core SG&A expenses increasing by 3% (CER: 4%). Within Core SG&A expenses, we saw investment in New Medicine launches and China expansion partially offset by COVID-19 pandemic-related savings.\n\n## Divestment activity\n\n2020 Reported and Core Other operating income was $1.5 billion and included income from various disposal transactions, including the sale of the international and Canadian rights for Atacand to Cheplapharm and the sale of the global rights excluding US, India and Japan for Zestril, Inderal and Tenormin to Atnahs.\n\n## Increased profitability\n\nWe are making good progress on delivering our operating leverage. In 2020, Reported Operating pro/fit grew by 77% (CER: 81%) to $5.2 billion and Core Operating pro/fit grew by 14% (CER: 17%) to $7.3 billion in the year, primarily driven by Product Sales growth. Reported Basic earnings per share (EPS) was $2.44 and Core EPS was $4.02.\n\n## Acquisition of Alexion\n\nIn December 2020, we were excited to announce that we had reached agreement with the board of Alexion to acquire 100% of the company. We are looking forward to building on our combined expertise, to enhance our presence in Immunology and drive the Group's strategic and /financial development. To support the /financing of the acquisition, AstraZeneca entered into committed bank facilities of $17.5 billion during December 2020.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented new challenges for the business with reduced elective surgery and hospitalisations for non-COVID-19-related illnesses impacting sales of our medicines. Notably, we mobilised our research efforts to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and developed the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in collaboration with the University of Oxford, as well as initiating clinical trials for AZD7442. We are delighted that the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca has been approved in the UK, Europe and other countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Marc Dunoyer\n\nChief Financial Officer",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\n## Business background and results overview\n\nThe business background is covered in the Healthcare in a changing world section from page 12, the Therapy Area Review from page 30 and the Performance in 2020 section from page 24, which describe in detail the business developments of our products.\n\nAs described earlier in this Annual Report, sales of our products are directly in/fluenced by medical need and are generally paid for by health insurance schemes or national healthcare budgets. Our operating results can be affected by a number of factors other than the delivery of operating plans and normal competition, such as:\n\n- > The risk of competition from generics following loss of patent protection or patent expiry of one of our products, or an 'at risk' launch by a competitor, or the launch of a competitive product in the same class as one of our products, with potential adverse effects on sales volumes and prices. Details of patent expiries for our key marketed products are included in Patent Expiries of Key Marketed Products from page 249.\n- > The adverse impact on pharmaceutical prices as a result of the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. For instance, in the US, political leadership has continued to consider drug pricing controls and transparency measures at national and local levels. In other parts of the world, governments have continued to implement and expand price control measures, including reference pricing.\n- > The timings of new product launches, which can be in/fluenced by national regulators, the speed to market relative to competitor products and the risk that such new products do not succeed as anticipated, together with the rate of sales growth and costs following new product launches.\n- > Currency /fluctuations. Our functional and reporting currency is the US dollar, but we have substantial exposures to other currencies, in particular the Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling and Swedish krona.\n- > Macro factors such as greater demand from an ageing population and increasing requirements of Emerging Markets.\n- > Supply chain risks including the failure of third parties to supply timely, quality products, such as raw materials, and the risk of catastrophic failure of critical internal processes leading to an inability to research, manufacture or supply products to patients.\n- Further details of the risks faced by the business are given in Risk Overview from page 78 and Risk from page 254.\n\nOver the longer term, the success of our R&D is crucial and we devote substantial resources to this area. The bene/fits of this investment are expected to emerge over the long term and there is considerable inherent uncertainty as to the scale and timing of outcomes and their transition to saleable products.\n\n## Measuring performance\n\nThe following measures are referred to in this Financial Review when reporting on our performance in absolute terms, but more often in comparison to earlier years:\n\n- > Reported performance : Reported performance takes into account all the factors (including those which we cannot in/fluence, such as currency exchange rates) that have affected the results of our business, as re/flected in our Group Financial Statements prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU. The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). On 31 December 2020, EU-adopted IFRS was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted international accounting standards, with future changes to IFRS being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board.\n- > Core performance : Core performance measures are adjusted to exclude certain signi/ficant items, using a set of established principles.\n- Readers should refer to our explanation of Core measures on page 85 for a detailed definition of this measure.\n\n## Use of non-GAAP performance measures\n\nNon-GAAP performance measures: Core performance measures, EBITDA, Net debt, Ongoing Collaboration Revenue and Initial Collaboration Revenue are non-GAAP /financial measures because they cannot be derived directly from the Financial Statements.\n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP performance measures, when provided in combination with Reported results, will provide investors with helpful supplementary information to understand the /financial performance and position of the Group better on a comparable basis from period to period. These non-GAAP performance measures are not a substitute for, or superior to, /financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBy disclosing non-GAAP performance and growth measures, in addition to our Reported /financial information, we are enhancing investors' ability to evaluate and analyse the /financial performance and trends of\n\nour ongoing business and the related key business drivers. The adjustments are made to our Reported /financial information in order to show non-GAAP performance measures that illustrate clearly, on a year-on-year or period-by-period basis, the impact on our performance caused by factors such as changes in revenues and expenses driven by volume, prices and cost levels relative to such prior years or periods.\n\nAs shown in the 2020 Reconciliation of Reported results to Core results table on page 86, our reconciliation of Reported /financial information to Core performance measures includes a breakdown of the items for which our Reported /financial information is adjusted, and a further breakdown by speci/fic line item as such items are re/flected in our Reported income statement. This illustrates the signi/ficant items that are excluded from Core performance measures and their impact on our Reported /financial information, both as a whole and in respect of speci/fic line items.\n\nManagement presents these results externally to meet investors' requirements for transparency and clarity. Core /financial measures are also used internally in the management of our business performance, in our budgeting process and when determining compensation. As a result, Core performance measures merely allow investors to differentiate between different kinds of costs and they should not be used in isolation.\n\n- Readers should also refer to our Reported financial information in the Summary performance in 2020 table on page 83, our reconciliation of Core performance measures to Reported financial information in the 2020 Reconciliation of Reported results to Core results table and the Excluded from Core results table on page 86 for our discussion of comparative Actual growth measures that reflect all factors that affect our business.\n\nOur determination of non-GAAP measures, and our presentation of them within this /financial information, may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies.\n\nThe SET retains strategic management of the costs excluded from Reported /financial information in arriving at Core /financial measures, tracking their impact on Reported Operating pro/fit and EPS, with operational management being delegated on a case-bycase basis to ensure clear accountability and consistency for each cost category.\n\nWe strongly encourage readers of the Annual Report not to rely on any single /financial measure but to review our Financial Statements, including the Notes thereto, and our other publicly /filed reports, carefully and in their entirety.",

Sales platforms grew by 11% (CER: 12%), representing 91% of Total Revenue after removing the effect of certain Product Sales which are included in more than one sales platform.\n\n## Oncology\n\nProduct Sales of Oncology medicines grew by 25% (CER: 26%) to $10,850 million in 2020, $4,328 million of which came from Tagrisso (2019: $3,189 million), which continues to be our leading medicine for the treatment of lung cancer and had received regulatory approval in more than 87 countries by the end of 2020.\n\n## Emerging Markets\n\nProduct Sales in Emerging Markets grew by 6% (CER: 10%) to $8,679 million mainly driven by strong performances from New Medicines. Product Sales in China increased by 10% in 2020 (CER: 10%), representing 62% of Emerging Markets Product Sales in the year.\n\n## Respiratory & Immunology\n\nProduct Sales of Respiratory & Immunology medicines declined by 1% (CER: stable) to $5,357 million, with growth in Fasenra and Symbicort being more than offset by a signi/ficant decline in sales of Pulmicort , which decreased by 32% (CER: 32%) in the year to $996 million, mainly in China, as the effect of COVID-19 impacted the treatment of respiratory patients.\n\n2019\n\n## New CVRM\n\nNew CVRM grew by 7% (CER: 8%) with revenue of $4,662 million, mainly re/flecting the strong performance of Farxiga with global sales of $1,959 million, representing growth of 27% (CER: 30%) as it continued to be our largest-selling CVRM medicine. Within New CVRM, sales of Brilinta in the year were $1,593 million, an increase of 1% (CER: 2%). Brilinta sales in the US were up 3% to $732 million, where an increase in the average duration of treatment was offset by an adverse COVID-19 impact, re/flecting fewer procedures.\n\n## Japan\n\nJapan Product Sales grew by 2% (CER: 1%) to $2,600 million with Tagrisso growing by 16% (CER: 14%) to $731 million being offset by declines in legacy products.",

Core Gross pro/fit increased by 9% (CER: 10%) to $21,442 million. These increases re/flected the growth of Product Sales.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nReported Total Operating expense declined by 2% (CER: 2%) in the year to $17,684 million and represented 66% of Total Revenue (2019: 74%). Core Total Operating expense increased by 6% (CER: 6%) to $15,633 million. Included in Operating expenses were additional costs and procedures related to COVID-19, such as personal protective equipment and employee testing.\n\nReported R&D expenses decreased by 1% (CER: 1%) to $5,991 million and Core R&D expenses increased by 10% (CER: 10%) to $5,872 million. The decline in Reported R&D expense was partly driven by the comparative effect of the $533 million impairment of Epanova in 2019. The growth in Core R&D expense included investment in the Oncology pipeline, such as the development of datopotomab deruxtecan and the ending in 2019 of the release of the upfront funding of the Lynparza development, as part of the aforementioned collaboration with MSD.\n\nReported SG&A expenses decreased by 3% (CER: 3%) to $11,294 million and Core SG&A expenses increased by 3% (CER: 4%) to $9,362 million. The difference in the movements of Reported and Core SG&A expenses partly re/flected fair value adjustments arising on acquisition-related liabilities, as well as a decrease in legal provisions recognised in comparison to 2019. Within Reported and Core SG&A expenses, pandemic-related savings partly compensated for investment in the launches of new medicines and expansion in China.\n\n## Other operating income and expense\n\nReported Other operating income and expense in the year was down 1% (CER: 1%) to $1,528 million and included $400 million from the sale of the international and Canadian rights for Atacand to Cheplapharm, $350 million on the sales of the global rights excluding the US, India and Japan for Zestril, Inderal and Tenormin to Atnahs, $120 million on the sale of an FDA Priority Review Voucher and $107 million of payments from Allergan in respect of the development of brazikumab.\n\nIn accordance with our Collaboration Revenue de/finition in the Group Accounting Policies from page 181 and the requirements of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', proceeds from these divestments are recorded as Other operating income and expense and comprise the majority of Other operating income and expense for the year.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nReported Operating pro/fit grew by 77% (CER: 81%) to $5,162 million in the year. The Reported Operating margin increased by seven percentage points (CER: eight percentage points) to 19% of Total Revenue. Core Operating pro/fit grew 14% (CER: 17%) in the year to $7,340 million. The Core Operating pro/fit margin increased by one percentage point (CER: two percentage points) to 28% of Total Revenue, as a result of revenue growth.\n\n## Net finance expense\n\nReported Net /finance expense decreased by 3% (CER: 4%) in the year to $1,219 million (2019: $1,260 million). Core Net /finance expense increased by 2% (CER: 2%) in the year to $782 million. The increase to Core Net /finance expense partly re/flected an adverse movement in securities and short-term deposits.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\n## Profit before tax\n\nReported Pro/fit before tax increased by 153% (CER: 157%) in 2020 to $3,916 million (2019: $1,548 million), re/flecting the increase in Total Revenue. Pre-tax adjustments to arrive at Core Pro/fit before tax amounted to $2,615 million in 2020 (2019: $4,007 million), comprising $2,178 million adjustments to Operating pro/fit (2019: $3,512 million) and $437 million to Net /finance expense (2019: $495 million). EBITDA increased by 24% (CER: 27%) to $8,311 million.\n\n## Taxation\n\nBoth the Reported and Core tax rates in the year were 20%. The income tax paid for the year was $1,562 million (40% of Reported Pro/fit before tax). This was $790 million higher than the Reported tax charge for the year, which bene/fited from a net deferred tax credit of $199 million (2019: $988 million), relating to the elimination of unrealised pro/fit on inventory, intangible amortisation and other deferred tax items, partially offset by a net $133 million deferred tax charge re/flecting the change in Dutch and UK income tax rates, cash liabilities arising on gains in equity investments recorded through Other comprehensive income and other cash tax timing differences. Additional information on these items is contained in Note 4 from page 190 to the Financial Statements.\n\nWe pay corporate income taxes, customs duties, excise taxes, stamp duties, employment and many other business taxes in all jurisdictions where applicable. In addition, we collect and pay employee taxes and indirect taxes such as value added tax.\n\n## Total comprehensive income\n\nTotal comprehensive income increased by $4,136 million to $4,752 million in 2020. Other comprehensive income for the period, net of tax was $1,608 million, an increase of $2,219 million. The increase was primarily driven by the Net gains/(losses) on equity investments measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income of $938 million (2019: $28 million loss) and Foreign exchange arising on designated borrowings in net investment hedges gains of $573 million (2019: loss of $252 million). A signi/ficant proportion of the Net gains/(losses) on equity investments measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income relates to gains recognised during the year from the sale of part of AstraZeneca's equity portfolio in the year, a large proportion of which related to the disposal of its full holding in Moderna as detailed in Note 12 from page 202 of the Financial Statements.\n\n## EPS\n\nReported EPS of $2.44 in the year was an increase of 137% (CER: 142%), driven by Revenue growth. Core EPS increased by 15% (CER: 18%) to $4.02. Reported growth in 2020 was impacted by the absence of the 2019 increase in legal provisions and higher intangible impairment charges.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn 2016, we announced plans to advance the strategy through sharper focus by streamlining operations, primarily in Commercial and Manufacturing, to redeploy investment to key therapy areas, particularly Oncology. Restructuring costs associated with this programme were initially forecast to be $1.5 billion by the end of 2017 and generate net annualised bene/fits of $1.1 billion by 2018. The total cost estimate is now $1.3 billion to be incurred by the end of 2021, with bene/fits expected to be $1.1 billion in 2021. In addition to the 2016 plan, there are two further active programmes. The /first is the continuation of the phase 3 restructuring that was announced in 2012, superseded by phase 4 in 2013 and subsequently expanded in 2014. This initiative consists of centralisation of our global R&D footprint into three strategic centres, transformation of the IT organisation, closure of a number of manufacturing facilities and other activities to simplify and streamline the organisation. At the time of the announcement, the phase 4 programme was estimated to incur $3.2 billion of costs and deliver $1.1 billion of annualised bene/fits by 2016. By the end of 2020, the phase 4 programme had incurred costs of $3.6 billion, creating headroom for investment in our pipeline and launch capability. The 2021 opening of our Cambridge R&D facility will enable us to successfully deliver on the vision of centralising AstraZeneca's leading research in strategic locations, while building upon the numerous pioneering projects and scienti/fic collaborations already underway in Cambridge. The phase 4 programme is now expected to conclude in 2023, upon completion of the ongoing consolidation of our sites and occupation of the Cambridge R&D facility. Total phase 4 programme costs are estimated to be $3.8 billion with annualised bene/fits of $1.2 billion. Out of that total, an estimated $716 million of costs are associated with the R&D transition to the new Cambridge footprint.\n\nThe second step was initiated in 2016 and relates to multi-year transformation programmes within our SG&A functions (principally Finance and HR) with anticipated costs by the end of 2018 of $270 million. By the end of 2020, these programmes had incurred costs of $471 million with total expected costs rising to $551 million. An estimated $116 million of annualised bene/fits are expected to be delivered in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, we initiated the Global PostPandemic New Ways of Working programme in response to the changing business environment, accelerated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. This programme is expected to run until the end of 2022 and incorporates the increasing utilisation of digitisation and technology, as well as the new ways of working that re/flect in the size, nature and footprint of commercial teams, enabling functions, R&D and operations. This programme is already underway in various regions including North America and Japan, with $72 million of costs incurred in 2020.\n\nThe aggregate restructuring charge incurred in 2020 across all our restructuring programmes was $251 million (2019: $347 million). Final estimates for programme costs, bene/fits and headcount impact in all functions are subject to completion of the requisite consultation in the various areas.\n\nOur priority, as we undertake these restructuring initiatives, is to work with our affected employees on the proposed changes, acting in accordance with relevant local consultation requirements and employment law.\n\n## Brexit readiness preparations and planning\n\nFollowing the UK referendum outcome in June 2016, the UK Government and European Commission negotiated the terms on which the UK would leave the EU and the framework for the future relationship. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 with a transition period running to 31 December 2020.\n\nOn 24 December 2020, the UK Government and European Commission agreed the terms of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement which sets out the relationship between the UK and the EU following the end of the transition period. The agreement comprises a Free Trade Agreement, rules on governance and dispute resolution, and security cooperation. The Free Trade Agreement: provides for zero tariffs and quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin; maintains a level playing /field in areas such as environmental protection, social and labour rights, tax transparency and state aid, with enforcement and a binding dispute settlement mechanism; and maintains air, road, rail and maritime connectivity but with new customs and passport checks and limitations on haulage operations. It is still too early to judge the full impact of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU on our market share, sales, pro/fitability, cash /flows and results of operations.",

In addition, the\n\nGroup engaged with its major suppliers to assess their readiness and continues to work with them to mitigate the risk of disruption to supply chains due to new border processes and potential port congestion. The costs associated with this and other actions directly related to Brexit are charged as restructuring, with the majority of such costs being cash costs. The costs incurred since the referendum are approximately $47 million of which $7 million was incurred in the year (2019: $28 million).\n\n## Cash flow and liquidity - for the year ended 31 December 2020\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities was $4,799 million for 2020 (2019: $2,969 million), re/flecting an underlying improvement to business performance.\n\nNet investment cash out/flows were $1,117 million (2019: $1,130 million).\n\nInvestment cash out/flows for 2020 include $822 million (2019: $709 million) of Payments of contingent consideration arising on business combinations and $1,645 million (2019: $1,481 million) for the purchase of other intangible assets, including $675 million to Daiichi Sankyo in respect of the second of two upfront payments made as part of the strategic collaboration on Enhertu and an upfront payment of $350 million to Daiichi Sankyo for the development and commercialisation of DS-1062.\n\nInvestment cash in/flows include $951 million (2019: $2,076 million) from the sale of intangible assets, including $350 million on the sales of the global rights excluding US, India and Japan for Zestril, Inderal and Tenormin to Atnahs, $250 million from the sale of the international and Canadian rights for Atacand to Cheplapharm, and $120 million on the sale of an FDA Priority Review Voucher to Incyte Corporation and also include amounts recognised from the sale of part of AstraZeneca's equity portfolio in the year, a large proportion of which related to the disposal of its full holding in Moderna. The comparative period in 2019 included $821 million on the sale of the US rights to Synagis to Sobi, $243 million from the sale of the global rights to Losec excluding the US, Japan, China and Mexico to Cheplapharm, $181 million on the sale of the rights to Arimidex and Casodex to Juvis\u00e9 and $178 million from the sale of the rights to Seroquel and Seroquel XR in Europe and Russia to Cheplapharm.\n\nNet cash distributions to shareholders were $3,542 million (2019: $67 million), including the proceeds from the exercise of share options of $30 million (2019: $32 million) less dividends paid of $3,572 million (2019: $3,592 million). 2019 Share proceeds also included net proceeds from the issue of Share capital of $3,493 million.\n\n## Bonds\n\nIn August 2020, AstraZeneca issued $3.0 billion of bonds in the US dollar debt capital markets with maturities of /five, 10 and 30 years. There were no bonds issued in 2019. In 2020, AstraZeneca repaid a $1.6 billion 2.375% bond, which matured in November 2020. In 2019, AstraZeneca repaid a $1.0 billion 1.95% bond, which matured in September 2019.",

Of the gross debt outstanding $2,386 million is due within one year (2019: $2,010 million). On 1 January 2019, the Group adopted IFRS 16, which eliminates the classi/fication of leases as either operating or /finance leases. The adoption of the new standard resulted in the initial recognition of Lease liabilities of $720 million at the start of 2020. Net debt at 31 December 2020 was $12,110 million, compared with $11,904 million at the beginning of the year, as a result of the net cash /flows, foreign exchange movement and other non-cash movements.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, Cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments totalled $7,992 million (2019: $6,280 million) and undrawn committed bank facilities totalled $21,625 million (2019 $4,125 million). Of the committed facilities, $4,125 million is intended to manage liquidity. In preparation for the acquisition of Alexion, the Company entered into committed bank facilities totalling $17,500 million during December 2020. The facilities contain no /financial covenants and were undrawn at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Financial position - 31 December 2020\n\nAll data in this section are on a Reported basis.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nIn 2020, Property, plant and equipment increased by $563 million to $8,251 million with additions of $926 million (2019: $996 million), impairment charges of $13 million (2019: $53 million net reversal) and exchange adjustments of $360 million (2019: credit of $3 million) offset by depreciation of $689 million (2019: $647 million) and disposals and other movements of $21 million (2019: $138 million).\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nFollowing the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, the Group recognised Lease liabilities and corresponding Right-of-use assets for arrangements that were previously classi/fied as operating leases. Right-ofuse assets at 31 December 2020 were $666 million (2019: $647 million).\n\n## Business combinations\n\nNo business acquisitions were made in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\n\nOn 12 December 2020, AstraZeneca announced that it had reached an agreement with the board of Alexion to acquire 100% of the company. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares per Alexion share. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearances and approval by the shareholders of both companies, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.\n\n## Net debt reconciliation\n\n|                                       | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   | 2018 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | 7,832     | 5,369     | 4,831     |\n| Other investments 1,2                 | 160       | 911       | 895       |\n| Cash and investments                  | 7,992     | 6,280     | 5,726     |\n| Overdraft and short-term borrowings   | (658)     | (225)     | (755)     |\n| Lease liabilities                     | (681) 4   | (675)     | -         |\n| Current instalments of loans          | (1,536)   | (1,597)   | (999)     |\n| Loans due after one year              | (17,505)  | (15,730)  | (17,359)  |\n| Loans and borrowings                  | (20,380)  | (18,227)  | ( 19,113) |\n| Net derivative /financial instruments | 278       | 43        | 384       |\n| Net debt\u00b3                             | (12,110)  | ( 11,904) | (13,003)  |\n\n- 3 The equivalent GAAP measure to Net debt is 'liabilities arising from financing activities', which excludes the amounts for cash and overdrafts, other investments and non-financing derivatives shown above and includes the Acerta Pharma put option of $2,297 million (2019: $2,146 million) shown in non-current other payables.\n- 4 Included in the Net debt reconciliation for 2020 are Lease liabilities of $681 million (2019: $675 million), which arose on the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019.

Intangible assets amounted to $20,947 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: $20,833 million) and included amortisation in the year of $1,992 million (2019: $1,928 million). Intangible asset additions were $1,592 million in 2020 (2019: $2,001 million), $996 million, of which arose from the collaborations with Daiichi Sankyo. Net impairment charges were $240 million (2019: $1,033 million) including impairments on Duaklir ($200 million) and Bydureon ($102 million), offset by an impairment reversal of $147 million on FluMist . Disposals of intangible assets totalled $71 million in the year (2019: $10 million).\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nIn 2019, Assets held for sale of $70 million comprised tangible assets relating to the Boulder, Colorado manufacturing site. There were no Assets held for sale in 2020.\n\n## Receivables, payables and provisions\n\nTotal current and non-current Trade and other receivables increased by $1,241 million to $7,742 million in the year, driven by activities related to the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and a reduction in debt factoring in the US.\n\nTotal current and non-current Trade and other payables increased by $1,591 million in 2020 to $21,869 million. The increase was driven by the recognition of vaccine-related deferred income.",

The Group revised its presentation of certain provisions ($258 million) in 2020, which cover Third party Liability and other risks (including incurred but not yet reported claims) to present this within current Other provisions. This balance has historically been presented within current Other payables. This is offset by legal payments as described in Note 21 from page 208.\n\nThe divestment of the US rights to Synagis , which completed in 2019, included $150 million held as a /financial liability. AstraZeneca will also receive $175 million following the submission of the Biologics Licence Application for MEDI8897, potential net payments of $110 million for other MEDI8897 pro/fit-related milestone payments and $60 million in non-contingent payments for MEDI8897 during the period from 2019 to 2021.\n\n## Contingent consideration\n\nThe majority of our business acquisitions have included elements of consideration that are contingent on future development and/or sales milestones, with both the Diabetes and Respiratory acquisitions in 2014 also including royalty payments linked to future revenues. The acquisitions of ZS Pharma in 2015 and Acerta Pharma in 2016 had no contingent consideration element and there were no relevant acquisitions in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOur agreement with BMS provides for various sales-related royalty payments up until 2025. Our transaction with Almirall includes further payments of up to $0.4 billion for future development, launch, and various other sales-related milestone payments, and sales-related royalty payments as detailed in Note 20 to the Financial Statements from page 207.\n\nAll these future payments are treated as contingent consideration liabilities, and are fair valued using decision-tree analyses, with key assumptions, including the probability of success, the potential for delays and the expected levels of future revenues. The fair value is updated at each reporting date to re/flect our latest estimate of the probabilities of these key assumptions. Given the longterm nature of the liabilities, the fair value calculation includes the discounting of future potential payments to their present value using discount rates appropriate to the period over which payments are likely to be made. Over time, as the target date of a consideration payment approaches, the discount in absolute terms of such future potential payment to its present value",

We refer to this charge as 'discount unwind'. The calculation of the fair value is considered to be a key estimate.\n\nBoth the discount unwind and any movements on the fair value of the underlying future payments can result in signi/ficant income statement movements. As detailed in the Excluded from Core results section on page 86, these movements are treated as non-Core items in our Reconciliation of Reported results to Core results. In 2020, we recorded an interest charge of $278 million on the discount unwind on contingent consideration arising on our business combinations, and a net fair value decrease on contingent consideration of $272 million (which resulted in a credit to our income statement for the same amount) driven principally by revised forecasts for revenues and lower probabilities of achieving certain sales milestones. At 31 December 2020, our contingent consideration liability was $3,323 million (2019: $4,139 million) with the movements of the balance detailed in the table on page 93.\n\n## Tax payable and receivable\n\nNet income tax payable has decreased by $313 million (2019: increased by $119 million) to $763 million, principally due to cash tax timing differences and the impact of foreign exchange movements. The tax receivable balance of $364 million (2019: $285 million) principally relates to cash tax timing differences.\n\nNet deferred tax assets increased by $292 million (2019: $1,135 million) in the year, resulting in a Net deferred tax asset of $520 million, due to movements in deferred tax arising on the elimination of unrealised pro/fit on inventory and associated with intangible amortisation, offset by a net $133 million deferred tax charge re/flecting the change in Dutch and UK income tax rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditional information on the movement in deferred tax balances is contained in Note 4 to the Financial Statements from page 190.\n\n## Defined benefit plan obligations\n\nIn terms of the Group's major de/fined bene/fit plans, approximately 90% of total de/fined bene/fit obligations (or around 77% of net obligations) are concentrated in the UK, the US and Sweden. The UK and US plans are largely legacy arrangements, as they have been closed to new entrants since 2000. In line with local regulations, the collectively bargained Swedish pension plan remains open to employees born before 1979.\n\nNet de/fined bene/fit obligations increased by $395 million in 2020 (2019: increase of $296 million) to $3,202 million. The increase was driven by actuarial remeasurements of $168 million from lower discount rate assumptions in the UK, US and Sweden which increased liability valuations, partially offset by higher than expected investment performance. A further $278 million remeasurement was due to exchange rate movements, caused by a weakening USD against GBP, SEK and euro. These remeasurements were partially offset by Group contributions totalling $172 million and an actuarial gain relating to amendments to the US Post-Retirement Welfare Plans, as detailed below.\n\nIn the UK, an actuarial valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a quali/fied actuary as at 31 March 2019. Following agreement between the Group and Trustee, an updated actuarial valuation, recovery plan and schedule of contributions was submitted to the Pensions Regulator in June 2020, ahead of the statutory deadline.\n\nOver the past few years, the Group has undertaken several initiatives to reduce net de/fined bene/fit obligations and manage associated long-term /financial risks. As a reminder, in the UK, a freeze on pensionable pay has been in effect from 30 June 2010 and in the US, both the quali/fied and non-quali/fied US pension plans were closed to future accruals in December 2017. Moreover, liability management exercises have also been carried out in the UK, including a Pension Increase Exchange exercise in 2016/2017. There has been further such activity in the US and Netherlands during 2020.\n\nIn the US, there was a change within the Group's Post Retirement Healthcare plans to the level of medical coverage provided for members aged 65 and over, effective from 1 January 2021. The changes resulted in a past service credit of approximately $64 million. In the Netherlands, a past service credit of approximately $7 million resulted from the freeze of the de/fined bene/fit pension plan from 1 January 2021. Both past service credits were recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of our accounting for post-retirement benefit plans are included in Note 22 to the Financial Statements from page 209.\n\n## Commitments and contingencies\n\nWe have commitments and contingencies which are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies described in the Financial Statements in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 180.\n\nWe also have taxation contingencies. These are described in the Taxation section in the Critical accounting policies and estimates section from page 97 and in Note 29 to the Financial Statements from page 228.\n\n## Off-balance sheet transactions and commitments\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements and our derivative activities are non-speculative. The table on page 93 sets out our minimum contractual obligations at the year end.\n\n## Research and development collaboration payments\n\nDetails of future potential R&D collaboration payments are also included in Note 29 to the Financial Statements on page 228. As detailed in Note 29, payments to our collaboration partners may not become payable due to the inherent uncertainty in achieving the development and revenue milestones linked to the future payments. We may enter into further collaboration projects in the future that may include milestone payments and as certain milestone payments fail to crystallise due to, for example, development not proceeding, they may be replaced by potential payments under new collaborations.\n\n## Investments, divestments and capital expenditure\n\nWe have completed over 123 major or strategically important business development transactions over the past three years.\n\nIn addition to the business development transactions detailed under Collaboration Revenue from page 88 of this Financial Review, the following signi/ficant collaborations remain in the development phase:",

        "page_content": "## Daiichi Sankyo\n\n- > AstraZeneca has entered into a new global development and commercialisation agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for DS-1062, their proprietary trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody drug conjugate and potential new medicine for the treatment of multiple tumour types. AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo an upfront payment of $1 billion in staged payments: $350 million is due upon completion, with $325 million after 12 months and $325 million after 24 months from the effective date of the agreement. AstraZeneca will pay additional conditional amounts of up to $1 billion for the successful achievement of regulatory approvals and up to $4 billion for sales-related milestones. The transaction was accounted for as an intangible asset acquisition, recognised initially at the present value of noncontingent consideration, with any potential future milestone payments capitalised into the intangible asset as they are recognised. The companies will jointly develop and commercialise DS-1062 worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo will share equally development and commercialisation expenses as well as pro/fits relating to DS-1062 worldwide, except for Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will be responsible for such costs and will pay AstraZeneca mid-single-digit royalties. Daiichi Sankyo will record sales in the US, certain countries in Europe and certain other countries where Daiichi Sankyo has af/filiates. Pro/fits shared with AstraZeneca from those countries will be recorded as Collaboration Revenue by AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will record Product Sales in other countries worldwide, for which pro/fits shared with Daiichi Sankyo will be recorded within Cost of sales. Daiichi Sankyo will manufacture and supply DS-1062. The collaboration agreement became effective on 27 July 2020.\n\n## Innate Pharma\n\n- > In April 2015, we entered into two oncology agreements with Innate Pharma: /first, a licence which provides us with exclusive global rights to co-develop and commercialise IPH2201 in combination with Imfinzi ; and, second, an option to license exclusive global rights to co-develop and commercialise IPH2201 in monotherapy and other combinations in certain treatment areas. Under the terms of the combination licence, we assumed exclusive global rights to research, develop and commercialise IPH2201 in combination with Imfinzi . We jointly fund Phase II studies with Innate Pharma and we lead the execution of these studies. Under the terms of the agreements, we made an initial payment to Innate Pharma of $250 million, which included the consideration for exclusive global rights to co-develop and commercialise IPH2201 in combination with Imfinzi , as well as access to IPH2201 in monotherapy and other combinations in certain treatment areas. The agreement includes a Phase III initiation milestone of $100 million, as well as additional regulatory and sales-related milestones. We record all sales and will pay Innate Pharma double-digit royalties on net sales. The arrangement includes the right for Innate Pharma to co-promote in Europe for a 50% pro/fit share in the territory.\n- > In October 2018, we exercised our option over IPH2201 and simultaneously entered into a further multi-element transaction with Innate Pharma. Under the agreement, we paid $50 million to collaborate on, and acquire an option to license, IPH5201, a /first-in-class anti-CD39 mAb. Additionally, we paid $20 million to acquire options over four future programmes currently being developed by Innate Pharma, and paid \u20ac62.6 million to acquire a 9.8% stake in Innate Pharma. The $100 million option fee and $50 million premium paid over market price for the investment in Innate Pharma have been capitalised as intangible assets. The payment for future programmes will be expensed as research and development expenditure over four years. At the same time, we licensed the EU and US rights to Lumoxiti to Innate Pharma for $50 million upfront plus future milestone payments of up to $25 million.\n- > In December 2020, Innate Pharma announced its intention to transfer the rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will not be required to refund the upfront payment but will no longer be entitled to receive milestones from Innate Pharma.\n\n## Moderna\n\n- > In March 2013, we signed an exclusive agreement with Moderna to discover, develop and commercialise pioneering medicines based on messenger RNA Therapeutics for the treatment of serious cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases, as well as cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $240 million. We will have exclusive access to select any target of our choice in cardiometabolic and renal diseases, as well as selected targets in oncology, over a period of up to /five years for subsequent development of messenger RNA Therapeutics . In addition, Moderna is entitled to an additional $180 million for the achievement of three technical milestones. Through this agreement, we have the option to select up to 40 drug products for clinical development and Moderna will be entitled to development and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on drug sales. AstraZeneca will lead the pre-clinical, clinical development and commercialisation of therapies resulting from the agreement and Moderna will be responsible for designing and manufacturing the messenger RNA Therapeutics against selected targets. We are currently progressing 19 projects across CVRM and Oncology. Utilising both companies' expertise, signi/ficant progress has also been made with the technology platform, with the focus on formulation, safety, and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.\n\nWe determine the above business development transactions to be signi/ficant using a range of factors. We look at the speci/fic circumstances of the individual arrangement and apply several quantitative and qualitative criteria. Because we consider business development transactions to be an extension of our R&D strategy, the expected total value of development payments under the transaction and its proportion of our annual R&D spend, both of which are proxies for overall R&D effort and cost, are important elements of the determination of the signi/ficance. Other quantitative criteria we apply include, without limitation, expected levels of future sales, the possible value of milestone payments and the resources used for commercialisation activities (for example, the number of staff). Qualitative factors we consider include, without limitation, new market developments, new territories, new areas of research and strategic implications.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\n## Capitalisation and shareholder return Capitalisation\n\nThe total number of shares in issue at 31 December 2020 was 1,313 million (2019: 1,312 million). In April 2019, AstraZeneca completed an issuance of 44,386,214 new Ordinary Shares of $0.25 each at a price of \u00a360.50 per share, resulting in an increase in share capital of $11 million and an increase in share premium of $3,479 million, net of transaction costs of $22 million. In addition, 0.5 million Ordinary Shares (2019: 0.7 million) were issued upon share option exercises for total proceeds of $30 million (2019: $32 million).\n\nShareholders' equity increased by $2,495 million to $15,622 million at the year end. Non-controlling interests were $16 million (2019: $1,469 million), with the decrease in the year as a result of the reclassi/fication of the $1,401 million Non-controlling interests reserve into Retained earnings relating to the minority shareholders of Acerta Pharma.\n\nFollowing the approval of Calquence in the EU in November 2020, the minority shareholders are now considered to have no further substantive variability in risk and reward related to their shares as it is considered highly likely that one of the options will be exercised, and the price of the options is now /fixed. Therefore, no further amounts of the consolidated AstraZeneca results have been attributed to the minority shareholders of Acerta Pharma and the Non-controlling interests reserve relating to the minority shareholders of Acerta Pharma, totalling $1,401 million, has been reclassi/fied into Retained earnings as detailed in Note 26 to the Financial Statements on page 218.\n\n## Dividend and share repurchases\n\nThe Board has recommended a second interim dividend of $1.90 (137.4 pence, 15.76 SEK) to be paid on 29 March 2021. This brings the full-year dividend to $2.80 (207.0 pence, 23.63 SEK). Against Reported Earnings per share, the Group had a dividend cover ratio of 0.9:1 in 2020 (2019: 0.4:1). Against Core Earnings per share, the Group had a dividend cover ratio of 1.44:1 in 2020 (2019: 1.25:1). This dividend is consistent with the progressive dividend policy, by which the Board intends to maintain or grow the dividend each year.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews its distribution policy and its overall /financial strategy to continue to strike a balance between the interests of the business, our /financial creditors and our shareholders. Having regard for business investment, funding the progressive dividend policy and meeting our debt service obligations, the Board currently believes it is appropriate to continue the suspension of the share repurchase programme which was announced in 2012.\n\nThe Board reviews the level of distributable reserves of the Parent Company annually and aims to maintain distributable reserves that provide adequate cover for dividend payments. At 31 December 2020, the Pro/fit and loss account reserve of $10,304 million (2019: $11,998 million) was available for distribution, subject to /filing these Financial Statements with Companies House. When making a distribution to shareholders, the Directors determine pro/fits available for distribution by reference to guidance on realised and distributable pro/fits under the Companies Act 2006 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in April 2017.\n\nThe pro/fits of the company have been received in the form of receivables due from subsidiaries. The availability of distributable reserves in the Company is dependent on those receivables meeting the de/finition of qualifying consideration within the guidance, and in particular on the ability of subsidiaries to settle those receivables within a reasonable period of time. The Directors consider that, based on the nature of these receivables and the available cash resources of the Group and other accessible sources of funds, at 31 December 2020 all (2019: the overwhelming majority; 2018: all) of the Company's pro/fit and loss reserves were available for distribution.\n\n## Future prospects\n\nAs outlined earlier in this Annual Report, our strategic priorities support delivery of growth through innovation and our Purpose: to push the boundaries of science to deliver lifechanging medicines.\n\nIn support of this, we made certain choices around our three strategic priorities:\n\n- > Deliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership\n- > Accelerate Innovative Science\n- > Be a Great Place to Work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Our Strategy and Key Performance Indicators from page 18.\n\n## Full year 2021: additional commentary\n\nTotal Revenue is expected to increase by a low-teens percentage, accompanied by a faster growth in Core EPS to $4.75 to $5.00. AstraZeneca continues its focus on improving operating leverage, while addressing its most important capital-allocation priority of reinvestment in the business; namely continued investment in R&D and the support of medicines and patient access in key markets A Core Tax Rate of 18-22% is expected.\n\nThis commentary represents management's current estimates and is subject to change. See the Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 284.\n\n## Financial risk management Financial risk management policies Insurance\n\nOur risk management processes are described in Risk Overview from page 78. These processes enable us to identify risks that can be partly or entirely mitigated through the use of insurance. We negotiate the best available premium rates with insurance providers on the basis of our extensive risk management procedures. We focus our insurance resources on the most critical areas, or where there is a legal requirement, and where we can get the best value for money. We purchase an external multi-line insurance programme to mitigate against signi/ficant /financial loss arising from business risks, including liability, business interruption, property damage, and Directors' and of/ficers' liability. In order to contain insurance costs, as of February 2006, we adjusted our product liability coverage pro/file, accepting uninsured exposure above $100 million.\n\n## Taxation\n\nOur approach to managing tax risk is integrated with our broader business risk management and compliance framework. Our approach is to manage tax risks and tax costs in a manner consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and with shareholders' best long-term interests, taking into account operational, economic and reputational factors. We manage tax risks in the context of substantive business transactions.\n\n## Treasury\n\nThe principal /financial risks to which we are exposed are those arising from liquidity, interest rates, foreign currency and credit. We have a centralised treasury function to manage these risks in accordance with Board-approved policies. Speci/fically, liquidity risk is managed through maintaining access to a number of sources of funding to meet anticipated funding requirements, including committed bank facilities, cash resources and use of debt factoring. We also use supply chain /financing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further information on our supply chain financing arrangements, refer to the Business Review on page 52.\n\nInterest rate risk is managed through maintaining a debt portfolio that is weighted towards /fixed rates of interest. In 2020, our net interest charge was adversely affected by movements in /floating rates of interest on the /floating rate assets AstraZeneca held, offset by lower interest on /floating rate debt. We monitor the impact of currency on a portfolio basis (to recognise correlation effect), and may hedge to protect against signi/ficant adverse impacts on cash /flow over the short to medium term. We aim to hedge the currency exposure that arises between the booking and settlement dates on material non-local currency purchases and sales by subsidiaries and the external dividend. Signi/ficant intra-Group loans that give rise to foreign exchange movements are also hedged.",

The Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables. These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'.\n\nOur capital and risk management objectives and policies are described in further detail in Note 27 to the Financial Statements from page 219 and in Risk Overview from page 78. Sensitivity analysis of the Group's exposure to exchange rate and interest rate movements is also detailed in Note 27 to the Financial Statements from page 219.\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\nOur Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU. The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The accounting policies employed are set out in the Group Accounting Policies section in the Financial Statements from page 180. In applying these policies, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the Reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The actual outcome could differ from those estimates. Some of these policies require a high level of judgement because the areas are especially subjective or complex.

It is the Group's policy to offer a credit note for all returns and to destroy all returned stock in all markets. Cash discounts for prompt payments are also discounted from sales. Sales are recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party, which is usually when title passes to the customer, either on shipment or on the receipt of goods by the customer, depending on local trading terms.\n\n## Rebates, chargebacks and returns in the US\n\nWhen invoicing Product Sales in the US, we estimate the rebates and chargebacks that we expect to pay, which are considered to be estimates. These rebates typically arise from sales contracts with third-party managed care organisations, hospitals, long-term care facilities, group purchasing organisations and various federal or state programmes (Medicaid contracts, supplemental rebates, etc.). They can be classi/fied as follows:\n\n- > Chargebacks, where we enter into arrangements under which certain parties, typically hospitals, long-term care facilities, group purchasing organisations, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service Covered Entities and the Department of Defense, are able to buy products from wholesalers at the lower prices we have contracted with them. The chargeback is the difference between the price we invoice to the wholesaler and the contracted price charged by the wholesaler to the other party. Chargebacks are credited directly to the wholesalers.\n- > Regulatory, including Medicaid and other federal and state programmes, where we pay rebates based on the speci/fic terms of agreements with the US Department of Health and Human Services and with individual states, which include product usage and information on best prices and average market prices benchmarks.\n- > Contractual, under which entities such as third-party managed care organisations are entitled to rebates depending on speci/fied performance provisions, which vary from contract to contract.\n\nThe effects of these deductions on our US pharmaceuticals revenue and the movements on US pharmaceuticals revenue provisions are set out on page 97.\n\nAccrual assumptions are built up on a product-by-product and customer-bycustomer basis, taking into account speci/fic contract provisions coupled with expected performance, and are then aggregated into a weighted average rebate accrual rate for each of our products. Accrual rates are reviewed and adjusted on an as needed basis. There may be further adjustments when actual rebates are invoiced based on utilisation information submitted to us (in the case of contractual rebates) and claims/invoices are received (in the case of regulatory rebates and chargebacks). We believe that we have made reasonable estimates for future rebates using a similar methodology to that of previous years. Inevitably, however, these estimates involve assumptions in respect of aggregate future sales levels, segment mix and customers' contractual performance.\n\nOverall adjustments between gross and net US Product Sales amounted to $10,617 million in 2020 (2019: $10,607 million) with the increase driven by an overall increase in our US Product Sales and changes in product mix.\n\nCash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment. Accruals are calculated based on historical experience and are adjusted to re/flect actual experience. Our revenue recognition policy is described within Group Accounting Policies from page 181.\n\nIndustry practice in the US allows wholesalers and pharmacies to return unused stocks within six months of, and up to 12 months after, shelf-life expiry. The customer is credited for the returned product by the issuance of a credit note. Returned products are not exchanged for products from inventory and once a return claim has been determined to be valid and a credit note has been issued to the customer, the returned products are destroyed. At the point of sale in the US, we estimate the quantity and value of products which may ultimately be returned. Our returns accruals in the US are based on actual experience. Our estimate is based on the historical sales and returns information for established products together with marketrelated information, such as estimated shelf life, product recall, and estimated stock levels at wholesalers, which we receive via third-party information services. For newly launched products, we use rates based on our experience with similar products or a pre-determined percentage.\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill (and contingent consideration arising from business combinations)\n\nOur business model includes investment in targeted business developments to strengthen our portfolio, pipeline and capabilities. These business development transactions include collaborations, asset in-licences and business acquisitions.\n\nEach transaction is considered to establish whether it quali/fies as a business combination by applying the criteria assessment detailed in IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', after applying the optional concentration test on an elective basis. The determination of a transaction being a business combination or asset acquisition is considered to be a key judgement as detailed in the accounting policy on page 184.\n\nOn the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identi/fiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair value cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill.\n\nAttributing fair values is a key judgement. Goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or pay for a liability in an orderly transaction at the date of acquisition. The price may be directly observable but, in most cases, is estimated using valuation techniques which normally involve predicting future cash /flows and applying a market participant discount rate. No business combinations were made in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nFuture contingent elements of consideration, which may include development and launch milestones, revenue threshold milestones and revenue-based royalties, are fair valued at the date of acquisition using decision-tree analysis with key inputs including probability of success, consideration of potential delays and revenue projections based on the Group's internal forecasts. Unsettled amounts of consideration are held at fair value within payables with changes in fair value recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Several of our business combinations have included signi/ficant amounts of contingent consideration. Details of the movements in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the year and the range of possible contingent consideration amounts that may eventually become payable, are contained in Note 10 to the Financial Statements from page 198.",

        "page_content": "Where not all the equity of a subsidiary is acquired, the non-controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-by-case basis. Put options over non-controlling interests are recognised as a /financial liability measured at amortised cost, with a corresponding entry in either retained earnings or against non-controlling interest reserves on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAs detailed on page 98, we have signi/ficant investments in goodwill and intangible assets as a result of acquisitions of businesses and purchases of assets, such as product development and marketing rights.\n\nDetails of the estimates and assumptions we make in our annual impairment testing of goodwill are included in Note 9 to the Financial Statements on page 197. The Group, including acquisitions, is considered a single operating segment for impairment purposes. No impairment of goodwill was identi/fied. A signi/ficant portion of our investments in intangible assets and goodwill arose from the restructuring of the joint venture with MSD which commenced in 1998, the acquisition of MedImmune in 2007 and our 2014 acquisition of BMS's interest in the Group's Diabetes Alliance. We are satis/fied that the carrying values of our intangible assets as at 31 December 2020 are fully justi/fied by estimated future cash /flows. The accounting for our Intangible assets is fully explained in Note 10 to the Financial Statements from page 198, including details of the estimates and assumptions we make in impairment testing of intangible assets.\n\n## Litigation and environmental liabilities\n\nIn the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from product-speci/fic and general legal proceedings, from guarantees or from environmental liabilities connected with our current or former sites. Where we believe that potential liabilities have a less than 50% probability of crystallising, or where we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability, we treat them as contingent liabilities. These are not provided for, but are disclosed in Note 29 to the Financial Statements from page 228.\n\nIn cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quanti/fiable /fines and penalties have been assessed and which are not subject to appeal (or other similar forms of relief), or where a loss is probable and we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the loss, we generally indicate the loss absorbed or make a provision for our best estimate of the expected loss.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged to pro/fit as they are incurred. Where it is considered that we have a valid contract which provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which a provision has been established and we consider recovery to be virtually certain, then the best estimate of the amount expected to be received is recognised as an asset.\n\nAssessments as to whether or not to recognise provisions or assets and of the amounts concerned usually involve a series of complex judgements about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. We believe that the provisions recorded are adequate based on currently available information and that any insurance recoveries recorded will be received.\n\nHowever, given the inherent uncertainties involved in assessing the outcomes of these cases and in estimating the amount of the potential losses and the associated insurance recoveries, we could in future periods incur judgments or insurance settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results in any particular period.\n\nThe position could change over time and there can, therefore, be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed the amount of the provisions that have been booked in the accounts.\n\nAlthough there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our /financial position, but they could signi/ficantly affect our /financial results in any particular period.\n\n## Sarbanes-Oxley Act section 404\n\nAs a consequence of our Nasdaq listing, we are required to comply with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to foreign issuers. Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act requires companies annually to assess and make public statements about the quality and effectiveness of their internal control over /financial reporting. As regards Sarbanes-Oxley Act section 404, our approach is based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) 2013 framework.\n\nOur approach to the assessment has been to select key transaction and /financial reporting processes in our largest operating units and a number of specialist areas (e.g. /financial consolidation and reporting, treasury operations and taxation etc.), so that, in aggregate, we have covered a signi/ficant proportion of the key lines in our Financial Statements. Each of these operating units and specialist areas has ensured that its relevant processes and controls are documented to appropriate standards, taking into account, in particular, the guidance provided by the SEC. We have also reviewed the structure and operation of our 'entity level' control environment. This refers to the overarching control environment, including structure of reviews, checks and balances that are essential to the management of a well-controlled business.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Introduction\n\n' It became apparent early in the year that we could work well together in a virtual way, maintaining continuity of governance.'\n\nGood corporate governance is a prerequisite for a well-run company and this Corporate Governance Report reflects the new regulations which encourage transparency in governance reporting and enhance understanding of how AstraZeneca is managed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 proved to be a test of AstraZeneca's solid governance foundations\n\n2020 proved to be a test of AstraZeneca's solid governance foundations as the Board, SET and colleagues around the world had to adapt quickly to new ways of working due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It became apparent early in the year that we could work well together in a virtual way, with good IT support, continuing to collaborate and maintain the continuity of the various governance processes and activities, including our usual /financial and other controls, and quarterly results announcements.\n\nHowever, the pandemic has hindered the Board's ability to engage as fully as usual with some stakeholders this year and we had to curtail our travel plans, including a planned visit to AstraZeneca Japan, and some employee engagement activities. Having published our Notice of AGM at about the time the UK started its /first lockdown, we had to hold a closed AGM in 2020. We encouraged shareholders to vote by proxy in advance and invited them to submit questions to the Board by post or e-mail. These questions and our responses were made available on our website. The Board is looking forward to returning to a more normal level of engagement with shareholders, employees and other stakeholders as soon as it is safe to do so in 2021.\n\nWith Directors based in different time zones across the world - from the west coast of the US to Asia - it has occasionally proved dif/ficult to schedule Board meetings at times convenient for all. However, we believe this challenge is outweighed by the bene/fits of having a diverse Board that re/flects the global nature of our business, made up of Directors who have the skills and experience that align with the Company's and the Board's needs.\n\nDespite having to operate virtually, we successfully recruited two new Non-Executive Directors during 2020, in October and November - Euan Ashley and Diana Lay/field. We are delighted to have the bene/fit of Euan's scienti/fic achievements and interests, and his entrepreneurial experience on the US west coast, and of Diana's broad international business experience, expertise in delivering innovation at scale and her passion for life sciences.\n\nAs always, discussion of strategy was a key part of the good governance process in 2020 and you can read elsewhere in this report about our agreement to acquire Alexion. As part of its oversight of management, the Board will continue to monitor the work to close this proposed transaction and assure itself that there is good planning for a successful integration, subject, of course, to regulatory clearances and shareholders' approval.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeif Johansson Chairman",

Eight of these were convened at short notice and related to the proposed acquisition of Alexion. Other than its meeting in January 2020, which took place in London, UK, all Board meetings in 2020 were held virtually by video conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n- 1 Dr Euan Ashley missed three ad hoc meetings. Two absences were due to long-standing medical training and student teaching commitments, and the third resulted from a time zone conflict. For full details, see page 115.\n\n## How our governance supports the delivery of our strategy\n\nAll Directors are collectively responsible for the success of the Group. The Non-Executive Directors exercise independent, objective judgement in respect of Board decisions, and scrutinise and challenge management. They also have various responsibilities concerning the integrity of financial information, internal controls and risk management.\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting our strategy and policies, overseeing risk and corporate governance, and monitoring progress towards meeting our objectives and annual plans. It is accountable to our shareholders for the proper conduct of the business and our long-term success, and seeks to represent the interests of all\n\nstakeholders. The Board conducts an annual review of the Group's overall strategy. The CEO, CFO and Senior Executive Team (SET) take the lead in developing our strategy, which is then reviewed, constructively challenged and approved by the Board.\n\n## The Board has delegated some of its powers to the CEO and operates with the assistance of four Committees:\n\n| Early Stage Portfolio Committee   |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Page 106                          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board Committee membership and meeting attendance in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Name                                         | Board   | Audit   | Remuneration   | Nomination and  Governance   | Science   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------------|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Euan Ashley  - appointed 1 October 2020      | 4(7) 1  |         |                |                              | 1(1)      |\n| Genevi\u00e8ve Berger                             | 14(15)  |         |                |                              | 4(5)      |\n| Philip Broadley                              | 13(15)  | 7(7)    | 6(6)           | 5(5)                         |           |\n| Graham Chipchase                             | 12(15)  |         | 4(4)           | 4(5)                         |           |\n| Michel Demar\u00e9                                | 15(15)  | 7(7)    | 2/(2)          |                              |           |\n| Deborah DiSanzo                              | 12(15)  | 7(7)    |                |                              |           |\n| Marc Dunoyer                                 | 15(15)  |         |                |                              |           |\n| Leif Johansson                               | 15(15)  |         | 6(6)           | 5(5)                         |           |\n| Diana Lay/field -  appointed 1 November 2020 | 5(5)    |         |                |                              |           |\n| Sheri McCoy                                  | 14(15)  | 7(7)    | 6(6)           |                              |           |\n| Tony Mok                                     | 15(15)  |         |                |                              | 5(5)      |\n| Nazneen Rahman                               | 15(15)  |         |                | 5(5)                         | 5(5)      |\n| Pascal Soriot                                | 15(15)  |         |                |                              |           |\n| Marcus Wallenberg                            | 13(15)  |         |                |                              | 4(5)      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: number in brackets denotes number of meetings during the year that Board members were entitled to attend.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Changes to the composition of the Board and its Committees for the year ended 31 December 2020 on page 104.

The matters that have not been expressly reserved to the Board are delegated by the Board to its four principle Committees or the CEO.\n\n## Principal matters\n\nThe principal matters considered by the Board during 2020 and the link to the Group's strategic priorities are set out in the table. As part of the business of each Board meeting, the CEO typically submits a progress report, giving details of business performance and progress against the goals the Board has approved. To ensure that the Board has good visibility of the key operating decisions of the business, members of the SET attend Board meetings regularly and Board members meet other senior executives throughout the year. The Board also receives accounting and other management information about our resources, and presentations from internal and external speakers on legal, governance and regulatory developments.\n\n## Adapting to virtual ways of working\n\nFrom the end of the /first quarter of 2020, all Board and Board Committee meetings were held virtually by videoconference due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Directors adapted quickly to this new way of working, although scheduling virtual meetings at times convenient to all Board members was made more dif/ficult by Directors being based in multiple time zones, including the US west and east coasts and Asia. In addition, as described later in this report, the pandemic signi/ficantly curtailed the Board's usual annual programme of site visits and face-to-face engagement with employees and other stakeholders.\n\n| Strategic matters                           | > The Group's strategy, including its long-range plan, annual budget, strategic  options and the overall state of the pharmaceuticals

The 2020 evaluation was externally facilitated by Lintstock Ltd (Lintstock), a London-based corporate advisory /firm that provides objective and independent counsel to leading European companies. Lintstock supplies software and services to the Company Secretary's team for Board evaluation questionnaires but has no other commercial relationship with the Company or any individual Directors. Based on Board members' responses to the web-based questionnaire covering a wide range of topics and on interviews carried out by Lintstock with each Board member,\n\nLintstock prepared a report which was discussed by the Board at its meeting in December 2020 and was also used by the Chairman as the basis for individual conversations with each Board member prior to the full Board discussion.\n\nAs part of each Director's individual discussion with the Chairman during the Board evaluation, his or her contribution to the work of the Board and personal development needs were considered. Directors' training needs are met by a combination of: internal presentations and updates and external speaker presentations as part of Board and Board Committee meetings; speci/fic training sessions on particular topics, where required; and the opportunity for\n\nDirectors to attend external courses at the Company's expense, should they wish to do so.\n\nThe Board intends to continue to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code guidance that the evaluation should be externally facilitated at least every three years and expects to commission the next externallyfacilitated review in 2023.\n\nAs part of the Board performance evaluation, Directors are asked to consider the composition and diversity of the Board, as well as how effectively members are working together.\n\n## 2020

This provides assurance to the\n\n## How our Board considers stakeholders' interests in decision making\n\nThroughout the year, Directors recognised their responsibility to act in good faith to promote the success of the Company for the bene/fit of shareholders, while also considering the impact of their decisions on wider stakeholders and other factors relevant to the decision being made. Clear communication and proactive engagement to understand the issues and factors which are most important to stakeholders is fundamental to this.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that every decision made will not necessarily result in a positive outcome for all stakeholders. By considering our Purpose and Values, together with our strategic priorities, the Board aims to ensure that the decisions made are consistent and intended to promote the Company's long-term success.\n\nIn addition to the stakeholder considerations set out on pages 110 to 111, the Board has also had regard to other factors such as environmental factors and community interests. For more information on the environmental and community factors considered by the business, see the Sustainability section set out from page 72.\n\nThe table to the right provides examples of how key stakeholders were considered in Principal Decisions made by the Board during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the s.172(1) statement, see page 100.\n\nBoard that management has engaged with stakeholders and allows the Board to consider stakeholder impact, as well as other factors, when making decisions. The stakeholder matrix is refreshed annually to ensure that stakeholders and methods of engagement remain relevant to the business.\n\n## Principal Decisions in 2020\n\n## Overview\n\nWe de/fine 'Principal Decisions' as decisions and discussions, which are material or strategic to the Group, and also those that are signi/ficant to any of our stakeholder groups. We consider the following items to be examples of Principal Decisions made by the Board during 2020.\n\n## Principal Decisions\n\nThroughout 2020, the Board considered management's response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that it was consistent with the Group's Values of following the science, putting patients first and doing the right thing. The Board considered the Group's work in communities to ensure that efforts such as global donations of PPE reached those most in need and that the business supported the communities in which we operate, such as through the establishment of a COVID-19 testing facility in Cambridge and providing additional support to our Young Health Programme partners. Employees also remained at the forefront of Board discussions to ensure the creation of safe working environments and the establishment of measures to support employees' physical and mental wellbeing. Ensuring the safety of patients and the continued supply of all of AstraZeneca's medicines remained a priority, and the Board sought regular operational updates from management.\n\nIn April 2020, the Group entered into a landmark agreement with the University of Oxford for the global development, production and supply of their potential vaccine for COVID-19. AstraZeneca committed to doing this at no profit during the pandemic and to providing broad and equitable supply of billions of doses of the potential vaccine. The Board acknowledged that although vaccine-related activities were not a core therapy area, the need for a vaccine was urgent and AstraZeneca had expertise and resources that could assist in its development. If successful, the vaccine would significantly impact all stakeholders and have a wide-reaching societal benefit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Group's response to the COVID-19,Pandemic see page 28 and Other medicines and COVID-19 from page 47\n\nDuring 2020, the Group entered an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the co-development and co-commercialisation of DS-1062, a clinical-stage, proprietary, TROP2-targeting ADC. The Board discussed the opportunity DS-1062 presented and the potential the medicine had to reshape the current standard of care for the treatment of lung cancer, while also considering patient safety. The Board considered how DS-1062 would fit into the Group's portfolio and noted that DS-1062 was at a relatively early stage of development, and therefore carried a degree of risk, but was being investigated in tumour types that would provide a good strategic fit for AstraZeneca and early data indicated it had the potential to be a best-in-class treatment. The Board also considered the Group's capital allocation priorities and level of investment required alongside the potential future market for ADCs and the potential returns the investment could generate for the Company's shareholders. It was concluded that entering into the agreement would promote the long-term success of the Company and, if successful, could help transform the treatment of patients and deliver value for shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Business development from page 63, and the Oncology Therapy Area Review from page 30.\n\nIn December 2020, the Group signed an agreement to acquire Alexion subject to regulatory clearances and approval by the shareholders of both companies. When discussing this opportunity, the Board considered how Alexion's pipeline, expertise in immunology and strong research platforms could accelerate the combined company's strategic ambitions. The potential combination would drive innovation and speed of delivery of the next wave of science, accelerating the development of potential medicines to help more patients around the world. The Board also considered the Company's shareholders and the strong financial benefits of the proposed acquisition, which would include improved profitability and strengthened cash flow.\n\nFor more information, see the CEO Review on page 5.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Understanding in action\n\nIn 2020, all employees were invited to participate in a crowdsourcing event COVID-19: Now & Next. This provided an opportunity for the workforce to share perspectives, thoughts and ideas to support the delivery of our strategy and enable us to emerge stronger from the pandemic. Almost half of our employees participated and more than 12,000 people from across 47 countries contributed ideas, reactions and comments. These employee ideas and comments helped inform recommendations that were made to the AstraZeneca Board as part of the Group's annual strategy review process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on COVID-19: Now & Next, see from page 18.",

        "page_content": "## Engaging with our workforce\n\nAstraZeneca is committed to being a great place to work. Engagement with employees is an important element in fostering this and ensuring an environment in which all employees are respected, and where openness is valued, diversity celebrated and every voice heard. We rely on our global workforce and their commitment to uphold our Values, deliver our strategic priorities and make the changes necessary to sustain and improve short- and long-term performance. For AstraZeneca, 'global workforce' includes all AstraZeneca's full-time and part-time employees, /fixed-term workers and external contractors working full- or part-time, regardless of their geographical location.\n\nThe Directors believe that the Board as a whole should continue to take responsibility for gathering the views of the workforce. Consequently, the Board chose not to implement any of the three methods set out in the 2018 Code. Instead, the multiple, long-standing channels of engagement which already exist in the organisation were developed and enhanced to ensure that the Board continues to understand the global workforce's views on a wide variety of topics.\n\nThe Board believes that this alternative approach is the best model of engagement for the Group and ensures that the Board has access to the views of the workforce, regardless of their location, and provides meaningful information and data that the Board can use when considering the impact of the strategic decisions on employees. Additionally, the chosen mechanisms allow all Directors to engage directly with a wider cross-section of the global workforce and provide opportunity for meaningful dialogue. The Board considers these views and the potential impacts on the workforce when it makes key decisions.\n\n## Workforce trends report and Annual Global Remuneration Overview\n\nThe Board was provided with information outlining progress against a range of metrics related to workforce culture and engagement. This information is provided biannually to enable Directors to monitor trends and, if required, take action. The Remuneration Overview provides evidence of how the workforce is rewarded in line with our principles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 92%\n\nof employees stated they believe strongly in AstraZeneca's future direction and key priorities in the November 2020 Pulse survey\n\nDue to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Board's usual annual programme of site visits and face-to-face engagement with the workforce was signi/ficantly curtailed during 2020. Instead, a number of virtual engagements took place. Directors attended virtual townhalls which were broadcast to the global workforce on matters including the Group's performance and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CFO also took part in a Q&A session via Workplace, the Group's social media platform, responding to questions on the intended Alexion acquisition. The Audit Committee undertook a number of virtual site visits which facilitated understanding of business operations and allowed engagement between the Directors and employees. Further information about this can be found from page 123. The Science Committee also hosted a number of virtual coffees with individuals within the R&D units to provide exposure to talent and leadership, and provide opportunity for dialogue.\n\nIn addition, the Board received a number of reports containing various metrics on workforce engagement and culture.\n\n- For more information, see People, from page 68.\n\n## Investing in and rewarding our workforce\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers remuneration arrangements for our global workforce, aiming to ensure the global total reward offering is competitive, compelling and aligned to our business performance, while supporting a culture where everyone feels valued and included.\n\n- For more information, see the Directors' Remuneration Report from page 131.\n\n## Employee opinion surveys (Pulse)\n\nTwice a year the workforce are invited to take part in an employee opinion survey, which seeks employees' views of the business. The results are reviewed by management and trends are monitored. The results are shared with the Board, which enables it to understand the views and sentiments of the workforce.\n\n## 91%\n\nof employees took part in the November 2020 Pulse survey\n\n## Workforce culture\n\nDuring 2020, the Board reviewed the workforce culture report, which demonstrates how our Values and behaviours are embedded throughout all levels of the workforce. Within the report, there is a summary metrics dashboard, which is divided into /five categories re/flecting various key aspects of AstraZeneca's culture (Performance and Development, Integrity, Engagement, Reputation and Sustainability). The dashboard is compiled from data across the global workforce including scores from the Pulse surveys and promotion and resignation rates. Additionally, Directors receive information on compliance issues and grievance cases, and a workforce trends report which covers broader metrics around workforce structure, composition, hiring and retention. The Board monitors the data for trends and to ensure that a culture consistent with our Values is being fostered. The report also contains a list of approximately 10 further analyses that reference culture and workforce engagement and help the Board to judge our culture and whether it re/flects our Values. This information is made available to Directors via the Board portal.\n\nThe workforce culture report is reviewed by the Board twice per annum. Where the Board has concerns that the culture does not re/flect our Values, the Board seeks assurances from management that remedial action has been taken, and where necessary, requests senior management's attendance at Board meetings to discuss corrective actions.\n\n## Actions and outcomes\n\nThe Board considered the workforce throughout its Principal Decisions in 2020. Directors ensured that, where required, queries raised during engagements were fed back to management or discussed by the wider Board. In 2020, the Board discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employees. The Board received regular updates on the steps taken by management to create safe working environments, support the mental and physical wellbeing of the workforce and access to testing for employees. The Remuneration Committee also discussed and reported back to the full Board the Group's decision to remove performance ratings and the shift our focus to coaching, development and contribution to the organisation.",

Engagement                       | The Board aims to ensure that a good dialogue with our  shareholders is maintained and that their issues and concerns  are understood and considered.  The Company's 2020 AGM was held on 29 April 2020 as a  closed meeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Engagement  with shareholders remains of the utmost importance to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | In our reporting to shareholders and other interested parties,  we aim to present a balanced and understandable assessment  of our strategy, /financial position and prospects.

Role of the Non-Executive Directors\n\nLeif Johansson, our Non-Executive Chairman, is responsible for leadership of the Board and promoting a culture of openness and constructive debate.\n\nThe Board comprises 12 Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, and two Executive Directors - the CEO, Pascal Soriot, and the CFO, Marc Dunoyer.\n\nThe roles of the Board, Board Committees, Chairman and CEO are documented, as are the Board's reserved powers and delegated authorities. The Board's responsibilities and the governance structure by which it delegates authority is set out in the Corporate Governance Overview from page 103.\n\nDuring 2020, the Board considered the independence of each Non-Executive Director for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Except for Marcus Wallenberg, the Board considers that all the NonExecutive Directors are independent.\n\nThe role of the Non-Executive Directors is to provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, offer specialist advice and hold management to account. At the end of Board meetings, the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present to review and discuss any matters that have arisen during the meeting and/or such other matters as may appear to the Non-Executive Directors to be relevant in properly discharging their duty to act independently.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOur expectation is that Non-Executive Directors should be prepared to commit 15 days a year, as an absolute minimum, to the Group's business. In practice, Board members' time commitment exceeds this minimum expectation when all the work that they undertake for the Group is considered, particularly in the case of the Chairman of the Board and the Chairmen of the Board Committees. As well as their work in relation to formal Board and Board Committee meetings, the Non-Executive Directors also commit time throughout the year to meetings and telephone calls with various levels of executive management, visits to AstraZeneca's sites throughout the world and, for new Non-Executive Directors, induction sessions and site visits.\n\nOn occasions when a Director is unavoidably absent from a Board or Board Committee meeting, they still receive and review the papers for the meeting and typically provide verbal or written input ahead of the meeting, usually through the Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the relevant Board Committee, so that their views are made known and considered at the meeting.\n\nGiven the nature of the business to be conducted, some Board meetings are convened at short notice, which can make it dif/ficult for some Directors to attend due to prior commitments.\n\nHe was considered to be independent upon his appointment as Chairman.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The 2020 Evaluation of the Board, including details of the Chairman's\n\nevaluation, is set out on page 109.\n\nMarcus Wallenberg was appointed as a Director of Astra in May 1989 and subsequently became a Director of the Company in 1999. He is a Non-Executive Director of Investor AB, which has a 3.93% interest in the issued share capital of the Company as at 11 February 2021.\n\nFor these reasons - his overall length of tenure and relationship with a signi/ficant shareholder - the Board does not believe that he can be determined independent under the UK Corporate Governance Code. However, the Board believes that he has brought, and continues to bring, considerable business experience and makes a valuable contribution to the work of the Board. In April 2010, he was appointed as a member of the Science Committee, re/flecting his interest in innovation and R&D, knowledge of the history of the Company and its scienti/fic heritage and culture, and his broad experience of other industries and businesses in which innovation and R&D are important determinants of success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe membership of the Board as at 31 December 2020 and information about individual Directors is contained in Board of Directors on pages 104 and 105.\n\nEuan Ashley attended all scheduled Board meetings following his appointment as a Director on 1 October 2020. He missed three ad hoc meetings relating to the proposed acquisition of Alexion that were arranged at short notice. Two clashed with long-standing, pre-arranged commitments of Dr Ashley attending on a cardiac care unit and in respect of a PhD student exam. The other was unavoidably arranged at a time in the middle of the night in Dr Ashley's time zone in California. The Board recognises the challenges of having Directors based in multiple time zones, including the US west and east coasts and Asia, particularly when arranging ad hoc, virtual or telephone meetings at short notice, but is committed to having a diverse Board that re/flects the global nature of the Company's business and is made up of Directors with skills and experience that align with the Company's and the Board's needs.\n\nSubject to speci/fic Board approval, Directors and SET members may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies, and retain any related fees paid to them, provided that such appointments are not considered by the Board to prevent or reduce the ability of the executive to perform his or her role within the Group to the required standard.\n\n## Senior independent Non-Executive Director\n\nGraham Chipchase was appointed senior independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 January 2019. The role of the senior independent Non-Executive Director is to serve as a sounding board for the Chairman and as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary. The senior independent Non-Executive Director is also available to shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal channels of Chairman or Executive Directors has failed to resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see Board Committee membership and meeting attendance in 2020 on page 103.",

Procedure for  developing remuneration  policy | During 2020, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the  Directors' Remuneration Policy to ensure it continues to align  with corporate governance best practice; support the Company's  ability to recruit and retain executive talent to deliver against its  strategy; and promote the delivery of the long-term strategy.  The Remuneration Committee also considers executive pay in  the context of the wider workforce, details of which can be  found from page 151. As part of the process for developing the  Directors' Remuneration Policy, the Chairman of the  Remuneration Committee consulted with major institutional  shareholders on the Committee's proposals and Willis Towers  Watson as independent adviser to the Remuneration Committee. | Details of these engagements are set out in the Directors'  Remuneration Report from page 131.    The Directors' Remuneration Policy, which is to be put to shareholders for  approval at the 2021 AGM, can be found from page 156.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| R.

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Report\n\n## Other Governance Information\n\n## Risk management and controls\n\n## Disclosure Committee\n\nOur disclosure policy provides a framework for the handling and disclosure of inside information and other information of interest to shareholders and the investment community. It also de/fines the role of the Disclosure Committee. The core members of the Disclosure Committee in 2020 were the CFO, who chaired the Disclosure Committee; the General Counsel; the Vice-President, Global Corporate Affairs; the Head of Investor Relations; and the Senior Vice-President Finance, Group Controller. The EVP, BioPharmaceuticals R&D and the EVP, BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit were members of the Disclosure Committee for BioPharmaceuticals-related matters. The EVP, Oncology R&D and the EVP, Oncology Business Unit were members of the Disclosure Committee for Oncology-related matters. Other personnel attend its meetings on an agenda-driven basis. The Deputy Company Secretary acted as secretary to the Disclosure Committee.\n\nThe Disclosure Committee meets regularly to assist and inform the decisions of the CEO concerning inside information and its disclosure. Periodically, it reviews our disclosure controls and procedures and its own operation as part of work carried out to enable management and the Board to assure themselves that appropriate processes are operating for both our planned disclosures, such as our quarterly results announcements and scheduled investor relations events, and our unplanned disclosures in response to unforeseen events or circumstances.\n\n## Global Compliance and Internal Audit Services (IA)\n\nThe role of the Global Compliance function is to help the Group achieve its strategic priorities by doing business the right way - with integrity and high ethical standards. Global Compliance continues to focus on ensuring the delivery of a globally aligned approach to compliance that addresses key risk areas across the business, including risks relating to third parties and anti-bribery/anti-corruption. Our priorities include: reinforcing and strengthening compliant behaviours through effective policies, training, advice and communications; monitoring adherence to our Code of Ethics and supporting requirements; providing assurance that we are conducting appropriate risk assessments and due diligence on third parties whom we engage for services; and ensuring that employees and external parties can raise any concerns.\n\nWe take all alleged compliance breaches and concerns extremely seriously, including appropriate investigation, as well as disciplinary action, and other remediation to address misconduct and prevent reoccurrence. Internal investigations are undertaken by staff from our Global Compliance, Human Resources and/or Legal functions. When necessary, external advisers are engaged to conduct and/or advise on investigations. Where a signi/ficant breach has occurred, management, in consultation with our Legal function, will consider whether the Group needs to disclose and/or report the /findings to a regulatory or governmental authority.\n\nGlobal Compliance provides direct assurance to the Audit Committee on compliance matters, including an analysis of compliance breaches and associated disciplinary actions, as well as commentary on the more serious breaches and corresponding remediation. Complementing this, IA carries out a range of audits that include compliance-related audits and periodically reviews the assurance activities of other Group assurance functions.\n\nThe results from these activities are reported to the Audit Committee. Global Compliance and IA work with specialist compliance functions throughout our organisation to share outcomes and to coordinate reporting on compliance matters.\n\nIA is established by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board and acts as an independent and objective assurance function guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Group. The scope of IA's responsibilities encompasses, but is not limited to, the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's governance, risk management, and internal control processes in relation to the Group's de/fined goals and objectives.\n\nAmong others, internal control objectives considered by IA include:\n\n- > compliance with signi/ficant policies, plans, procedures, laws and regulations\n- > consistency of operations or programmes with established objectives and goals and effective performance\n- > safeguarding of assets.\n\nBased on its activity, IA is responsible for reporting signi/ficant risk exposures and control issues identi/fied to the Board and to senior management, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or requested by the Audit Committee. It may also evaluate speci/fic operations at the request of the Audit Committee or management, as appropriate.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nOur Code of Ethics (the Code) is based on our Values, expected behaviours and key policy principles. The Code recommends that employees report possible violations to their line managers or to their local Human Resources, Legal or Compliance partners. The Code also contains information on how to report possible violations through our helpline, which includes the AZ Ethics telephone lines, the AZ Ethics website, and the Global Compliance email and postal addresses. The externally-operated website is available in approximately 58 languages to facilitate reporting, and telephone lines are included for 151 countries. AstraZeneca's new case management platform launched in the third quarter of 2020 continues to incorporate the AZ Ethics helpline for reporting compliance concerns and raising inquiries. The new platform is more user-friendly for reporters by expanding access to reporting channels, streamlining intake of reports and prompting regular communication touchpoints with AstraZeneca investigators. AZ Ethics continues to be managed by an independent third party on the Group's behalf and remains available to both employees and external parties via website or telephone, and now SMS in North America.\n\nThe helpline is available to both employees and to external parties to report any concerns or make enquiries. Reports can be made anonymously where desired and where permitted by local law. Anyone who raises a potential breach in good faith is fully supported by management.\n\nThe majority of cases come to our attention through management and employee self-reporting, which can be seen as an indication that employees are comfortable in raising their concerns with line managers or local Human Resources, Legal or Compliance, as recommended in the Code and reinforced in the 2020 Code training. In addition, in 2020, 385 reports of alleged compliance breaches or other ethical concerns were made through the helpline, including reports made by any anonymous route that could be considered whistleblowing: in 2019 there were 556 reports.\n\n## External auditor\n\nA resolution will be proposed at the AGM on 30 April 2021 for the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as auditor of the Company. During 2020, PwC undertook various audit and audit related services. More information about this work and the audit and audit related fees that we have paid are set out in Note 30 to the Financial Statements on page 233. The external auditor is not engaged by AstraZeneca to carry out any audit related services in respect of which it might, in the future, be required to express an audit opinion. As explained more fully in the Audit Committee Report from page 122, the Audit Committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures for audit and audit related services permitted to be carried out by the external auditor and has carefully monitored the objectivity and independence of the external auditor throughout 2020.\n\n## Electronic communications with shareholders\n\nThe Company has been authorised by shareholders to place shareholder communications (such as the Notice of AGM and this Annual Report) on the corporate website in lieu of sending paper copies to shareholders (unless speci/fically requested). While recognising and respecting that some shareholders may have different preferences about how they receive information from us, we will continue to promote the bene/fits of electronic communication given the advantages that this has over traditional paper-based communications, both in terms of the con/figurability and accessibility of the information provided and the consequent cost savings and reduction in environmental impact.",

The Committee reviews the composition of the Board using a matrix that records the skills and experience of current Board members, comparing this with the skills and experience it believes are appropriate to the Company's overall business and strategic needs, both now and in the future. The matrix is set out opposite. Any decisions relating to the appointment of Directors are made by the entire Board based on the merits of the candidates and the relevance of their background and experience, measured against objective criteria, with care taken to ensure that appointees have enough time to devote to our business.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nDiversity is integrated across our Code of Ethics and associated workforce policy, and we promote a culture of diversity, respect and equal opportunity, where individual success depends only on personal ability and contribution. We strive to treat our employees with fairness, integrity, honesty, courtesy, consideration, respect, and dignity, regardless of gender, race, nationality, age, sexual orientation or other forms of diversity. The Board is provided each year with a comprehensive overview of the AstraZeneca workforce, covering a wide range of metrics and measures (including trends around gender diversity, leadership, ethnic diversity and age pro/file). The latest Hampton-Alexander Report published in 2020 named AstraZeneca PLC as one of the top 10 best performers in the FTSE 100 for representation of women on the combined executive committee and their direct reports.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2020, women represented 42.5% of senior management and their direct reports.\n\nThe Board views gender, nationality, cultural and ethnic diversity among Board members as important considerations when reviewing its composition and has met the recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander and Parker Reviews. Considering diversity in a wider sense, the Board aims to maintain a balance in terms of the range of experience and skills of individual Board members, which includes relevant international business, pharmaceutical industry and /financial experience, as well as appropriate scienti/fic and regulatory knowledge. The biographies of Board members set out on pages 104 and 105 give more information about current Directors in this respect.\n\nThe Board has adopted an Inclusion and Diversity Policy (the Policy), which is applicable to the Board and its Committees. The Policy reinforces the Board's ongoing commitment to all aspects of diversity and to fostering an inclusive environment in which each Director feels valued and respected. While the Board appoints candidates based on merit and assesses Directors against measurable, objective criteria, the Board recognises that an effective Board with a broad strategic perspective requires diversity.\n\nThe Policy sets out the Board's aim to maintain a composition of at least 33% female Directors and at least one Director from an ethnic minority background. The Policy provides a commitment to use at least one professional search /firm which has signed up to the 'Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms', to help recruit Directors from a broad, quali/fied group of candidates to increase diversity of thinking and perspective.

Currently, 42% of the Company's Non-Executive Directors are women, and women make up 36% of the full Board.\n\nThis meets the Policy's aim of 33% female representation on the Board, the same target as set out in the report from Lord Davies published in October 2015. The Board also met the recommendations of the HamptonAlexander and Parker Reviews.\n\n- The Board's Inclusion and Diversity Policy can be found on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\nInformation about our approach to diversity in the organisation below Board level can be found in the People section from page 68.\n\n## Inductions and training\n\nNewly appointed Directors are provided with comprehensive information about the Group and their role as Non-Executive Directors. They also typically participate in tailored induction programmes that take account of their individual skills and experience. During 2020, two independent Non-Executive Directors, Euan Ashley and Diana Lay/field, were appointed and commenced ongoing induction programmes intended to provide an understanding of the Group, as well as their duties as a Director of a listed company. Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, these induction programmes are taking place virtually, typically by videoconference, until it is possible to recommence face-to-face meetings and site visits. Although elements of their inductions will be adjusted for their existing expertise and Committee membership, key areas covered during 2020 and continuing into 2021 include:\n\n- > meetings with members of the Board, SET and other senior management\n- > meeting with external legal advisers\n- > meeting with the external auditors\n- > when possible after the pandemic, visits to various sites including R&D centres, commercial sites and operations facilities in China, Sweden, the UK and the US\n- > access to a reading room which provides information on the Group, including /financial performance, pipeline information, policies including the AstraZeneca Securities Dealing Code and rules relating to inside information, investor and analyst reports, and media updates. In addition, the reading room contains guidance on directors' duties and listed company requirements.\n\n## Ongoing training and development\n\nAstraZeneca is committed to developing a culture of lifelong learning, including for Directors. As part of each Director's individual discussion with the Chairman, his or her contribution to the work of the Board and personal development needs were considered. Directors' training needs are met by: a combination of internal presentations and updates and external speaker presentations as part of Board and Board Committee meetings; speci/fic training sessions on particular topics, where required; and the opportunity for Directors to attend external courses at the Company's expense, should they wish to do so. In addition, Directors are encouraged to attend site visits during the year. During these visits, Directors meet with local management and have tours of both AstraZeneca sites and facilities, as well as those of our strategic partners. These site visits further Directors' understanding of the Group's business and operations, as well as providing an insight into the particular challenges faced in those regions. Additionally, such visits provide Directors with an opportunity to engage with key stakeholders. As mentioned elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic signi/ficantly curtailed Board members' ability to travel for site visits during 2020 but such visits will\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee considers both planned and unplanned (unanticipated) succession scenarios and met /five times in 2020. The Committee split the majority of its time between succession planning for Non-Executive Directors and continued routine succession planning for the roles of Chairman, CEO and CFO. The search /firms Korn Ferry, MWM Consulting and Spencer Stuart were engaged to assist the Committee with its work. Korn Ferry and Spencer Stuart periodically undertake executive search assignments for the Company.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee also advises the Board periodically on signi/ficant developments in corporate governance and the Company's compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. See from page 114 for the Company's statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leif Johansson\n\nChairman\n\n- The Nomination and Governance Committee's terms of reference are available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\nrecommence when possible.",

Our priorities were to receive assurance over the integrity of:\n\n- > Financial reporting, internal controls, and the quality and effectiveness of the external audit\n- > Risk management, including the identification, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of risks, and lines of management accountability\n- > Compliance matters, including continued work on fostering a 'Speak Up' culture, and on anti-bullying and anti-harassment\n- > Cybersecurity and information governance\n- > Business continuity planning and resilience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nEffective internal controls, appropriate accounting practices and policies, and the exercise of experienced judgement by the Committee and the Board underpin AstraZeneca's /financial reporting integrity. At least once per quarter, the Committee reviewed the Group's signi/ficant accounting matters, including contingent liabilities and provisions, revenue recognition and impairment triggers for intangible assets. Where appropriate, the Committee challenged management's decisions before approving the proposed accounting treatment. The Committee dedicated signi/ficant time to considering the effects of COVID-19 on the Company's business, internal controls and /financial reporting. This included: (i) the additional accounting and reporting considerations given the increased risk posed by the economic consequences of COVID-19 (including speci/fic, topical guidance from regulators such as the Financial Reporting Council, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Securities Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Association); (ii) ensuring that Company management and internal audit personnel involved in managing and reviewing, and PwC audit teams involved in auditing, the Company's accounting, reporting and control activities were able to carry out their work adequately using remote and technologyenabled working practices; and (iii) accounting considerations, governance, risk management and controls framework relating to the development, manufacture and supply of the vaccine, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and the development of other AstraZeneca medicines to treat COVID-19.\n\nPwC was reappointed as the Company's external auditor by its shareholders at the Company's AGM held in April 2020, serving for the fourth successive year. The Committee\n\ncontinued to oversee the conduct, performance and quality of the external audit, in particular through its review and challenge of the coverage of the external auditor's audit plan and subsequent monitoring of their progress against it. The Committee maintained regular contact with PwC through formal and informal reporting and discussion throughout the year, with a particular focus on maintaining audit ef/ficiency and quality during a prolonged period of remote working.\n\n## Risk identification and management\n\nDuring the year, the Committee continued its regular reviews of the Group's approach to risk management, the operation of its risk reporting framework and risk mitigation. The Committee has continued its interaction with the Company's Science Committee to assist both Committees in deepening their understanding of the clinical compliance risk facing the Group, with Nazneen Rahman (Science Committee Chair) attending the Committee session on R&D activities in China.\n\nWhen identifying risks, the Committee considers the total landscape of risks. The most signi/ficant of these, as measured through potential impact and probability, are our Principal Risks. We then consider those speci/fic risks which are challenging our business presently, our key active risks. Finally, we scan the horizon and identify risks which may challenge us in the future, our emerging risks. This framework provided the context for the Committee's consideration of the Directors' Viability statement. The Directors' Viability statement is underpinned by the assurance provided through a 'stress test' analysis under which key pro/fitability, liquidity and funding metrics are tested against severe downside scenarios.",

The Committee considered in detail the validity of each scenario. This included obtaining additional analysis from management as to the indirect or unintended consequences of its proposed mitigating actions including, for example, assessing the likely response of a broader range of stakeholders. The Committee also assessed whether the proposed mitigations were viable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Viability statement, see Risk Overview from page 78.\n\nThe Committee's consideration of risk management was supported by 'deep dive' reviews of key activities, including:\n\n- > a detailed review with PwC of the audit process, the current and future regulatory environment for auditors and the use of technology in auditing\n- > regular information security and information technology updates\n- > R&D activities in China and the impact of the Human Genetic Resource regulation\n- > a review of compliance-related activities in the Central America & Caribbean (CAMCAR) region\n- > the implementation of the Global Standards on sexual harassment, and bullying and harassment\n- > tax charges and liabilities\n- > de/fined bene/fit pensions scheme liabilities and disclosures\n- > manufacturing and supply activities, including inventory management and C19VAZ vaccine production\n- > speci/fic risks posed by COVID-19 aligned with respective mitigation actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further information on the deep dive reviews can be found in the Business updates section on page 126.\n\nAs discussed below, members of the Committee engaged with Group personnel through virtual meetings to enhance their understanding of risks arising across the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Group's Principal Risks, see Risk Overview from page 78.\n\n## Cybersecurity and information governance\n\nThe Committee receives bi-annual presentations from the Chief Digital Of/ficer and Chief Information Of/ficer (CIO) and her team. During 2020, the Committee continued to monitor and review the effectiveness of our procedures to defend our IT systems against increased levels and new forms of attack from external agents. The Committee also reviewed data governance standards across the Group.\n\n## Business continuity planning\n\nThe Committee receives quarterly risk management reports from the CFO on the key active and emerging risks facing the Company. During the year, the Committee considered the particular risks associated with operating during the pandemic, including maintaining manufacture and supply of the Company's products in all markets.\n\n## Compliance with the Code of Ethics\n\nThe Committee's priorities continue to include overseeing compliance with AstraZeneca's Code of Ethics, and ensuring high ethical standards, and that we operate within the law in all countries where we operate. The Code of Ethics is written in simple and accessible language to empower decision making that re/flects AstraZeneca's Values, expected behaviours and key policy principles. During the year, the Committee continued to monitor and review the effectiveness of our anti-bribery and anti-corruption controls across the Group, prioritising its focus on countries/regions where we have signi/ficant operations and countries in which doing business is generally considered to pose higher compliance risks. The Committee also monitored and reviewed the impact of the implementation of our new Global Standards of behaviour on bullying and harassment. AstraZeneca is committed to ensuring that its people feel respected through promoting a culture of inclusion and diversity, and fostering a working environment in which its employees feel able and safe to speak up.\n\n- For more information on our Code of Ethics, see the Business Review on page 61 and the Corporate Governance Report on page 118.\n\n## Engagement with employees and other stakeholders\n\nThe Committee regularly interacts with members of management below the SET and seeks wider engagement with the Group's employees and other stakeholders. In a normal year, this would have involved members of the Committee visiting a wide range of the Group's sites. As this was not possible in 2020 due to travel restrictions and social distancing measures, the Committee undertook a series of virtual interactions with a wider range of teams from across the organisation. While these virtual interactions were typically shorter than in-person site visits, meeting virtually enabled the Committee to arrange for a greater number of meetings across many geographies. The Committee met with representatives from the following teams:\n\n- > the Japanese marketing company\n- > Business Development Operations and Oncology Business Development\n- > the German marketing company\n- > the Australian marketing company\n- > Treasury\n- > the UK marketing company\n- > the Middle East and Africa marketing organisation\n- > the French marketing company.\n\nThese interactions provided the Committee with valuable insights from these teams about the key issues and challenges relating to, and current and emerging risks associated with, our activities in these areas. They also enabled AstraZeneca personnel from these parts of the business to meet Committee members and share their perspectives on the Group and the work they do. The Committee welcomes the opportunity to engage with employees in these meetings and uses them to communicate the importance it attaches to compliance and our 'Speak Up' culture. The Committee looks forward to being able to make in-person visits again in the future and to meet an even wider range of personnel.\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee monitored the Group's engagements with external stakeholders relevant to the Committee's areas of oversight, including the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, during the year the FRC's Audit Quality Review (AQR) team reviewed PwC's audit of the Group's 2019 Financial Statements as part of its annual inspection of audit /firms. The Audit Committee received and reviewed the /final report from the AQR team which identi/fied no key /findings, assessed the audit as requiring limited improvement, and noted some areas of good practice.\n\nWe hope that you /find this information helpful in understanding the work of the Committee. Our dialogue with our shareholders and other stakeholders is valued greatly and we welcome your feedback on this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philip Broadley\n\nChairman of the Audit Committee",

External audits typically involve a signi/ficant amount of in-person meetings and other interactions. The Committee therefore paid particular attention to the delivery of the audit plan in a predominantly remote working environment.

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee Report\n\n## continued\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe Committee receives a report of the matters considered by the Disclosure Committee during each quarter. At the February 2021 meeting, the CFO presented to the Committee the conclusions of the CEO and the CFO following the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures required by Item 15(a) of Form 20-F at 31 December 2020. Based on their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as at that date, the Company maintained an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over /financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over /financial reporting.\n\nFor further information on the Company's internal controls, refer to the Audit, Risk and Internal Control section in the Corporate Governance Report on page 117.\n\n## External auditor\n\nFollowing a competitive tender carried out in 2015, PwC was appointed as the Company's external auditor for the /financial year ending 31 December 2017. In April 2020, PwC was reappointed as the Company's auditor for the /financial year ending 31 December 2020. Richard Hughes continues to be the lead audit partner at PwC.\n\n## Non-audit services and safeguards\n\nThe Committee maintains a policy (the Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy) for the pre-approval of all audit services, audit-related services and other services undertaken by the external auditor. The principal purpose of this policy is to ensure that the independence of the external auditor is not impaired. The Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy was revised during the year to incorporate the requirement of the FRC Ethical Standard and it includes a 'whitelist' of permitted audit and audit-related services along with a listing of prohibited services aligned with the rules of the FRC, SEC and other relevant UK and US professional and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe pre-approval procedures permit certain audit and audit-related services to be performed by the external auditor during the year, subject to annual fee limits agreed with the Committee in advance. Pre-approved audit and audit-related services below the clearly trivial threshold (within the overall annual fee limit) are subject to case-by-case approval by the Senior Vice-President Finance, Group Controller.\n\nPre-approved audit services included services in respect of the annual /financial statement audit (including quarterly and half-year reviews), attestation opinions under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, statutory audits for subsidiary entities, and other procedures to be performed by the independent auditor to be able to form an opinion on the Group's consolidated Financial Statements. The pre-approved audit-related services, which the Committee believes are services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's Financial Statements, included certain services required by law or regulation, such as /financial statements audits of employee bene/fit plans and transactions. The Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy prohibits any tax services. Audit-related services included the assurance in relation to tax regulatory certi/ficates required to be issued by the external auditor.\n\nThe CFO (supported by the Senior VicePresident Finance, Group Controller), monitors the status of all services being provided by the external auditor. Authority to approve work exceeding the pre-agreed annual fee limits and for any individual service above the clearly trivial threshold is delegated to the Chairman of the Committee together with one other Committee member in the /first instance. A standing agenda item at Committee meetings covers the operation of the pre-approval procedures and regular reports are provided to the full Committee.\n\nAll services other than the pre-approved audit and audit-related services, require approval by the Committee on a case-by-case basis. In 2020, PwC provided audit services including an interim review of the results of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2020, and audit-related assurance services in respect of the Group's debt issuance activities, including its US shelf registration prospectus renewal.\n\n## Audit/non-audit services\n\n|   2020 | $20.3m   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2019 | $14.9m   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Statutory audit fee\n- Audit-related and other assurance services\n\nFees for audit-related and other assurance services amounted to 6% of the fees payable to PwC for audit services in 2020 (2019: 5%). The Committee is mindful of the 70% non-audit services fee cap under EU regulation, together with the overall proportion of fees for audit and audit-related services in determining whether to pre-approve such services. Fees for audit-related and other assurance services payable to PwC in 2020 were 9% of average audit fees over 2017 to 2019.\n\nPwC were considered better-placed than any alternative provider to provide these services in terms of their familiarity with the Company's business, skills, capability and ef/ficiency. All such services were either within the scope of the pre-approved services set out in the Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy or were presented to Committee members for pre-approval and all such services were permitted by the FRC Ethical Standard. Further information on the fees paid to PwC for audit, audit-related and other services is provided in Note 30 to the Financial Statements on page 233.\n\n## Assessing external audit effectiveness\n\nIn accordance with its normal practice, the Committee considered the performance of PwC and its compliance with the independence criteria under the relevant statutory, regulatory and ethical standards applicable to auditors.\n\nThe Committee assessed PwC's effectiveness principally against four key factors, namely: judgement; mindset and culture; skills, character and knowledge; and quality control. As part of that assessment, it also took account of the views of senior management within the Finance function and regular Committee attendees.\n\nThe Committee concluded that the PwC audit was effective for the /financial year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nIn February 2021, the Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment of PwC as the Company's auditor for the /financial year ending 31 December 2021. Accordingly, a resolution to reappoint PwC as auditor will be put to shareholders at the Company's AGM in April 2021.",

This is my /first report as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, since stepping into the role in August 2020. On behalf of the Committee I would like to thank Graham Chipchase for his valuable contribution as Chairman over the past /five years and express my gratitude to him for the great support he provided me as I took over the role.\n\n2020 has been a very challenging and dif/ficult year for everyone around the globe. In this demanding environment, our Chief Executive Of/ficer, Mr Soriot, Chief Finance Of/ficer, Mr Dunoyer, and the Senior Executive Team have delivered an outstanding performance, exceeding targets set in many areas, including strengthening our scienti/fic leadership. They also positioned AstraZeneca as a globally recognised leader in developing solutions in response to the global pandemic.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nAs outlined earlier in this Annual Report, 2020 has been an impactful year for AstraZeneca, which has taken a world-leading role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of testing, treatment and vaccination in response to COVID-19 is an entirely new /field of activity for AstraZeneca. This includes ongoing clinical trials in relation to potential neutralising mAbs for the virus and trials to explore the potential bene/fits of approved medicines in COVID-19 patients. In addition to providing humanitarian aid, such as the development of extremely high ef/ficacy PCR, saliva and antibody tests for the virus and the establishment of national testing facilities, the most signi/ficant development has been our agreement with the University of Oxford to develop, produce and supply\n\na vaccine at a record pace. We have also decided to make an unparalleled move to make these vaccines available and affordable around the world. Our leadership team has secured agreements spanning some 180 countries to deliver billions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, on a not-for-pro/fit and equitable basis throughout the pandemic.\n\nAstraZeneca has also not applied for any Government funded wage subsidies or furlough arrangements, around the world.\n\nFor more information on the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, see the Great Place to Work paragraph on page 132.\n\n## 2020 Performance\n\nAstraZeneca has continued to deliver against its strategic priorities throughout this unprecedented period. In December 2020, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Alexion, which is anticipated to close in Q3 2021 subject to regulatory clearance and approval by shareholders of both companies. The proposed acquisition is intended to accelerate AstraZeneca's commercial and scienti/fic evolution even further, allowing AstraZeneca to enhance its presence in immunology. For more information on the acquisition, see page 79.\n\n## Growth and Therapy Area Leadership\n\nRevenue growth is strong, and has continued throughout 2020, with new medicines driving growth - more than $2 billion of incremental total revenue compared with 2019. This has been accomplished in an environment where the pandemic has adversely impacted healthcare for non-COVID patients. Our success has been made possible through\n\nThe Directors' Remuneration Report contains the following sections:\n\n- > Chairman's letter, page 131\n- > Remuneration at a glance, page 135\n- > How our performance measures for 2021 support the delivery of our strategy, page 136\n- > How the Remuneration Committee ensures targets are stretching, page 137\n- > Annual Report on Remuneration, page 138\n- > Directors' Remuneration Policy, page 156\n\nan acceleration of our digital transformation and the dedication of our workforce, who have ensured both continuity of the supply of medicines to patients and of engagement with healthcare professionals around the world.\n\n## Accelerate Innovative Science\n\nScience productivity has also continued to grow markedly, with return on investment in our pipeline continuing to outperform our peers. We secured a record number of 36 pipeline progression events, either NME Phase II starts or Phase III investment decisions in 2020. Our clinical trial success rate (from pre-clinical through to registrational studies) stands at 24%. This is three times higher than the industry median 1 , exempli/fied in 2020 with two studies unblinded and submitted early for overwhelming ef/ficacy ( Tagrisso ADAURA and Forxiga CKD), emergency supply approval of the COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, and positive readout for tezepelumab NAVIGATOR. We have also secured a range of opportunities to collaborate with partners, bringing our clinical development expertise to bear in relation to NMEs discovered by the global scienti/fic community. An example of this is our trusted partnership with Daiichi Sankyo, which has materialised into a further collaboration for the development of datopotamab deruxtecan (DS-1062), building on our successful 2019 collaboration in relation to Enhertu . These assets continue to show enormous promise in the clinic across multiple tumour types, and the recent successful US and Japan launches of Enhertu highlight the importance of such partnerships for future growth.\n\n- 1 Benchmarking group consists of Amgen, Astellas, Biogen, Boehringer, BMS, Roche, GSK, Janssen, Merck KGaA, Merck, Novo Nordisk, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi.",

AstraZeneca helped employees to work from home whenever necessary, and increased emphasis on the health and safety of our global workforce. We implemented new COVID-19 safe protocols and working arrangements for those that continued to attend the workplace. This ensured continuity of clinical trials and the supply of medicines to patients. We have taken steps to ensure that our workforce, who have continued to deliver, are appropriately recognised and rewarded. Payments to employees and contractors were increased in some areas to address the additional requirements of COVID-19. Of our total workforce, 96% report that they are proud of AstraZeneca's contribution to society through the pandemic. Employee engagement is at an all-time high and we continue to improve our diversity at senior levels. An example of this is the increase in women in senior roles, now at 47% with our ambition to achieve 50% by 2025. This is underscored by the CEO's personal commitment to oversee the delivery of our Inclusion & Diversity strategy as Chair of our Global Inclusion and Diversity Council.\n\n## Total shareholder return\n\nThis success is re/flected in the share price and TSR growth.\n\n## 2020 remuneration outcomes\n\nThe Committee always seeks to ensure that the remuneration of our Executive Directors and our wider workforce re/flects the underlying performance of the business. When approving outcomes, we therefore considered the Group scorecard along with wider business and individual performance over 2020, including other achievements across the enterprise, such as our COVID-19 response summarised earlier in this letter, advancing our Great Place to Work priorities and environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. In that context, we believe that the payments outlined below fairly re/flect performance.\n\n## Annual bonus - 90% of maximum\n\nWhen determining bonus outturns, the Committee considered the formulaic outcome from the Group scorecard along with wider business and individual impact and performance in 2020, including ESG achievements. The Committee determined to award annual bonuses equivalent to 90% of maximum (180% of base pay) and 90% of maximum (162% of base pay) to Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer respectively. Details of the factors considered to determine the bonuses are provided from pages 139 to 143.\n\nOne half of each Executive Director's bonus for 2020 will be deferred into AstraZeneca shares for three years to ensure further alignment with shareholder interests.\n\n## How we have performed in 2020\n\nGlobal pharma peers average\n\nEuropean pharma peers average\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Calculated using a three-month calendar average, from 1 October to 31 December, prior to the start and at the end of the relevant period.\n- More information on the European and global pharmaceutical peer groups can be found on page 134.\n\n## Delivery against strategy - 2020 Group scorecard performance 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                            | Target   | 2020 outcome   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|\n| Deliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership |          |                |\n| Total Revenue                              | $26.8bn  | $26.5bn        |\n| Accelerate Innovative Science              |          |                |\n| Pipeline progression events                | 19       | 25             |\n| Regulatory events                          | 33       | 43             |\n| Achieve Group Financial Targets            |          |                |\n| Cash /flow                                 | $4.4bn   | $4.6bn         |\n| Core EPS                                   | $4.14    | $4.17          |\n\n- 3 For details of the Remuneration Committee's consideration of Group scorecard outcomes and a description of performance measures, see from page 140.\n- Further detail of 2020 commercial and scientific performance can be found in the Strategic Report from page 18.\n\n## Long-term incentives (LTI) 2018 PSP - 99% of maximum\n\nOur approach aims to reward sustainable out-performance and hence our 2018 award will vest at the upper end of the possible range. The three-year performance period for Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards granted to Executive Directors in 2018 ended on 31 December 2020. Awards will vest at 99% of maximum, as shown on page 144 and re/flect overachievement in each and every three year target, as well as delivering a three year TSR of 77%.\n\n## Policy review and remuneration in 2021\n\nAt last year's AGM, our shareholders approved our new Remuneration Policy, which is usually intended to stay in place for three years. We need, however, to acknowledge that the world has drastically changed in the last 12 months, and so did AstraZeneca. Our Executive Directors, Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer, have demonstrated solid and visionary leadership to steer the Company towards delivering another outstanding performance. They have delivered on /financial targets, actively managing the pipeline to accelerate innovation and negotiated new partnerships with great\n\npotential, including the proposed acquisition of Alexion. Notably they have also initiated an impactful societal, not-for-pro/fit initiative - in partnership with University of Oxford - as a response to the global pandemic. During 2020, they have led AstraZeneca in developing new or deeper relationships with governments and non-governmental organisations in the developed and developing worlds, to deliver globally an affordable vaccine and help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nSince their appointment, our Executive Directors have driven a remarkable turnaround in the Company's performance. This has resulted in AstraZeneca delivering a Total Shareholder Return of close to 300% over the last eight years, signi/ficantly ahead of our Global pharmaceutical and FTSE 100 peers (at 183% and 44% TSR respectively) 1 . With this impressive track record, the Board wants to ensure that our Remuneration Policy keeps driving a performance in line with the ambitious expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n- 1 From 2013-2020.

        "page_content": "Markets have changed and became even more differentiated in 2020. Strong leadership performance can more than ever drive exceptional success. In the last year, it became apparent that the current Remuneration Policy did not provide the Committee with suf/ficient /flexibility to appropriately reward the exceptional performance and growth we expect the Executive team to deliver. We have therefore decided to propose some adjustments to our Policy, further increasing the focus on pay for performance for our Executive Directors, while immediately aligning pension contributions to the level of the wider workforce. We have also taken this opportunity to introduce an ESG measure to the performance criteria of our PSP.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, we will therefore be seeking shareholder approval for a renewed Directors' Remuneration Policy (the Policy). The Policy is set out from pages 156 to 167 and is intended to remain in effect for three years from the date of the AGM. Changes to the Policy and how it will be implemented are summarised on the following page and in more detail on page 156.\n\nOur proposal is to increase the maximum PSP award under the Policy to 650% base pay from the current 550%. At the same time, the pension contributions of our current Executive Directors will be reduced to the level of the wider workforce (11% of base pay) under the new Policy. The combination of these two proposed changes drives further a reduction of the /fixed remuneration component, while offering more potential when exceptional performance has been delivered.\n\nIn shaping the new Policy, we have taken into account the perspectives of shareholders, gathered from consultation undertaken during 2020. I met 21 of AstraZeneca's largest shareholders and proxy advisors to discuss our proposals, and was pleased with the level of engagement, feedback and support received. The importance of being able to offer our impactful CEO a remuneration package competitive with our European peers, has been a key theme in consultation discussions with our shareholders. The Committee took shareholders' feedback into account on the proposed changes to the Policy, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who took part for their constructive engagement and support for our proposals.\n\nThere will be a 3% base pay increase for the two Executive Directors, effective 1 January 2021, in line with the UK all-employee base pay increase budget for 2021. Target annual bonus opportunity for Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer in 2021 will be 125% and 100% of base pay respectively, with the maximum bonus opportunity 250% of base pay for Mr Soriot and 200% of base pay for Mr Dunoyer.

Awards under the PSP will be increased for Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer to 650% and 450% of base pay respectively (from 550% and 400%). Shareholding guidelines will mirror the size of PSP awards and a two-year post-cessation shareholding requirement will continue to apply.\n\nThese proposals represent a reduction in our Executive Directors' /fixed pay, whilst seeking to increase the competitiveness of their performance-related pay opportunity. This is illustrated in the charts on the following page, showing our Executive Directors' on-target opportunity relative to comparator groups. However, our proposed changes will only bring Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer into the lower quartile of our global peer group, but will better re/flect AstraZeneca's relative position within the European peer group. Global competition for talent in the biopharmaceutical industry has increased as the world focuses on healthcare. The Board considers that the proposed changes will enable our remuneration framework to be more competitive as we focus on balancing the delivery of long-term sustainable success for our patients and shareholders with the need to attract and retain outstanding talent. And our emphasis on performance related pay is further strengthened, ensuring that outcomes are fully aligned with shareholder interests.\n\n## Incentivising environmental, social and governance delivery\n\nAs re/flected in our 2019 Directors' Remuneration Report, AstraZeneca recognises the importance of ESG factors in operating a sustainable business and has made a number of clear commitments in this area. I am delighted to con/firm that, from\n\n2021, a metric focusing on the delivery of our Ambition Zero Carbon commitments will be included in our executive incentive arrangements for the PSP, to underline the importance we place on eliminating our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Targets and assessment of performance against this metric will be determined in line with the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development GHG Protocol methodology for accounting and reporting of our emissions footprint. In selecting this metric, the Committee considered a range of alternatives, covering Environmental Protection, Access to Healthcare, and Ethics and Transparency, the three pillars of AstraZeneca's sustainability strategy. As set out on pages 141 and 142, the full breadth of achievements in relation to ESG performance is taken into account when considering the individual performance of Executive Directors for bonus purposes.\n\nIn determining this ESG goal, the Committee is also conscious of the signi/ficant contribution to society that is re/flected in AstraZeneca's commitment to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic on a not-for-pro/fit basis during the pandemic. With those plans already well under way, the Committee concluded that it would be appropriate to instead focus on an environmental measure that is designed to incentivise the delivery of our Ambition Zero Carbon commitments, which will require the complete long-term transition to 100% renewable sources of onsite and imported energy, having an entirely electric vehicle /fleet, and the introduction of a programme to eliminate F-gas propellant emissions from our inhaler production -\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Achieved\n\n| Achieve Scienti/fic Leadership               | 96%   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Return to Growth                             | 100%  |\n| Achieve Group Financial Targets - Cash /flow | 100%  |\n| Relative TSR                                 | 100%  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAchieved",

As an organisation committed to health equity, climate action is central to our sustainability strategy because climate change ampli/fies and accelerates existing social inequities, including physical and mental health issues, the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, poverty, forced migration, and disparities in education, housing, wealth, etc. Over the next decade or two, we believe environmental issues will become much more material and a differentiator in the marketplace as the wider healthcare value chain embraces net-zero. This will result in physical and transitional risks to proactively manage and mitigate, and new opportunities as we transition to a low carbon market where healthcare can be delivered to patients and society with a lower environmental burden and improved clinical outcomes.

We take the following robust process to setting annual bonus and PSP targets:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStage 4 Determination of Executive Directors' bonuses\n\nScience targets are based on a cohort of scienti/fic opportunities speci/fied at the start of the performance period. Opportunities represent potential achievements through the pipeline, from an early stage where our scientists work to discover new molecules, through to ultimately obtaining approvals and getting new medicines to patients. Rewarding success at each stage recognises the importance of creating and maintaining a long-term sustainable pipeline. Stretch of proposed targets is reviewed by the Science Committee taking into account factors such as past performance, the external regulatory environment and internal resourcing and ef/ficiencies. Targets for realisation of these opportunities are ambitious.\n\nDeliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership and Achieve Group Financial Targets metrics align with the business' Long Range Plan (LRP), which sets out the /financial framework for delivering our ambitious strategy over the short, medium and long-term. The LRP process includes detailed business reviews during which plans and ef/ficiencies of each unit are challenged, leading to a proposed LRP for the Board to review and challenge. The Committee sets targets based on the Board-approved LRP, considering consensus expectations, independent analytics and anticipated challenges and opportunities. This range of data is used by the Committee to ensure the stretching nature of performance targets is robustly tested. Additionally, the PSP TSR measure is designed to reward strong performance relative to our peers.\n\nThe Committee thoroughly reviews and challenges initial targets proposed by management, before /final targets are agreed and approved. Draft targets are reviewed in December, with /final target setting and approval in January, once the prior year's /final results are available to inform decisions.\n\nThe Committee is provided with considerable supporting material for each metric. For science measures, the Committee reviews and approves the full cohort of opportunities and receives brie/fings from senior science leaders within the business. These targets are set with oversight of the Science Committee. The target in relation to our ESG metric in the PSP is determined with the input of our Non-Executive Director with accountability for the oversight of sustainability matters on behalf of the Board.\n\nAt the end of the period, /final performance against each metric is assessed. Outcomes are calculated based on performance against each weighted metric. Each performance measure is assessed on a standalone basis, so that underperformance against one measure cannot be compensated for by overperformance against another.\n\nFor annual bonus, the fairness of the formulaic Group scorecard outcome is considered in the context of overall business performance and the experience of shareholders. Such considerations include TSR performance and each Executive Director's personal impact on the delivery of the strategy, ESG performance and other organisational achievements, such as inclusion and diversity targets and the realisation of technologybased milestones. Each year there are important individual deliverables beyond the scorecard metrics which are taken into account when determining individual bonuses.\n\n' We set stretching targets which incentivise our leaders to deliver exceptional performance, to drive sustainable results for our patients, our employees and our shareholders.'\n\nCommittee members participate in the full Board discussions on the strategy, LRP and budget which form the basis for the targets. The Committee considers how proposed /financial targets align with the LRP and budget; prior years' outcomes (in absolute terms and against target); how the ambition has changed from the prior LRP and budget; external guidance the business has provided or plans to give; consensus from external /financial analysts and factors it may be impacted by; and the underlying assumptions. Statistical analysis conducted by the Committee's independent adviser is also used to assess the proposals. This includes an assessment of historic levels of performance volatility.\n\nThe Science Committee independently considers and informs the Committee whether science achievements represent a fair and balanced outcome, re/flecting genuine achievements and pipeline progression. Apart from Cash /flow, which is set at actual rates of exchange, /financial metrics are set at budget rates of exchange and evaluated at those rates at year end, which means they are not directly comparable year-on-year. The Committee is, however, provided with data to allow it to conduct year-on-year analyses.\n\nHaving considered the Group scorecard outcome, overall business performance, the experience of shareholders and individual performance, the Committee carefully determines a /final bonus outcome for each Executive Director which is considered fair and appropriate for the year's performance and is in the best interests of shareholders.\n\n## 2021 targets\n\n- > Financial performance goals under the 2021 Group scorecard and PSP would require growth in excess of the average expected of the industry, and above prior year outturns.\n- > The Committee has reviewed the proposed targets against internal and external forecasts including market consensus and is comfortable that the level of stretch promotes exceptional performance.",

Each metric within the scorecard is assessed on a standalone basis and has a de/fined payout range. Performance below the speci/fied threshold level for a metric will result in 0% payout for that metric. 100% of target bonus will pay out for on-target performance. For employees, 200% of target bonus will pay out for the maximum level of performance. Maximum bonus payouts for the CEO and CFO for 2020 were capped at 200% and 180% of base pay respectively. The payout range for each metric is capped in line with each Executive Director's maximum bonus opportunity to ensure underperformance against one metric cannot be compensated for by overachievement against another.

This target was set and evaluated at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the year and evaluated at those rates at the end of the performance period, so that any bene/ficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Company's control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash /flow measure is set and evaluated at the actual exchange rate and is evaluated by reference to net cash /flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets, to be fully transparent with all elements easily derived from the Group IFRS cash /flow statement. The Core EPS and Total Revenue measures are evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates, so that any bene/ficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Company's control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash /flow and EPS outcomes for 2020 were in/fluenced by a number of signi/ficant one-off events, both positive and negative, which were unforeseeable at the start of the year when targets were set. Two material examples of this were the impact of unanticipated changes in corporate income tax rates and the impact of advances received from governments and supranational organisations in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine. The Committee agreed to eliminate these impacts when deciding the /final bonus achievement as best re/flecting the underlying operational Cash /flow and EPS of the business.\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nDuring 2020, the Executive Directors' individual performance was assessed in the following key areas which align with the Company's objectives.\n\n## Pascal Soriot\n\n2020 was a truly remarkable year for AstraZeneca under Mr Soriot's leadership. In addition to delivery of the /financial and scienti/fic performance in extremely challenging circumstances as described from page 19, the Committee considered Mr Soriot's strong performance against his personal objectives as well as his inspiring leadership in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n| COVID-19 response                                                                                                 | In 2020, Mr Soriot worked tirelessly to steer AstraZeneca into a world-leading role in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Achievements of particular importance include: humanitarian aid, through the development of extremely high ef/ficacy PCR, saliva and  antibody tests for the virus, the establishment of national testing facilities and the donation of nine million items of personal protective  equipment for the bene/fit of millions of people around the world; ongoing clinical trials in relation to potential neutralising monoclonal  antibodies for the virus and trials to explore the potential bene/fits of approved medicines in COVID-19 patients; the delivery of an  effective vaccine through our agreement with the University of Oxford, which is on track to deliver up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine  worldwide, on a not-for-pro/fit and equitable basis throughout the pandemic.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Demonstrating  leadership to support  developments in global  life sciences                                       | Throughout 2020, Mr Soriot continued to extend his in/fluence with senior external stakeholders on key issues in healthcare with a  particular focus on the world's response to COVID-19. Mr Soriot attended more than 50 meetings and engagements with senior level  Government of/ficials around the world including in China, Russia, Australia, the EU, Brazil, France, Japan, the UK, France, the  Netherlands, Italy, Germany and the US.

Mr Dunoyer continued to play a critical  leadership role in Japan, playing an active role despite the travel challenges in 2020. Throughout the year Mr Dunoyer had numerous  meetings with senior government of/ficials, as well as other senior pharmaceutical leaders, all of which were critical in enabling  AZ Japan to sign a COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) contract of 120 million doses and contracts with local companies to manufacture  the vaccine locally.

In consideration of their exceptional leadership and personal contribution particularly in relation to the response to COVID-19 as well as the successful announcement of the Alexion acquisition - the Committee determined the bonus outturn for both Executive Directors should be 180% of target (or 90% of maximum).

During 2020, the minimum shareholding requirements for the CEO and CFO were set at 550% and 400% of base pay respectively. Shares that count towards these minimum shareholding requirements are shares bene/ficially held by the Executive Director and their connected persons and share awards that are not subject to further performance conditions. Share awards included are DBP shares in deferral periods and PSP and AZIP shares in holding periods, on a net of tax basis. On this basis, as at 31 December 2020, Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer held shares worth 1,108% and 2,290% of base pay respectively and had ful/filled their minimum shareholding requirements.\n\nA further post-employment shareholding requirement applies to Executive Directors. For two years following cessation of employment, Executive Directors are required to hold shares to the value of the shareholding guideline that applied at the cessation of their employment; or, in cases where the individual has not had suf/ficient time to build up shares to meet their guideline, the actual level of shareholding at cessation. The post-cessation requirement will be maintained through self-certi/fication, with the Committee keeping this approach under review.\n\n## Position against minimum shareholding requirement (MSR) as a percentage of base pay\n\n|               | Bene/ficially owned  shares and shares in  a holding period 1   | Shares in  deferral period   | Shares subject   to performance  conditions   | Value of shares   counted towards   MSR as a % of base pay 2   |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pascal Soriot | 358,272                                                         | 31,740                       | 327,444                                       | 1,108%                                                         |\n| Marc Dunoyer  | 294,875                                                         | 16,234                       | 151,431                                       | 2,290%                                                         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is proposed that the minimum shareholding requirements for the CEO and CFO be increased to 650% and 450% of base salary respectively on approval of the proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2021 AGM.\n\nNon-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director (\u00a388,000 during 2020) or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately equivalent to his basic annual fee (\u00a3625,000 during 2020).

        "page_content": "## Remuneration in the wider context\n\nIn our Corporate Governance Report on page 113, we explain in detail how the Board has chosen to engage with AstraZeneca's workforce, and how important engagement with our employees is if we are to be a great place to work and continue to deliver outstanding performance. The Directors believe that the Board as a whole should continue to take responsibility for gathering the views of the workforce. Consequently, instead of implementing one of the three methods for workforce engagement prescribed in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has chosen to further enhance and develop the long-standing channels of engagement which already exist in the organisation to ensure that the Board continues to understand the global workforce's views on a wide variety of topics, including matters relating to remuneration.\n\nIn light of the challenging conditions in a COVID-19 year, Directors' (including members of the Remuneration Committee) in person engagement was replaced with virtual interactions. Remuneration Committee members review wide-ranging data on employee reward, as well as broader information on workforce trends and culture, which is provided to the full Board. Decisions of the Remuneration Committee affecting employees, such as the annual Group scorecard outcomes, are communicated to employees through internal communications as well as through the Remuneration Report. In the event that more signi/ficant changes to workforce remuneration are proposed, active engagement with employee representative groups provides feedback to help the Committee understand the impact upon the broader workforce.\n\nWhen considering executive remuneration and setting the Directors' Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into consideration our global workforce, looking to ensure the global total reward offering is competitive, compelling and aligned to our business performance, while supporting a culture where everyone feels valued and included, as outlined in the table below. Being a great place to work is one of our three strategic priorities. We explain in our Business Review from page 64 the role that reward plays in developing a diverse culture that encourages and rewards innovation, entrepreneurship and high performance.\n\n## Summary of remuneration structure for employees below the Board\n\n| Element               | Policy features for the wider workforce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Comparison with Executive Director   and Senior Executive Team (SET) remuneration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base pay              | Our base pay is the basis for a competitive total reward package  for all employees, and we review base pay annually.

The regulations require comparison between the remuneration of each Director and that of all employees of the parent company on a full-time equivalent basis. As AstraZeneca PLC has no direct employees, and in line with our disclosure approach in prior years to changes in employee remuneration, the selected comparator group is comprised of employees in the UK, US and Sweden who represent approximately 30% of our total employee population. We consider that this group is representative of the Group's major science, business and enabling units. These employee populations are also well balanced in terms of seniority and demographics.\n\n|                         | Change in 2020 against 2019 (%)   | Change in 2020 against 2019 (%)   | Change in 2020 against 2019 (%)   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                         | Salary/fees                       | Bene/fits                         | Annual Bonus                      |\n| Executive Directors     |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Pascal Soriot           | 0.0%                              | -2.7%                             | 20.0%                             |\n| Marc Dunoyer 1          | 0.0%                              | 25.0%                             | 29.6%                             |\n| Non-Executive Directors |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Leif Johansson 2        | 0.0%                              | 1.4%                              | -                                 |\n| Euan Ashley 3           | -                                 | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Genevi\u00e8ve Berger        | 0.0%                              | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Philip Broadley         | 2.8%                              | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Graham Chipchase        | -10.8%                            | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Michel Demar\u00e9 4         | 15.7%                             | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Deborah DiSanzo         | 0.0%                              | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Diana Lay/field 5       | -                                 | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Sheri McCoy             | 0.0%                              | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Tony Mok                | 0.0%                              | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Nazneen Rahman          | 0.0%                              | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Marcus Wallenberg       | 0.0%                              | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Employees               | 4.1%                              | 4.1%                              | -11.6%                            |\n\n## CEO and employee pay ratios\n\nThe table below sets out the ratios of the CEO's realised pay to the equivalent pay for the lower quartile, median and upper quartile UK employees (calculated on a full -time equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Requirements 2018 (the Regulations).\n\n|   Year 1 | Method   | 25th percentile pay ratio   | 50th percentile pay ratio   | 75th percentile pay ratio   |\n|----------|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|     2020 | Option A | 284:1                       | 197:1                       | 130:1                       |\n|     2019 | Option A | 280:1                       | 190:1                       | 123:1                       |\n|     2018 | Option A | 230:1                       | 160:1                       | 103:1                       |\n\nThe comparison with UK employees is speci/fied by the Regulations. This group represents approximately 10% of our total employee population. The Regulations provide /flexibility to adopt one of three methods of calculation; we have chosen Option A which is a calculation based on all UK employees on a full-time equivalent basis as we consider this to be the most appropriate method of comparison and in line with the calculation of CEO's realised pay. The ratios are based on total pay, which includes base pay, bene/fits, bonus and long-term incentives (LTI). The CEO pay is as shown in the realised pay for 2020 table, on page 138. For UK employees, quartile data has been determined as at 31 December 2020, with calculations based on actual pay data for January to November 2020. Estimates have been used for December 2020 pay, annual bonus outcomes and LTI dividend equivalent payments. These estimates are based on forecast December 2020 pay, the 2020 bonus budget and projected payout, and anticipated dividend equivalent payments on LTI awards, respectively. No elements of pay have been excluded from the calculation, which has been determined following the approach of previous years.\n\n|                     | UK employees   | UK employees   | UK employees    | UK employees    | UK employees    | UK employees    | UK employees    | UK employees    |\n|---------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                     |                |                | 25th percentile | 25th percentile | 50th percentile | 50th percentile | 75th percentile | 75th percentile |\n| Pay data 1  (\u00a3'000) | Base pay       | Total pay      | Base pay        | Total pay       | Base pay        | Total pay       | Base pay        | Total pay       |\n| 2020                | 1,289          | 15,447         | 41              | 54              | 60              | 78              | 82              | 119             |\n| 2019                | 1,289          | 14,330         | 38              | 51              | 53              | 75              | 71              | 117             |\n| 2018                | 1,251          | 11,356         | 36              | 49              | 50              | 71              | 70              | 110             |",

        "page_content": "Although higher slightly at each quartile, the 2020 CEO pay ratio is broadly consistent when compared to 2019, which also saw strong bonus and PSP outcomes, and share price appreciation driving the CEO's realised pay. The Committee is mindful that ratios may vary signi/ficantly year-on-year given varied annual bonus and PSP outcomes and share price movements, and therefore also considers the CEO pay ratio when excluding LTI. The median pay ratio of the CEO compared to the median UK employee when excluding LTI is 53:1, compared to 51:1 in 2018 and 2019. The stability of the ratio at the 50th percentile between 2018, 2019 and 2020, when calculated to exclude the variability of LTIs, is consistent with the pay and progression policies for UK employees. The Committee remains mindful of the debate on executive pay and seeks to ensure that when determining the remuneration of the CEO it /finds the right balance between rewarding performance in a highly competitive global executive talent market, as shown by the pay across the Group.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe table below shows the remuneration paid to all employees in the Group, including the Executive Directors, and expenditure on shareholder distributions through dividends. The /figures have been calculated in accordance with the Group Accounting Policies and drawn from either the Company's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on page 176, or its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 179. Further information on the Group's Accounting Policies can be found from page 180.\n\n|                                               | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |   Difference in spend between  years $m |   Difference in spend between  years % |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Total employee remuneration                   | 8,247     | 7, 5 6 8  |                                     679 |                                   8.97 |\n| Distributions to shareholders: dividends paid | 3,572     | 3,592     |                                     -20 |                                  -0.56 |\n\n## Total shareholder return (TSR)\n\nThe graph below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past ten years with the TSR of the FTSE 100 Index. This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the relevant period. As a constituent of the FTSE 100, this index represents an appropriate reference point for the Company. To provide shareholders with additional context we have also included a 'Pharmaceutical peers average', re/flecting the TSR of the comparator group adopted in 2017 which is used to assess relative TSR performance for PSP awards granted in 2018. It consists of AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, BMS, Celgene, Daiichi Sankyo, Gilead, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, MSD, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, P/fizer, Roche, Sano/fi, Shire and Takeda. Where a comparator company delisted during the 2018 PSP performance period, as the result of an acquisition, TSR performance has been assessed up unto the point of de-listing. The TSR comparator group for PSP awards to be granted in 2021 consists of AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, BMS, Daiichi Sankyo, Gilead, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, MSD, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, P/fizer, Roche, Sano/fi and Takeda.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Policy\n\nThis section sets out the Directors' Remuneration Policy (the Policy) proposed for approval by shareholders at the Company's AGM on 30 April 2021. Subject to shareholder approval, the Policy is intended to remain in effect for three years from the 2021 AGM. The previous page summarises how the Policy differs from the policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM. Whilst the policy at the 2020 AGM received strong support from our shareholders, the Committee reviewed the policy in light of AstraZeneca's continuous growth, the increase to both the CEO's and CFO's role scope following AstraZeneca's COVID-19 response, as well as competitive pay levels in comparison to global and European pharmaceutical peers.\n\n## Setting the Policy\n\nThe Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about speci/fic remuneration arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. The Committee reviews Group remuneration data annually, including ratios of average employee pay to senior executive pay; bonus data; as well as gender and geographical data in relation to base pay and variable compensation. This includes a workforce remuneration review to understand the ways in which reward is differentiated by contribution across the population.\n\nRemuneration for all roles within the organisation is benchmarked against that for comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employee's local market. Executive Directors' remuneration is benchmarked against global and European pharmaceutical peer groups and the FTSE 30. In reviewing the base pay of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the overall level of any base pay increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Director's local market in the relevant year. In setting, reviewing and implementing the Policy, the Committee seeks independent advice and ensures that no Director makes decisions relating to their own remuneration. The Committee connects with the Audit Committee to ensure that the Group's remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance, management of risk, and the pursuit of the Company's strategic objectives.\n\nThe Board as a whole takes responsibility for gathering the views of AstraZeneca's workforce, and does so through multiple channels of engagement. While the Committee does not consult employees speci/fically when setting the Executive Directors' remuneration policy, the Company engages with employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, to solicit feedback generally on a wide range of matters, including pay. Many employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore have the opportunity to vote on the Policy at the 2021 AGM.\n\nIn all aspects of its work, the Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company's major investors on general and speci/fic remuneration matters and provides opportunities for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the Committee and other Committee and Board members. It is the Company's policy to seek input from major shareholders on an ad hoc basis when signi/ficant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed. A thorough consultation process was undertaken as this Policy was developed, with investors' feedback on the Committee's proposals in/fluencing the /final Policy. The Company's shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM and any views expressed will be considered by Committee members.\n\n## Legacy arrangements\n\nThe Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of of/fice on terms that differ to the terms in the Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect or were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company (provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the agreement was not entered into in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Committee in connection with such payments. For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, including share awards, in line with the terms agreed at the time the award was granted.\n\n## Minor amendments\n\nThe Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for Directors described in the Policy without shareholder approval for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation.",

In line with the approach for other employees, a  Director may be offered the opportunity to elect to defer part  of their cash bonus into pension. | The maximum annual bonus amount that can be awarded  is equivalent to 250% of base pay. |\n| On vesting of the deferred shares, shares equivalent in value  to the dividends that would have been paid during the deferral  period will be awarded to the Director.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                         |\n| The Committee has discretion to claw-back from individuals  some or all of the cash bonus award in certain circumstances  including (i) serious misconduct by the individual (for up to six  years from the payment date); (ii) material misstatement or  restatement of the results of the Group (for up to two years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                         |\n| from the payment date); or (iii) signi/ficant reputational damage  to the Group (for up to two years from the payment date).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                         |\n| reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested deferred bonus  share award in certain circumstances (malus) including (i)  serious misconduct by the individual; (ii) material misstatement  or restatement of the results of the Group; or (iii) signi/ficant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                         |\n| reputational damage to the Group.

Stretching performance targets are set by the Committee at  the beginning of the relevant performance period. Performance  measures are closely aligned to the Company's strategy and                                                                                                                                                                                     | The maximum market value of shares that may be  awarded under the PSP in any year is equivalent to 650%  of the participant's annual base pay at the date of grant. |\n|                                                                                                                                  | When selecting the performance measures for each award, the  Committee weights the performance measures as it considers  appropriate, taking into account strategic priorities.

The holding period attached to the 2016 AZIP award will end on 1 January 2024. During the holding period, no further performance measures apply. Payout of an award is subject to continued employment as further described in the Treatment of LTI and Deferred Bonus Plan awards on cessation of employment section on page 165.

The Committee has discretion to claw-back from individuals some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including (i) serious misconduct by the individual (for up to six years from the end of the performance period); (ii) material misstatement or restatement of the results of the Group (for up to two years from the end of the performance period); or (iii) signi/ficant reputational damage to the Group (for up to two years from the end of the performance period).\n\n## Differences in remuneration policy for other employees\n\nThe Company's approach to determining and reviewing the base pay of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a whole is the same. On an annual basis the base pay for individual roles are reviewed in the context of the external market. AstraZeneca participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust base pay review process for all roles. Employee base pay is reviewed through our annual review process. The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive bene/fits, including healthcare and pension, to all employees (including Executive Directors) in the context of their local market.\n\nEmployees globally may be eligible for LTI awards in the form of the PSP and/or restricted stock units depending on their level and market. The occupants of senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards - these are the leaders who have the ability to directly in/fluence the execution of the Company's strategic goals. A proportion of each Senior Executive Team (SET) member's annual bonus is deferred into shares under the DBP. An LTI award may be used for the same purpose as described above on the recruitment of employees, or, for employees other than Directors, for retention.\n\nParticipants may contribute up to \u00a3150 per month\n\nfrom pre-tax pay or such other maximum amount as\n\ndetermined by the Company within the parameters\n\nof applicable legislation.",

The Committee will offer a remuneration package that it considers appropriate in the particular circumstances of the recruitment, giving due regard to the interests of the Company's shareholders and taking into account factors such as typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors, internal relativities and market positioning.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is global, and future Executive Directors might be recruited from organisations with pay structures and practices that differ from AstraZeneca's usual Remuneration Policy. The Committee believes that it is in the interests of shareholders for it to retain an element of /flexibility in its approach to recruitment to enable it to attract the best candidates; however, this /flexibility is limited.\n\nThe Committee may /find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements as a consequence of the recruit leaving his or her previous employment to join AstraZeneca. There is no limit to the value of such buy-out award, however the Committee will rigorously consider the appropriate value so as not to pay more than the compensation being forfeited. The Committee will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company, and will usually seek to use the PSP as the primary vehicle for buy-out awards where possible; however, the precise nature of the compensation arrangement will depend on the type of entitlement being forfeited. The arrangement might therefore comprise a combination of cash, share awards granted under the PSP (subject to the Policy maximum), and other restricted shares. The Committee may introduce a one-off arrangement as permitted under Listing Rule 9.4.2 in order to deliver a restricted share award. Malus and claw-back provisions would normally apply to buy-out awards, for the same reasons as detailed under the DBP and PSP.\n\nRestricted share awards will only be granted as part of recruitment arrangements to compensate for loss of remuneration opportunities suffered on leaving previous employment.\n\nThe Committee considers whether the lost incentives were subject to performance targets and their probability of vesting. The normal approach is to seek broadly to mirror the timing of vesting and application of performance targets of the compensation being forfeited. For example, a buy-out award may be granted without performance conditions where the foregone compensation was not subject to performance testing, however the Committee may apply appropriate performance measures if it considers it appropriate.\n\nThe Committee may allow a restricted share award to vest in tranches at different points. If no performance targets are attached to a compensatory award, it will vest in full if the individual remains in employment on the vesting date. On vesting, shares equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period will be awarded to the Director.",

The Committee has discretion to award payments in certain circumstances, as set out on the following page, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Director's performance. The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which de/fine how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon termination of employment and corporate activity, including sale of a business outside the Group. The treatment of awards in these circumstances will be determined according to the rules and subject to Committee discretion. Aside from the reasons relating to corporate activity, generally, awards under LTI plans will only be allowed to vest for those Executive Directors who leave the Company in circumstances such as ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or any other reason the Committee considers appropriate, or where employment terminates by reason of the Executive Director's death (see the table on page 165 for further information). Awards that are allowed to vest will typically be pro-rated for time, subject to the Committee's discretion. In addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual components of remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of of/fice are set out on the following pages, subject to the terms of any applicable bonus rules or share plan rules.

The exact timing and number of shares vesting will depend on the circumstances, including the reason for leaving (as set out in the table on page 165) and may be subject to Committee discretion, depending on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n## Restricted share awards\n\nThe treatment on termination will depend upon the terms of the individual Executive Director's awards on recruitment. The Committee has discretion to determine the treatment at the time of departure based on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n## Non-statutory redundancy payment\n\nExecutive Directors are not entitled to non-statutory redundancy payments.\n\n## Pension contributions and other bene/fits\n\nPension contributions and other bene/fits for Executive Directors will be payable up to the termination date or as part of a payment in lieu of notice as described on page 163.\n\n## Payments in relation to statutory rights\n\nThe amount considered reasonable to pay by the Committee in respect of statutory rights may be included in the overall termination payment.\n\n## Payments required by law\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with an Executive Director's cessation of of/fice or employment where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of an Executive Director's of/fice or employment.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe departing Executive Director will be required to mitigate their loss by using reasonable efforts to secure new employment.\n\n## Professional fees\n\nThe Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Committee in respect of fees for legal and tax advice, and outplacement support for the departing Executive Director.",

In accordance with the Company's Articles, following their appointment, all Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for re-election. The Company is mindful of the director independence provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and, in this regard, a Non-Executive Director's overall tenure will not normally exceed nine years. The Chairman may terminate his appointment at any time, on three months' notice.

        "page_content": "## Preparation of the Financial Statements and Directors' Responsibilities\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing this Annual Report and Form 20-F Information and the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each /financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework', and applicable law). Additionally, the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules require the Directors to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with international /financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. In preparing the Group Financial Statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with international /financial reporting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nUnder company law, the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satis/fied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their pro/fit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently\n- > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent\n- > for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU\n- > for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether FRS 101 has been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent Company Financial Statements\n- > prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are suf/ficient to show and explain the Parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the /financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\n## Directors' Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over /financial reporting. AstraZeneca's internal control over /financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over /financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Directors assessed the effectiveness of AstraZeneca's internal control over /financial reporting as at 31/uni00A0December 2020 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, the Directors believe that, as at 31/uni00A0December 2020, the internal control over /financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting /firm, has audited the effectiveness of internal control over /financial reporting as at 31 December 2020 and has issued an unquali/fied report thereon.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Strategic Report, Directors' Remuneration Report, Corporate Governance Report and Audit Committee Report that comply with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and /financial information included on our website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other/uni00A0jurisdictions.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement pursuant to DTR 4\n\nThe Directors con/firm that to the best of/uni00A0our/uni00A0knowledge:\n\n- > the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair/uni00A0view of the assets, liabilities, /financial position and pro/fit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole\n- > the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and/uni00A0uncertainties that they face.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors on 11/uni00A0February 2021\n\n## Pascal Soriot\n\nDirector",

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the /financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group.\n\nOther than those disclosed in Note 30 to the /financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- > We identi/fied 12 reporting components which required a full scope audit of their complete /financial information, either due to their size or risk characteristics. These components are the principal operating units in the US, UK (two components), Sweden, China (two components), Japan, France, Germany and Brazil as well as the Parent Company and AstraZeneca Treasury.\n- > We also identi/fied a further 15 reporting components which had one or more individual balances that were considered signi/ficant to the Group's Financial Statements. For these components our work was solely focussed on the audit of one or more of the following /financial statement line items: revenue, accounts receivable, inventory, research and development expense, taxation and/or property, plant and equipment.\n- > We also identi/fied four shared service centres where audit procedures were performed over certain shared service functions for transaction processing. Audit procedures were performed centrally in relation to various Group functions, including pensions, goodwill, intangible assets (excluding software), other investments and litigation matters, as well as the consolidation.\n- > The above procedures accounted for 87% of the Group's revenue and over 76% of the Group's absolute pro/fit before tax.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- > Recognition and measurement of accruals for certain rebates in the US (Group)\n- > Assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of intangible assets (product, marketing and distribution rights and other intangible assets) (Group)\n- > Recognition and measurement of litigation provisions and contingent liabilities in both the Group and the Parent Company (Group and Parent Company)\n- > Recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions (Group)\n- > Valuation of the Group's de/fined bene/fit obligations (Group)\n- > Impact of COVID-19 (Group)\n\n## Materiality\n\n- > Overall Group materiality: $200m (2019: $140m) based on approximately 5% of pro/fit before tax after adding back intangible asset impairment charges (Note 10), fair value movements and discount unwind on contingent consideration (Note 20) and the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma put option liability (Note 3) and material legal settlements (Note 21).\n- > Overall Parent Company materiality: $100m (2019: $50m) based on approximately 0.5% of net assets as constrained by the allocation of overall Group materiality.\n- > Performance materiality: $150m (Group) and $75m (Parent Company).\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the /financial statements.\n\n## Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Group and the industry in which it operates, we identi/fied that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to patent protection, product safety (including but not limited to the US Food and Drug Administration regulation), competition law (including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and tax legislation, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the /financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the /financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the /financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate /financial results and potential management bias in accounting estimates. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:",

Those intangible assets under development and not available for use are tested annually for impairment and other intangible assets are tested when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nThe recoverability of the carrying values of intangible assets is contingent on future cash /flows and/or the outcome of research and development (R&D) activities. The determination of the recoverable amounts include signi/ficant estimates, which are highly sensitive and depend upon key assumptions including the probability of technical and regulatory success and amount and timing of projected future cash /flows (in particular peak year sales and sales erosion curves). Future cash /flows include the impact of COVID-19 if relevant. Changes in these assumptions could have an impact on the recoverable amount of intangible assets.\n\nDuring 2020, $240m (2019: $1,031m) of impairment charges (net of impairment reversals of $165m; 2019: $3m) were recorded (of which $55m (2019: $609m) was recorded in Research and development expenses and $185m (2019: $425m) within Selling, general and administrative costs) as a result of the impairment review conducted by management. There is no headroom in the recoverable amount calculation for those partially impaired assets and they are inherently sensitive to any variations in assumptions, which could give rise to future impairments.\n\n## Recognition and measurement of legal provisions and contingent liabilities in both the Group and the Parent Company (Group and Parent Company) Refer to Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies, Notes 21 and 29 in the Group Financial Statements\n\nRefer to Company Accounting Policies and Note 5 in the Parent Company Financial Statements\n\nThe Group is engaged in a number of legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, commercial litigation, and government investigations/ proceedings. At 31 December 2020 the Group held provisions of $348m (2019: $642m) in respect of legal claims and settlements (together, legal provisions) and disclosed the more signi/ficant legal proceedings as contingent liabilities in Note 29 of the Group Financial Statements. The Parent Company is also named in two of these legal proceedings, as disclosed in Note 5 in the Parent Company Financial Statements.\n\nThere is signi/ficant judgement by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and in determining whether a reasonable estimate can be made for the loss or range of loss for each legal claim.\n\n## Recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions (Group)\n\nRefer to Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Note 29 in the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe Group operates in a complex multinational tax environment and is subject to a range of tax risks, leading to uncertain tax positions which arise in the normal course of business, including transaction related tax matters, transfer pricing arrangements and a number of audits and reviews with tax authorities, and in some cases is in dispute with tax authorities.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Group recorded provisions of $1,014m (2019: $1,027m) in respect of these uncertain tax positions. As disclosed in Note 29, accruals can be built up over a long period of time but the ultimate resolution of tax exposures usually occurs at a point in time. Given the inherent uncertainties in management's assessments of the outcomes of these exposures, there could, in future periods, be adjustments to these accruals that have a material positive or negative effect on the results in any particular period.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's assessment of the impairment of intangible assets. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\nFor those assets or cash generating units which we selected based on our risk assessment to be in scope for our audit we:\n\n- > tested management's process for determining the recoverable amount;\n- > evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used in the impairment models;\n- > tested the completeness and accuracy of the models as well as the underlying data used in the models, including reconciling the cash /flows to the Board approved Long Range Plan (which includes the impact of COVID-19); and\n- > evaluated the signi/ficant assumptions used by management in determining future cash /flows, including the probability of technical and regulatory success, peak year sales and sales erosion curves, and considering the potential future impact of COVID-19 in the future cash /flows.\n\nIn evaluating the reasonableness of management's assumptions we:\n\n- > compared signi/ficant assumptions (including management's probability of technical and regulatory success, peak year sales assumptions and sales erosion curves) to external data and benchmarks; and\n- > performed a retrospective comparison of forecasted revenues and costs to actual past performance.\n\nWe utilised our in-house valuation experts to assess the valuation techniques used and to assist with the evaluation of certain key assumptions for higher risk assets (primarily the probability of technical and regulatory success).\n\nAs a result of our work, we determined that the net impairment charge of $240m recorded for intangible assets was reasonable.\n\nWe considered the disclosures in Note 10 of the Group Financial Statements, including sensitivity analysis based on reasonably possible downsides. We are satis/fied that these disclosures are appropriate.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in respect of the recognition and measurement of legal matters and related disclosures. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\nWe obtained and evaluated letters of audit inquiry with the Group's internal and external legal counsel.\n\nWe tested the completeness of management's assessment of both the identi/fication of legal claims and possible outcomes of each legal claim. This included assessment of whether the Parent Company was named as a party to these legal claims.\n\nWe evaluated management's judgement that each of the claims set out in Note 29 represents a contingent liability and that for one matter management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of possible losses at this stage.\n\nFor the provisions recorded we consider them to be appropriate.\n\nWe evaluated the disclosures in Notes 21 and 29 of the Group Financial Statements and Note 5 in the Parent Company Financial Statements and considered them to be appropriate.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in respect of the identi/fication, recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\nWe tested the completeness of management's assessment of both the identi/fication of tax contingencies and the possible outcomes of each tax contingency. We also evaluated the status and results of tax audits and enquiries with the relevant tax authorities.\n\nWith the assistance of our local and international tax specialists, we tested the information used in the calculation of the probability of different outcomes for tax contingencies and the determination of the liability for those tax contingencies by jurisdiction, including management's assessment of the technical merits of tax positions (including where relevant evaluating any advice received from the Group's external advisors) and estimates of the amount of tax bene/fit expected to be sustained.\n\nWe noted that the assumptions and judgements that are required to determine the accruals mean that there is a range of possible outcomes. However, from the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the Group Financial Statements taken as a whole.\n\nWe considered the disclosures in Note 29 of the Group Financial Statements. We are satis/fied that these disclosures are appropriate.",

Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work in these territories to be able to conclude whether suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group Financial Statements as a whole.\n\nThe Group operates in over 100 countries and the size of operations within each territory varies. We identi/fied 12 reporting components which, in our view, required a full scope audit of their complete /financial information,\n\ndue to their size or risk characteristics. These are the principal operating units in the US, UK (two components), Sweden, China (two components), Japan, France, Germany and Brazil as well as the Parent Company and AstraZeneca Treasury.\n\nWe also identi/fied a further 15 reporting components which had one or more individual balances that were considered signi/ficant to the Group's Financial Statements. For these components our work was solely focussed on the audit of one or more of the following /financial statement line items: revenue, accounts receivable, inventory, research and development expense, taxation and/or property, plant and equipment. We also identi/fied four shared service centres where audit procedures were performed over certain shared service functions for transaction processing. Audit procedures were performed centrally in relation to various Group functions, including pensions, goodwill, intangible assets (excluding software), other investments and litigation matters, as well as the consolidation. Our Group engagement team's involvement in the audits of the reporting components was performed virtually and\n\nincluded regular meetings with component auditors, reviews of the component auditors' planned response to signi/ficant risks and the review of auditor working paper reviews for material reporting components. We attended meetings with local management alongside the component auditors for all full scope and other material components.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was in/fluenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual /financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the /financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the /financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                  | Financial statements - Group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Financial statements - Parent Company                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall materiality              | $200m (2019: $140m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | $100m (2019: $50m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| How we determined it             | Approximately 5% of pro/fit before tax after adding back intangible asset  impairment charges (Note 10), fair value movements and discount unwind on  contingent consideration (Note 20) and the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma  put option liability (Note 3) and material legal settlements (Note 21).                                                                                                                                     | Approximately 0.5% of net assets as constrained  by the allocation of overall Group materiality                                                                                                                                      |\n| Rationale for  benchmark applied | The reported pro/fit of the Group can /fluctuate due to intangible asset impairment  charges, fair value and discount unwind movements on contingent consideration  and the Acerta Pharma put option liability, and material legal settlements. These  amounts are prone to year on year volatility and are not necessarily re/flective of  the operating performance of the Group and as such they have been excluded  from the benchmark amount. | We have considered the nature of the business  of AstraZeneca PLC (being holding company  investment activities) and have determined that net  assets is an appropriate basis for the calculation of  the overall materiality level. |\n\nFor each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between $20m and $130m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality. We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Speci/fically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to US$150m for the Group Financial Statements and US$75m for the Parent Company Financial Statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk, and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identi/fied during our audit above $10m (Group audit) (2019: $7m) and $10m (Parent Company audit) (2019: $7m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- > agreeing the underlying cash /flow projections to management approved forecasts, assessing how these forecasts are compiled, and assessing the accuracy of management's forecasts;\n- > evaluating the key assumptions within management's forecasts;\n- > considering liquidity and available /financial resources;\n- > assessing whether the stress testing performed by management appropriately considered the principal risks facing the business; and\n- > evaluating the feasibility of management's mitigating actions in the stress testing scenarios.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identi/fied any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the /financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the /financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the /financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the Group's and the Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the /financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the /financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the /financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the /financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the",

If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the /financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic Report and Directors' Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic Report and Directors' Report\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the /financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Parent Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code speci/fied for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement, included within the Corporate Governance Report, is materially consistent with the /financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- > The directors' con/firmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- > The disclosures in the Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2020 that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- > The directors' statement in the /financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identi/fication of any material uncertainties to the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the /financial statements;\n- > The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Parent Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- > The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Parent Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary quali/fications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the /financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the /financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- > The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and Parent Company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- > The section of the Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2020 that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- > The section describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the Parent Company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code speci/fied under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.\n\n## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in the Preparation of the Financial Statements and Directors' Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the /financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satis/fied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes\n\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting Companies Act 2006 exception reporting\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- > we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- > certain disclosures of directors' remuneration speci/fied by law are not made; or\n- > the /financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- > a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the Parent Company.\n\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Appointment\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 27 April 2017 to audit the /financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and subsequent /financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is four years, covering the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2020.\n\n## Richard Hughes (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors\n\nLondon\n\n11 February 2021",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of accounting and preparation of financial information\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modi/fied to include revaluation to fair value of certain /financial instruments as described below, in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU. The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company's functional currency.\n\nIn preparing their individual /financial statements, the accounting policies of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform with IASB issued IFRSs. Therefore, where appropriate, adjustments are made in order to present the Consolidated Financial Statements on a consistent basis.\n\n## UK-adopted international accounting/uni00A0standards\n\nOn 31 December 2020 EU-adopted IFRS was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted international accounting standards, with future changes to IFRS being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The Consolidated Financial Statements will transition to UK-adopted international accounting standards for /financial periods beginning 1 January 2021.\n\n## IFRS 3\n\nAn amendment to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' relating to the de/finition of a business was endorsed by the EU in April 2020 with an effective date of 1 January 2020, which the Group has adopted from the effective date.\n\nThe change in de/finition of a business within IFRS 3 introduces an optional concentration test to perform a simpli/fied assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is or is not a business on a transaction by transaction basis. This change is expected to result in more consistency in accounting in the pharmaceutical industry for substantially similar transactions that, under the previous de/finition, may have been accounted for in different ways despite limited differences in substance.\n\nThe change would not have resulted in a different accounting treatment for any transactions undertaken during the prior year when compared with the previous version of IFRS 3.\n\n## IFRS 9, IFRS 7\n\nThe replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs) is a priority for global regulators and is expected to be largely completed in 2021. To prepare for this, the Group early adopted the Phase 1 amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' in 2019. These amendments provide relief from applying speci/fic hedge accounting requirements to hedge relationships directly affected by IBOR reform and have the effect that the reform should generally not cause hedge accounting to terminate. There was no /financial impact from the early adoption of these amendments. Further amendments (Phase 2) were issued on 27 August 2020 and the Group will apply these in 2021.\n\nThe Group has one IFRS 9 designated hedge relationship that is impacted by IBOR reform: our euro 300m cross currency interest rate swap in a fair value hedge relationship with euro 300m of our euro 750m 0.875% 2021 non-callable bond. This swap references three month USD LIBOR and uncertainty arising from the Group's exposure to IBOR reform will cease when the swap matures in 2021.\n\nThe implications on the wider business of IBOR reform have been assessed and the Group is currently preparing to move to the new benchmark rates in 2021.\n\n## Basis for preparation of Financial Statements on a going concern basis\n\nThe Group has considerable /financial resources available. As at 31 December 2020, the Group has $12.1bn in /financial resources (cash and cash equivalent balances of $7.8bn, $0.2bn of liquid /fixed income securities and undrawn committed bank facilities of $4.1bn, of which $3.4bn is available until April 2024, $0.7bn is available until November 2021 (with a one-year extension option, exercisable by the Group), with only $2.4bn of borrowings due within one year). In addition, to support the /financing of the acquisition of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Group entered into committed bank facilities totalling $17.5bn during December 2020. The facilities are intended to cover the /financing of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration and associated acquisition costs and to re/finance the existing term loan and revolving credit facilities of Alexion. All the facilities contain no /financial covenants and were undrawn at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Directors have considered the impact of COVID-19 on AstraZeneca's operations (including the effects of any governmental or regulatory response to the pandemic), and mitigations to these risks. Overall, the impact of these items would heighten certain risks, such as those relating to the delivery of the pipeline or launch of new medicines, the execution of AstraZeneca's commercial strategy, the manufacturing and supply of\n\nmedicines and reliance on third-party goods and services. The Company is continuously monitoring, and mitigating where possible, impacts of these risks.\n\nThe Group's revenues are largely derived from sales of medicines covered by patents, which provide a relatively high level of resilience and predictability to cash in/flows, although government price interventions in response to budgetary constraints are expected to continue to adversely affect revenues in many of the mature markets. The Group, however, anticipates new revenue streams from both recently launched medicines and products in development, and the Group has a wide diversity of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas.\n\nConsequently, the Directors believe that, overall, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.\n\n## Estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgements and estimates need exercising, the most signi/ficant of which include the following Key Judgements KJ and Signi/ficant Estimates SE :\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  revenue recognition - see Revenue Accounting Policy on page 181 KJ and Note 1 on page 187 SE\n- >  expensing of internal development expenses - see Research and Development Policy on page 182 KJ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  impairment reviews of Intangible assets - see Note 10 on page 199 SE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  useful economic life of Intangible assets see Research and Development Policy on page 182 KJ and Note 10 on page 200 SE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  business combinations and Goodwill (and Contingent consideration arising from business combinations) - see Business Combinations and Goodwill Policy on page 184 KJ , Note 10 on page 200 KJ , and Note 20 on page 208 SE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  litigation liabilities - see Litigation and Environmental Liabilities within Note 29 on page 229 KJ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  operating segments - see Note 6 on page 193 KJ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  employee bene/fits - see Note 22 on page 216 SE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n>  taxation - see Taxation Policy on page 183\n\nand Note 29 on page 232.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "AstraZeneca has assessed the impact of the uncertainty presented by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Financial Statements, speci/fically considering the impact on key judgements and signi/ficant estimates along with several other areas of increased risk.\n\nA detailed assessment has been performed, focusing on the following areas:\n\n- >  recoverable value of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n- >  impact on key assumptions used to estimate contingent consideration liabilities\n- >  key assumptions used in estimating the Group's de/fined bene/fit pension obligations\n- >  basis for estimating clinical trial accruals\n- >  key assumptions used in estimating rebates and chargebacks for US Product Sales\n- >  valuations of unlisted equity investments\n- >  expected credit losses associated with changes in credit risk relating to trade and other receivables\n- >  net realisable value of inventories\n- >  fair value of certain /financial instruments\n- >  recoverability of deferred tax assets\n- >  effectiveness of hedge relationships.\n\nNo material accounting impacts relating to the areas assessed above were recognised in the year.\n\nThe Group will continue to monitor these areas of increased judgement, estimation and risk for material changes.\n\nFinancial risk management policies are detailed in Note 27 to the Financial Statements from page 219.\n\nAstraZeneca's management considers the following to be the most important accounting policies in the context of the Group's operations.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue comprises Product Sales and Collaboration Revenue.\n\nProduct Sales are revenues arising from contracts with customers. Collaboration Revenue arises from other contracts, however, the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' are applied as set out below.\n\nRevenue excludes inter-company revenues and value-added taxes.\n\n## Product Sales\n\nProduct Sales represent net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be variable consideration and include signi/ficant estimates. Sales are recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when title passes to the customer, either on shipment or on receipt of goods by the customer, depending on local trading terms. In markets where returns are signi/ficant,\n\nestimates of returns are accounted for at the point revenue is recognised. Revenue is not recognised in full until it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nRebates are amounts payable or credited to a customer, usually based on the quantity or value of Product Sales to the customer for speci/fic products in a certain period. Product sales rebates, which relate to Product Sales that occur over a period of time, are normally issued retrospectively.\n\nAt the time Product Sales are invoiced, rebates and deductions that the Group expects to pay, are estimated. These rebates typically arise from sales contracts with government payers, third-party managed care organisations, hospitals, long-term care facilities, group purchasing organisations and various state programmes.\n\nFor the markets where returns are signi/ficant, we estimate the quantity and value of goods which may ultimately be returned at the point of sale. Our returns accruals are based on actual experience over the preceding 12 months for established products together with marketrelated information such as estimated stock levels at wholesalers and competitor activity which we receive via third-party information services. For newly launched products, we use rates based on our experience with similar products or a predetermined percentage.\n\nWhen a product faces generic competition, particular attention is given to the possible levels of returns and, in cases where the circumstances are such that the level of Product Sales are considered highly probable to reverse, revenues are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally on ultimate prescription of the product to patients.\n\nThe methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Once the uncertainty associated with returns is resolved, revenue is adjusted accordingly.\n\nUnder certain collaboration agreements which include a pro/fit sharing mechanism, our recognition of Product Sales depends on which party acts as principal in sales to the end customer. In the cases where AstraZeneca acts as principal, we record 100% of sales to the end customer.\n\nContracts relating to the supply of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca during the COVID-19 pandemic include conditions whereby payments are receivable from customers in advance of the delivery of product. Such amounts are held on the balance sheet as contract liabilities until the related revenue is recognised, generally upon product delivery.\n\nCertain of these contracts contain further provisions that restrict the use of inventory manufactured in speci/fied supply chains to speci/fied customers, resulting in an enforceable right to payment as the activities are performed. Under IFRS 15, such contracts require revenue to be recognised over time using an appropriate and reasonably measurable method to measure progress. Revenue is recognised on these contracts based on the proportion of product delivered compared to the total contracted volumes.\n\n## Collaboration Revenue\n\nCollaboration Revenue includes income from collaborative arrangements where either the Group has sold certain rights associated with those products, but retains a signi/ficant ongoing economic interest or has acquired a signi/ficant interest from a third party. Signi/ficant interest can include ongoing supply of /finished goods, participation in pro/fit share arrangements or direct interest from sales of medicines.\n\nThese arrangements may include development arrangements, commercialisation arrangements and collaborations. Income may take the form of upfront fees, milestones, pro/fit sharing and royalties and includes pro/fit share income arising from sales made as principal by a collaboration partner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ Timing of recognition of clinical and regulatory milestones is considered to be a key judgement. There can be signi/ficant uncertainty over whether it is highly probable that there would not be a signi/ficant reversal of revenue in respect of speci/fic milestones if these are recognised before they are triggered due to them being subject to the actions of third parties. In general, where the triggering of a milestone is subject to the decisions of third parties (e.g. the acceptance or approval of a /filing by a regulatory authority), the Group does not consider that the threshold for recognition is met until that decision is made.\n\nWhere Collaboration Revenue arises from the licensing of the Group's own intellectual property, the licences we grant are typically rights to use intellectual property which do not change during the period of the licence and therefore related non-conditional revenue is recognised at the point the license is granted and variable consideration as soon as recognition criteria are met. Those licences are generally unique and therefore when there are other performance obligations in the contract, the basis of allocation of the consideration makes use of the residual approach as permitted by IFRS 15.\n\nThese arrangements typically involve the receipt of an upfront payment, which the contract attributes to the license of the intangible assets, and ongoing receipts, which the contract attributes to the sale of the product we manufacture. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, we account for",

Where the substance of an arrangement is that of a right to access rights attributable to an intangible asset, revenue is recognised over time, normally on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.\n\nWhere the fair market value of the undelivered component (for example, a manufacturing agreement) exceeds the contracted price for that component, we defer an appropriate element of the upfront consideration and amortise this over the performance period. However, where the fair market value of the undelivered component is equal to or lower than the contracted price for that component, we treat the whole of the upfront amount as being attributable to the delivered intangible assets and recognise that part of the revenue upon delivery. No element of the contracted revenue related to the undelivered component is ordinarily allocated to the sale of the intangible asset. This is because the contracted revenue relating to the undelivered component is contingent on future events (such as sales) and cannot be recognised until either receipt of the amount is highly probable or where the consideration is received for a licence of intellectual property, on the occurrence of the related sales.\n\nWhere the Group provides ongoing services, revenue in respect of this element is recognised over the duration of those services. Where the arrangement meets the de/finition of a licence agreement, sales milestones and sales royalties are recognised when achieved by applying the royalty exemption under IFRS 15. All other milestones and sales royalties are recognised when considered it is highly probable there will not be a signi/ficant reversal of income. The determination requires estimates to be made in relation to future Product Sales.\n\nWhere Collaboration Revenue is recorded and there is a related Intangible asset that is licensed as part of the arrangement, an appropriate amount of that Intangible asset is charged to Cost of sales based on an allocation of cost or value to the rights that have been licenced.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales are recognised as the associated revenue is recognised. Cost of sales include manufacturing costs, royalties payable on revenues recognised, movements in provisions for inventories, inventory write-offs and impairment charges in relation to manufacturing assets. Cost of sales also includes cocollaborator pro/fit shares arising from collaborations, and foreign exchange gains and losses arising from business trading activities.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is charged to pro/fit and loss in the year in which it is incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ Internal development expenditure is capitalised only if it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'. This is considered a key judgement. Where regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is charged to pro/fit and loss and this is almost invariably the case prior to approval of the drug by the relevant regulatory authority. Where, however, recognition criteria are met, Intangible assets are capitalised and amortised on a straightline basis over their useful economic lives from product launch. At 31 December 2020, no amounts have met the recognition criteria.\n\nPayments to in-license products and compounds from third parties for new research and development projects (in process research and development) generally take the form of upfront payments, milestones and royalty payments. Where payments made to third parties represent consideration for future research and development activities, an evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such payments are expensed if they represent compensation for sub-contracted research and development services not resulting in a transfer of intellectual property. By contrast, payments are capitalised if they represent compensation for the transfer of identi/fiable intellectual property developed at the risk of the third party. Development milestone payments relating to identi/fiable intellectual property are capitalised as the milestone is triggered. Any upfront or milestone payments for research activities where there is no associated identi/fiable intellectual property are expensed. Assets capitalised are amortised, on a straight-line basis, over their useful economic lives from product launch.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ The determination of useful economic life is considered to be a key judgement. On product launch, the Group makes a judgement as to the expected useful economic life with reference to the expiry of associated patents for the product, expectation around the competitive environment speci/fic to the product and our detailed long-term riskadjusted sales projections compiled annually across the Group and approved by the Board.\n\nThe useful economic life can extend beyond patent expiry dependent upon the nature of the product and the complexity of the development and manufacturing process. Signi/ficant sales can often be achieved post patent expiration.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation and impairments. Intangible assets relating to products in development are subject to impairment testing annually. All Intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The determination of the recoverable amounts include key estimates which are highly sensitive to, and depend upon, key assumptions as detailed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements from page 198.\n\nImpairment reviews have been carried out on all Intangible assets that are in development (and not being amortised), all major intangible assets acquired during the year and all other intangible assets that have had indications of impairment during the year. Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to sell using a discounted cash /flow calculation, where the products' expected cash /flows are risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining useful economic life. The determination of the recoverable amounts include signi/ficant estimates which are highly sensitive and depend upon key assumptions as detailed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements from page 198. Sales forecasts and speci/fic allocated costs (which have both been subject to appropriate senior management review and approval) are risk-adjusted and discounted using appropriate rates based on our post-tax weighted average cost of capital or for fair value less costs to sell, a required rate of return for a market participant. Our weighted average cost of capital re/flects factors such as our capital structure and our costs of debt and equity.\n\nAny impairment losses are recognised immediately in pro/fit. Intangible assets relating to products which fail during development (or for which development ceases for other reasons) are also tested for impairment and are written down to their recoverable amount (which is usually nil).\n\nIf, subsequent to an impairment loss being recognised, development restarts or other facts and circumstances change indicating that the impairment is less or no longer exists, the value of the asset is re-estimated and its carrying value is increased to the recoverable amount, but not exceeding the original value, by recognising an impairment reversal in operating pro/fit.",

        "page_content": "## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income so as to match with the related expenses that they are intended to compensate. Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under Trade and other payables as deferred income and released to net off against the related expenditure when incurred.\n\nEach contract is assessed to determine whether there are both grant elements and supply of product which need to be separated. In each case, the contracts set out the speci/fied terms for the supply of the product and the provisions for funding for certain costs, primarily research and development associated with the IP. It is considered whether there are any conditions for the funding to be refunded. The consideration in the contract is allocated between the grant and supply elements. The standalone selling price for the supply of products is determined by reference to observed prices with other customers. The amount allocated as a government grant is determined by reference to the speci/fic agreed costs and activities identi/fied in the contract as not directly attributable to the supply of product. Government grants are recorded as an offset to the relevant expense in the Income Statement and are capped to match the relevant costs incurred.\n\n## Joint arrangements and associates\n\nThe Group has arrangements over which it has joint control and which qualify as joint operations or joint ventures under IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. For joint operations, the Group recognises its share of revenue that it earns from the joint operations and its share of expenses incurred. The Group also recognises the assets associated with the joint operations that it controls and the liabilities it incurs under the joint arrangement. For joint ventures and associates, the Group recognises its interest in the joint venture or associate as an investment and uses the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe Group accounts for pensions and other employee bene/fits (principally healthcare) under IAS 19 'Employee Bene/fits' and recognises all actuarial gains and losses immediately through Other comprehensive income. In respect of de/fined bene/fit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value while plan assets are measured at fair value. Given the extent of the assumptions used to determine these values, these are considered to be signi/ficant estimates. The operating and /financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in pro/fit, current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and /financing costs are recognised in full in the periods in which they arise. Remeasurements of the net de/fined bene/fit pension liability, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income.\n\nWhere the calculation results in a surplus to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any available future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Payments to de/fined contribution plans are recognised in pro/fit as they fall due.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe current tax payable is based on taxable pro/fit for the year. Taxable pro/fit differs from reported pro/fit because taxable pro/fit excludes items that are either never taxable or tax deductible or items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period. The Group's current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. This requires judgements to be made in respect of the availability of future taxable income.\n\nNo deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Group's Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nAccruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements of potential exposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax bene/fits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax bene/fit and re/flects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable result.\n\nAccruals for tax contingencies are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nFurther details of the estimates and assumptions made in determining our recorded liability for transfer pricing contingencies and other tax\n\ncontingencies are included in Note 29 to the Financial Statements from page 232.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nAll plans have been classi/fied as equity settled after assessment. The grant date fair value of employee share plan awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo model. In accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment', the resulting cost is recognised in pro/fit over the vesting period of the awards, being the period in which the services are received. The value of the charge is adjusted to re/flect expected and actual levels of awards vesting, except where the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition. Cancellations of equity instruments are treated as an acceleration of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is recognised in pro/fit immediately.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group's policy is to write off the difference between the cost of each item of Property, plant and equipment and its residual value over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Assets under construction are not depreciated.\n\nReviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. It is impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, and three to 15 years for plant and equipment. All items of Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in operating pro/fit.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nThe Group has no borrowing costs with respect to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are recognised in pro/fit as incurred and in accordance with the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Leases\n\n## Accounting policy applied from 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02019 (IFRS 16)\n\nThe Group's lease arrangements are principally for property, most notably a portfolio of of/fice premises and employee accommodation, and for a global car /fleet, utilised primarily by our sales and marketing teams.\n\nThe lease liability and corresponding right-ofuse asset arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- >  /fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable\n- >  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date",

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. Property leases will often include an early termination or extension option to the lease term. Fleet management policies vary by jurisdiction and may include renewal of a lease until a measurement threshold, such as mileage, is reached. Extension and termination options have been considered when determining the lease term, along with all facts and circumstances that may create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension periods (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using incremental borrowing rates, as in the majority of leases held by the Group the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily identi/fiable. Calculating the discount rate is an estimate made in calculating the lease liability. This rate is the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk, adjusting for terms speci/fic to the lease including term, country and currency.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate, which are initially measured as at the commencement date, with any future changes in the index or rate excluded from the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nLease payments are allocated between principal and /finance cost. The /finance cost is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases of Property, plant and equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value leases are those where the underlying asset value, when new, is $5,000 or less and includes IT equipment and small items of of/fice furniture.\n\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nRight-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life. It is impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, and three to 15 years for motor vehicles and other assets.\n\nThere are no material lease agreements under which the Group is a lessor.\n\n## Accounting policy applied until 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02019 (IAS 17)\n\nLeases are classi/fied as /finance leases if they transfer substantively all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, otherwise they are classi/fied as operating leases. Assets and liabilities arising on /finance leases are initially recognised at fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. Finance charges under /finance leases are allocated to each reporting period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the /finance liability. Rentals under operating leases are charged to pro/fit and loss on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill\n\nIn assessing whether an acquired set of assets and activities is a business or an asset, management will /first elect whether to apply an optional concentration test to simplify the assessment. Where the concentration test is applied, the acquisition will be treated as the acquisition of an asset if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired\n\n(excluding cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and related goodwill) is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identi/fiable assets.\n\nWhere the concentration test is not applied, or is not met, a further assessment of whether the acquired set of assets and activities is a business will be performed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ The determination of whether an acquired set of assets and activities is a business or an asset can be judgemental, particularly if the target is not producing outputs. Management uses a number of factors to make this determination, which are primarily focused on whether the acquired set of assets and activities include substantive processes that mean the set is capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return. Key determining factors include the stage of development of any assets acquired, the readiness and ability of the acquired set to produce outputs and the presence of key experienced employees capable of conducting activities required to develop or manufacture the assets. Typically, the specialised nature of many pharmaceutical assets and processes is such that until assets are substantively ready for production and promotion, there are not the required processes for a set of assets and activities to meet the de/finition of a business in IFRS 3.\n\nOn the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identi/fiable assets and liabilities. Attributing fair values is a judgement. Contingent liabilities are also recorded at fair value unless the fair value cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill. Where the Group fully acquires, through a business combination, assets that were previously held in joint operations, the Group has elected not to uplift the book value of the existing interest in the asset held in the joint operation to fair value at the date full control is taken. Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other contingent liabilities.\n\nWhere not all of the equity of a subsidiary is acquired, the non-controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-bycase basis. Put options over non-controlling interests are recognised as a /financial liability, with a corresponding entry in either Retained earnings or against non-controlling interest reserves on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe timing and amount of future contingent elements of consideration is considered a signi/ficant estimate. Contingent consideration, which may include development and launch milestones, revenue threshold milestones and",

Unsettled amounts of consideration are held at fair value within payables with changes in fair value recognised immediately in pro/fit.\n\nGoodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired.\n\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Group's policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate Goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' and IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', such Goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by AstraZeneca PLC. Control is regarded as the exposure or rights to the variable returns of the entity when combined with the power to affect those returns.\n\nThe /financial results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is obtained until the date that control ceases.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The /first in, /first out or an average method of valuation is used. For /finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses (including depreciation). Selling expenses and certain other overhead expenses (principally central administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.\n\nWrite-downs of inventory occur in the general course of business and are recognised in Cost of sales for launched or approved products and in Research and development expense for products in development.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classi/fied as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. A sale is usually considered highly probable only when the appropriate level of management has committed to the sale.\n\nAssets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Where there is a partial transfer of a non-current asset to held for sale, an allocation of value is made between the current and non-current portions of the asset based on the relative value of the two portions, unless there is a methodology that better re/flects the asset to be disposed of.\n\nAssets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nFinancial assets included in Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. The Group holds the Trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash /flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses.\n\nTrade receivables that are subject to debt factoring arrangements are derecognised if they meet the conditions for derecognition detailed in IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nFinancial liabilities included in Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Contingent consideration payables are held at fair value within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as de/fined in Note 12.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nThe Group's /financial instruments include Lease liabilities, Trade and other receivables and payables, liabilities for Contingent consideration and put options under business combinations, and rights and obligations under employee bene/fit plans which are dealt with in speci/fic accounting policies.\n\nThe Group's other /financial instruments include:\n\n- >  Cash and cash equivalents\n- >  Fixed deposits\n- >  Other investments\n- >  Bank and other borrowings\n- >  Derivatives\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions, and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired. They are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are held at amortised cost under the hold to collect classi/fication, where they meet the hold to collect 'solely payments of principal and interest' test criteria under IFRS 9. Those not meeting these criteria are held at fair value through pro/fit and loss. Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Cash Flows include unsecured bank overdrafts at the balance sheet date where balances often /fluctuate between a cash and overdraft position.\n\n## Fixed deposits\n\nFixed deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other /financial institutions, are initially measured at fair value, plus direct transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method at each reporting date. Changes in carrying value are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Other investments\n\nInvestments are classi/fied as fair value through pro/fit or loss (FVPL), unless the Group makes an irrevocable election at initial recognition for certain non-current equity investments to present changes in Other comprehensive income (FVOCI). If this election is made, there is no subsequent reclassi/fication of fair value gains and losses to pro/fit and loss following the derecognition of the investment.\n\n## Bank and other borrowings\n\nThe Group uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, to hedge the interest rate exposure inherent in a portion of its /fixed interest rate debt. In such cases the Group will either designate the debt as fair value through pro/fit and loss when certain criteria are met or as the hedged item under a fair value hedge.\n\nIf the debt instrument is designated as fair value through pro/fit or loss, the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being included in pro/fit as an expense) and is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with changes in carrying value being recognised in pro/fit (along with changes in the fair value of the related derivative), with the exception of changes in the fair value of the debt instrument relating to own credit risk which are recorded in Other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9. Such a designation has been made where this signi/ficantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would result from recognising gains and losses on different bases.\n\nIf the debt is designated as the hedged item under a fair value hedge, the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the debt) and is remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date with changes in carrying value being recognised in pro/fit (along with changes in the fair value of the related derivative).\n\nIf the debt is designated in a cash /flow hedge, the debt is measured at amortised cost (with gains or losses taken to pro/fit and direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the debt). The related derivative is remeasured for fair value changes at each reporting date with the portion of the gain or loss on the derivative that is determined to be an effective hedge recognised in Other comprehensive income.

Changes in carrying value are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nForeign currency transactions, being transactions denominated in a currency other than an individual Group entity's functional currency, are translated into the relevant functional currencies of individual Group entities at average rates for the relevant monthly accounting periods, which approximate to actual rates.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency transactions are retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange gains and losses on loans and on short-term foreign currency borrowings and deposits are included within Finance expense. Exchange differences on all other foreign currency transactions are recognised in Operating pro/fit in the individual Group entity's accounting records.\n\nNon-monetary items arising from foreign currency transactions are not retranslated in the individual Group entity's accounting records.\n\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements, income and expense items for Group entities with a functional currency other than US dollars are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates, which approximate to actual rates, for the relevant accounting periods. Assets and liabilities are translated at the US dollar exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognised in Other comprehensive income.\n\nIf certain criteria are met, non-US dollar denominated loans or derivatives are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of net investments, and of foreign currency loans which are designated in an effective net investment hedge relationship, are recognised in Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign\n\nexchange derivatives hedging net investments in foreign operations are carried at fair value. Effective fair value movements are recognised in Other comprehensive income, with any ineffectiveness taken to pro/fit. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to pro/fit and loss when the foreign operation is sold.\n\n## Litigation and environmental liabilities\n\nAstraZeneca is involved in legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Group. Provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs, including related legal costs, can be estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate disclosures are included. Determining the timing of recognition of when an adverse outcome is probable is considered a key judgement, refer to Note 29 to the Financial Statements on page 229.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they are incurred.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which a provision has been established, the best estimate of the amount expected to be received is recognised as an asset only when it is virtually certain.\n\nAstraZeneca is exposed to environmental liabilities relating to its past operations, principally in respect of soil and groundwater remediation costs. Provisions for these costs are made when there is a present obligation and where it is probable that expenditure on remedial work will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the cost. Provisions are discounted at the relevant risk free rate where the effect is material.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe carrying values of non-/financial assets, other than Inventories and Deferred tax assets, are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. For Goodwill, Intangible assets under development and for any other assets where such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated based on the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. In assessing the recoverable amount, the estimated future cash /flows, adjusted for the risks speci/fic to each asset, are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money, the general risks affecting the pharmaceutical industry and other risks speci/fic to each asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets\n\nthat generates cash in/flows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash /flows of other assets. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## International accounting transition\n\nOn transition to using adopted IFRSs in the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group took advantage of several optional exemptions available in IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards'. The major impacts which are of continuing importance are detailed below:\n\n- >  Business combinations - IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' has been applied from 1 January 2003, the date of transition, rather than being applied fully retrospectively. As a result, the combination of Astra and Zeneca is still accounted for as a merger, rather than through purchase accounting. If purchase accounting had been adopted, Zeneca would have been deemed to have acquired Astra.\n- >  Cumulative exchange differences - the Group chose to set the cumulative exchange difference reserve at 1 January 2003 to nil.\n\n## Applicable accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted\n\nAt the date of authorisation of these /financial statements, the following amendments were in issue but not yet adopted by the Group:\n\n- >  amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Instruments', effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 not endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB).\n- >  amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4, IFRS 16 in relation to Interest rate benchmark reform - phase 2, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 - endorsed by the UKEB on 5 January 2021.\n\nThe above amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on the Group's net results.",

When invoicing Product Sales in the US, we estimate the rebates and chargebacks we expect to pay. The adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2020 was 3.5% (2019: 3.6%; 2018: 3.2%). The most signi/ficant of these relate to the Medicaid and state programmes with an adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2020 of 1.1% (2019: 1.3%; 2018: 2.6%) and Managed Care and Medicare of 1.5% (2019: 1.9%; 2018: 1.2%).\n\nThese values demonstrate the level of sensitivity; further meaningful sensitivity is not able to be provided due to the large volume of variables that contribute to the overall rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals.",

These adjustments re/flect revised estimates for future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, revised estimates for future royalties payable.\n\nIn 2020, Selling, general and administrative costs also includes a credit of $143m (2019: credit of $58m; 2018: credit of $32m) resulting from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of Almirall's respiratory business. These adjustments re/flect revised estimates for future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, revised estimates for future milestones payable.\n\nIn 2020, Selling, general and administrative costs also includes a credit of $9m (2019: charge of $610m; 2018: credit of $219m) relating to a number of legal proceedings including settlements in various jurisdictions in relation to several marketed products.\n\nIn 2020, there were no changes in estimates of cash /flows arising from the put option over the non-controlling interest in Acerta Pharma, and therefore no charge or credit to Selling, general and administrative costs (2019: charge of $172m; 2018: credit of $113m).\n\n## Research and development expense: Government grants\n\nDuring the year $222m of government grants were recognised within Operating pro/fit.

The 2020 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2019 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net increases in provisions for tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2018 prior period current tax adjustments relate mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.\n\nThe 2020 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to return adjustments offset by net increases in provisions for tax contingencies. The 2019 and 2018 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to return adjustments.\n\nTo the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for. No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies. Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $5,742m at 31 December 2020 (2019: $4,902m; 2018: $8,144m).",

        "page_content": "## 6 Segment information\n\nThe Group has reviewed its assessment of reportable segments under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' and concluded that the Group continues to have one reportable segment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis determination is considered to be a Key Judgment and this judgement has been taken with reference to the following factors:\n\n## 1 The level of integration across the different functions of the Group's pharmaceutical business:\n\nAstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments. AstraZeneca's pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold. All of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. These individual functional areas are not managed separately.\n\n## 2 The identi/fication of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and the nature and extent of the /financial information reviewed by the CODM:\n\nThe SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of our business. It is considered that the SET is AstraZeneca's chief operating decision making body (as de/fined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the Commercial operations, R&D, manufacturing and supply. All signi/ficant operating decisions are taken by the SET. While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole. Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision. For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub team for implementation. The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.\n\nIn assessing performance, the SET reviews /financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Group's IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products, coupled with the relatively insigni/ficant and stable unit cost of production, means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product. Consequently, the pro/fitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET. The focus of additional /financial information reviewed is at brand sales level within speci/fic geographies. Expenditure analysis is completed for the science units, operations and enabling functions; there is no allocation of these centrally managed group costs to the individual product brands. SET members' bonus continues to be derived from the Group scorecard outcome as discussed in our Directors Remuneration Report.\n\n## 3 How resources are allocated:\n\nResources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group's Early Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee.\n\n## Geographic areas\n\nThe following table shows information for Total Revenue by geographic area and material countries. The additional tables show the Operating pro/fit and Pro/fit before tax made by companies located in that area, together with Non-current assets, Total assets, assets acquired, net operating assets, and Property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies.

The assets were presented within Property, plant and equipment and the liabilities within Interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Initial adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019 resulted in the recognition of Right-of-use assets of $722m and Lease liabilities of $720m. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the Lease liabilities on 1 January 2019 was 3%.\n\nThe interest expense on lease liabilities included within /finance costs was $21m (2019: $22m). The expense relating to short-term leases was $2m (2019: $1m). The expense relating to leases of Low-value assets that are not shown above as short-term leases was $1m (2019: $1m). The income relating to variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities was $1m (2019: $nil). Income recognised from subleasing was $7m (2019: $4m).\n\nThe total cash out/flow for leases in 2020 was $228m (2019: $208m).",

Where testing is required, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss or reversal. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which it belongs. The Group considers that as the intangible assets are linked to individual products and that product cash /flows are considered to be largely independent of other product cash /flows, the CGU for intangibles is at the product level. Group level budgets and forecasts include forecast capital investment and operational impacts related to sustainability projects, and form the basis for the value in use models used for impairment testing.\n\nAn asset's recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less costs to sell or value in use, in both cases using discounted cash /flow calculations where the assets' expected post-tax cash /flows are risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining period of expected economic bene/fit. Where the value in use approach is used, the risk-adjusted cash /flows are discounted using AstraZeneca's post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7% for 2020, 2019 and 2018), with reference to comparable companies. There is no material difference in the approach taken to using pre-tax cash /flows and a pre-tax rate compared to post-tax cash /flows and a post-tax rate, as required by IAS 36. Where fair value less costs to sell is used to determine recoverable value, the discount rate is assessed with reference to a market participant; this is not usually materially different to the AstraZeneca post-tax weighted average cost of capital rate of 7%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSE The estimates used in calculating the recoverable amount are considered signi/ficant estimates, highly sensitive and depend on assumptions speci/fic to the nature of the Group's activities including:\n\n- >  outcome of R&D activities\n- >  probability of technical and regulatory success\n- >  market volume, share and pricing (to derive peak year sales)\n- >  amount and timing of projected future cash /flows\n- >  sales erosion curves following patent expiry.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued\n\n## 10 Intangible assets continued\n\nFor assets held at fair value less costs to sell, we make appropriate adjustments to re/flect market participant assessments.\n\nIn 2020, the Group recorded impairment charges of $350m in respect of launched products, including Duaklir ($200m, revised carrying amount of $210m) under fair value less costs to sell, Bydureon ($102m, revised carrying amount of $581m) under value in use model, and other launched products totalling $48m. The fair value less costs to sell valuation model for Duaklir is based on discounted cash /flows, and is categorised at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions in this model are forecast future revenue and costs of production. As these assets have been impaired in the current year, there is limited headroom in the recoverable amount calculation and they are inherently sensitive to any changes in assumptions, which could give rise to future impairments.\n\nImpairment charges recorded against products in development totalled $55m.\n\nIn 2019, the Group recorded impairment charges of $425m in respect of launched products Bydureon ($154m, revised carrying amount of $747m) under value in use model, Qtern ($89m, revised carrying amount of $233m) under value in use model, Eklira / Tudorza ($84m, revised carrying amount of $192m) under value in use model, FluMist ($52m, revised carrying amount of $172m) under fair value less costs to sell and $46m relating to other launched products. Impairment charges recorded against products in development related to Epanova ($533m) and other intangible assets ($76m).\n\nIn 2018, the Group recorded impairment charges of $144m in respect of launched products Eklira / Tudorza ($114m, revised carrying value of $396m) and Movantik ($30m, revised carrying value of $59m). Impairment charges recorded against products in development related to MEDI0680 ($470m) and other intangible assets ($95m).\n\nThe impairments recorded on launched products were a consequence of revised market volume, share and price assumptions. Impairments recorded on products in development were a consequence of failed or poor performing trials, with the individual assets being fully impaired.\n\nThe Group has performed an assessment on assets which have had impairments recorded in previous periods to determine if any reversals of impairments were required. Impairment reversals of $165m were recorded in 2020 in respect of launched products, including FluMist ($147m, revised carrying amount of $300m, driven by expanded vaccination efforts increasing global demand), and other launched products of $18m.\n\nNo impairment reversals were recorded against products in development in 2020 (2019: $3m; 2018: $28m).\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nWhen launched products, such as the ones detailed above, are partially impaired, the carrying values of these assets in future periods are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast assumptions, including those assumptions set out above, as the asset is impaired down to its recoverable amount.\n\nAssets that are particularly sensitive to variations in valuation assumptions include Ardea (carrying value of $1,172m) and Bydureon (carrying value of $581m). The Ardea valuation is particularly sensitive to variations in the probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) assumptions. Sensitivities performed at the year end on the Ardea asset included reducing the PTRS by /five percentage points. Applying this sensitivity would result in an impairment charge against the Ardea intangible asset of approximately $140m. If revenue projections for Bydureon were to fall by 15% over the forecast period, this would result in a further impairment charge of approximately $110m.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSE Were the useful economic lives to be adjusted to reduce them all by one year, the net book value would be reduced by $526m. If the useful economic lives were to be extended by one year, the net book value would increase by $275m.\n\n## Significant assets\n\n|                                                                                         | Carrying/uni00A0value $m   | Remaining/uni00A0amortisation period   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Acerta Pharma                         | 5,781                      | 12 years                               |\n| Intangible assets arising from the acquisition of ZS Pharma                             | 2,746                      | 11 years                               |\n| Enhertu  intangible assets acquired from Daiichi Sankyo                                 | 1,651                      | 13 years                               |\n| Intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Ardea 1                               | 1,172                      | Not amortised                          |\n| Other intangible assets acquired from Daiichi Sankyo 1                                  | 1,060                      | Not amortised                          |\n| Farxiga / Forxiga  intangible assets acquired from BMS                                  | 952                        | 6 years                                |\n| Intangible assets arising from the restructuring of a historical joint venture with MSD | 797                        | 1 to 9 years                           |\n| Intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics                    | 765                        | 8 to 9 years                           |\n| RSV franchise assets arising from the acquisition of MedImmune                          | 764                        | 5 years                                |\n| Bydureon  intangible assets acquired from BMS                                           | 581                        | 10 years                               |\n| Respiratory intangible assets acquired from Almirall and Actavis                        | 527                        | 4 to 18 years                          |\n| Onglyza  intangible assets acquired from BMS                                            | 462                        | 3 years                                |\n| Roxadustat intangible assets acquired from FibroGen                                     | 444                        | 9 years                                |\n| Other diabetes intangible assets acquired from BMS                                      | 391                        | 2 to 5 years                           |\n| Monalizumab intangible assets acquired from Innate Pharma 1                             | 344                        | Not amortised                          |\n\nThe acquisition of intangible assets relating to DS-1062 in 2020 was assessed under the optional concentration test in IFRS 3 and was determined to be an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ In assessing whether the intangible assets and associated processes acquired from Daiichi Sankyo in 2019 were a business, we determined that they were not at a stage of readiness to be able to obtain regulatory approval and manufacture and commercialise at scale.

This agreement was to divest a number of assets in MedImmune's non-core in/flammation and autoimmunity portfolio to Viela Bio, including MEDI-551, which is an advanced Phase IIb/III asset, and a number of other clinical and pre-clinical assets. AstraZeneca contributed $142m in initial funds and held an initial 45% interest in the joint venture. Consideration was $142m and a restricted disposal gain of $63m was recognised in Other operating income in 2018. Viela Bio completed an IPO on 7 October 2019 with AstraZeneca investing $8m. After the IPO, AstraZeneca's holding was reduced to 29%. In May 2020, Viela Bio completed a follow-on /financing reducing AstraZeneca's holding to 26.7% with one member on a board size of seven. Given the shareholding and board representation, the investment continues to be treated as an associate. During the year the Group provided transitional research and development services to Viela Bio, comprising $3m (2019: $13m) of services provided directly by the Group and $15m (2019: $24m) of passed-through third-party costs incurred by the Group on behalf of Viela Bio. At the end of the year, the Group had an outstanding unsecured receivable of $2m (2019: $6m) settleable in cases on customary terms against which no credit loss provision has been made.\n\nOn 27 November 2017, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Chinese Future Industry Investment Fund (FIIF), to discover, develop and commercialise potential new medicines to help meet unmet medical needs globally, and to bring innovative new medicines to patients in China more quickly. The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in China, Dizal (Jiangsu) Pharmaceutical Co., Limited (Dizal). AstraZeneca contributed $55m in initial funds and held an initial 48% interest in the joint venture. The joint venture entity purchased exclusive rights from AstraZeneca in 2017 to develop and commercialise three potential medicines currently in pre-clinical development in the areas of oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and respiratory, resulting in a disposal gain of $28m for AstraZeneca recognised in Other operating income. An additional contribution of $25m was made in 2019. In July 2020, Dizal completed a follow-on /financing reducing AstraZeneca's holding to 30.3% with two members on a board size of seven. Given the shareholding and board representation, the investment continues to be treated as an associate.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Fuji/film Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using the combined capabilities of the two parties. The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Centus Biotherapeutics Limited. AstraZeneca contributed $45m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint venture. Additional contributions were made of $10m in 2016, $20m in 2017, $27m in 2018, $20m in 2019 and $7.5m in 2020.\n\nOn 30 April 2014, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using the combined capabilities of the two parties. The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Archigen Biotech Limited. Since its establishment, AstraZeneca has contributed $131m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint venture. At the end of the year Archigen had net assets of $1m, of which AstraZeneca's share is $0.4m, and the investment is held at $nil value.\n\nAll investments are accounted for using the equity method. At 31 December 2020, unrecognised losses in associates and joint ventures totalled $56m (2019: $3m; 2018: $nil) which have not been recognised due to the investment carrying value reaching $nil value.\n\nAggregated summarised /financial information for the associate and joint venture entities is set out below:\n\n|                                                                | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   | 2018 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-current assets                                             | 324       | 298       | 260       |\n| Current assets                                                 | 552       | 447       | 233       |\n| Total liabilities                                              | (105)     | (89)      | (71)      |\n| Net assets                                                     | 771       | 656       | 422       |\n| Amount attributable to AstraZeneca                             | 38        | 64        | 104       |\n| Exchange adjustments                                           | 1         | (6)       | (15)      |\n| Carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures | 39        | 58        | 89        |",

Other investments held at fair value through pro/fit and loss comprise /fixed income securities that the Group holds to sell.\n\nThe fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices. Fixed deposits are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses equity securities and bonds, contained within Other investments and carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been de/fined as follows:\n\n- >  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- >  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)\n- >  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n|         | 2020 FVPL $m   | 2020 FVOCI $m   | 2019 FVPL $m/uni00A0   | 2019 FVOCI $m   | 2018 FVPL $m   | 2018 FVOCI $m   |\n|---------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Level 1 | 118            | 891             | 873                    | 1,112           | 809            | 667             |\n| Level 2 | -              | -               | -                      | -               | -              | -               |\n| Level 3 | -              | 217             | -                      | 227             | -              | 166             |\n| Total   | 118            | 1,108           | 873                    | 1,339           | 809            | 833             |\n\nDuring 2020, AstraZeneca sold a proportion of its equity portfolio receiving consideration of $1,381m, a large proportion of which related to the disposal of its full holding in Moderna. All related gains were accounted through Other comprehensive income.\n\nEquity securities that are analysed at Level 3 include investments in private biotech companies. In the absence of speci/fic market data, these unlisted investments are held at fair value based on the cost of investment and adjusting as necessary for impairments and revaluations on new funding rounds, which approximates to fair value.

None of the derivatives have been reclassi/fied in the year.\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash /flows based on rates at the current year end.\n\nThe fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash /flow accounting models using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end. The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.\n\nThe interest rates used to discount future cash /flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows:\n\n|             | 2020           | 2019           | 2018           |\n|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Derivatives | (0.5)% to 2.4% | (0.5)% to 2.7% | (0.4)% to 3.2% |\n\n## 14 Non-current other receivables\n\n|                               |   2020 $m |   2019 $m | 2018 $m   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Prepayments                   |       395 |       392 | 461       |\n| Accrued income                |        56 |        10 | -         |\n| Other receivables             |       269 |       338 | 54        |\n| Non-current other receivables |       720 |       740 | 515       |\n\nPrepayments include $121m (2019: $125m; 2018: $146m) in relation to our research collaboration with Moderna. Other receivables include $nil (2019: $118m; 2018: $nil) of outstanding payments relating to the out-licence of Duaklir and Tudorza to Circassia in 2017 and $56m (2019: $53m; 2018: $nil) owed by FibroGen for promotional activity in China pursuant to the roxadustat collaboration.\n\nThe 2018 balance included a prepayment of $114m which represented the long-term element of minimum contractual royalties payable to Shionogi under the global licence agreement for Crestor , which was renegotiated in December 2013. The resulting modi/fied royalty structure, which included /fixed minimum and maximum payments in years until 2020, resulted in the Group recognising liabilities, and corresponding prepayments, for the discounted value of total minimum payments. At 31 December 2019 the prepayment was reported in amounts due within one year (see Note 16).\n\n10\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n10\n\nNon-current/uni00A0\n\nCurrent\n\nCurrent\n\nNon-current\n\nassets\n\nassets\n\nliabilities\n\nliabilities\n\nTotal\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\n16\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n16\n\nNon-current\n\nassets\n\nassets\n\nliabilities\n\nliabilities\n\nTotal\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\n$m\n\nCurrent\n\nCurrent\n\nNon-current",

The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss is the fair value; this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as de/fined in Note 12. For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date. All other loans are held at amortised cost. Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as de/fined in Note 12, with the exception of overdrafts and lease liabilities, where fair value approximates to carrying values.\n\nA loss of $1m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss, due to decreased credit risk. A gain of $29m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. Under IFRS 9, the Group records the component of fair value changes relating to the component of own credit risk through Other comprehensive income. Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other /financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements. The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk. The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss is $287m.\n\nThe interest rates used to discount future cash /flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows:\n\n|                      | 2020 2019                      | 2018           |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|\n| Loans and borrowings | (0.5)% to 0.1%  (0.5)% to 1.6% | (0.4)% to 2.4% |",

The revenue recognised in the year for contract liabilities is $101m, comprising $73m relating to other revenue accruals and $28m Collaboration Revenue contract liabilities. The most signi/ficant market where Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals are seen relates to the US where the liability at 31 December 2020 amounted to $3,126m (2019: $3,385m; 2018: $3,266m).\n\nTrade payables includes $248m (2019: $492m; 2018: $166m) due to suppliers that have signed up to a supply chain /financing programme, under which the suppliers can elect on an invoice-by-invoice basis to receive a discounted early payment from the partner bank rather than being paid in line with the agreed payment terms. If the option is taken, the Group's liability is assigned by the supplier to be due to the partner bank rather than the supplier. The value of the liability payable by the Group remains unchanged. The Group assesses the arrangement against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier /financing scheme continue to meet the de/finition of trade payables or should be classi/fied as borrowings. At 31 December 2020, the payables met the criteria of Trade payables.\n\nVaccine contract liabilities relate to amounts received from customers, primarily government bodies, in advance of supply of product. Substantially all of the vaccine contract liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue during the next /financial year.\n\nDeferred government grant income relates to government grants received or receivable but for which the related expenses have not been incurred.\n\nIncluded within current Other payables are liabilities to Daiichi Sankyo totalling $146m (2019: $795m; 2018: $nil) resulting from the collaboration agreement in relation to Enhertu entered into in March 2019 and $324m (2019: $nil; 2018: $nil) in relation to DS-1062 entered into in July 2020. Additionally, included within non-current Other payables are liabilities totalling $100m (2019: $241m; 2018: $nil) as a result of the Enhertu collaboration agreement and $323m (2019: $nil; 2018: $nil) as a result of the DS-1062 collaboration agreement.\n\nOn 5 November 2020, Calquence received marketing approval in the EU, which removed all remaining conditionality in respect of the Acerta Pharma put and call options regarding the non-controlling interest (see Note 26). Based on the latest assessment of the expected timing and amount of the Acerta Pharma put option redemption, no remeasurement was required in 2020. In 2019, remeasurement of the liability resulted in an increase (2018: decrease) in the liability for the year before the effect of interest costs, with the remeasurement taken to Selling, general and administrative costs (see Note 2). In October 2019, an amendment to the share purchase and option agreement (SPOA) with the sellers of Acerta Pharma (originally entered into in December 2015) came into effect, changing certain terms of the SPOA on both the timing and also reducing the maximum consideration that would be required to be made to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of Acerta Pharma if the options are exercised. The payments would be made in similar annual instalments commencing at the earliest from 2022 through to 2024, subject to the options being exercised. The changes to the terms have been re/flected in the assumptions used to calculate the amortised cost of the option liability as at 31 December 2020 of $2,297m (2019: $2,146m; 2018: $1,838m). Interest arising from amortising the liability is included within Finance Expense (see Note 3). Upon exercise of the option, the associated cash /flows will be disclosed as /financing activities within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nWith the exception of Contingent consideration payables of $3,323m (2019: $4,139m; 2018: $5,106m) which are held at fair value within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as de/fined in Note 12, all other /financial liabilities are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.",

Employee costs in connection with the initiatives are recognised in severance provisions. Final severance costs are often subject to the completion of the requisite consultations on the areas impacted. AstraZeneca endeavours to support employees affected by restructuring initiatives to seek alternative roles within the organisation. Where the employee is successful, any severance provisions will be released.\n\nDetails of the environmental and legal provisions totalling $100m (2019: $96m; 2018: $97m) and $348m (2019: $642m; 2018: $198m), respectively, and ongoing matters are provided in Note 29. The legal issues are often subject to substantial uncertainties with regard to the timing and /final amounts of any payments. As such, once established these provisions remain in Provisions until settlement is reached and uncertainty resolved, with no transfer to Trade and other payables prior to payment. A signi/ficant proportion of the total legal provision relates to matters settled in previous periods. These uncertainties can also cause reversal in previously established provisions once /final settlement is reached.\n\nEmployee bene/fit provisions include the Deferred Bonus Plan. Further details are included in Note 28.\n\nOther provisions comprise amounts relating to speci/fic contractual or constructive obligations and disputes. The majority of other provisions relates to amounts associated with long-standing product liability settlements that arose prior to the merger of Astra and Zeneca. Given the nature of the provision the amounts are expected to be settled over many years.\n\nNo provision has been released or applied for any purpose other than that for which it was established.\n\n## 22 Post-retirement and other defined benefit schemes\n\n## Background\n\nThis section predominantly covers de/fined bene/fit arrangements like post retirement pension and medical plans which make up the vast bulk of the Group's liabilities. However, it also incorporates other bene/fits which fall under IAS 19 rules and which require an actuarial valuation, including but not limited to: Lump Sum plans, Long Service Awards and de/fined contribution pension plans which have some de/fined bene/fit characteristics (e.g. a minimum guaranteed level of bene/fit).\n\nThe Group and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group. The Group's policy is to provide de/fined contribution (DC) orientated pension provision to its employees unless otherwise compelled by local regulation. As a result, many of these retirement plans are DC, where the Group contribution and resulting charge is /fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees' pay.\n\nHowever, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are de/fined bene/fit (DB), where bene/fits are based on employees' length of service and linked to their salary. The major de/fined bene/fit plans are largely legacy arrangements as they have been closed to new entrants since 2000, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan (which is still open to employees born before 1979). During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees' representatives, the Group introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for de/fined bene/fit members of the UK Pension Fund. The number of active members in the Fund continues to decline and is now 579 employees. In November 2017, the Group closed the quali/fied and non-quali/fied US de/fined bene/fit pension plans to future accrual (and removed any salary link) from 31 December 2017.\n\nThe major de/fined bene/fit plans are funded through separate, /fiduciary-administered assets. The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special Group payments, is designed, in consultation with independent quali/fied actuaries, to ensure that the assets are suf/ficient to meet future obligations as and when they fall due. The funding level is monitored rigorously by the Group and by local /fiduciaries, who take into account the strength of the Group's covenant, local regulation, cash /flows, and the solvency and maturity of the relevant pension scheme.\n\n## Financing principles\n\nNinety per cent of the Group's total de/fined bene/fit obligations (or 77% of net obligations) at 31 December 2020 are in schemes within the UK, the US and Sweden. In these countries, the pension obligations are funded in line with the Group's /financing principles. There were no fundamental changes to these principles during 2020. The Group believes:\n\n- >  in funding the bene/fits it promises to employees (when compatible with local regulation and best practice) and in meeting its obligations\n- >  that the pension arrangements should be considered in the context of its broader capital structure. In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding when the Group might use the capital elsewhere to reinvest in the wider business, nor does it wish to generate surpluses\n- >  in taking some measured and rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a long-term plan to reduce those risks when opportunities arise\n- >  that holding certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position. However, the Group would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations in funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more signi/ficant deviations\n- >  that proactive engagement with local Fiduciary Bodies is necessary and helpful to provide robust oversight and input in relation to funding and investment strategy and to facilitate liability management exercises appropriate to each pension plan\n- >  in considering the use of alternative methods of providing security that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.\n\nThese principles are appropriate at the present date but they are kept under ongoing review and, should circumstances change, these principles may be subject to change.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued\n\n## 22 Post-retirement and other defined benefit schemes continued\n\nThe Group has developed a long-term funding framework to implement these principles. This framework targets either full funding on a low-risk funding measure or buy-out with an external insurer as the pension funds mature, with affordable long-term de-risking of investment strategy along the way. Unless local regulation dictates otherwise, this framework determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds. A key element of this funding framework is the investment strategy used to grow existing assets and hedge against changes in liability values. The Group provides regular input to local /fiduciary boards with the aim of ensuring that an appropriate investment return is targeted over the long term in a risk-controlled manner.\n\n## UK\n\nThe UK de/fined bene/fit pension fund represents approximately 61% of the Group's de/fined bene/fit obligations at 31 December 2020. The /financing principles are modi/fied in light of the UK regulatory requirements (summarised below) and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.\n\n## Role of Trustees and Regulation\n\nThe UK Pension Fund is governed and administered by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Group. The Trustee Directors are comprised of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees and include an independent professional Trustee Director. The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant bene/ficiaries and are responsible in particular for investment strategy and the day-to-day administration of the bene/fits. They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund (see below).\n\nThe UK pensions market is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.\n\n## Funding requirements\n\nUK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. On a triennial basis, the Trustee and the Group must agree on a set of assumptions used to value the liabilities as a part of an actuarial valuation. Together with the asset valuation, this facilitates the calculation of a funding level and of the contributions required (if any) to ensure the UK Pension Fund is fully funded over an appropriate time-period and on a suitably prudent measure. The technical provisions assumptions used to value the liabilities for the triennial actuarial valuation are usually set more prudently than the assumptions used to prepare an accounting valuation of the liabilities, which are set under IAS 19 rules to be a 'best estimate'.\n\nThe last full actuarial valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a quali/fied actuary as at 31 March 2019. Following discussions between the Group and Trustee, it was /finalised and submitted to the Pensions Regulator in June 2020, ahead of the statutory deadline. The next actuarial valuation is due to take place as at 31 March 2022, with a likely timescale for completion in early to mid-2023.\n\nCertain aspects of the triennial actuarial valuation are governed by a long-term funding agreement, effective since October 2016 and which sets out a path to full funding on a low-risk measure. Under this agreement, if a de/ficit exists, the Group will grant a charge in favour of the Trustee over certain land and buildings on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, effective upon practical completion of the site, or from 2022 (whichever is earlier). This charge is not currently in force. When effective, the charge would only crystallise in the event of the Group's insolvency. This charge will provide long-term security in respect of future UK Pension Fund contributions and will be worth up to \u00a3350m.\n\nIn relation to de/ficit recovery contributions, a lump sum contribution of \u00a351m ($65m) was made in March 2020, with a further \u00a339m contribution due before 31 March 2021. In addition, a contribution of \u00a328m ($36m) was also made in March 2020, with a further contribution of \u00a329m due before 31 March 2021, in relation to part payment of the deferred contribution explained below.\n\nDuring 2017, the Group provided a letter of credit to the Trustee, to underwrite the deferral of an additional de/ficit recovery contribution of approximately \u00a3126m which was due in 2017. This contribution will be paid in /five instalments (with interest added each year) from March 2018 to March 2022 and to date, three instalments have been paid. The letter of credit underwriting these payments will reduce in value as each annual payment is made.\n\nUnder the funding assumptions used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions from the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2019 (shown as a single-equivalent rate) were as follows: salary increases at 0% per annum (as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010); pension increases at 3.07% per annum; and discount rate at 2.98% per annum. The resulting valuation of the Fund's liabilities on that basis was \u00a35,991m ($8,012m) compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2019 of \u00a35,403m ($7,225m).\n\nUnder the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to the Group by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the Fund. In particular, the Trustee has no unilateral right to wind-up the Fund without Company consent nor does it have the power to unilaterally use surplus to augment bene/fits prior to wind-up. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a De/fined Bene/fit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction'.\n\n## High Court Ruling on GMP\n\nA second UK High Court Ruling in the Lloyds Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation case was published on Friday 20 November 2020. The /first ruling in 2018 instructed Trustees of UK Pension Funds to equalise GMP bene/fits across genders for members and resulted in a past service cost of \u00a317m ($23m) being recognised in the year ended 31 December 2018. The second ruling instructed Trustees to equalise for historical bene/fits paid via past transfers out, going back to 1990. The impact of this second ruling is estimated to be minimal, adding approximately $1m to liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## United States and Sweden\n\nThe US plan and the Sweden plan account for 12% and 18%, respectively, of the Group's de/fined bene/fit obligations. The US and Sweden pension funds are governed by Fiduciary Bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of the assets. These plans are funded in line with the Group's /financing principles and local regulations.\n\nThe US de/fined bene/fit pension plans were actuarially revalued at 31 December 2020, when plan obligations were $1,428m and plan assets were $1,335m. This includes obligations in respect of the non-quali/fied plan which is unfunded. The quali/fied US pension plan remains approximately fully funded on an IAS 19 basis and has a positive funding balance on the local statutory measure. As such, no contributions are required, and the investment strategy is largely de-risked.\n\nThe Swedish de/fined bene/fit pension plans were actuarially valued at 31 December 2020, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $2,525m and plan assets were $1,338m. It should be noted that the Swedish plans have a funding surplus on the local GAAP accounting basis and this in/fluences contribution policy.\n\nOn current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions (excluding those in respect of past service de/ficit contributions) during the year ending 31 December 2021 for the three main countries will be approximately $33m.\n\n## Other defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group provides bene/fit plans other than pensions which have to be reported under IAS 19. These include Lump Sum plans, Long Service Awards and de/fined contribution pension plans which have a guaranteed minimum bene/fit. However, the largest category of these 'other' non-pension plans are healthcare bene/fits.\n\nIn the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, the Group's employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance bene/fits for eligible retired employees. As at 31 December 2020, some 2,953 retired employees and covered dependants currently bene/fit from these provisions and some 1,879 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. The Group accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee. In practice, these bene/fits will be funded with reference to the /financing principles.\n\nIn the US, there was a change to the level of bene/fit provision for members aged 65 and over within the Group's healthcare plans, effective from 1 January 2021. The changes were communicated to the membership in September 2020 and resulted in an estimated liability reduction of $64m which has been recognised as a past service credit for the year ending 31 December 2020. Following these changes, the plans became fully funded on an IAS 19 basis and are projected to have a small surplus. As a result, the investment strategy has been fully de-risked.\n\nThe cost of post-retirement bene/fits other than pensions for the Group in 2020 was $1m (2019: $3m). Plan assets were $235m and plan obligations were $209m at 31 December 2020. These bene/fit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement bene/fits under IAS 19.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nQuali/fied independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 for the major de/fined bene/fit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2020. The assumptions used may not necessarily be borne out in practice, due to the inherent /financial and demographic uncertainty associated with making long-term projections. These assumptions re/flect the changes which have the most material impact on the results of the Group and were as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2019   | 2019   | 2019   | 2019                          |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------------------|\n|                                            | UK     | US     | Sweden | Rest/uni00A0of/uni00A0Group 4 |\n| Inflation assumption                       | 3.0%   | -      | 1.8%   | 1.5%                          |\n| Rate of increase in salaries               | - 1    | -      | 3.3%   | 2.3%                          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment    | 2.8%   | -      | 1.8%   | 1.5%                          |\n| Discount rate - defined benefit obligation | 2.0%   | 3.2%   | 1.5%   | 1.3%                          |\n| Discount rate - interest cost              | 2.7%   | 3.9%   | 2.0%   | 1.6%                          |\n| Discount rate - service cost               | 2.8%   | 4.0%   | 2.5%   | 1.9%                          |\n\n|                                              | 2020   | 2020   | 2020   | 2020                        |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------------------|\n|                                              | UK     | US     | Sweden | Rest/uni00A0of/uni00A0Group |\n| Inflation assumption                         | 2.9%   | -      | 1.5%   | 1.6%                        |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                 | - 1    | -      | 3.0%   | 3.1%                        |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment      | 2.8%   | -      | 1.5%   | 1.6%                        |\n| Discount rate - defined benefit obligation 2 | 1.4%   | 2.5%   | 1.2%   | 0.7%                        |\n| Discount rate - interest cost 3              | 1.1%   | 1.8%   | 1.0%   | 0.5%  0.8%                  |\n| Discount rate - service cost 3               | 1.4%   | 1.7%   | 1.2%   |                             |\n\n- 2 Group defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2020 calculated using discount rates based on market conditions as at 31 December 2020.\n- 3 2020 interest costs and service costs calculated using discount rates based on market conditions as at 31 December 2019.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the post-retirement scheme obligations is 16 years in the UK, 12 years in the US, 20 years in Sweden and 10 years for the Rest of the Group.",

The UK Pension Fund holds a significant proportion of  assets (around 72.5%) in a growth portfolio. Although these growth assets  are expected to outperform AA-rated corporate bonds in the long term,  they can lead to volatility and mismatching risk in the short term. The  allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate  given the UK Pension Fund's long-term objectives. | In order to mitigate investment risk, the Trustee invests in a suitably  diversified range of asset classes, return drivers and investment managers.  The investment strategy will evolve to further improve the expected risk/ return profile as opportunities arise.

Furthermore, there are operational risks (such as paying out the wrong bene/fits) and legislative risks (such as the government increasing the burden on companies through new legislation). These are mitigated so far as possible via the governance structure in place which oversees and administers the pension funds.\n\nThe Group's pension plans in the US and Sweden also manage these key risks, where they are relevant, in a similar manner, with the local /fiduciary bodies investing in a diversi/fied growth portfolio and employing a framework to hedge interest rate risk.\n\nLocal /fiduciary boards are aware of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks as they pertain to investment policy, and where local regulation allows, have policies in place to monitor and manage such risks.\n\n## Assets and obligations of defined benefit schemes\n\nThe assets and obligations of the de/fined bene/fit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2020, as calculated in accordance with IAS 19, are shown below.

Past service cost in 2019 includes a credit of $49m arising from changes to the payment of GMP bene/fits from the UK Pension Fund.\n\nTotal Group pension costs in respect of de/fined contribution and de/fined bene/fit schemes during the year are set out below (see Note 28).\n\n|                                                              | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Defined contribution schemes                                 | 351       | 432       |\n| Defined benefit schemes - current service costs and expenses | 113       | 93        |\n| Defined benefit schemes - past service credit                | (29)      | (34)      |\n| Pension costs                                                | 435       | 491       |",

The put option gives rise to a liability (see Note 20). The ability of the parties to exercise their respective put and call options, as well as the timing and amount of exercise, was dependent on certain conditions, the last of which was based on regulatory outcomes of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in the EU. On 5 November 2020, Calquence received marketing approval in the EU, which removed all remaining conditionality in respect of the options. The minority shareholders are now considered to have no further substantive variability in risk and reward related to their shares as it is considered highly likely that one of the options will be exercised, and the price of the options is now /fixed. Therefore, from 5 November 2020, no further amounts of the consolidated AstraZeneca result have been attributed to the minority shareholders of Acerta Pharma. In addition, the Non-controlling interests reserve relating to the minority shareholders of Acerta Pharma, totalling $1,401m, has been reclassi/fied into Retained earnings (see Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity).\n\nThe Group Financial Statements at 31 December 2020 re/flect equity of nil (2019: $1,456m; 2018: $1,567m) and total comprehensive losses of $55m (2019: losses of $111m; 2018: losses of $109m) attributable to the non-controlling interest in Acerta Pharma.

The main purpose of these /financial instruments is to manage the Group's funding and liquidity requirements. The Group has other /financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe principal /financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies are set out below.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Group may designate certain /financial instruments as fair value hedges, cash /flow hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IFRS 9. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. Sources of hedge effectiveness will depend on the hedge relationship designation but may include:\n\n- >  a signi/ficant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship\n- >  a timing mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item\n- >  movements in foreign currency basis spread for derivatives in a fair value hedge\n- >  a signi/ficant change in the value of the foreign currency denominated net assets of the Group in a net investment hedge.\n\nThe hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group's existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1. Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on pro/fit is not expected to be material. The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through pro/fit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 180.\n\nThe following table represents the Group's continuing designated hedge relationships under IFRS 9.\n\n## 2018\n\n|                                                                                                                     |                                   |                   | Other comprehensive income        | Other comprehensive income                | Other comprehensive income                          | Other comprehensive income          |                               |             |                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                     | Nominal amounts in local currency | Carrying value $m | Opening balance 1 January 2018 $m | Fair value loss/(gain) deferred to OCI $m | Fair value loss recycled to the income statement $m | Closing balance 31 December 2018 $m | Average Average maturity year | USD FX rate | Average pay interest rate |\n| Fair value hedge -

The cash flow associated with the settlement has been reflected in cash flows from investing activities within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 179, as its primary purpose was to hedge the translation foreign exchange risk arising on the consolidation of the Group's net investment in Japan.\n- 6 Nominal amount of FX forwards in a cash flow hedge of USD 618m represents the USD equivalent notional of the FX forwards. By currency, the nominal amounts were SEK 3,310m at FX rate 8.35373, RMB 366m at 6.5561, JPY 4,690m at 103.5085 and EUR 99m at 1.21918. All FX forwards in a cash flow hedge mature on 25 January 2021.\n\nKey controls applied to transactions in derivative /financial instruments are to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all /financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options or as part of a risk management strategy. The Group is not a net seller of options, and does not use derivative /financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Group held no options during the reporting period.\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of Shareholders' equity (Note 24), Debt (Note 19), Other current investments (Note 12) and Cash (Note 17). For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group's strategic objectives through:\n\n- >  managing funding and liquidity risk\n- >  optimising shareholder return\n- >  maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.\n\nThe Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables. These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IFRS 9. Amounts due, on invoices that have not been factored at year end, from customers that are subject to factoring arrangements are disclosed in Note 16.\n\nFunding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.\n\nThe Board's distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend and, subject to business needs, a share repurchase component. The Board regularly reviews its shareholders' return strategy, and, in 2012, decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic /flexibility.\n\nThe Group's net debt position (loans and borrowings net of Cash and cash equivalents, Other investments and Derivative /financial instruments) has increased from a net debt position of $11,904m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $12,110m at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Board reviews the Group's ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis. The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash /flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are suf/ficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. Speci/fically, the Group uses US and European commercial paper, bank loans, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets. The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-2 by Moody's and A-2 by Standard and Poor's. The Group's long-term credit rating is A3 Negative outlook by Moody's and BBB+ CreditWatch Positive outlook by Standard and Poor's.\n\nIn addition to Cash and cash equivalents of $7,832m, short-term /fixed income investments of $118m, /fixed deposits of $42m, less overdrafts of $286m at 31 December 2020, the Group has committed bank facilities of $21,625m. Of the committed facilities, $4,125m is intended to manage liquidity. Of these, $3,375m mature in April 2024 and $750m is available until November 2021 with a one-year extension option, exercisable by the Group. In conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company entered into committed bank facilities totalling $17,500m during December 2020. None of the above facilities contain any /financial covenants and all were undrawn at 31 December 2020. The Group regularly monitors",

Advances under these facilities currently bear an interest rate per annum based on the LIBOR (or other relevant benchmark rate) plus a margin. The facilities contain arrangements to switch to alternative risk free rate benchmarks during 2021.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group has $4,083m outstanding from debt issued under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $14,950m under a SEC-registered programme. The funds made available under these facility agreements may be used for the general corporate purposes of the Group.\n\nThe maturity pro/file of the anticipated future contractual cash /flows including interest in relation to the Group's /financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:\n\n|                                                    | Bank overdrafts and/uni00A0other loans $m   | Bonds $m   | Finance leases 1 $m   | and/uni00A0other payables $m   | Total Trade non-derivative /financial instruments $m   | Derivative /financial instruments receivable 2 $m   | Derivative /financial instruments payable 2 $m   | Total derivative financial instruments 2 $m   | Total $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Within one/uni00A0year                             | 774                                         | 1,629      | -

As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.\n\n## Translational\n\nApproximately 66% of Group external sales in 2020 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a signi/ficant proportion of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona. Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars. As a result, operating pro/fit and total cash /flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.\n\nThis currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash /flows. The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated signi/ficantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, before the impact of derivatives, 3% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 18% were denominated in euros. Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to pro/fit.\n\nThe Group holds cross-currency swaps to hedge against the impact of /fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, with any ineffectiveness taken to pro/fit.\n\nForeign currency risk arises when the Group has inter-company funding and investments in certain subsidiaries operating in countries with exchange controls or where there is risk of signi/ficant future currency devaluation. One indicator of potential foreign currency risk is where a country is of/ficially designated as hyperin/flationary. As at 31 December 2020, the Group operates in two countries designated as hyperin/flationary, being Argentina and Venezuela.\n\nThe foreign exchange risk to the Group from Argentina and Venezuela has been assessed and deemed to be immaterial.\n\n## Transactional\n\nThe Group aims to hedge all its forecast major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months. Where practicable, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange. In addition, the Group's external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date. Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to pro/fit.",

The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis re/flects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of future cash /flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date. For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2020, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2020, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $20m in interest expense being incurred per year. The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2020, with all other variables held constant. The +10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.\n\nEach incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each incremental 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.\n\n|                                                                 | Interest/uni00A0rates   | Interest/uni00A0rates   | Exchange/uni00A0rates   | Exchange/uni00A0rates   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02018                                  | +1%                     | -1%                     | +10%                    | -10%                    |\n| Increase/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m) | 1,130                   | (1,267)                 | (146)                   | 161                     |\n| Impact on profit: (loss)/gain ($m)                              | -                       | -                       | (299)                   | 348                     |\n| Impact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                       | -                       | 153                     | (187)                   |\n\n|                                                                 | Interest/uni00A0rates   | Interest/uni00A0rates   | Exchange/uni00A0rates   | Exchange/uni00A0rates   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019                                  | +1%                     | -1%                     | +10%                    | -10%                    |\n| Increase/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m) | 1,417                   | (1,521)                 | (4)                     | (36)                    |\n| Impact on profit: (loss)/gain ($m)                              | -                       | -                       | (174)                   | 172                     |\n| Impact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                       | -                       | 170                     | (208)                   |\n\n|                                                                 | Interest/uni00A0rates   | Interest/uni00A0rates   | Exchange/uni00A0rates   | Exchange/uni00A0rates   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020                                  | +1%                     | -1%                     | +10%                    | -10%                    |\n| Increase/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m) | 1,696                   | (1,758)                 | 114                     | (132)                   |\n| Impact on profit: (loss)/gain ($m)                              | -                       | -                       | (57)                    | 74                      |\n| Impact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                       | -                       | 171                     | (206)                   |\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to credit risk on /financial assets, such as cash investments, derivative instruments, and Trade and other receivables. The Group is also exposed in its Net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through pro/fit or loss. Under IFRS 9, the effect of the losses and gains arising from own credit risk on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss are recorded in Other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial counterparty credit risk\n\nThe majority of the AstraZeneca Group's cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested. The level of the Group's cash investments and hence credit risk will depend on the cash /flow generated by the Group and the timing of the use of that cash. The credit risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return and, as such, cash is only invested in high credit-quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.\n\nThe Group's principal /financial counterparty credit risks at 31 December 2020 were as follows:\n\n## Current assets\n\n|                                                                         | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m/uni00A0   | 2018 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                                | 1,182     | 755               | 893       |\n| Money market liquidity funds                                            | 6,602     | 4,110             | 3,435     |\n| Collateralised repurchase agreement                                     | -         | 400               | 400       |\n| Other short-term cash equivalents                                       | 48        | 104               | 103       |\n| Total Cash and cash equivalents (Note 17)                               | 7,832     | 5,369             | 4,831     |\n| Fixed income securities at fair value through profit and loss (Note 12) | 118       | 811               | 809       |\n| Fixed deposits (Note 12)                                                | 42        | 38                | 40        |\n| Total derivative financial instruments (Note 13)                        | 142       | 36                | 258       |\n| Current assets subject to credit risk                                   | 8,134     | 6,254             | 5,938     |\n| Non-current assets                                                      | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m/uni00A0   | 2018 $m   |\n| Fixed income securities at fair value through profit and loss (Note 12) | -         | 62                | -         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (Note 13)                              | 171       | 61                | 157       |\n| Non-current assets subject to credit risk                               | 171       | 123               | 157       |\n\nThe Group may hold signi/ficant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point re/flecting the level of cash /flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.

The Group's investments represent no more than 10% of each overall fund value. There were no other signi/ficant concentrations of /financial credit risk at the reporting date.\n\nThe short-term repurchase agreements were fully collateralised investments. The Group closed out its repurchase agreements during 2020. The value of the cash deposited in repurchase agreements at 31 December 2020 was $nil (2019: $401m; 2018: $403m).\n\nThe /fixed income securities are managed by four external third-party fund managers. During 2020, a signi/ficant amount of the securities were sold and reinvested in money market liquidity funds. The long-term rating of these securities was BBB- or better.\n\nAll /financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the bene/fit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2020 was $288m (2019: $71m; 2018: $384m) and the carrying value of such cash collateral posted by the Group at 31 December 2020 was $11m (2019: $10m; 2018: $14m).\n\nThe impairment provision for other /financial assets at 31 December 2020 was immaterial.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade /finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group applies the expected credit loss approach to establish an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of Trade receivables.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simpli/fied approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all Trade receivables. To measure expected credit losses, Trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit characteristics and the days past due.\n\nThe expected loss rates are based on payment pro/files over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2020, 31 December 2019 or 31 December 2018 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to re/flect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customer to settle the receivables.\n\nOn that basis, the loss allowance was determined as follows:\n\n| 31 December 2018           | Current   | 0-90 days past due   | 90-180 days past due   | Over 180 days past due   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Expected loss rate         | 0.05%     | 0.75%                | 10%                    | 47%                      |         |\n| Gross carrying amount ($m) | 2,854     | 82                   | 27                     | 70                       | 3,033   |\n| Loss allowance ($m)        | 1         | 1                    | 3                      | 33                       | 38      |\n\n| 31 December 2019           | Current   | 0-90 days past due   | 90-180 days past due   | Over 180 days past due   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Expected loss rate         | 0.05%     | 0.75%                | 2%                     | 44%                      |         |\n| Gross carrying amount ($m) | 3,178     | 312                  | 82                     | 34                       | 3,606   |\n| Loss allowance ($m)        | 2         | 2                    | 2                      | 15                       | 21      |\n\n| 31 December 2020           | Current   | 0-90 days past due   | 90-180 days past due   | Over 180 days past due   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Expected loss rate         | 0.05%     | 2.00%                | 19%                    | 61%                      |         |\n| Gross carrying amount ($m) | 3,659     | 124                  | 21                     | 25                       | 3,829   |\n| Loss allowance ($m)        | 2         | 2                    | 4                      | 15                       | 23      |\n\nTrade receivables are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nImpairment losses on Trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within Operating pro/fit, any subsequent recoveries are credited against the same line.\n\nIn the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 95% of US sales (2019: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 94%; 2018: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 88%).\n\nThe movements of the Group expected credit losses provision are follows:\n\n|                                                | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   | 2018 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                   | 21        | 38        | 16        |\n| Net movement recognised in income statement    | 3         | (13)      | 22        |\n| Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements | (1)       | (4)       | -         |\n| At 31/uni00A0December                          | 23        | 21        | 38        |\n\nGiven the pro/file of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identi/fied with the Trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.

They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company. The Group's current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below; other arrangements apply elsewhere.\n\n## Bonus plans\n\n## The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan\n\nEmployees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid in cash.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme\n\nThis scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and re/flect both corporate and individual performance measures. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls suf/ficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan\n\nThis plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET. Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the /first award having been made in February 2006.\n\n## Sweden\n\nIn Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.\n\n## US\n\nIn the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance. Annual bonuses are paid in cash. There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 120 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs. AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.",

In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element, the /first award of which was made in 2011. Currently one Matching Share is awarded for every four Partnership Shares purchased. Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved All-Employee Share Plan. At the Company's AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.\n\n## The AstraZeneca 2014 Performance Share Plan\n\nThis plan was approved by shareholders in 2014 for a period of 10 years and replaces the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a closed period of the Company. The /first grant of awards was made in May 2014. Awards granted under the plan vest after three years, or in the case of Executive Directors and members of the SET, after an additional two-year holding period, and can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions. For awards granted to all participants in 2020, vesting is subject to a combination of measures focused on scienti/fic leadership, revenue growth and /financial performance. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate.\n\n|                                 | Ordinary Shares '000   |   WAFV 1 pence | ADR Shares '000   | WAFV 1 $   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| Outstanding at 1 January 2018   | 2,415                  |           2251 | 7, 3 8 8          | 15.58      |\n| Granted                         | 981                    |           2434 | 2,529             | 17.38      |\n| Forfeited                       | (309)                  |           2311 | (1,356)           | 16.27      |\n| Cancelled                       | (10)                   |           2427 | -                 | -          |\n| Exercised                       | (395)                  |           2357 | (1,598)           | 17.52      |\n| Outstanding at 31 December 2018 | 2,682                  |           2295 | 6,963             | 15.65      |\n| Granted                         | 1,018                  |           3147 | 1,978             | 21.06      |\n| Forfeited                       | (350)                  |           2317 | (1,900)           | 16.80      |\n| Exercised                       | (491)                  |           1983 | (1,835)           | 14.17      |\n| Outstanding at 31 December 2019 | 2,859                  |           2649 | 5,206             | 17.80      |\n| Granted                         | 932                    |           3702 | 1,767             | 24.02      |\n| Forfeited                       | (191)                  |           3088 | (478)             | 19.57      |\n| Cancelled                       | (3)                    |           2234 | -                 | -          |\n| Exercised                       | (552)                  |           2426 | (1,704)           | 15.43      |\n| Outstanding at 31 December 2020 | 3,045                  |           2985 | 4,791             | 20.76      |\n\n## The AstraZeneca Investment Plan\n\nThis plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM.

This plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to selected below SET-level employees and is used in conjunction with the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan to provide a mix of RSUs and performance shares. Awards typically vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are contingent on continued employment with the Company. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated.\n\n|                                 | Ordinary Shares '000   | WAFV pence   | ADR Shares '000   |   WAFV $ |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Outstanding at 1 January 2018   | 865                    | 4491         | 9,945             |    31.03 |\n| Granted                         | 436                    | 4867         | 4,081             |    34.66 |\n| Forfeited                       | (82)                   | 4583         | (1,094)           |    31.6  |\n| Cancelled                       | -                      | -            | (2)               |    32.52 |\n| Exercised                       | (218)                  | 4720         | (2,437)           |    34.52 |\n| Outstanding at 31 December 2018 | 1,001                  | 4598         | 10,493            |    31.57 |\n| Granted                         | 759                    | 6313         | 3,885             |    42.06 |\n| Forfeited                       | (115)                  | 5438         | (1,199)           |    35.44 |\n| Cancelled                       | -                      | -            | (1)               |    32.39 |\n| Exercised                       | (317)                  | 4028         | (3,408)           |    28.82 |\n| Outstanding at 31 December 2019 | 1,328                  | 5640         | 9,770             |    36.22 |\n| Granted                         | 689                    | 7408         | 3,671             |    47.71 |\n| Forfeited                       | (113)                  | 6204         | (1,077)           |    41.08 |\n| Cancelled                       | -                      | 7280         | (9)               |    36.93 |\n| Exercised                       | (278)                  | 4929         | (3,180)           |    31.47 |\n| Outstanding at 31 December 2020 | 1,626                  | 6471         | 9,175             |    41.89 |",

Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as an intangible asset once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle. Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group's long-term revenue forecasts for the related product. The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.\n\n|                                                              | Total $m   |   Under/uni00A01/uni00A0year $m | Years/uni00A01/uni00A0and/uni00A02 $m   | Years/uni00A03/uni00A0and/uni00A04 $m   | Years/uni00A05 and/uni00A0greater $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Future potential research and development milestone payments | 11,067     |                             549 | 2,372                                   | 1,954                                   | 6,192                                  |\n| Future potential revenue milestone payments                  | 12,263     |                              48 | 178                                     | 1,247                                   | 10,790                                 |\n\nThe table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of speci/fied levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (e.g. royalty-type payments) which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk-adjusted. As detailed in the Risk section from page 254, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns). The timing of the payments is based on the Group's current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.\n\n## Environmental costs and liabilities\n\nThe Group's expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products. This includes investment to conserve natural resources and otherwise minimise the impact of our activities on the environment.\n\nThey are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Group's research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are not separated from overall operating and development costs. There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2018, 2019 or 2020.\n\nIn addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination. In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third-party sites.\n\nIn the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) or defendants at a number of sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes (together, US Environmental Consequences). Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC (SMC), which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at a number of sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences.\n\nAstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US. These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Group's business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or in progress. AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Group's R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges; where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably. With respect to such estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2020 in the aggregate of $100m (2019: $96m; 2018: $97m), mainly relating to the US. Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we re/flect only our share of the obligation. Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.\n\nIt is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions. The extent of such possible additional costs is inherently dif/ficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: (i) the nature and extent of claims that may be asserted in the future; (ii) whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims; (iii) the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known; (iv) the potential for recoveries from or allocation of liability to third parties; and (v) the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation process can take. As per our accounting policy on page 186, provisions for these costs are made when there is a present obligation and where it is probable that expenditure on remedial work will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the cost. Notwithstanding and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to be, in aggregate, between $95m and $158m (2019: $86m and $143m; 2018: $71m and $118m), which relates mainly to the US.",

        "page_content": "## Legal proceedings\n\nAstraZeneca is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including actual or threatened litigation and actual or potential government investigations relating to employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and marketing practices, infringement of IP rights, and the validity of certain patents and competition laws. The more signi/ficant matters are discussed below.\n\nMost of the claims involve highly complex issues. Often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and/or an estimate of the amount of any loss is dif/ficult to ascertain.\n\nUnless speci/fically identi/fied below that a provision has been taken, AstraZeneca considers each of the claims to represent a contingent liability and discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the cases in accordance with IAS 37.\n\nThere is one matter, which is considered probable that an out/flow will be required, but for which we are unable to make an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible losses at this stage.\n\nWe do not believe that disclosure of the amounts sought by plaintiffs, if known, would be meaningful with respect to these legal proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including (i) the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; (ii) the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; (iii) clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law; (iv) uncertainties in timing of litigation; and (v) the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any.\n\nWhile there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings referred to in this Note 29, based on management's current and considered view of each situation, we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our /financial position including within the next /financial year. This position could of course change over time, not least because of the factors referred to above.\n\nIn cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quanti/fiable /fines and penalties have been assessed and which are not subject to appeal (or other similar forms of relief), or where a loss is probable and we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the loss, we generally indicate the loss absorbed or make a provision for our best estimate of the expected loss.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged to pro/fit as they are incurred.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which a provision has been established, and we consider recovery to be virtually certain, the best estimate of the amount expected to be received is recognised as an asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ Assessments as to whether or not to recognise provisions or assets, and of the amounts concerned, usually involve a series of complex judgements about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that the provisions recorded are adequate based on currently available information and that the insurance recoveries recorded will be received. However, given the inherent uncertainties involved in assessing the outcomes of these cases, and in estimating the amount of the potential losses and the associated insurance recoveries, we could in the future incur judgments or insurance settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results in any particular period.\n\nIP claims include challenges to the Group's patents on various products or processes and assertions of non-infringement of patents. A loss in any of these cases could result in loss of patent protection on the related product. The consequences of any such loss could be a signi/ficant decrease in Product Sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results. The lawsuits /filed by AstraZeneca for patent infringement against companies that have /filed ANDAs in the US, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by the Group prior to the expiry of the applicable patents covering these products, typically also involve allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these patents by the ANDA /filers. In the event that the Group is unsuccessful in these actions or the statutory 30-month stay expires before a ruling is obtained, the ANDA /filers involved will also have the ability, subject to FDA approval, to introduce generic versions of the product concerned.\n\nAstraZeneca has full con/fidence in, and will vigorously defend and enforce, its IP.\n\nOver the course of the past several years, including in 2020, a signi/ficant number of commercial litigation claims in which AstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, particularly in the US, thereby reducing potential contingent liability exposure arising from such litigation. Similarly, in part due to patent litigation and settlement developments, greater certainty has been achieved regarding possible generic entry dates with respect to some of our patented products. At the same time, like other companies in the pharmaceutical sector and other industries, AstraZeneca continues to be subject to government investigations around the world.\n\n## Patent litigation Tagrisso\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nIn February 2020, in response to Paragraph IV notices from multiple abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) /filers, AstraZeneca /filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. In its complaint, AstraZeneca alleged that a generic version of Tagrisso , if approved and marketed, would infringe a US Orange Book-listed Tagrisso patent. The trial is scheduled for May 2022.\n\n## Faslodex\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nAstraZeneca /filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey (the District Court) relating to four patents listed in the FDA Orange Book with reference to Faslodex after receiving a number of Paragraph IV notices relating to multiple ANDAs or NDAs submitted pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(2) seeking FDA approval to market generic versions of Faslodex prior to the expiration of AstraZeneca's patents. In July 2016, AstraZeneca settled one of these, the lawsuit brought against Sandoz, Inc. (Sandoz), and the District Court entered a consent judgment, which included an injunction preventing Sandoz from launching a generic fulvestrant product until March 2019, or earlier in certain circumstances. Between 2016 and 2020, AstraZeneca resolved all of the remaining lawsuits, and the District Court also entered consent judgments ending those lawsuits.\n\n## Farxiga\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nIn 2018, in response to Paragraph IV notices, AstraZeneca initiated ANDA litigation against Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. (Zydus) in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. In its complaint, AstraZeneca alleged that Zydus' generic version of Farxiga , if approved and marketed, would infringe patents listed in the FDA Orange Book with reference to Farxiga . Proceedings are ongoing and trial is scheduled for May 2021.\n\n## Patent proceedings outside the US\n\nIn Canada, in January 2021, Sandoz Canada Inc. served three Notices of Allegation on AstraZeneca alleging invalidity and/or non-infringement of all three patents listed on the Canadian Patent Register in relation to Forxiga . AstraZeneca is considering its response.\n\n## Brilinta\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nIn 2015 and subsequently, in response to Paragraph IV notices from ANDA /filers, AstraZeneca /filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US District Court for the District of Delaware (the District Court) relating to patents listed in the FDA Orange Book with reference to Brilinta . In 2020, AstraZeneca entered into three separate settlements and the District Court entered consent judgments to",

AstraZeneca is the exclusive licensee of FibroGen in Canada. AstraZeneca and FibroGen are defending the action. A trial is scheduled to begin on 15 February 2021.\n\n## Symbicort\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nIn October 2018, AstraZeneca initiated ANDA litigation against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan) and subsequently against 3M Company (3M) in the US District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. In the action, AstraZeneca alleges that the defendants' generic versions of Symbicort , if approved and marketed, would infringe various AstraZeneca patents. Mylan and 3M alleged that their proposed generic medicines do not infringe the asserted patents and/or that the asserted patents are invalid and/or unenforceable. In July 2020, AstraZeneca added Kindeva Drug Delivery L.P. (Kindeva) as a defendant in the case. In September 2020, Mylan, 3M and Kindeva stipulated to patent infringement to the extent that the asserted patent claims are found to be valid and enforceable, but reserved the right to seek a vacatur of the stipulation if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reverses or modi/fies the District Court's claim construction. In October 2020, following a stipulation by AstraZeneca, 3M and Kindeva, 3M was dismissed from the action. The trial of the matter was held in October 2020 and closing argument was held in January 2021. A decision is awaited.\n\n## Daliresp\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nIn 2015 and subsequently, in response to Paragraph IV notices from ANDA /filers, AstraZeneca /filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey (the District Court) relating to patents listed in the FDA Orange Book with reference to Daliresp . In 2020, AstraZeneca entered into a settlement and the District Court entered a consent judgment to dismiss the corresponding litigation. Additional proceedings are ongoing in the District Court. No trial date has been set.\n\n## Movantik\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nIn March 2020, Aether Therapeutics, Inc. /filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Delaware against\n\nAstraZeneca, Nektar Therapeutics and Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., relating to Movantik . A trial has been set for March 2023.\n\n## Onglyza\n\n## Patent proceedings outside the US\n\nIn Canada, in November 2019, Sandoz Canada Inc. sent a Notice of Allegation to AstraZeneca challenging the validity of Canadian substance Patent No. 2402894 (expiry March 2021) (the '894 patent) and formulation Patent No. 2568391 (expiry May 2025) related to Onglyza . AstraZeneca commenced an action in response related to the '894 patent in January 2020. A trial date has been set for October 2021.\n\n## Enhertu\n\n## US patent proceedings\n\nIn October 2020, Seagen Inc. (Seagen) /filed a complaint against Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Enhertu infringes US Patent No. 10,808,039 (the '039 patent). AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP co-commercialises Enhertu with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. in the US. A claim construction hearing has been scheduled for August 2021 and a trial has been scheduled for April 2022.\n\nIn November 2020, AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited and Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. /filed a complaint against Seagen in the US District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a declaratory judgment that plaintiffs do not infringe the '039 patent. On 18 December 2020, Seagen /filed a motion seeking to stay or dismiss this action.\n\nOn 23 December 2020, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. /filed a post grant review petition with the US Patent and Trademark Of/fice alleging, inter alia, that the '039 patent is invalid for lack of written description and enablement. In January 2021, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, Inc /filed a second post grant review petition with the US Patent and Trademark Of/fice extending its challenge to additional claims in the '039 patent. A decision on institution of these petitions is expected in July 2021.\n\n## Product liability litigation\n\n## Farxiga (dapagli/flozin) and Xigduo XR (dapagli/flozin/metformin HCl)\n\nIn several jurisdictions in the US, AstraZeneca has been named as a defendant in lawsuits involving plaintiffs claiming physical injury, including diabetic ketoacidosis and kidney failure, from treatment with Farxiga and/or Xigduo XR. In April 2017, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered transfer of any currently pending cases as well as of any similar, subsequently /filed cases to a co-ordinated and consolidated pre-trial multidistrict litigation proceeding in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. All of these claims have been resolved or dismissed, and the MDL has been administratively closed.\n\nIn addition, in several jurisdictions in the US, AstraZeneca has been named as a defendant in lawsuits involving plaintiffs claiming physical injury, including Fournier's Gangrene and necrotising fasciitis, from treatment with Farxiga and/or Xigduo XR. A majority of these claims are /filed in Delaware state court and remain pending.\n\n## Byetta / Bydureon\n\nIn the US, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, and/ or AstraZeneca are among multiple defendants in various lawsuits /filed in federal and state courts involving claims of physical injury from treatment with Byetta and/or Bydureon . The lawsuits allege several types of injuries including pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, and kidney cancer. A multidistrict litigation was established in the US District Court for the Southern District of California (the District Court) in regard to the alleged pancreatic cancer cases in federal courts. Further, a coordinated proceeding has been established in Los Angeles (the California Court), California in regard to the various lawsuits in California state courts. In November 2015, the District Court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed all claims alleging pancreatic cancer that accrued prior to 11 September 2015. In November 2017, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court's order and remanded for further discovery. In November 2018, the Court of Appeals for the State of California annulled the judgment from the California state coordinated proceeding and remanded for further discovery. In October and December 2020, the District Court and the California Court jointly heard oral argument on a renewed motion /filed by Defendants seeking summary judgment and dismissal of all claims. That motion remains pending.\n\n## Onglyza and Kombiglyze\n\nIn the US, AstraZeneca is defending various lawsuits alleging heart failure, cardiac injuries, and/or death from treatment with Onglyza or Kombiglyze . In February 2018, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the transfer of various pending federal actions to the US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (District Court) for consolidated pre-trial proceedings with the federal actions pending in the District Court. The previously disclosed California State Court coordinated proceeding remains pending in California.\n\n## Nexium and Losec / Prilosec\n\n## U.S. proceedings\n\nIn the US, AstraZeneca is defending various lawsuits brought in federal and state courts involving multiple plaintiffs claiming that they have been diagnosed with various injuries following treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including Nexium and Prilosec .

In August 2017, the JPML granted the motion and consolidated the pending federal court cases in an MDL proceeding in federal court in New Jersey for pre-trial purposes. A trial in the MDL has been scheduled for November 2021. In addition to the MDL cases, there are cases /filed in several state courts around the US; a trial in Delaware state court has been scheduled for February 2022.\n\nIn addition, AstraZeneca has been defending lawsuits involving allegations of gastric cancer following treatment with PPIs. All but one of these claims is /filed in the MDL. One claim is /filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, where the court has scheduled a trial for March 2022.\n\n## Canada proceedings\n\nIn Canada, in July and August 2017, AstraZeneca was served with three putative class action lawsuits. Two of the lawsuits seek authorisation to represent individual residents in Canada who allegedly suffered kidney injuries from the use of proton pump inhibitors, including Nexium and Losec . In August 2019, the third lawsuit, /filed in Quebec, was dismissed.\n\n## Commercial litigation Amplimmune\n\nIn the US, in June 2017, AstraZeneca was served with a lawsuit /filed by the stockholders' agents for Amplimmune, Inc.

No trial date has been set.\n\n## Ocimum lawsuit\n\nIn the US, in December 2017, AstraZeneca was served with a complaint /filed by Ocimum Biosciences, Ltd. (Ocimum) in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware that alleges,\n\namong other things, breaches of contractual obligations and misappropriation of trade secrets, relating to a now terminated 2001 licensing agreement between AstraZeneca and Gene Logic, Inc. (Gene Logic), the rights to which Ocimum purports to have acquired from Gene Logic. In December 2019, the court granted AstraZeneca's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. Ocimum has appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\n## Seroquel XR (Antitrust Litigation)\n\nIn the US in 2019, AstraZeneca was named in several related complaints brought in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, including several putative class action lawsuits that were purportedly brought on behalf of classes of direct purchasers or end payors of Seroquel XR, that allege AstraZeneca and generic drug manufacturers violated antitrust laws when settling patent litigation related to Seroquel XR. In August 2020, the Court granted AstraZeneca's motions to transfer all such lawsuits to the US District Court for the District of Delaware.\n\n## Anti-Terrorism Act Civil Lawsuit\n\nIn the US, in July 2020, the US District Court for the District of Columbia granted AstraZeneca's and certain other pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies' motion and dismissed a lawsuit /filed by US nationals (or their estates, survivors, or heirs) who were killed or wounded in Iraq between 2005 and 2011, which had alleged that the defendants violated the US Anti-Terrorism Act and various state laws by selling pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the Iraqi Ministry of Health. The plaintiffs are appealing the District Court's order dismissing the litigation.\n\n## AZD1222 Securities/uni00A0Litigation\n\nIn January 2021, putative securities class action lawsuits were /filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against AstraZeneca PLC and certain of/ficers, on behalf of purchasers of AstraZeneca publicly traded securities during the period 21 May 2020 through 20 November 2020. The complaints allege that defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with the development of AZD1222 (otherwise known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca ), a potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, and assert claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5.\n\n## De/finiens\n\nIn Germany, in July 2020, AstraZeneca received a notice of arbitration /filed with the German Institution of Arbitration from the sellers of De/finiens AG (Sellers) regarding the 2014 Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) between AstraZeneca and the Sellers.

This matter has resolved and is now concluded.\n\n## Synagis\n\n## Investigations and Litigations\n\nIn the US, in June 2011, MedImmune received a demand from the US Attorney's Of/fice for the Southern District of New York requesting certain documents related to the sales and marketing activities of Synagis . In July 2011, MedImmune received a similar court order to produce documents from the Of/fice of the Attorney General for the State of New York Medicaid and Fraud Control Unit pursuant to what the government attorneys advised was a joint investigation. In May 2012, MedImmune received a subpoena duces tecum from the Of/fice of Attorney General for the State of Florida Medicaid and Fraud Control Unit requesting certain documents related to the sales and marketing activities of Synagis . MedImmune accepted receipt of these requests and coordinated with these agencies to provide the appropriate responses and cooperate with any related investigation.\n\nIn March 2017, the Attorney General for the State of New York /filed a complaint in intervention in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that MedImmune inappropriately provided assistance to a single specialty care pharmacy. Neither the US Attorney's Of/fice for the Southern District of New York nor the Of/fice of the Attorney General for the State of Florida sought to intervene or pursue litigation. In September 2018, the US District Court in New York denied MedImmune's motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the Attorney General for the State of New York. In July 2020, this matter was resolved. This matter is now concluded.\n\nIn November 2017, MedImmune was served with an amended complaint in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by a relator under the qui tam (whistle-blower) provisions of the federal and certain state False Claims Acts. The lawsuit was originally /filed under seal in April 2009 and alleged that MedImmune made false claims about Synagis . In September 2018, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the relator's lawsuit. In January 2019, the relator appealed the decision",

This matter is now concluded.\n\n## Toprol-XL Louisiana Attorney General Litigation\n\nIn July 2020, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeals (the Appellate Court) reversed and remanded a Louisiana state trial court (the Trial Court) ruling that had granted AstraZeneca's motion for summary judgment and dismissed a state court complaint, brought by the Attorney General for the State of Louisiana, alleging that AstraZeneca engaged in unlawful monopolisation and unfair trade practices in connection with the enforcement of its Toprol-XL patents. In August 2020, AstraZeneca petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court (the Supreme Court) to review the decision of the Appellate Court and reinstate the Trial Court's summary judgment ruling. In December 2020, the Supreme Court granted AstraZeneca's petition and agreed to review the Appellate Court's decision. AstraZeneca /filed its opening appellate brief with the Supreme Court in January 2021, and a decision on the merits of the appeal remains pending.\n\n## Iraqi Ministry of Health Anti-Corruption Probe\n\nIn the US, in July 2018, AstraZeneca, along with other companies, received an inquiry from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) pursuant to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with an anticorruption investigation relating to activities in Iraq, including interactions with the Iraqi government. In August 2020, the DOJ noti/fied AstraZeneca that it does not intend to institute an enforcement action and is closing the inquiry.\n\n## Vermont US Attorney Investigation\n\nIn the US, in April 2020, AstraZeneca received a Civil Investigative Demand from the US Attorney's Of/fice in Vermont and the Department of Justice, Civil Division, seeking documents and information relating to AstraZeneca's relationships with electronic health-record vendors. AstraZeneca is co-operating with this enquiry.\n\n## US 340B Litigations and Proceedings\n\nAstraZeneca is involved in several matters relating to its policy with regard to contract pharmacy recognition under the 340B Drug Pricing Program in the US. In October and November 2020, two lawsuits, one in the US District Court for the District of Columbia and one in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, were /filed by covered entities and advocacy groups against the US Department of Health and Human Services, the US Health Resources and Services Administration as well as other US government agencies and their of/ficials. The complaints allege, among other things, that these agencies should enforce an interpretation of the governing statute for the 340B Drug Pricing Program that would require drug manufacturers participating\n\nin the program to offer their drugs for purchase at statutorily capped rates by an unlimited number of contract pharmacies. AstraZeneca has sought to intervene in the lawsuits. Administrative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceedings have also been initiated against AstraZeneca before the US Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\nIn addition, in January 2021, AstraZeneca /filed a separate lawsuit in federal court in Delaware alleging that a recent Advisory Opinion issued by the Department of Health and Human Services violates the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n## US Congressional\n\nIn January 2019, AstraZeneca received a letter from the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform seeking information related to pricing practices for Crestor . Similar letters were sent to 11 other pharmaceutical manufacturers. We continue to cooperate with the inquiry and have produced certain responsive information.\n\n## Additional government inquiries\n\nAs is true for most, if not all, major prescription pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca is currently involved in multiple inquiries into drug marketing and pricing practices. In addition to the investigations described above, various law enforcement of/fices have, from time to time, requested information from the Group. There have been no material developments in those matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSE AstraZeneca considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it is concluded that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, where tax exposures can be quanti/fied, an accrual is made based on either the most likely amount method or the expected value method depending on which method management expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Accruals can be built up over a long period of time but the ultimate resolution of tax exposures usually occurs at a point in time, and given the inherent uncertainties in assessing the outcomes of these exposures (which sometimes can be binary in nature), we could, in future periods, experience adjustments to these accruals that have a material positive or negative effect on our results in any particular period. Details of the movements in relation to material tax exposures are discussed below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKJ AstraZeneca faces a number of audits and reviews in jurisdictions around the world and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax authorities. The issues under discussion are often complex and can require many years to resolve. Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make key judgements with respect to the ultimate outcome of current and potential future tax audits, and actual results could vary from these estimates.\n\n## Transfer pricing and other international tax/uni00A0contingencies\n\nThe total net accrual included in the Group Financial Statements to cover the worldwide exposure to transfer pricing audits is $287m (2019: $140m; 2018: $212m), an increase of $147m compared with 2019 mainly as a result of additional provisions for tax contingencies partially offset by reductions following the conclusion of tax authority review. These positions can be complex and judgemental. Therefore in determining the accrual, management has assessed their expectation of the ultimate resolution of the uncertainty, including settlement or litigation.\n\nManagement continues to believe that AstraZeneca's positions on all its transfer pricing and other international tax audits and disputes are robust, and that AstraZeneca is appropriately provided, including consideration of whether corresponding relief will be available under Mutual Agreement procedures or unilaterally.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) issued its decision on the state aid review of UK Controlled Foreign Company Group Financing Exemption. The EC concluded that part of the UK measures was unlawful and have instructed recovery of the state aid. The UK Government and the Group have appealed the decision. Despite the nature of the complexities of the ruling in relation to the Group's position, the complex tax legislation and taking into account the ongoing appeal, the Group does not expect any additional liability would be material.\n\nFor transfer pricing and other international tax matters where AstraZeneca and the tax authorities are in dispute, and the state aid matter, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for reasonably possible additional liabilities above and beyond the amount provided to be up to $251m (2019: $76m; 2018: $357m) including associated interest. Management believes that it is unlikely that these additional liabilities will arise. It is possible that some of these contingencies may change in the future to re/flect progress in tax authority reviews, to the extent that any tax authority challenge is concluded, or matters lapse including following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods.\n\n## Other tax contingencies\n\nIncluded in the tax accrual is $727m (2019: $887m; 2018: $730m) relating to a number of other tax contingencies, a decrease of $160m mainly due to releases of tax contingencies following the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations and on the conclusion of tax authority review, partially offset by the impact of an additional year of transactions relating to contingencies for which accruals had already been established and exchange rate effects. The majority of the accrual relates to tax contingencies which are estimated using",

It is possible that some of these contingencies may reduce in the future if any tax authority challenge is concluded or matters lapse following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation, resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods.\n\n## Timing of cash /flows and interest\n\nIt is not possible to estimate the timing of tax cash /flows in relation to each outcome. It is anticipated that tax payments may be required in relation to a number of signi/ficant disputes which may be resolved over the next one to\n\ntwo years. AstraZeneca considers the accruals set out above to appropriately re/flect the expected value of any /final settlement. Some of the items discussed above are not currently within the scope of tax authority audits and may take longer to resolve.\n\nIncluded within other receivables and payables is a net amount of interest arising on tax contingencies of $82m (2019: $90m; 2018: $116m).\n\n## 30 Statutory and other information\n\n|                                                                                                                                         | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |   2018 $m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its associates: Group audit fee                                                          | 6.3       | 3.9       |       3.8 |\n| Fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its associates for other services: The audit of subsidiaries pursuant to legislation     | 10.8      | 8.3       |       9.4 |\n| Attestation under s404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002                                                                                       | 2.0       | 2.0       |       2   |\n| Audit-related assurance services                                                                                                        | 0.7       | 0.3       |       0.8 |\n| Tax compliance services                                                                                                                 | -         | -         |       0.1 |\n| Other assurance services                                                                                                                | 0.2       | 0.1       |       0.9 |\n| Fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers Associates in respect of the Group's pension schemes: The audit of subsidiaries' pension schemes | 0.3       | 0.3       |       0.4 |\n|                                                                                                                                         | 20.3      | 14.9      |      17.4 |\n\n$0.8m of fees payable in 2020 are in respect of the 2019 Group audit and audit of subsidiaries (2019: $0.7m in respect of the 2018 audit).\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nThe Group had no material related party transactions which might reasonably be expected to in/fluence decisions made by the users of these Financial Statements.\n\n## Key management personnel compensation\n\nKey management personnel are de/fined for the purpose of disclosure under IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' as the members of the Board and the members of the SET.\n\n|                              | 2020 $'000   | 2019 $'000   | 2018 $'000   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits | 29,126       | 31,329       | 32,523       |\n| Post-employment benefits     | 1,602        | 1,766        | 2,387        |\n| Share-based payments         | 27,666       | 19,210       | 23,605       |\n|                              | 58,394       | 52,305       | 58,515       |\n\nTotal remuneration is included within employee costs (see Note 28).\n\n## 31 Subsequent events\n\nOn 12 December 2020, AstraZeneca and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) announced that they had entered into a de/finitive agreement for AstraZeneca to acquire Alexion for a total consideration of $39bn, partly funded in cash and partly in AstraZeneca American Depository Shares. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition. Subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by shareholders of both companies, the acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, and upon completion, Alexion shareholders will own approximately 15% of the combined company. In conjunction with the acquisition, AstraZeneca has entered into committed bank facilities of $17.5bn as discussed in Note 27.\n\nOn 1 February 2021, AstraZeneca announced that it had agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, to divest its 26.7% ownership of Viela Bio, as part of the proposed acquisition of Viela Bio by Horizon Therapeutics plc. AstraZeneca is anticipating to receive cash proceeds and pro/fit of approximately $760-$780m upon closing for the sale of the holding, which will be recorded in Other operating income and expense. The divestment is expected to complete by the end of the /first quarter of 2021.\n\nOn 9 February 2021, AstraZeneca completed its sale of rights to Crestor and associated medicines in certain European countries to Gr\u00fcnenthal for an upfront payment of $320m, which will be recorded within Other operating income and expense. At 31 December 2020 there were no intangible or other assets on the balance sheet relating to the disposal.",

        "page_content": "## Company Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of presentation of financial information\n\nThese /financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\nIn preparing these /financial statements, the Company applied the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRSs), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.\n\nIn these /financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- >  Statement of Cash Flows and related notes\n- >  disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries\n- >  disclosures in respect of capital management\n- >  the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs\n- >  disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel.\n\nAs the Group Financial Statements (presented on pages 176 to 237) include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- >  IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment' in respect of Group settled share-based payments certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 'Financial Instrument Disclosures'.\n- >  No individual pro/fit and loss account is prepared as provided by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## UK-adopted international accounting standards\n\nOn 31 December 2020, EU-adopted IFRS was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted international accounting standards, with future changes to IFRS being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The Company Financial Statements will transition to UK-adopted international accounting standards for /financial periods beginning 1 January 2021.\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Company Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies, which have been applied consistently.\n\n## Estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There are no signi/ficant judgements and estimates.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nPro/fit and loss account items in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at average rates for the relevant accounting periods. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the Company Balance Sheet. Exchange gains and losses on loans and on short-term foreign currency borrowings and deposits are included within net Finance expense. Exchange differences on all other foreign currency transactions are recognised in Operating pro/fit.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe current tax payable is based on taxable pro/fit for the year. Taxable pro/fit differs from reported pro/fit because taxable pro/fit excludes items that are either never taxable or tax deductible or items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period. The Company's current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro/fit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. This requires judgements to be made in respect of the availability of future taxable income.\n\nNo deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches where the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nAccruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements of potential exposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax bene/fits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax bene/fit and re/flects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable result.\n\nAccruals for tax contingencies are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the Company expect to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\n## Investments\n\nFixed asset investments, including investments in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe issuance by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries of a grant of awards over the Company's shares, represents additional capital contributions by the Company to its subsidiaries. An additional investment in subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the grant issued, allocated over the underlying grant's vesting period, less the market cost of shares charged to subsidiaries in settlement of such share awards.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nInterest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the loan) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective rate method at each reporting date. Changes in carrying value are recognised in pro/fit.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThrough the normal course of business, the AstraZeneca Group is involved in legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Company. Provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs can be estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate descriptions are included.",

This might impact the fair values of loans as they change according to changes in the market rate. As the loans are held at amortised cost, change in interest rates and the credit rating of the Company do not have an effect on the Company's net assets.\n\n## 4 Called-up share capital\n\nDetails of share capital movements in the year are included in Note 24 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## 5 Contingent liabilities\n\nThe Company has guaranteed the external borrowing of a subsidiary in the amount of $286m (2019: $286m), as well as guaranteed the undrawn borrowing facility of a subsidiary totalling $17.5bn (2019: $nil) in relation to the acquisition of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) as further described in Note 7.\n\n## Vermont US Attorney Investigation\n\nIn the US, in April 2020, AstraZeneca received a Civil Investigative Demand from the US Attorney's Of/fice in Vermont and the Department of Justice, Civil Division, seeking documents and information relating to AstraZeneca's relationships with electronic health-record vendors. AstraZeneca is co-operating with this enquiry.\n\n## AZD1222 Securities Litigation\n\nIn January 2021, putative securities class action lawsuits were /filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against AstraZeneca PLC and certain of/ficers, on behalf of purchasers of AstraZeneca publicly traded securities during the period 21 May 2020 through 20 November 2020. The complaints allege that defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with the development of AZD1222 (otherwise known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca ), a potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, and assert claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5.\n\n## 6 Statutory and other information\n\nThe Directors of the Company were paid by another Group company in 2020 and 2019.\n\n## 7 Subsequent events\n\nOn 12 December 2020, AstraZeneca and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) announced that they had entered into a de/finitive agreement for AstraZeneca to acquire Alexion for a total consideration of $39bn, partly funded in cash and partly in AstraZeneca American Depository Shares. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition. Subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by shareholders of both companies, the acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, and upon completion, Alexion shareholders will own approximately 15% of the combined company.\n\nNo other subsequent events having material impact on the /financial statements were identi/fied after the balance sheet date.",

In this section, we describe the risks and uncertainties that we consider material to our business in that they may have a signi/ficant effect on our /financial condition, results of operations, and/or reputation.\n\nThese risks are not listed in any particular order of priority and have been categorised consistently with the Principal Risks detailed from page 80, which are included below along with the other risks that we face. We believe that the forward-looking statements about AstraZeneca in this Annual Report, identi/fied by words such as 'anticipates', 'believes', 'expects' and 'intends', and that include, among other things, future prospects in the Financial Review from page 82, are based on reasonable assumptions. However, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties such as those summarised below. They relate to events that may occur in the future, that may be in/fluenced by factors beyond our control and that may have actual outcomes materially different from our expectations.

        "page_content": "## Product pipeline and IP risks\n\n## Impact\n\n## Failure to meet regulatory or ethical requirements for medicine development or approval\n\nWe are subject to strict controls on the commercialisation processes for our pharmaceutical products, including their development, manufacture, distribution and marketing. The criteria for establishing safety, ef/ficacy and quality, which are essential for securing marketing approvals, vary by country and by region. Regulators can refuse to grant approval or may require additional data before approval is granted or as a post-approval commitment, even though the medicine may already be approved or launched in other countries.\n\nFactors, including advances in science and technology, evolving regulatory science, new laws and policies, and different approaches to bene/fit/risk tolerance by regulatory authorities, the general public, and other third-party public interest groups are known to in/fluence the approvability of new drugs. While we seek to manage most of these risks, unanticipated and unpredictable policymaking by governments and regulators, limited regulatory authority resources or con/flicting priorities often lead to delays in regulatory approvals.\n\nWe may be required to generate additional data after a drug's approval because a regulatory authority may have concerns that impact the bene/fit/risk pro/file of the drug. For our marketed drugs, new data or meta-analyses have the potential to drive changes in the approval status or labelling. In addition, recent years have seen an increase in post-marketing regulatory requirements and commitments, an increased call for third-party access to regulatory and clinical trial data packages for independent analysis and interpretation, and broader data transparency. Such transparency, while important, could lead to inappropriate or incorrect data analyses which may damage the integrity of our products and our Company's reputation. In 2020, we have seen additional transparency challenges with the COVID-19 vaccine trials, due to intense media scrutiny driven by extremely high public interest, as well as information leaks.\n\nDelays in regulatory reviews and approvals could delay our ability to market our products and may adversely affect our revenue. In addition, post-approval requirements, including additional clinical trials, could result in increased costs.\n\nIn anticipation of the UK leaving the EU on 31 January 2020, with a transition period running to 31 December 2020, intense work was undertaken to manage Brexit-related changes, identify scenarios for the many uncertainties still to be resolved, and determine the new UK requirements moving forward. This included transferring licences and authorisations for EU markets historically held in the UK to an EU member state and building capability to test medicines in the EU where such testing has in the past been undertaken in the UK for all EU markets. UK licences also needed to be separated out from centrally approved products in the EU. These actions were undertaken to ensure appropriate regulatory requirements can be met both in the EU and UK following the end of the transition period. Our corporate planning assumption was initially for a 'no deal' Brexit and no transition period. This was revised after the Withdrawal Agreement was rati/fied to no extension of the transition period and no deal. In light of these assumptions, the Company has taken steps to protect product supply in both the UK and the EU.\n\nOn 24 December 2020 the European Commission and UK Government entered into a Trade and Cooperation agreement which sets out the basis of their relationship following the end of the transition period. Changes in regulatory review and approval processes, and safety surveillance in light of this agreement will certainly have implications on resources, ways of working and costs, and could impact the availability and timing of approvals.\n\n## Failure to obtain, defend and enforce effective IP protection and IP challenges by third parties\n\nA pharmaceutical product may be protected from being copied for a limited period of time under certain patent rights and/or related IP rights, such as Regulatory Data Protection or Orphan Drug status. Typically, products protected by such rights generate signi/ficantly higher revenues than those not protected. Our ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patents and other IP rights in relation to our products is an important element in protecting and recouping our investment in R&D and creating long-term value for the business. Some countries in which we operate do not offer robust IP protection. This may be because IP laws are still developing, the scope of those laws is limited or the political environment does not support such legislation. We also recognise increasing use of compulsory licensing in some countries in which we operate.\n\nWe may also face challenges early in the patent application process and throughout a patent's life. The grounds for these challenges could be the validity of a patent and/or its effective scope and are based on ever-evolving legal precedents. We are experiencing increased challenges in the US and elsewhere in the world and there can be no guarantee of success for either party in patent proceedings and litigation.\n\nWe also bear the risk that our products may be found to infringe patents owned or licensed by third parties, including research-based and generic pharmaceutical companies and individuals. These third parties may seek remedies for patent infringement, including injunctions (for example, preventing the marketing of one of our products) and damages.\n\nDetails of material patent proceedings and litigation matters can be found in Note 29 to the Financial Statements from page 228.\n\nLimitations on the availability of patent protection, the ability to obtain related IP rights or the use of compulsory licensing in certain countries in which we operate, as well as our ability to defend and enforce our patents, could allow for earlier entry of generic or biosimilar competitor products. This could have a material adverse effect on the pricing and sales of our products and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our revenues.\n\nThird parties may be awarded remedies for alleged infringement of their IP, for example injunctions and damages for alleged patent infringement. In the US, courts may order enhanced (i.e. up to treble) damages for alleged wilful infringement of patents. From time to time we may seek to acquire licences, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, discontinue activities and/or modify processes to avoid claims of patent infringement. These steps could entail signi/ficant costs and our revenue and margins could be materially adversely affected.\n\nMore information about protecting our IP, the risk of patent litigation and the early loss of IP rights is contained in the Intellectual Property section from page 65, the competitive pressures including expiry or loss of IP rights, and generic competition risk on page 256 and Note 29 to the Financial Statements from page 228.",

This is a particular risk in some Emerging  Markets where appropriate patent protection or other related IP rights may be dif/ficult  to obtain or enforce. The biosimilars market has experienced notable growth since 2017, with approval of  several monoclonal antibody biosimilars in the US and Europe. This trend is expected  to continue.

Many formularies employ 'generic /first' strategies and/or  require physicians to obtain prior approval for the use of a branded medicine where a  generic alternative exists. These mechanisms can be used by payers to limit the use of  branded products and put pressure on manufacturers to reduce net prices. In addition,  patients are seeing changes in the design of their health plan bene/fits and may  experience variation in how their plans cover their medications, including increases  in the out-of-pocket payments for their branded medications. Patient out-of-pocket  spending is generally in the form of a co-payment or co-insurance, but there is a growing                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| In Europe, the industry continues to be exposed to various ad hoc cost-containment  measures and reference pricing mechanisms which impact prices. There is a trend  towards increasing transparency and comparison of prices among EU Member States  which may eventually lead to a change in the overall pricing and reimbursement  landscape. There is also a continued push across the EU to harmonise the Health  Technology Assessment (HTA) review process. This could lead to an environment in  the EU where medicines undergo duplicate HTA evaluations, both at an EU level and  a country level, as it is unlikely organisations such as GBA in Germany or HAS in  France would make changes to their systems. In Emerging Markets, governments are increasingly controlling pricing and favouring locally  manufactured drugs. In addition, the emergence of price referencing has been seen in some  markets combined with a call from authorities to provide greater global price transparency.  For example, in 2020, China expanded value-based procurement (VBP), placing downward |",

        "page_content": "## Commercialisation risks\n\n## Impact\n\n## Uncertainty and volatility in relation to the UK's planned exit from the EU\n\nOn 23 June 2016, the UK held a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU, the outcome of which was a decision for the UK to leave the EU (Brexit). Following Royal Assent of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act in the UK and rati/fication of the Withdrawal Agreement by the European Parliament, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 with a transition period running to 31 December 2020.\n\nOn 24 December 2020 the UK Government and European Commission agreed the terms of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement which sets out the relationship between the UK and the EU following the end of the transition period. Entering into this agreement was provisionally approved by the European Council on 29 December 2020 and the associated UK legislation received Royal Assent on 30 December 2020. The European Parliament is due to formally scrutinise the agreement in the coming months prior to providing its consent to it. The agreement comprises a Free Trade Agreement, rules on governance and dispute resolution, and security cooperation. The Free Trade Agreement provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin; maintains a level playing /field in areas such as environmental protection, social and labour rights, tax transparency and State aid, with enforcement and a binding dispute settlement mechanism; and maintains air, road, rail and maritime connectivity but with new customs and passport checks and limitations on haulage operations.\n\nIt is still too early to judge the full impact of the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU. Brexit, implementation of the resulting changes from the new agreement together with the outcome of future negotiations between the UK and EU on matters not fully addressed in it, could materially and adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes as well as the macro-economic environment in which the Group operates. Since the referendum, global markets and foreign exchange rates have experienced increased volatility, including a decline in the value of the pound sterling as compared with the euro and US dollar. Following the end of the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement, among other things, the UK no longer bene/fits from membership of the single EU market. Travel between the UK and EU countries now has some increased restrictions and border checks or other regulatory and system constraints may impede the rapid free movement of goods.\n\nOur workforce, and in turn our ability to recruit and retain talent, could be impacted by the new restrictions on the movement of persons. We could face new and greater costs and challenges if UK regulations and policies that govern our business diverge from those of the EU, or if there is any other new or increased friction in our trading environment. It therefore remains dif/ficult to anticipate the potential impact on our market share, sales, pro/fitability and results of operations as a result of Brexit.\n\nThe longer-term effects of Brexit remain dif/ficult to predict but could include further /financial instability and slower economic growth or economic downturn in the UK in particular, but also in Europe and the global economy. Restrictions on the movement of persons, deterioration in market access or trading terms, delay or restrictions to the movement of goods or increased cost and burdens in the form of new or diverging rules and regulations may have a signi/ficant adverse impact on our operations, pro/fitability and business model. Further, uncertainty around the form and timing of any future trading arrangements between the UK and other countries now that bene/fits of the EU's Free Trade Agreement network are no longer available to the UK could increase volatility and lead to adverse effects on the economy of the UK, other parts of Europe and the rest of the world, which in turn could have an adverse economic impact on our operations.\n\n## Failures or delays in the quality or execution of the Group's commercial strategies\n\nCommercial success of our products and markets, including the development of growth markets, is a critical factor in sustaining or increasing global Product Sales and replacing lost Product Sales due to patent expiry. The successful launch of a new pharmaceutical product involves substantial investment in sales and marketing activities, launch stocks and other items. We may ultimately be unable to achieve commercial success for various reasons, including dif/ficulties in manufacturing suf/ficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialisation in a timely manner, the impact of price control measures imposed by governments and healthcare authorities, the outcome of negotiations with third-party payers, erosion of IP rights (including infringement by third parties), failure to show a differentiated product pro/file and changes in prescribing habits.\n\nThe commercialisation of biologics is often more complex than for small molecule pharmaceutical products, primarily due to differences in the mode of administration, technical aspects of the product, and rapidly changing distribution and reimbursement environments.\n\nWe face particular challenges in Emerging Markets, including:\n\n- > More volatile economic conditions and/or political environments.\n- > Competition from multinational and local companies with existing market presence.\n- > Dif/ficulties enforcing and protecting IP.\n- > Inadequate protection against crime (including counterfeiting, corruption and fraud).\n- > Unauthorised or unregulated parallel imports.\n- > The need to impose developed market compliance standards.\n- > The need to meet a more diverse range of national regulatory, clinical, manufacturing and distribution requirements.\n- > Potential inadvertent breaches of local and international law and the need to manage sanctions and other restrictions that may be imposed in each jurisdiction.\n- > Possible geopolitical risks impacting trade and tariffs across connected markets.\n- > Recruitment of appropriately skilled and experienced personnel.\n- > Dif/ficulty in identifying the most effective sales and marketing channels and routes to market.\n- > Intervention by local or national governments or regulators, restricting market access and/or introducing adverse price controls and price referencing.\n- > Dif/ficulty in managing local arrangements, such as co-promotion and co-marketing, in terms of performance and adherence to AstraZeneca's compliance standards, which are often higher than the market norm.\n- > Dif/ficulties in cash repatriation due to strict foreign currency controls, risk of material currency devaluation and lack of hard currency reserves in some Emerging Markets.\n- > Complexity derived from direct exports to countries where we do not have a legal entity.\n\nFailure to execute our commercial strategies could materially adversely impact our business or results of operations.\n\nIf a new product does not succeed as anticipated or its rate of sales growth is slower than anticipated, there is a risk that we may be unable to fully recoup the costs incurred in launching it, which could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.\n\nDue to the complexity of the commercialisation process for biologics, the methods of distributing and marketing biologics could materially adversely impact our revenues from the sales of biologic medicines, such as Synagis and FluMist / Fluenz .\n\nThe failure to exploit potential opportunities appropriately in Emerging Markets or materialisation of the risks and challenges of doing business in such markets, including inadequate protection against crime (including counterfeiting, corruption and fraud) or inadvertent breaches of local and international law may materially adversely affect our reputation, business or results of operations.\n\nThe inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations may result in signi/ficant unexpected expenses or failure to realise anticipated bene/fits which may materially impact the results of operations.",

Such laws require us, among other things, to maintain reasonable and appropriate data security measures and to provide timely notice to individuals and/or regulators in the event that personal data is compromised.

For example, under the GDPR, /fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of a company's worldwide annual revenue of the previous /fiscal years (whichever is higher) can be imposed. Further, these laws are subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Many other countries where we operate are also enforcing their own laws more aggressively and/or adopting tougher new measures, aligning themselves to the updated EU privacy framework. The effects of such laws and regulations are potentially signi/ficant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses.\n\nAstraZeneca processes signi/ficant volumes of personal data, including sensitive data relating to health and genomics, which is subject to heightened protections and may attract increased attention under privacy laws. Personal data is used for drug development, sales and marketing, and managing our employees and contractors. As such, the ability to process personal data in a lawful and compliant manner is essential to achieving our stated business aims.\n\nDespite taking measures designed to ensure compliance with the applicable privacy laws by our personnel and associated third parties, non-compliance may still occur, potentially resulting in the imposition of signi/ficant penalties, such as /fines, orders to cease sharing or using personal data, or legal action on behalf of impacted individuals. Any of these impacts could materially adversely affect our reputation, business or results of operations, which in turn would further impact patient con/fidence in sharing further personal data with us. While the management of company-sensitive data (such as intellectual property) is subject to less regulation than personal data, failure to protect such data could similarly lead to a competitive disadvantage and a loss of trust from partners and other stakeholders, and ultimately prevent us from delivering against our strategic objectives. We or our third-party service providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers' business practices, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers' business, /financial condition and results of operations.",

AstraZeneca shares were listed on Nasdaq on 25 September 2020, prior to which they were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Ordinary Shares of $0.25 each in AstraZeneca PLC are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the shareholder register is maintained by Equiniti Limited, the Ordinary Share registrar. Shares listed on Nasdaq Stockholm are issued under the Euroclear Services Agreement by Euroclear Sweden AB, the Swedish Central Securities Depositary. Shares listed on Nasdaq are in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) issued by the Company's ADR depositary, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank). Deutsche Bank replaced Citibank, N.A. as the Company's ADR depositary on 6 February 2020. Two ADSs are equivalent to one Ordinary Share.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires companies to include in their annual report on Form 20-F /filed with the SEC, a report by management stating its responsibility for establishing internal control over /financial reporting and to assess annually the effectiveness of such internal control. We have complied with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to foreign private issuers.\n\nThe Board continues to believe that the Group has a sound corporate governance framework, good processes for the accurate and timely reporting of its /financial position and results of operations, and an effective and robust system of internal controls. We have established a Disclosure Committee, further details of which can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 118.\n\nThe Directors' assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over /financial reporting is set out in the Directors' Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting on page 169.\n\nWe are required to disclose any signi/ficant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies under the Nasdaq Corporate Governance Requirements. In addition, we must comply fully with the provisions of the Nasdaq Corporate Governance Requirements relating to the composition, responsibilities and operation of audit committees, applicable to foreign private issuers. These provisions incorporate the rules concerning audit committees implemented by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have reviewed the corporate governance practices required to be followed by US companies under the Nasdaq Corporate Governance Requirements and our corporate governance practices are generally consistent with those standards.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend dates for 2021 are shown in the /financial calendar on page 268. A /first interim dividend is normally announced in July/ August and paid in September and a second interim dividend is normally announced in January/February and paid in March. Dividends are paid in GBP, SEK and USD, depending on where the eligible shares are listed. Further information on dividends declared can be found in the Shareholder Information section of the website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\nShareholders holding Ordinary Shares directly may opt for dividends to be paid straight to their bank or building society account, rather than being paid by cheque. To elect for this swift and secure method of payment, contact the Ordinary Share registrar, visit www.shareview.co.uk or /fill in the mandate form that will be sent to you with your next dividend cheque. If you hold shares listed in Stockholm, you should contact your personal bank/broker or, if you hold a VP account, contact the bank that services your VP account. If you hold ADRs directly you should contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (the ADR transfer agent). If you hold your shares through a nominee, you should direct any queries relating to your shareholding and dividend payments to the nominee provider.\n\n## Shareholder communications\n\nCopies of shareholder communications and annual reports are available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com. If you hold Ordinary Shares directly, currently receive hard copies of shareholder communications and/or the annual report and would rather receive these documents electronically, you can manage your communication preferences at www.shareview.co.uk or by contacting the Ordinary Share registrar. If your record on the Ordinary Share register has been duplicated you may receive multiple copies of shareholder communications. If this is the case, please contact the Ordinary Share registrar so that this can be recti/fied.\n\nHolders of shares listed in Stockholm should contact Computershare AB, PO Box 5267, 102 46 Stockholm, Sweden (Tel: +46 (0)771 24 64 00) and holders of ADRs should contact the ADR depositary or their personal broker with queries relating to shareholder communications.\n\n## Shareview\n\nHolders of Ordinary Shares may create a portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk to view and manage their AstraZeneca shareholding. Shareview is a free and secure online service provided by the Ordinary Share registrar that allows users to, among other things, update personal details, manage communication preferences, view dividend information and manage direct dividend payments.\n\n## ShareGift\n\nShareholders that hold only a small number of shares, the value of which makes it uneconomical to sell them, may wish to consider donating them to charity through ShareGift, an independent charity share donation scheme (registered charity number 1052686). Further information about ShareGift can be found on its website at www.sharegift.org or by calling +44 (0)20 7930 3737.",

It is a public limited company domiciled in the UK. The Company's registered number is 2723534 and its registered of/fice is at 1 Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AA, UK (Tel: +44 (0)20 3749 5000). From February 1993 until April 1999, the Company was called Zeneca Group PLC. On 6 April 1999, the Company changed its name to AstraZeneca PLC.\n\nThe Company was formed when the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty chemical businesses of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC were demerged in 1993. In 1999, the Company sold the specialty chemical business. Also in 1999, the Company merged with Astra of Sweden. In 2000, it demerged the agrochemical business and merged it with the similar business of Novartis to form a new company called Syngenta AG. In 2007, the Group acquired MedImmune, a biologics and vaccines business based in the US.\n\nIn 1999, in connection with the merger between Astra and Zeneca, the Company's share capital was redenominated in US dollars. On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held.\n\nThis was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the Companies Act 1985. Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the sum arising as a result of the share cancellation credited to a special reserve, which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the record date. This US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.\n\nAt the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares for cash, at par. The Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights, no dividend rights and are capable of redemption, at par, at the option of the Company on the giving of seven days' written notice to the registered holder of the Redeemable Preference Shares.\n\nA total of 826 million Ordinary Shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the /final closing date, 21 May 1999. The Company received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6% of Astra's shares and the remaining 0.4% was acquired in 2000, for cash.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Articles enable the Directors to authorise any situation in which a Director has an interest that con/flicts or has the potential to con/flict with the Company's interests and which would otherwise be a breach of the Director's duty, under Section 175 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board has a formal system in place for Directors to declare such situations to be considered for authorisation by those Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered.\n\nIn deciding whether to authorise a situation, the non-con/flicted Directors must act in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company, and they may impose limits or conditions when giving the authorisation, or subsequently, if they think this is appropriate. Situations considered by the Board and authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of con/flicts maintained by the Company Secretary and are reviewed annually by the Board. The Board believes that this system operates effectively.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholder Information continued\n\n## Tax information for shareholders Taxation for US persons\n\nThe following summary of material UK and US federal income tax consequences of ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADRs held as capital assets by the US holders described below is based on current UK and US federal income tax law, including the US/UK double taxation convention relating to income and capital gains, which entered into force on 31 March 2003 (the Convention). This summary does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the US holders' particular circumstances and tax consequences applicable to US holders subject to special rules (such as certain /financial institutions, insurance companies, entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, persons whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is not the US dollar, tax-exempt entities, persons holding Ordinary Shares or ADRs as part of a straddle, hedge or integrated transaction, dealers or traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting, persons that own directly, indirectly or constructively ADRs or Ordinary Shares representing 10% or more of our voting power or value, persons subject to alternative minimum tax, persons subject to the Medicare contribution tax on 'net investment income', or persons holding Ordinary Shares or ADRs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the US). US holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the UK and US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in their particular circumstances.\n\nThis summary is based in part on representations of the depositary for ADRs and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement among the Company and the depositary and the holders from time to time of ADRs and any related agreements will be performed in accordance with its terms. The US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depositary shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary (pre-release), or intermediaries in the chain of ownership between holders and the issuer of the security underlying the American depositary shares, may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming, by US holders of American depositary shares, of foreign tax credits for US federal income tax purposes. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced tax rates, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders. Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rates for dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADRs are pre-released.\n\nFor the purposes of this summary, the term 'US holder' means a bene/ficial owner of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, for US federal income tax purposes, a citizen or resident of the US, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised in or under the laws of the US, any state in the US or the District of Columbia, or an estate or trust, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source.\n\nThis summary assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company, as discussed below.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a holder of ADRs generally will be treated as the owner of the underlying Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, deposits or withdrawals of Ordinary Shares for ADRs will not be subject to US federal income tax.\n\n## UK and US income taxation of dividends\n\nThe UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK company, such as the Company.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, distributions paid by the Company to a US holder are included in gross income as foreign source ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out of the Company's current or accumulated earnings and pro/fits, calculated in accordance with US federal income tax principles. The Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and pro/fits under US federal income tax principles and so it is expected that distributions generally will be reported to US holders as dividends. For any dividend paid in a foreign currency, the amount of the dividend will, in the case of ADRs, be the US dollar value of the foreign currency payment received by the depositary determined at the spot rate of the relevant foreign currency on the date the dividend is received by the depositary (or, in the case of Ordinary Shares, the US dollar value of the foreign currency payment received by the US holders, determined at the spot rate of the relevant foreign currency on the date the dividend is received by the US holders, regardless of whether the dividend is converted into US dollars). Dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to US corporations.\n\nIf the dividend is converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, US holders of Ordinary Shares generally should not be required to recognise foreign currency gains or losses in respect of the dividend income. They may have foreign currency gain or loss (which would be US source and taxable at the rates applicable to ordinary income) if the amount of such dividend is converted into US dollars after the date of its receipt.\n\nSubject to applicable limitations and the discussion above regarding concerns expressed by the US Treasury, dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs may be taxable at favourable US federal income tax rates. US holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules which may limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates.\n\n## Taxation on capital gains\n\nUnder present English law, individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK, and companies which are not resident in the UK, will not be liable for UK tax on capital gains made on the disposal of their Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless such Ordinary Shares or ADRs are held in connection with a trade, profession or vocation carried on in the UK through a branch or agency or other permanent establishment.\n\nA US holder will generally recognise US source capital gains or losses for US federal income tax purposes on the sale or exchange of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar amount realised and such holder's US dollar tax basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADRs. US holders should consult their own tax advisers about the treatment of capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income for non-corporate US holders, and capital losses, the deductibility of which may be subject to limitations.\n\n## Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) rules\n\nWe believe that we were not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for the year ended 31 December 2020. However, since PFIC status depends on the composition of our income and assets, and the market value of our assets (including, among others, less than 25% owned equity investments), from time to time, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which Ordinary Shares or ADRs were held, certain adverse tax consequences could apply to US holders.",

        "page_content": "## Information reporting and backup withholding\n\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the US or through certain US-related /financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless: (i) the US holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient; or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, the US holder provides a correct taxpayer identi/fication number and certi/fies that it is not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a US holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder's US federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely supplied to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nCertain US holders who are individuals (or certain speci/fied entities) may be required to report information relating to securities issued by non-US persons (or foreign accounts through which the securities are held), generally on IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for securities held in accounts maintained by US /financial institutions). US holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nUnder the current Double Taxation (Estates) Convention (the Estate Tax Convention) between the US and the UK, Ordinary Shares or ADRs held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US, and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK, will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual's death or on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs during the individual's lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a /fixed base situated in the UK. Where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs have been placed in trust by a settlor who, at the time of settlement, was a US-domiciled shareholder, the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the time of settlement, was a UK national, or the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a /fixed base situated in the UK. In the exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for double taxation to be relieved by means of credit relief.\n\n## UK stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty\n\nA charge to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) may arise on the deposit of Ordinary Shares in connection with the creation of ADRs. The rate of stamp duty or SDRT will generally be 1.5% of the value of the consideration or, in some circumstances, the value of the Ordinary Shares. HMRC accept that this is a breach of EU law and there is no 1.5% SDRT charge on the issue of Ordinary Shares (or, where it is integral to the raising of new capital, the transfer of Ordinary Shares) into the ADR arrangement and it was con/firmed in the Autumn 2017 Budget that the Government intend to continue this approach following Brexit.\n\nNo UK stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition or transfer of existing ADRs provided that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is executed outside the UK and remains at all times outside the UK. An agreement for the transfer of ADRs will not give rise to a liability for SDRT.\n\nA transfer of, or an agreement to transfer, Ordinary Shares will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or SDRT at 0.5% of the amount or value of any consideration, provided, in the case of stamp duty, it is rounded up to the nearest \u00a35.\n\nTransfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST will generally not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT, unless such a transfer is made for a consideration in money or money's worth, in which case a liability to SDRT will arise, usually at the rate of 0.5% of the value of the consideration. Paperless transfers of Ordinary Shares within CREST are generally liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the value of the consideration. CREST is obliged to collect SDRT from the purchaser on relevant transactions settled within the system.\n\n## Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders\n\nThere are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the UK restricting the import or export of capital or affecting the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs.\n\nThere are no limitations under English law or the Articles on the right of non-resident or foreign owners to be the registered holders of, or to exercise voting rights in relation to, Ordinary Shares or ADRs or to be registered holders of notes or debentures of the Company or its wholly owned subsidiary, Zeneca Wilmington Inc.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nThe following information relating to average and spot exchange rates used by AstraZeneca is provided for convenience:\n\n|                                                                                 | SEK/USD                                                                         | USD/GBP                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Average rates   (statement of comprehensive income,   statement of cash /flows) | Average rates   (statement of comprehensive income,   statement of cash /flows) | Average rates   (statement of comprehensive income,   statement of cash /flows) |\n| 2020                                                                            | 9.3184                                                                          | 1.2763                                                                          |\n| 2019                                                                            | 9.3980                                                                          | 1.2678                                                                          |\n| 2018                                                                            | 8.6419                                                                          | 1.3405                                                                          |\n| End of year spot rates   (statement of /financial position)                     |                                                                                 |                                                                                 |\n| 2020                                                                            | 8.1999                                                                          | 1.3650                                                                          |\n| 2019                                                                            | 9.3550                                                                          | 1.3133                                                                          |\n| 2018                                                                            | 8.9537                                                                          | 1.2743                                                                          |",

The Group's subsidiaries and their locations are set out in Group Subsidiaries and Holdings in the Financial Statements from page 234.\n\n## Branches and countries in which the Group conducts business\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, we disclose below our subsidiary companies that have representative or scienti/fic branches/ of/fices outside the UK:\n\n- > AstraZeneca UK Limited: Algeria (scienti/fic of/fice), Angola, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Dubai (branch of/fice), Georgia, Ghana (scienti/fic of/fice), Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia (scienti/fic of/fice), Serbia, Slovenia (branch of/fice), Syria, Ukraine and Yemen (scienti/fic of/fice)\n- > AstraZeneca AB: Egypt (scienti/fic of/fice) and Slovakia (branch of/fice)\n- > AstraZeneca Singapore Pte Limited: Vietnam\n- > Astra Export & Trading AB: United Arab Emirates (branch of/fice).\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nThe Directors who held of/fice at the date of approval of this Annual Report con/firm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern accounting basis\n\nInformation on the business environment in which AstraZeneca operates, including the factors underpinning the industry's future growth prospects, is included in the Strategic Report. Details of the product portfolio of the Group are contained in both the Strategic Report (in the Therapy Area Review from page 30) and the Directors' Report. Information on patent expiry dates for key marketed products is included in Patent Expiries of Key Marketed Products from page 251. Our approach to product development and our development pipeline are also covered in detail with additional information by therapy area in the Strategic Report.\n\nThe /financial position of the Group, its cash /flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review\n\nfrom page 82. In addition, Note 27 to the Financial Statements from page 219 includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing capital; /financial risk management objectives; details of its /financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. Further details of the Group's cash balances and borrowings are included in Notes 16 and 18 to the Financial Statements from page 204.\n\nHaving assessed the Principal Risks and other matters considered in connection with the Viability statement on page 78, the Board considers it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.\n\n## Shares\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Issued share capital, shareholdings and share prices on page 269.\n\nA shareholders' resolution was passed at the 2020 AGM authorising the Company to purchase its own shares. The Company did not purchase any of its own shares in 2020. On 31 December 2020, the Company did not hold any shares in treasury.\n\n## Rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to shares\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Company had 1,312,668,724 Ordinary Shares and 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares in issue. The Ordinary Shares represent 99.98% and the Redeemable Preference Shares represent 0.02% of the Company's total share capital (these percentages have been calculated by reference to the 8am WM/Reuters USD/GBP exchange rate on 31 December 2020).\n\nAs agreed by the shareholders at the Company's AGM held on 29 April 2010, the Articles were amended with immediate effect to remove the requirement for the Company to have an authorised share capital, the concept of which was abolished under the Companies Act 2006. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to vote at general meetings of the Company. The rights and restrictions attaching to the Redeemable Preference Shares differ from those attaching to Ordinary Shares as follows:\n\n- > The Redeemable Preference Shares carry no rights to receive dividends.\n- > The holders of Redeemable Preference Shares have no rights to receive notices of, attend or vote at general meetings except in certain limited circumstances. They have one vote for every 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares held.\n- > On a distribution of assets of the Company, on a winding-up or other return of capital (subject to certain exceptions), the holders of Redeemable Preference Shares have priority over the holders of Ordinary Shares to receive the capital paid up on those shares.\n\n- > Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has the right to redeem the Redeemable Preference Shares at any time on giving not less than seven days' written notice.\n\nThere are no speci/fic restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company, which is governed by the Articles and prevailing legislation.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares or that may result in restrictions on voting rights. The Company is also not aware of any arrangements under which /financial rights are held by a person other than the holder of the shares.\n\n## Action necessary to change the rights of shareholders\n\nIn order to vary the rights attached to any class of shares, the consent in writing of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of such holders is required.\n\n## Changes in share capital\n\nChanges in the Company's Ordinary Share capital during 2020, including details of the allotment of new shares under the Company's share plans, are given in Note 24 to the Financial Statements on page 217.\n\n## Directors' and officers' shareholdings\n\nAt 31 January 2021, the total amount of the Company's voting securities owned by Directors and of/ficers of the Company was:\n\n| Title of class   | Amount   owned   |   Percentage  of class |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Ordinary Shares  | 582,432          |                   0.04 |\n\n## Options to purchase securities from registrant or subsidiaries\n\n(a) At 31 January 2021, options outstanding to subscribe for Ordinary Shares were:\n\n| Number of shares   | Subscription  price (pence)   | Normal expiry date   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 1,234,490          | 3307-6839                     | 2020-2026            |\n\nThe weighted average subscription price of options outstanding at 31 January 2021 was 5386 pence. All options were granted under Company employee share schemes.\n\n(b) Included in paragraph (a) are options granted to of/ficers of the Company as follows:\n\n|   Number of shares |   Subscription  price (pence) |   Normal expiry date |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n|                526 |                          6839 |                 2024 |\n\n(c) During 2020, no options were held by Directors.\n\nDuring the period 1 January 2021 to 31 January 2021, no Director was granted or exercised any options.",

Two employee share trusts, AstraZeneca Employee Bene/fit Trust and AstraZeneca Share Retention Trust, waived their rights to a dividend on the Ordinary Shares they hold and instead received nominal dividends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Financial calendar on page 268.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nAstraZeneca PLC's current Articles were adopted by shareholders at the Company's AGM held on 18 May 2018. Any amendment to the Articles requires the approval of shareholders by a special resolution at a general meeting of the Company.\n\n## Objects\n\nThe Company's objects are unrestricted.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Board has the authority to manage the business of the Company, for example, through powers to allot and repurchase its shares, subject where required to shareholder resolutions. Subject to certain exceptions, Directors do not have power to vote at Board meetings on matters in which they have a material interest.\n\nThe quorum for meetings of the Board is a majority of the full Board, of whom at least four must be Non-Executive Directors. In the absence of a quorum, the Directors do not have power to determine compensation arrangements for themselves or any member of the Board.\n\nThe Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money. Variation of these borrowing powers would require the passing of a special resolution of the Company's shareholders.\n\nAll Directors must retire from of/fice at the Company's AGM each year and may present themselves for election or re-election. Directors are not prohibited, upon reaching a particular age, from submitting themselves for election or re-election.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Directors, see Board of Directors on pages 104 and 105.\n\n## General meetings\n\nAGMs require 21 clear days' notice to shareholders. Subject to the Companies Act 2006, other general meetings require 14 clear days' notice.\n\nFor all general meetings, a quorum of two shareholders present in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the business transacted, is required unless each of the two persons present is a corporate representative of the same corporation, or each of the two persons present is a proxy of the same shareholder.\n\nShareholders and their duly appointed proxies and corporate representatives are entitled to be admitted to general meetings.\n\n## Limitations on the rights to own shares\n\nThere are no limitations on the rights to own shares.",

This includes engagement with our employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders, as well as the impact of our operations on the community and environment.\n\nInformation on how we encourage employee involvement in the Company's performance is set out in A culture of high performance on page 69. Details of some of the employee share plans are described in the Directors' Remuneration Report from page 131, and in Note 28 to the Financial Statements from page 225. All employees are provided with information on matters of concern to them through regular meetings and updates on the Group's intranet and internal social media. Townhall meetings and Q&A sessions hosted by members of senior management, including the SET, are broadcast on internal social media. During 2020, these broadcasts included business updates, as well as information on the Group's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and working arrangements. In addition, information on the Group's quarterly results are shared with employees through the intranet and internal social media. These updates inform employees of the /financial and economic factors which affect the performance of the Company.\n\n## Political donations\n\nNeither the Company nor its subsidiaries made any EU political donations or incurred any EU political expenditure in 2020 and they do not intend to do so in the future in respect of which shareholder authority is required, or for which disclosure in this Annual Report is required, under the Companies Act 2006. However, to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to continue to support interest groups or lobbying organisations concerned with the review of government policy or law reform without inadvertently breaching the Companies Act 2006, which de/fines political donations and other political expenditure in broad terms, a resolution will be put to shareholders at the 2021 AGM, similar to that passed at the 2020 AGM, to authorise the Company and its subsidiaries to:\n\n- > make donations to political parties or independent election candidates\n- > make donations to political organisations other than political parties\n- > incur political expenditure, up to an aggregate limit of $250,000.\n\nCorporate political contributions in the US are permitted in de/fined circumstances under the First Amendment of the US Constitution and are subject to both federal and state laws and regulations. In 2020, the Group's US legal entities made contributions amounting in aggregate to $1,016,550 (2019: $1,120,525) to national political organisations, state-level political party committees and to campaign committees of various state candidates. No corporate donations were made at the federal level and all contributions were made only where allowed by US federal and state law. We publicly disclose details of our corporate US political contributions, which can be found on our website, www.astrazeneca-us.com/ sustainability/corporate-transparency.\n\nThe annual corporate contributions budget is reviewed and approved by the US VicePresident, Corporate Affairs and the President of our US business to ensure robust governance and oversight. US citizens or individuals holding valid green cards exercised decision making over the contributions and the funds were not provided or reimbursed by any non-US legal entity.

This is AstraZeneca's /first report that follows the TCFD-recognised framework and it describes our process and actions as of 31 December 2020. All our business operations worldwide are in scope regardless of their function, unless otherwise stated. A full TCFD disclosure will be provided according to the Listing Rule for the 2021 reporting year onwards.\n\nOur CDP response provides further disclosures on our approach to climate change and is available at https://www.cdp.net/en.\n\n## Governance\n\nNon-Executive Director, Genevi\u00e8ve Berger, oversees our sustainability strategy on behalf of the Board, including delivery of our Ambition Zero Carbon programme, and evaluates our performance against our targets and commitments.\n\nAs outlined on page 6, our CEO is responsible to the Board for the management, development and performance of our business, including AstraZeneca's Ambition Zero Carbon and climate-related risks and opportunities. Reporting to the CEO, the Executive VicePresident (EVP), Sustainability and Chief Compliance Of/ficer (CCO) is responsible for the delivery of the AstraZeneca sustainability strategy, including our climate-related strategy and leads a quarterly update with the Board.\n\nA number of strategic groups have been established to support delivery of our sustainability and climate strategies:\n\n- > An external Sustainability Advisory Board (SAB) advises on strategic direction, recommends opportunities and provides insight. Our SAB comprises /five SET members (EVP, Sustainability and CCO; EVP, Operations and IT; EVP, Human Resources; EVP & President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D; and EVP & President, International) and four external sustainability experts (Pankaj Bhatia, Deputy Director, Climate Program, World Resources Institute; Dame Polly Courtice, Director, Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, University of Cambridge; Louise Nicholls, Managing Director of Suseco and Vice Chair of IEMA; and Rain Henderson, Founder, Elementor Advisors). The SAB met once in 2020 where an update was provided on our climate strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see our Sustainability Report available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n\n- > In 2020, we established an Ambition Zero Carbon Governance Group with executivelevel ownership, accountable for the delivery of our Ambition Zero Carbon programme. The group meets monthly and includes AstraZeneca's CEO; CFO; the EVP, Sustainability and CCO; and EVP, Operations and IT.\n- > In 2020, a TCFD steering group was also established with cross-functional membership to identify and proactively manage the physical and transitional risks and opportunities posed to AstraZeneca by climate change. The Board was updated on progress in September 2020.\n\nThe outcomes from the specialist groups are regularly reported to the AstraZeneca Board.\n\n## Identifying and managing climate risk and opportunity\n\nOur overall approach to risk management and a summary of our Principal Risks can be found from page 80. To inform the wider enterprise risk management process of any speci/fic risks and opportunities posed by climate change and/or the transition to a low carbon economy, we have integrated climate assessments into the overall risk management process. In 2020, we conducted physical and transitional risk assessments and the process for these assessments is described below.\n\n## Physical assessment\n\nIn 2020, working with environmental resource managements experts, ERM Group, Inc, (ERM), we conducted a screening study of two future climatic scenarios to explore our physical climate-related risks (/floods, water scarcity, extreme heat, cyclones and wild /fires); Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 (+2\u00b0C) and RCP 8.5 (+4\u00b0C) were used for this study. These scenarios were applied to 61 AstraZeneca sites with predictions out from 2020 to 2030 and 2050. The sites evaluated included all businesscritical operations sites, R&D Hubs, IT centres and other strategic hubs; pure commercial sites were out of scope as they posed a low material risk. The outcome of these screening studies across the 61 sites was combined with a revenue-based assessment for each site to identify medium- to long-term risks.\n\n## Transitional assessment\n\nIn 2020, working with ERM we de/fined the risks and opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. To measure these transitional risks, we adopted two scenarios; a base case (~3.5\u00b0C) and low carbon (~2\u00b0C) scenario with predictions out to 2025, 2030, 2035 and 2040. Risks and opportunities were assessed at an enterprise level and product-speci/fic level for the top ten brands where life-cycle assessment (LCA) data is available, representing approximately 50% of Total Revenue with examples from all therapy areas.\n\n## Outcome of the physical and transitional assessments\n\nAs a result of this analysis, a new risk 'Failure to meet regulatory expectations on environmental impact, including climate change' has been added as a standalone risk to the Group's risk landscape. This risk has been shared with the Board and Audit Committee. The risk is not currently assessed to be /financially material and does not impact our current business model. In many cases mitigation measures are already in place to address the risks and opportunities presented by climate change, including the transition to a low carbon economy. These risks and opportunities are explained in more detail in the table opposite/overleaf.\n\n## Climate change and our strategy\n\nThe nature of the risks and opportunities we face depends not only on the physical aspects of climate change, but also changes in the regulations in the markets in which we operate, pressures to reduce the carbon footprints of speci/fic medicinal products, and our ability to understand and shape a culture of climate action. Our response to the identi/fied climate risks and opportunities requires enterprise-wide action, in addition to further integration of environmental considerations in drug development and manufacture, and a greater focus on responsible procurement and sourcing across the entire value chain.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of AstraZeneca's business operations on the environment, the Board of Directors approved a new climate strategy in 2019. Our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy was launched in January 2020 when we disclosed new targets to be zero carbon across our global operations by 2025 (Scopes 1 and 2) and be carbon negative across our entire value chain by 2030 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3). Ambition Zero Carbon goes beyond the veri/fied reduction goals of our existing Scope 1 and 2 Science Based Targets to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. To support achievement of Ambition Zero Carbon we will double energy productivity, use 100% renewable energy for both power and heat, and switch to a 100% electric vehicle /fleet /five years ahead of schedule. Our actions to tackle climate change include plans to launch next-generation near-zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) respiratory inhalers and plant 50 million trees under the 'AZ Forest' programme. Overall, the $1 billion Ambition Zero Carbon programme brings forward our decarbonisation plans by more than a decade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our GHG footprint, see our Sustainability Report available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.",

The Company and its Directors, employees, agents and advisers do not accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom this Annual Report is shown or into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed. In order, among other things, to utilise the 'safe harbour' provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the UK Companies Act 2006, we are providing the following cautionary statement:\n\nThis Annual Report contains certain forwardlooking statements with respect to the operations, performance and /financial condition of the Group, including, among other things, statements about expected revenues, margins, earnings per share or other /financial or other measures. Forwardlooking statements are statements relating to the future which are based on information available at the time such statements are made, including information relating to risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report are based on reasonable assumptions, the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements may be in/fluenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those predicted. The forward-looking statements re/flect knowledge and information available at the date of the preparation of this Annual Report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. We identify the forward-looking statements by using the words 'anticipates', 'believes', 'expects', 'intends' and similar expressions in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, certain of which are beyond our control, include, among other things:\n\n- > the risk of failure or delay in delivery of pipeline or launch of new medicines\n- > the risk of failure to meet regulatory or ethical requirements for medicine development or approval\n- > the risk of failure to obtain, defend and enforce effective intellectual property (IP) protection and IP challenges by third parties\n- > the impact of competitive pressures including expiry or loss of IP rights, and generic competition\n- > the impact of price controls and reductions\n- > the impact of economic, regulatory and political pressures\n\n- > the impact of uncertainty and volatility in relation to the UK's exit from the EU\n- > the risk of failures or delays in the quality or execution of our commercial strategies\n- > the risk of failure to maintain supply of compliant, quality medicines\n- > the risk of illegal trade in our medicines\n- > the impact of reliance on third-party goods and services\n- > the risk of failure in information technology, data protection or cybercrime\n- > the risk of failure of critical processes\n- > any expected gains from productivity initiatives are uncertain\n- > the risk of failure to attract, develop, engage and retain a diverse, talented and capable workforce, including following the Alexion transaction\n- > the risk of failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations\n- > the risk of the safety and ef/ficacy of marketed medicines being questioned\n- > the risk of adverse outcome of litigation and/or governmental investigations, including relating to the Alexion transaction\n- > the risk of failure to adhere to increasingly stringent anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation\n- > the risk of failure to achieve strategic plans or meet targets or expectations\n- > the risk of failure in /financial control or the occurrence of fraud\n- > the risk of unexpected deterioration in our /financial position\n- > the impact that the COVID-19 global pandemic may have or continue to have on these risks, on our ability to continue to mitigate these risks, and on our operations, /financial results or /financial condition\n- > the risk that a condition to the closing of the transaction with Alexion may not be satis/fied, or that a regulatory approval that may be required for the transaction is delayed or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated\n- > the risk that we are unable to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the Alexion transaction, or that we are unable to promptly and effectively integrate Alexion's businesses\n- > and the risk that management's time and attention are diverted on transactionrelated issues or that disruption from the Alexion transaction makes it more dif/ficult to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships.\n\nCertain of these factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report including, without limitation, in the Risk section from page 254 of this Annual Report. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a pro/fit forecast.\n\n## Inclusion of Reported performance, Core financial measures and constant exchange rate growth rates\n\nAstraZeneca's determination of non-GAAP measures together with our presentation of them within our /financial information may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies.\n\n## Statements of competitive position, growth rates and sales\n\nIn this Annual Report, except as otherwise stated, market information regarding the position of our business or products relative to its or their competition is based upon published statistical sales data for the 12 months ended 30 September 2020 obtained from IQVIA, a leading supplier of statistical data to the pharmaceutical industry. Unless otherwise noted, for the US, dispensed new or total prescription data and audited sales data are taken, respectively, from IQVIA National Prescription Audit and IQVIA National Sales Perspectives for the 12 months ended 31 December 2020; such data are not adjusted for Medicaid and similar rebates. Except as otherwise stated, these market share and industry data from IQVIA have been derived by comparing our sales revenue with competitors' and total market sales revenues for that period, and except as otherwise stated, growth rates are given at CER. For the purposes of this Annual Report, unless otherwise stated, references to the world pharmaceutical market or similar phrases are to the 50 countries contained in the IQVIA database, which amounted to approximately 94% (in value) of the countries audited by IQVIA. Changes in data subscriptions, exchange rates and subscription coverage, as well as restated IQVIA data, have led to the restatement of total market values for prior years.\n\n## AstraZeneca websites\n\nInformation on or accessible through our websites, including www.astrazeneca.com, and www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com and on any websites referenced in this Annual Report, does not form part of and is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## External/third-party websites\n\nInformation on or accessible through any third-party or external website does not form part of and is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## Figures\n\nFigures in parentheses in tables and in the Financial Statements are used to represent negative numbers.",
