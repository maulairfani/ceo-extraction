        "page_content": "## Chapter 1  Letter to Shareholders\n\nDear shareholders,\n\nInfluenced by COVID-19 in 2020, China, known as a global manufacturing power, was first in lockdown, and then other countries were also affected, resulting into a slowdown in global economic development. The IMF released at the beginning of this year that the global economic growth shrank 3.5 percent last year. Although  there  is  still  no  significant  downward  trend  of  the  epidemic,  with  the  development  and popularization  of  vaccines,  it  should  be  effectively  controlled  and  relieved.  It  is  predicted  that  global economic activity will return to the pre-epidemic level this year. In the face of the impact of the epidemic, AcBel Polytech Inc. picked up the pace of development. Although it was greatly affected at the beginning of 2020, thanks to communication with external stakeholders and rapid internal adjustment, the Company gradually regained its footing in the second half of the year and achieved growth in revenue and profit for the  whole  year.  We  hereby  report  to  our  shareholders  the  annual  operating  results  for  2020  and  the operating prospect for 2021.\n\n## 2020 Operating Results\n\nThe revenue for the whole year reached NT$20.983 billion, 1.94 percent up from the previous year. Net profit after tax was also boosted by the sale of land to NT$1.313 billion. Earnings per share after tax was NT$2.54.\n\nAcBel Electronic (Wuhan) was closed down by COVID-19 at the beginning of the year. In the first wave of the epidemic,  it  quickly  developed  countermeasures,  including  personnel  protection,  personnel management, supply chain investigation, customer communication, to strengthen its own conditions. The epidemic has changed some patterns of industry and the transfer of the end market, such as home office, teleconferences and other opportunities, which also drive the shipments of laptops, servers, and memory. In 2020, AcBel obtained the bidding project of a total of 316,000 meters. So far, it has shipped nearly 400,000 meters.  It  will  continue  to  develop  technologies  and  capabilities  in  the  field  of  smart  grids  in  line  with policies.  In  terms  of  green  energy  layout,  the  Company  also  achieved  great  results,  with  the  cumulative amount of solar power generation field reaching 137MWp, of which 36MWp has been completed. In terms of  electric  vehicle-related  products,  the  Company  has  co-developed  motor  drivers  with  leading  large manufacturers, and also cooperated with well-known electric vehicle manufacturers to cut into the power management system of power switching plant, thus becoming a comprehensive integrated power service platform.\n\nAcBel has also been recognized for its efforts in corporate governance and corporate social responsibility. We  have  won  the  Taiwan  Corporate  Sustainability  Report  Awards  -  Platinum  Award  for  Electronic Information Manufacturing, Excellent Enterprise - Innovation and Growth Award, Excellent Enterprise Climate Change Award in the \"2020 TCSA Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Award\", and become the first to  pass  the  TCFD  Maturity  Model  Verification  [Excellent  -  Highest  Level]  in  the  global  electronics industry,  demonstrating  our  commitment  to  giving  back  to  the  community  and  implementing  corporate social responsibility.\n\n## Business Environment and Development Strategies\n\nAcBel upholds the commitment of \" We Power the World with Sustainable/Renewable Energy and High Efficiency Power Supply \", will take its own research and development efficiency as the core in the future, join  the  concept  of  providing  positive  energy  of  the  earth,  and  strive  to  create  the  maximum  value  for customers,  employees  and  shareholders.  In  combination  of  strong  R&D  momentum,  we  step  into  the application of the areas of clean energy, solar power plant, medical equipment and electric vehicle related power products, with a view to become the innovative leading company of smart green energy in the power industry.",

The Company's sales of power supply products are expected to be 77,637 units this year. In the fuel cell power supply sector, as the global market share of key international customers increases, AcBel plans to expand its production capacity in Taiwan to drive its performance of the hardware power supply products to increase year by year. At present, in addition to power supply products, we are also  engaged  in  power  supply  system  integration  and  assembly  business,  so  as  to  improve  the  overall shipment margin and revenue scale.\n\nThe construction of our new plant in Tamsui commenced in early January 2020, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021 and to be officially put into operation in the first quarter of 2022. By then, the Company will fully introduce the intelligent production line, which is expected to contribute a capacity of 2.5 billion to increase revenue and profit. The old site will be demolished and rebuilt after the new plant comes online, which is expected to be put into mass production in the next 2~3 years.\n\nGoing forward, we will focus on the technological deepening of 5G communication, vehicle power supply, aerospace power supply, high-end consumer and medical power supply with forward-looking application technologies,  demonstrating  our  strong  ambition  and  constant  self-requirements  and  challenges  in forward-looking technology development.\n\nWish all shareholders.\n\nGood health and good luck.\n\nAcBel Polytech Inc.\n\nChairman: Hsu Sheng-Hsiung\n\nManager: Hsu Chieh-Li\n\nChief Accountant: Yeh Jin-Mao",

        "page_content": "## (II) Industrial Overview\n\n- 1. The Current Status and Development of the Industry\n\nThe  Power  Supply  is  designed  to  provide  stable  power  supply  with  appropriate  voltage  or  current  for electronic  products,  and  is  one  of  the  indispensable  functional  components.  According  to  the  different functions and basic structure of products, it can be divided into two categories: Linear Power Supply (LPS) and Switching Power Supply (SPS).\n\nThe advantages to use SPS include providing products with low loss, small volume, lightweight, which is in  line  with  the  development  trend  of  light,  thin  and  short  terminal  products  and  energy-saving  and environmental protection, and providing a wider range of external imputable voltages than an LPS, and providing the performance of higher power density/conversion efficiency, all of which contribute to wider application  scope.  The  scope  of  products  includes  chargers,  rectifiers,  converters,  inverters  and    an Uninterrupted Power System (UPS).\n\nAt present, domestic SPS manufacturers are facing low price competition from Chinese manufacturers in the  PC  and  consumer  electronic  device  charger  market.  Together  with  the  saturated  PC  market, manufacturers are facing an environment with severe challenges. In terms of data center application, as affected by the epidemic, the construction layout was restricted this year. However, the market for servers and Networking and Telecom products is still booming due to the development of 5G and the demand for work from home and web-based conferencing due to the epidemic. The transfer of most customer orders to Taiwan under the condition of risks hedging as a result of the trade war between China and the United States,  the  United  States  sanctions  to  ban  Huawei  and  SMIC  from  the  American  market  and  the digitization  of  energy  vehicles  have  further  caused  the  market  panic  and  material  market  shortage.  The change of the external environment stimulates the traditional electronics industry to be a hot industry. As the Company is located in the technology island Taiwan, an adequate supply chain is available for us to provide complete solutions to various emerging industries. With mature AI, further integration of IoT into a  new  generation  of  AIoT  applications  and  the  introduction  of 5G,  in  addition  to  traditional  computing center  applications,  Open  Source  IT  servers  and  Networking  and  Telecom  equipment  will  be  further applied to 5G infrastructure to meet the needs of Edge Computing. Global data center hardware demand is expected to continue to grow. Under the steady growth of the global server and communication equipment market, domestic SPS manufacturers have shifted their product strategies to develop servers, workstations, and  power  suppliers  for  Networking  and  Telecom  equipment  in  recent  years.  The  application  of  such power supplies has led to a trend towards commodity standardization, resulting in lower barriers to enter the  market  and  fiercer  competition  than  ever  before.  In  the  low-end  SME  market,  some  Chinese manufacturers  also  began  to  develop  related  products  and  conduct  a  low-price  competition.  However, affected  by  the  intensified  trade  war  between  China  and  the  United  States,  telecoms  vendors  change  to adopt open hardware due to information security factors in the 5G infrastructure equipment market and data center equipment market in Europe and the United States. It is expected that in the future, domestic SPS manufacturers will compete in the open hardware market for telecommunications and surveillance, as well as in the high-end and mid-end market, in addition to the mid-end and low-end standardized product market  in  the  professional  application  fields  such  as  servers,  storage  and  Networking  and  Telecom equipment.  Furthermore,  manufacturers  are  also  investing  in  product  development  of  the  green  energy conversion market, which was formerly dominated by European, American and Japanese manufacturers, expecting to find new outlets through the extension of power electronics technology.\n\nThe infrastructure of a data center includes servers, switches, storage, routers, and communications power. In particular, the demand for power supply of routers and switches is growing continuously. In terms of high-end and mid-end power supply, while the power supply and power density are increasing, the Power Factor (PF), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and conversion efficiency of power supply has become the basic technical indexes of power supply. Meanwhile, new applications such as IT equipment power supply, edge  computing  server  power  supply,  cabinet-level  power  supply,  integrated  HVDC  input,  48V  DC input/output,  PoE  and  integrated  backup  batteries  applied  to  5G  infrastructure  are  the  direction  of technology development.\n\nWith society gradually entering an aging society, the demand for personal home care and various medical equipment used in hospitals has also increased. In addition, the wide application of the cloud has deepened the  integration  of  medical  products  with  the  cloud  application.  In  recent  years,  domestic  medical manufacturers  have  combined  medical  products  with  cloud  monitoring,  making  home  care  more accessible.  Therefore,  the  application  of  medical  products  has  gradually  expanded  from  medical institutions to home use, as a result, the medical product market is growing year by year. If the standard product can be horizontally constructed, there will be more application opportunities in the future.\n\nIn  addition  to  medical  care,  the  fitness  craze  has  been  on  the  rise  in  recent  years.  Under  the  epidemic, physical gyms have closed down one after another, and consumers are turning to purchase equipment to exercise  at  home,  accelerating  the  replacement  of  traditional  fitness  equipment  with  smart  fitness",

        "page_content": "equipment. Different from traditional fitness equipment, smart fitness equipment provides more interactive functions through the integration of 3C electronic technology, and integrates online community to increase consumers' willingness to use and stickiness. Going digital and smart also brings business opportunities for power supplies. Microcomputers, tablets and large screens that provide interactive functions and motors that simulate real motion all require extra power to drive.\n\nIn terms of personal electronic devices, the emergence of new USB Type-C and USB PD, QC, PPS and other universal external power supply/charger supporting variable voltage, USB Type-C interface terminals have  become  a  standard  in  consumer  electronic  products.  With  the  demand  for  fast  charging  and  the maturity of new components, the power density of high-end products has exceeded 1W/CC, and the power has also moved up from 10W-20W to 65W or even higher, and the output terminals have also increased from  one  group  to  multiple  groups.  Moreover,  with  the  hot  news  that  the  European  Union  has  been working on a regulation that would require smartphones to be shipped without chargers in their boxes, and some mobile phone companies have taken the lead in cancel charger to be packed in the box in 2020, we will continue to observe whether other brands will follow up in the future. If such states become a trend, the production and marketing mode of chargers must be substantially changed.\n\nIn  the  smart  grid  market,  the  demand  for  smart  meters  is  increasing  due  to  energy  shortages  and  rising environmental awareness. Teclast is also accelerating the deployment of smart meters, including meters, communication solutions and data processing platforms. And the Company has also started to deploy the market of smart meters in Southeast Asia, where the market is growing.\n\nThe Company integrates multiple smart solutions, such as energy gateways, renewable energy and energy storage  equipment,  and  digitizes  and  visualizes  all  devices  to  generate  various  services  creating  a  new business model. As a result, a number of energy management system (EMS) solutions have emerged on the market, offering an operating model in addition to device sales. In an era when everything is connected to the Internet, the digitization and intelligence of energy products are unstoppable.\n\nWith the development of AI artificial intelligence, 5G communication system, edge computing and cloud computing  technology,  and  based  on  the  overall  strategy  for  innovation  and  development  of  the  new generation  of  the  data  center,  the  requirements  of  high  power,  high  integration,  modular  and  open computing  architecture  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  design  of  data  center,  which  requires  more common power modules and shell design to the data center. At present, most of the inverter systems in the mainstream  market  adopt  a  centralized  design.  However,  the  design  concept  of  the  modular  and expandable  shell  will  innovate  the  application  of  inverter  systems  in  the  data  center,  and  such  design thinking is also the future trend of related inverter products.\n\n- 2. The Links between the Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream Segments of the Industry Supply Chain Links between upstream raw materials and the industry\n\nThe main raw materials of switching power supply can be broadly classified as active components, passive components,  magnetic  components,  other  electronic  components,  housing  and  printed  circuit  boards. Control  ICs  for  active  components  and  power  semiconductors  are  mostly  supplied  from  the  USA  and Japan, while passive components and magnetic materials, except for special cores for transformers, can be made at home, which is rather highly homemade in domestic electronics industry. On the other hand, as the power management function becomes more and more important in the future, Micro Controller or DSP chip will become an indispensable key component in the application of high-end power supply. Links between downstream application products and switching power supplies\n\nSwitching power supply produced in Taiwan is mainly applied in communication products, computers and peripheral  equipment.  With  the  rapid  development  of  the  computer  and  information  industry,  there  is  a number of domestic information products ranked first of output in the world, one of which is the switching power  supply.  Just  because  of  this,  the  power  supply  is  an  indispensable  component  of  downstream communication  products  and  computer  peripherals,  network  equipment,  consumer  electronics  and industrial equipment, and thus bringing a lot of business opportunities for the power supply industry. As the demand for data centers expands and with the cloud computing effect, the demand for power supply applications  in  data  centers  is  also  growing  rapidly.  The  emerging  smart  electricity  and  LED  lighting industry also boost the market demand for smart meters and special power for smart lighting.\n\nIn  Taiwan  and  East  Asia,  the  upstream,  midstream  and  downstream  manufacturers  cooperate  closely, strengthening the overall industrial strength. The structure of the upstream, midstream and downstream of the industry is shown as follows:",

Trends of Products\n\nBase on the demand for AIoT and 5G infrastructure equipment, Taiwan's SPS product development can be divided into two aspects: 1) the technology development is towards the field of high efficiency, multiple input voltage, wider operating temperature, intelligence. The equipment traditionally used in data centers, including  servers,  Networking  and  Telecom  equipment  for  enterprises,  and  storage  equipment,  is  also being applied to the communications room and base station environment. Modular design is adopted for products,  parallel  stacking  mode  (500W+500W+...)  is  applied,  the  application  range  of  products  is expanded (low-end,  mid-end and  high-end power),  all  of  which  has  significantly  shortened  the  product development cycle;  2)  the  product  is  developed  as  light,  thin,  short  and  small.  The  main  market  is  the consumer end of cloud computing, such as smart mobile phones, notebook computers, tablet computers, etc., and small power suppliers applied in 3C products. Looking forward to the future, the market demand for small, light, energy-saving and low-cost products will continue to increase. With the adoption of smart and portable communication products in large numbers, the appearance of the products becomes smaller and thinner, with the advantages of being portable. End-users have to connect with the cloud through the network and service providers who provide information with computing capacity, which directly stimulates the cloud service providers to build a large number of data centers. Under the convergence environment of 5G data and communication, both Telecom operators and network service providers must actively expand network equipment to meet the needs of users and AIoT equipment for information services, which will promote the growth of  the  market  and  form  a  virtuous  cycle.  Networking  and  Telecom  equipment  and consumer electronics products have become the most important market for SPS.\n\nThe  global  power  supply  for  desktop  personal  computers  has  been  well  developed.  In  2020,  under  the impact of the epidemic, the industry shows signs of accelerating decline and poor outlook of the market on the whole. The high level of standardization has forced desktop PC vendor manufacturers to expand their market share through price competition that drives down costs and mass production capacity. On the other hand, the market acceptance for beautiful and convenient All In One computer is increasing. Despite the recession, the market is still growing faster than traditional desktop PCs. In addition to basic applications, e-sports  PC  requires  stable  dynamic  responses  and  high  power  output  as  a  result  of  adopting high-efficiency GPU for lots of computing, and there will be room for growth in power supplies for such special applications.\n\nPortable PCs, such as notebook computers, account for a large portion of current PC shipments. Under the influence  of  the  epidemic,  the  market  for  laptop  computers  has  grown  rapidly  due  to  the  demand  for remote offices and education. This type of power supply is designed in the form of a portable Adapter.",

        "page_content": "With the M-type development of the market, the main growth markets are e-sports laptops above 150W and ultra-thin laptops with a low power consumption of 65W and 45W. High-end products below 65W tend to be gradually replaced by USB Type-C PD chargers due to the thin and light needs of the products. In terms of tablet computers and smart mobile phones, converters with lower power were mainly used in the  past,  or  Charger  was  designed  to  adjust  the  output  voltage  to  achieve  a  fast-charging  function.  The output  power  is  developed  to  65W  or  above,  which  can  be  applied  to  various  consumer  electronic products. A large number of automation processes must be adopted in manufacturing to reduce costs. Once the  EU  Act  on  Standardization  of  Mobile  Phone  Chargers  is  implemented,  the  mobile  phone  charger market  is  bound  to  be  affected.  In  addition,  the  new  Act  on  Efficiency  Improvement  Requirements  for External Power Supply raised by the EU and the U.S. Department of Energy come into force in 2016, and higher  conversion  efficiency  will  also  be  a  basic  indicator.  Last  but  not  the  least,  in  addition  to  the traditional  single-voltage  output  products,  the  multi-functional  power  converters  conforming  to  USB Power Delivery specifications can provide different voltage outputs, which can be applied in a variety of consumer  electronic  products.  In  2020,  mobile  devices  equipped  with  USB  Type-C  have  become  the mainstream products in the market. However, as the majority of users still own traditional USB Type-A or Micro USB devices, the market for small external power supplies/chargers with multiple USB charging ports continues to grow.\n\nThe technology of power supplies for personal computers extends upward to servers, large Networking, Telecom equipment and storage devices. With the rapid development of cloud computing, mid-end and low-end servers tend to be matured after years of rapid growth in recent years. Although the technology, complexity and stability of the power supply applied in servers are higher than those applied in PC power supply, as servers move towards a standardized single architecture, the power supply also moves towards standardization due to the high commercialization of the mid-end and low-end systems. As a result, it is difficult for manufacturers to increase unit prices through differentiation. Therefore, in order to reduce the overall  development  cost,  it  tends  to  adopt  the  standardized  design  for  power  supply  and  reduce  the number of parts and automatic production to improve the reliability.\n\nIn  response to the large number of servers  deployed in a single location by the data center, the product tends to gradually shift from continuous efficiency improvement of a single power supply to systematic optimization  of  smart  power  management  and  cabinet  power  architecture,  enhance  the  power  factor  of power supply and reduce total harmonic distortion through the introduction of digital control. In recent years, with production and R&D bases of servers, large Networking and Telecom equipment and storage equipment  moving  to  China  and  Taiwan,  Taiwan  power  supply  manufacturer  actively  developing  their design  capabilities  with  relatively  lower  price  pressure  compared  to  European,  American  and  Japanese manufacturers,  power  supplies  for  mid-end  and  low-end  servers,  large  Networking  and  Telecom equipments  and  storage  equipments  have  been  mainly  designed  and  manufactured  by  Taiwan manufacturers. The server power supply market is becoming mature due to the advances in virtualization and cloud computing technology and the rise of distributed power architecture. The market for dedicated storage  devices  has  also  been  hit  by  Intel-Based  storage  servers  and  cloud  storage  solutions.  Under  the decline  of  terminal  application,  the  growth  momentum  of  the  market  has  shifted  to  Networking  and Telecom equipment as the focus. Base on the AIOT's edge computing requirements and as it is expected to adopt a large number of IT servers and Networking and Telecom equipment for 5G infrastructure, the IT system and power supply in line with the environmental standards of telecommunications equipment and computer room will drive the development of a new generation of products in the future.\n\nPower supply for communication mostly adopts Distributed Power Architecture, which usually consists of an AC-DC Rectifier supplying the busbar voltage and a DC/DC Converter at the later stage. Such kinds of products are of high technology and with great importance attaching to product reliability. On the whole structure,  it  can  reduce  costs  and  improve  efficiency  by  reducing  the  times  of  power  conversion.  The rectifier  sector  also  develops  toward  high  efficiency,  high  density.  In  consideration  of  costs  of  DC-DC converter  at  the  later  stage,  traditional  high-end  isolated  converters  tend  to  be  replaced  by  non-isolated converters  (POLs)  with  lower  cost.  For  bus  bar  voltage,  with  the  rise  of  new  energy  sources  and  the application  of  data  centers,  more  efficient  HVDC  systems  sprung  up  in  the  market.  The  emergence  of different  architectures  and  applications  is  expected  to  create  new  growth  momentum  in  the  highly standardized telecommunications power supply market.\n\nWith the rise of environmental awareness, how to use energy more efficiently is becoming more and more important in the face of arguments on anti-nuclear and nuclear abolition. Smart meters may enable power companies  to  keep  track  of  trends  in  electricity  consumption  in  a  timely  manner  and  dispatch  limited power resources more efficiently. Replacing the traditional meters in every household with smart meters with communication function is the most basic and important step, which is also a necessary step.\n\nEnergy management services can inject new energy into all energy products. In addition to smart meters, if all  kinds  of  grid-connected  power  generation  devices,  energy  storage  systems,  renewable  energy  power",

OCP (Open Compute Project,  initiated  by  Facebook,  etc.),  ODCC  (Open  Data  Center  Committee,  initiated  by  BAT),  Open19 (Open Data Center, initiated by LinkedIn) and other open computing organizations are playing a major role in driving innovation in the data center field, all of which have come up with a reference specification for modular cabinet design. In consideration of standardized cabinet design is a trend in the design of power converters  applied  for  data  centers,  the  design  of  modular  converter  module  and  expandable  cabinet  is proposed, which will enable the related products to meet the functional requirements of major data center manufacturers.\n\n## 4. Competition\n\nTaiwan  is  a  major  producer  of  information  products  in  the  world.  Driven  by  downstream  industries, Taiwan ranks first in  global  shipments  of  power  supplies.  In  recent  years,  due  to  the  impact  of  the  PC industry  being  hit  by  the  rise  of  low-cost  computers,  tablets  and  smartphones,  the  competition  from Chinese manufacturers at low prices, and the global economic downturn for several years, the prices of power supply products have been declining year by year, and the manufacturers' gross margins are not good as they used to be. However, with the increasing demand for energy-saving and carbon reduction in various countries, the conversion efficiency of power supply and power management function has become the  focus  of  customer  requirements.  In  recent  years,  the  concept  of  smart  electricity  consumption  has attracted more attention from all countries. Energy saving and effective use of energy has become one of the  key  requirements  of  competing  products  from  all  countries.  Smart  meters  are  the  first  step  to implement smart power grids. How to effectively capture the data that users need from meters has become an important issue. In addition, the application of data captured by meters is also of great importance, and many enterprises have begun to invest resources in research and development in this market. Under the development  of  industry  standards  and  the  successive  formulation  of  product  specifications,  various lighting major manufacturers have launched a complete series of products. The threshold of R&D design, manufacturing capability and cost control has also been raised.\n\nFurthermore, large cloud service companies and data center operators, and new types of applications such as  edge  computing  systems  for  5G  infrastructure,  define  hardware  through  software  and  introduce  the concept of open hardware standards, which will not only continue to change the traditional data center equipment, but will also impact the supply pattern and demand of telecommunications equipment. They, together with Telecom providers and data centers, purchased a huge amount of servers, Networking and Telecom equipment and storage, and went beyond the traditional brand vendors and directly to Asia to seek customized products from ODM manufacturers according to specific requirements, which caused a certain impact on the supply chain of traditional commercial information equipment. As a key component of the power supply industry, it is necessary to readjust the product strategy and design production mode in the new supply chain pattern, and seize the opportunity to seek a new position.\n\nBesides, due to China's manpower shortage and the risk of the US-China trade war, in order to maintain lower manufacturing costs and improve price competitiveness, and quickly launch energy-saving products that  meet  the  market  demand,  and  reduce  the  risk  of  single  manufacturing  site,  domestic  SPS manufacturers have also set  up factories in  Thailand,  Malaysia,  India,  the  Philippines  and  other  places, shortened  the  development  cycle  through  internal  design  standardization,  and  improved  the  automation productivity of mid-end and low-end products. In the past few years, the global power supply industry has been moving towards integration through consolidation and the elimination of a number of small factories in the face of fierce market competition. However, there is still no single player to dominate the market, with  the  big  Taiwanese  players  competing  against  each  other.  The  conditions  of  each  competitor  are different, so the medium and above-sized companies in the market still have their own room for growth and development due to the difference in product positioning, and the advantages in manufacturing and R&D capabilities.",

most recent two years:\n\n- 1. Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment, and property, plant, and equipment turnover ratio (times) It is mainly due to the increase in property, plant and equipment over the same period.\n- 2. Interest coverage ratio\n- It is mainly due to the decrease in net profit before income tax and interest expense over the same period.\n- 3. Return on assets (%), return on equity (%), net profit margin (%)\n- It is mainly due to the decrease in net profit over the same period.\n- 4. Cash flow adequacy ratio (%), cash reinvestment ratio (%)\n- It is mainly due to the increase in capital expenditure over the same period in the most recent five years.\n- 5. Operating leverage, financial leverage\n\nIt is mainly due to the increase in operating profit over the same period.\n\nNote 1:  All financial data from 2016 to 2020 have been audited and attested by the CPAs, and the data was also reviewed by the CPAs on March 31, 2021.\n\nNote 2:  The cash flow ratio is zero or negative.",

        "page_content": "Note 3:  The calculation formulas for the above items of financial analysis data are listed as follows:\n\n- 1. Financial structure\n- (1) Debt-to-assets ratio = Total liabilities / Total assets.\n- (2) Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment = (Total equity + Non-current liabilities) / Net property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2. Solvency\n\n- (1) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Current liabilities.\n- (3) Interest coverage ratio = Income before tax and interest expenses / Interest expenses.\n\n## 3. Operating Ability\n\n- (1) Receivables  (including  accounts  receivable  and  notes  receivable  due  to  business  operations)  turnover ratio = Net sales / Balance of average receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations).\n- (2) Average collection days = 365 / Receivables turnover ratio.\n- (3) Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory.\n- (4) Payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Cost of  goods  sold  /  Balance  of  average  payables  (including  accounts  payable  and  notes  payable  due  to business operations).\n- (5) Average days for sale = 365 / Inventory turnover ratio.\n- (6) Property, plant and equipment turnover ratio = Net sales / Average net property, plant and equipment.\n\n(7)\n\nTotal asset turnover ratio = Net sales / Average total assets.\n\n## 4. Profitability\n\n- (1) Return on assets = [Net income after tax + Interest expenses x (1 - Tax rate)] / Average total assets.\n- (2) Return on equity = Net income after tax / Average total equity.\n- (3) Net profit margin = Net income after tax / Net sales.\n- (4) Earnings per share = (Net income attributable to owners of parent company  - Dividends on preferred shares) / Weighted average number of shares issued (Note 4).\n\n## 5. Cash Flow\n\n- (1) Cash flow ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Net cash flow adequacy ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities for the most recent five years / (Capital expenditures + Inventory increase + Cash dividends) for the most recent five years.\n- (3) Cash reinvestment ratio = (Net cash flow from operating activities - Cash dividends) / (Gross property,\n- plant and equipment + Long-term investments + Other non-current assets + Working capital).\n\n## 6. Leverage\n\n- (1) Operating  leverage  =  (Net  operating  income  -  Changes  in  operating  costs  and  expenses)/Operating income (Note 6).\n- (2) Financial leverage = Operating income / (Operating income - Interest expenses).\n- Note 4:  Special attention shall be paid to the following matters when the above calculation formula for earnings per share is used:\n- 1. Use the weighted average number of common shares, not the number of shares issued at the end of the year.\n- 2. Capital  increase  for  cash  or  treasury  stock  transactions  shall  be  considered  when  the  weighted  average number of shares is calculated.\n- 3. Capital increase from surplus earnings or capital reserve shall be retrospectively adjusted by the proportion of capital increase when earnings per share for previous annual and semi-annual periods are calculated. The issue period for capital increase does not have to be considered.\n- 4. For preferred shares that are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, dividends (regardless of whether they are distributed) shall be deducted from net income after tax or included as net loss after tax. If preferred shares are non-cumulative, where net income after tax is available, dividends on preferred shares shall be deducted from net income after tax. No adjustment is required if the Company has loss after tax.\n\n## Note 5:  Special attention shall be paid to the following in the process of cash flow analysis:\n\n- 1. Net  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  refers  to  net  cash  flow  generated  from  operating  activities  in  the statement of cash flows.\n- 2. Capital expenditures refer to the annual cash flow used in capital investment.\n- 3. The increase in inventory is included only if the balance at the end of the year is greater than the balance at the beginning of the year. If it is the other way around, the number used should be zero.\n- 4. Cash dividends include cash dividends on common shares and preferred shares.\n- 5. Gross  property,  plant  and  equipment  refers  to  the  total  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  minus accumulated depreciation.\n- Note 6:  The issuer shall classify the operating costs and operating expenses as fixed or variable based on their nature. If it involves estimation or subjective judgment, attention shall be paid to its rationality and consistency.\n- Note 7:  Where company shares have no par value or where the par value per share is not NT$10, any calculation involving paid-in capital and its ratio shall be replaced with the calculation of the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the balance sheet.",

Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment, and property, plant, and equipment turnover ratio (times) It is mainly due to the increase in property, plant and equipment over the same period.\n- 2. Quick ratio\n- It is mainly due to the increase in the (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) over the same period.\n- 3. Return on assets (%)\n- It is mainly due to the increase in the average total assets over the same period.\n- 4. Cash flow ratio (%), cash flow adequacy ratio (%), cash reinvestment ratio (%)\n\nIt is mainly due to the decrease in net cash inflow from operating activities.\n\n- 5. Operating leverage: It is mainly due to the increase in net operating loss over the same period.\n- Note 1: All financial data from 2016 to 2020 have been audited and attested by the CPAs.\n- Note 2: The ratio of cash flow and leverage is zero or negative.",

        "page_content": "Note 3:  The calculation formulas for the above items of financial analysis data are listed as follows:\n\n- 1. Financial structure\n- (1) Debt-to-assets ratio = Total liabilities / Total assets.\n- (2) Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment = (Total equity + Non-current liabilities) / Net property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2. Solvency\n\n- (1) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Current liabilities.\n- (3) Interest coverage ratio = Income before tax and interest expenses / Interest expenses.\n\n## 3. Operating Ability\n\n- (1) Receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Net  sales  /  Balance  of  average  receivables  (including  accounts  receivable  and  notes  receivable  due  to business operations).\n- (2) Average collection days = 365 / Receivables turnover ratio.\n- (3) Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory.\n- (4) Payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold /  Balance  of  average  payables  (including  accounts payable  and  notes  payable  due  to business operations).\n- (5) Average days for sale = 365 / Inventory turnover ratio.\n- (6) Property, plant and equipment turnover ratio = Net sales / Average net property, plant and equipment.\n- (7) Total asset turnover ratio = Net sales / Average total assets.\n\n## 4. Profitability\n\n- (1) Return on assets = [Net income after tax + Interest expenses x (1 - Tax rate)] / Average total assets.\n- (2) Return on equity = Net income after tax / Average total equity.\n- (3) Net profit margin = Net income after tax / Net sales.\n- (4) Earnings per share = (Net income attributable to owners of parent company - Dividends on preferred shares) / Weighted average number of shares issued (Note 4).\n\n## 5. Cash Flow\n\n- (1) Cash flow ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Net  cash  flow  adequacy  ratio  =  Net  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  for  the  most  recent  five  years  / (Capital expenditures + Inventory increase + Cash dividends) for the most recent five years.\n- (3) Cash reinvestment ratio = (Net cash flow from operating activities - Cash dividends) / (Gross property, plant and    equipment + Long-term investments + Other non-current assets + Working capital).\n\n## 6. Leverage\n\n- (1) Operating leverage = (Net operating income - Changes in operating costs and expenses)/Operating income (Note 6).\n- (2) Financial leverage = Operating income / (Operating income - Interest expenses).\n\nNote 4:  Special attention shall be paid to the following matters when the above calculation formula for earnings per share is\n\nused:\n\n- 1. Use the weighted average number of common shares, not the number of shares issued at the end of the year.\n- 2. Capital  increase  for  cash  or  treasury  stock  transactions  shall  be  considered  when  the  weighted  average number of shares is calculated.\n- 3. Capital increase from surplus earnings or capital reserve shall be retrospectively adjusted by the proportion of capital increase when earnings per share for previous annual and semi-annual periods are calculated. The issue period for capital increase does not have to be considered.\n- 4. For preferred shares that are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, dividends (regardless of whether they are distributed) shall be deducted from net income after tax or included as net loss after tax. If preferred shares are non-cumulative, where net income after tax is available, dividends on preferred shares shall be deducted from net income after tax. No adjustment is required if the Company has loss after tax.\n- Note 5:  Special attention shall be paid to the following in the process of cash flow analysis:\n- 1. Net  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  refers  to  net  cash  flow  generated  from  operating  activities  in  the statement of cash flows.\n- 2. Capital expenditures refer to the annual cash flow used in capital investment.\n- 3. The increase in inventory is included only if the balance at the end of the year is greater than the balance at the beginning of the year. If it is the other way around, the number used should be zero.\n- 4. Cash dividends include cash dividends on common shares and preferred shares.\n- 5. Gross  property,  plant  and  equipment  refers  to  the  total  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  minus accumulated depreciation.\n- Note 6:  The issuer shall classify the operating costs and operating expenses as fixed or variable based on their nature. If it involves estimation or subjective judgment, attention shall be paid to its rationality and consistency.\n- Note 7:  Where company shares have no par value or where the par value per share is not NT$10, any calculation involving paid-in capital and its ratio shall be replaced with the calculation of the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Changes in Interest Rates\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic raged around the world, killing millions of people and dealing a major blow to  global  business.  Hard-hit  countries  such  as  the  United  States  and  Europe  maintained  ultra-low interest rates and a quantitative easing base. The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) also cut interest rates by 1 yard to 1.125% in 2020, ending the 14th freeze on interest rates to cope with possible economic shocks in the future. The market widely expects that the Central Bank of Taiwan would continue to  freeze  interest  rates  in  2021.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  currently  have  a  large  amount  of available bank credit, even if the future interest rate reverses upward, its impact on the Company's use of funds should be limited.\n\n## 3. Changes in Exchange Rate\n\nThe  exchange  rate  of  Taiwan  dollar  against  the  US  dollar  at  the  end  of  2020  was  28.508  dollars,  an appreciation of 1.598 dollars (+5.31%) compared with that at the end of 2019, which was unfavorable to most of the products quoted in US dollars by the Company and its subsidiaries. In order to effectively manage the exchange rate risk, the Company and its subsidiaries try their best to quote in US dollars for purchase and payment, so as to achieve the effect of natural hedging. The Company also has formulated the Operational procedures for Acquisition and Disposal of Assets, with the financial department referring to the analysis of well-known banks and research institutions at home and abroad, to engage in forwarding exchange, exchange rate swaps and other hedging derivative financial commodity trading, so as to reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n## 4. Inflation\n\nThe  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  in  Taiwan  decreased  by  0.23%  and  the  wholesale  price  index  (WPI) decreased by 7.8% in 2020 compared with the previous year. Even if prices rise in the future, it will not have a significant impact on the profits and losses of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n- (II) The Company's Policy Regarding High-Risk Investments, Highly Leveraged Investments, Loans to Other  Parties,  Endorsements,  Guarantees,  and  Derivatives  Transactions;  the  Main  Reasons  for  the Profits/Losses Generated thereby; and Response Measures to be Taken in the Future\n- 1. The  Company  and  its  Subsidiaries  do  not  engage  in  high-risk  investments  and  highly  leveraged investments.\n- 2. Lending funds to others are conducted in accordance with the Operational Procedures for Loaning Funds to Others of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The actual balance used at the end of 2020 was NT$43,770 thousand, and that in the first quarter of 2021 was NT$43,480 thousand\n- 3. The endorsement guarantee refers to the endorsement guarantee  of bank loans for the operation turnover needs  of  the  subsidiary.  All  policies  shall  follow  the  Operational  Procedures  for  Endorsements  and Guarantees  of  the  Company.

Furthermore, we conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Certification of Financial Statements  by  Certified  Public  Accountants,  Rule  No.  1090360805  issued  by  the  Financial  Supervisory Commission and the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Certified Public Accountants Code of Professional Ethics in Republic of China ('the Code'), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters we judged shall be presented in the auditors' report as follows:\n\n## 1. Operating Revenue- Revenue Recognition of Vender Management Inventory (VMI)\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(p) revenue for operating revenue recognition (including VMI). Information regarding sales revenue and revenue from contracts with customers is shown in note (6)(t) of the consolidated financial statements, respectively.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nThe Group has established vender managed inventories in overseas warehouses which do not belong to the Group. The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Group, should be based on the circumstance of VMI client delivery. Both parties reconcile periodically to ensure the consistency in the amount and timing of sales recognition. Therefore, revenue recognition, VMI is one of the key judgmental areas for our audit.\n\n## Audit Procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedures included: understanding and testing the related controls surrounding the aforementioned sales and collection cycle, reconciling the account records between Acbel Polytech Inc. and VMI  client  delivery,  selectively  conducting  external  confirmations  on  VMI,  as  well  as  assessing  the operating  revenue  recognition  (including  VMI)  of  the  Group  to  determine  whether  related  accounting policies are applied appropriately.\n\n## 2. Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(h) Inventories and note (5) of the consolidated financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate of inventory valuation, respectively. Information regarding the inventory and related expenses are shown in note (6)(g) of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for the inventory of the Group is expected. Therefore, the test of inventory valuation is one of the significant evaluation in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow moving inventories to determine whether policies of the Group and accounting policies are applied. In addition, in order to verify the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## Other Matter\n\nAcbel Polytech Inc. has prepared its parent company only financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, on which we have issued an unmodified opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and with the IFRSs, IASs, IFRC, SIC, endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic  of  China,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Group' s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. Unless the management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cause significant doubt on the Group' s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partners on the reviews resulting in this independent auditors' review report are I-Wen Wang and Hsing-Fu Yen.\n\n## KPMG\n\nTaipei, Taiwan (Republic of China) March 10, 2021\n\n## Notes to Readers\n\nThe  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  are  intended  only  to  present  the  consolidated  financial  position,  financial performance and cash flows in accordance with the accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the Republic of China and not those of any other jurisdictions.

Subsidiaries re entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its control over the entity.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  the  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Group attributes the profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nThe Group prepares consolidated financial statements using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n\nChanges in the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any differences between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received will be recognized directly in equity, and the Group will attribute it to the owners of the parent.\n\n## (ii) List of subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements\n\n|                   |                                                         |                                                  | Shareholding      | Shareholding      |             |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Name of  investor | Name of subsidiary                                      | Principal activity                               | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2019 | Description |\n| The Company       | AcBel Polytech Holdings Inc.

Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty,  result  in  its  settlement  by  the  issue  of  equity  instruments  do  not  affect  its classification.\n\n## (f) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes are reclassified as cash equivalents.\n\n## (g) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is an account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. An account receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortized cost; Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## 1) Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nA  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\n(Continued)",

Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, as well as impairment, are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 2) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI )\n\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nSome accounts receivables are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling by the Group, therefore, those receivables  are  measured  at  FVOCI.  However,  they  are  included  in  the  account receivables line items.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nDebt investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the exdividend date.\n\n## 3) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nAll financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI described as above are measured at FVTPL, including derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset, which meets the requirements to be measured  at  amortized  cost  or  at  FVOCI,  as  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so  eliminates  or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\n(Continued)",

Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe  Group recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortized cost (including cash and cash equivalents, amortized costs, notes  and  accounts  receivable,  other  receivables(current  and  non-current),  guarantee deposit paid and other financial assets) and contract assets.\n\nThe Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (ECL), except for the following which are measured as 12-month ECL:\n\n- \u00b7 debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n- \u00b7 other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument)  has  not  increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nLoss allowance for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Group's historical  experience  and  informed  credit  assessment  as  well  as  forward-looking information.\n\nThe Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of 'investment grade which is considered to be BBB- or higher per  Standard & Poor's, Baa3 or higher per Moody's or twA or higher per Taiwan Ratings'.\n\nThe Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the financial asset is more than 90 days past due or the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full.\n\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\n\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.",

Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at  FVOCI  are  credit-impaired.  A  financial asset is ' creditimpaired'  when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial assets is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- \u00b7 the lender of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate customers, the Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.  The  Group  expects  no  significant  recovery  from  the  amount  written  off. However,  financial  assets  that  are  written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## 5) Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized.\n\n(Continued)",

Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it  is  designated  as  such  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities  at  FVTPL  are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Group  derecognizes  a  financial  liability  when  its  contractual  obligations  are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different,  in  which  case  a  new  financial  liability  based  on  the  modified  terms  is recognized at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 5) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value.

The Group also documents the economic relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument,  including  whether  the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nThe fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss except when the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument designated at FVOCI in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe carrying amount of a hedged item not already measured at fair value is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hedged risk with a corresponding entry in profit or loss. For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument. Where hedging gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, they are recognized in the same line as the hedged item.\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold,  expires  is  terminated  or  is  exercised,  then  hedge  accounting  is  discontinued prospectively. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (h) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is based on weighted average costing principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\n## (i) Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are highly probable to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are reclassified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter, generally, the assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to assets not within the scope of IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment in associates includes goodwill arising from the acquisition, less, any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Group' s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of those associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group from the date on which significant influence commences until the date on which significant influence ceases. The Group recognizes any changes of its proportionate share in the investee within capital surplus, when an associate's equity changes due to reasons other than profit and loss or comprehensive income, which did not result in changes in actual proportionate share.\n\nGain and loss resulting from the transactions between the Group and an associate are recognized only to the extent of unrealized Group's interest in the associate.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interests in an associate, it discontinues recognizing its share of further losses.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether:\n\n- 1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified; and\n- 2) the customer has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and\n- 3) the customer has the right to direct the use of the asset throughout the period of use only if either:\n- \u00b7 the customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use; or\n- \u00b7 the  relevant  decisions  about  how  and  for  what  purpose  the  asset  is  used  are predetermined and:\n- - the customer has the right to operate the asset throughout the period of use, without the supplier having the right to change those operating instructions; or\n- - the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used throughout the period of use.",

However, for the leases of land and buildings in which it is a lessee, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and nonlease components as a single lease component.\n\n## (ii) As a leasee\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any  initial  direct  costs  incurred  and  an  estimate  of  costs  to  dismantle  and  remove  the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- 1) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- 2) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- 3) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n- 4) payments for purchase or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when:\n\n- 1) there is a change in future lease payments arising from the change in an index or rate; or\n- 2) there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or\n- 3) there is a change in the lease term resulting from a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, or\n- 4) there is a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option; or\n- 5) there are any lease modifications\n\n(Continued)",

The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor sale-and-leaseback transactions, the Group applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of the asset. If the transfer of an asset satisfies the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Group recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group will continue to recognize the transferred asset and shall recognize the financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (iii) As a leaser\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance  lease  or  an  operating  lease.  To  classify  each  lease,  the  Group  makes  an  overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then the lease is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\n## (m) Intangible assets\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.",

All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Amortization\n\nAmortization is calculated over the cost of the asset, less its residual value, and is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of computer software for current and comparative periods are 2~5 years.\n\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each annual reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\n## (n) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units (CGUs).\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.

The Group recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The accounting policies for the Group's main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n## (i) Sale of goods\n\nThe  Group  manufactures  electronic  components  to  electronic  manufacturers.  The  Group recognizes revenue when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe  Group  often  offers  volume  discounts  to  its  customers  based  on  aggregate  sales  of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term, which is consistent with the market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed through the grid, and the revenue is calculated according to the fee agreed with Taiwan Power Company.\n\n(Continued)",

As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\n## (q) Government grants and government assistance\n\nThe Group recognizes an unconditional government grant as other income when the grant becomes receivable. Other government grants related to assets are initially recognized as deferred income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant; they are then recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses or losses incurred are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses or losses are recognized.\n\n## (r) Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group' s net obligation in respect of the defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.\n\nThe calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.  When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the total of the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present  value  of  the  economic  benefits,  consideration  is  given  to  any  minimum  funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated in retained earnings within equity. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\n(Continued)",

A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (s) Share-based payment\n\nThe grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.\n\nFor share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the sharebased  payment  is  measured  to  reflect  such  conditions, and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\n## (t) Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Except for expenses related to business combinations  or  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  all  current  and deferred taxes shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatment, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under IAS37.\n\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payables or receivables on the taxable profits (losses) for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred taxes arise due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits (losses) at the time of the transaction;\n\n(Continued)",

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\n## (u) Earnings per share\n\nThe Group discloses the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company. The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding  after  adjustment  for  the  effects  of  all  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares.  Dilutive potential  ordinary  shares  comprise  employee  stock  options,  remuneration  to  employees  not  yet approved by the directors, and restricted employee shares.\n\n## (v) Operating segments\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may incur revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the Group). Operating results of the operating segment are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. Each operating segment consists of standalone financial information.",

Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe  management  continues  to  monitor  the  accounting  estimates  and  assumptions.  The  management recognizes any changes in accounting estimates during the period and the impact of those changes in accounting estimates in the next period.\n\nThere are no critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBesides, for those uncertainties due to accounting assumptions and estimations, information about the significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year is stated below:\n\n## Inventory valuation\n\nInventories are supposed to be measured based on the lower of cost or net realizable value. Due to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, which tends to devalue the inventories, the Group evaluates the costs of inventories using the net realizable value. Inventory valuation is based on the demand of the products during the specific period, therefore, the value of inventories may be variable due to the nature of fast-paced industry.

Of the remaining balance, 10% is to be appropriated as legal reserve. Only if the legal reserves have attained to the paid-in capital could be the exception, besides, special reserves are supposed to set  aside  or  reversed  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  regulations  or  as  required  by  the government. And then any remaining profit together with any undistributed retained earnings shall be distributed according to the distribution plan proposed by the Board of Directors and submitted to the stockholders' meeting for approval.\n\nThe Company explicitly stipulate in its articles of incorporation to authorize the distributable dividends and bonuses, in whole or in part, which may be paid in cash after a resolution has been adopted by a majority vote at a meeting of the Board of Directors attended by two-thirds of the total number of directors; and in addition thereto, a report of such distribution shall be submitted to the shareholders' meeting.\n\nThe  Company' s  industry  is  currently  in  a  gentle  growth  phase.    To  take  the  capital requirements of the Company and the shareholders into account, the Company's remaining balance is partially distributed as cash dividends to stockholders, and the amount of cash dividends should not be lower than 50% of the total dividends.\n\n## 1) Legal reserve\n\nIf the Company experienced profit for the year, the distribution of the statutory earnings reserve, either by new shares or by cash, shall be decided at the shareholders meeting, and the distribution amount is limited to the portion of legal reserve which exceeds 25 percent of the paid-in capital.",

The amount to be reclassified should equal to the current-period total net reduction of other shareholders'  equity. Similarly, a portion of undistributed prior period earnings shall be reclassified as a special earnings reserve (and is not qualified for earnings distribution) to account for cumulative changes to other shareholders' equity pertaining to prior periods. Amounts of subsequent reversals pertaining to the net reduction of other shareholders' equity shall qualify for additional distributions.

However, if the Company has accumulated deficits, the profit should be reserved to offset the deficit.\n\nThe aforementioned profit for the year is the earnings before tax, excluding directors' remuneration.\n\nThe aforementioned employees' compensation will be distributed in shares or cash.  The recipients may include employees of the Company's affiliated entities that are owned more than 50% of shareholdings by the Company.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration  amounting  to  $60,929  and  $44,549,  respectively,  and  directors'  remuneration amounting  to  $15,820  and  $17,345,  respectively.  The  estimated  amounts  mentioned  above  are calculated based on the net profit before tax, excluding the remuneration to employees and directors of each period, multiplied by the percentage of remuneration to employees and directors as specified in the Company's articles. These remunerations were expensed under operating costs or operating expenses. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based on the closing price of the Company's shares, one day before the date of the Board of Directors' meeting.\n\n(Continued)",

A  weakening  (strengthening)  of  5%  each  major  foreign  currency against Group entities' functional currency for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 would have affected the net profit before tax as followings:\n\n|                       | 2020      | 2019     |\n|-----------------------|-----------|----------|\n| USD (against the TWD) |           |          |\n| Strengthening 5%      | $ (2,587) | (12,957) |\n| Weakening 5%          | 2,587     | 12,957   |\n\n(Continued)",

Regarding the liabilities with variable interest rates, the analysis is on the basis of the assumption that the amount of liabilities outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding throughout the year. The rate of change is expressed as the interest rate increases or decreases by 0.25% when reporting to management internally, which also represents the Group management's assessment of the reasonably possible interest rate change.\n\nIf the interest rate had increased or decreased by 0.25%, the net profit before tax for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were illustrated below, which would be mainly resulted from the bank savings with variable interest rates.  Since the interest of time deposits, financial assets at amortized cost, long-term borrowings and short-term borrowings were fixed, changes in market interest of the aforementioned financial assets will have no effect on the net profit before tax.\n\n(Continued)",

However, if no quoted prices are available, the discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair values.\n\n## 3) Valuation technique for financial instruments measured at fair value\n\n## a) Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments trade in active markets are based on quoted market prices. The quoted price of a financial instrument obtained from main exchanges and onthe-run bonds from Taipei Exchange can be used as a basis to determine the fair value of the listed companies' equity instrument and debt instrument of the quoted price in an active market.\n\nMeasurements of fair value of financial instruments without an active market are based on valuation technique.\n\n## b) Derivative financial instruments\n\nMeasurement of fair value of derivative instruments is based on the valuation techniques that are generally accepted by the market participants. For instance, discount method or option pricing models. Fair value of forward currency exchange is usually determined by using the forward currency rate.\n\n## 4) Transfers between Level 1 and Level 3\n\nThere were no transfer among fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n(Continued)",

The Group has no transactions  in  financial  instruments  (including  derivative  financial  instruments)  for  the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the Board of Directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group' s receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Group's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's credit limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed periodically. Customers that fail to meet the Group's benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.\n\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk.  The Group's customers are mainly from the high-tech industry. In order to mitigate account receivable credit risk, the Group constantly assesses the financial status of the customers, and requests the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Group regularly accesses the collectability of accounts receivable and recognizes allowance for accounts receivable. The impairment losses are always within management's expectation.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records and the degree of cooperation. Customers that are graded as ' high risk'  are placed on a restricted customer list and monitored by the finance department more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.\n\nThe Group set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade and other receivables. The allowance for bad debt account consists of specific losses relating to individually significant exposure and the unrecognized losses arising from similar  assets  groups.  The  allowance  for  bad  debt  account  is  based  on  historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investments\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial instruments are measured and monitored by the Group's finance department. Since the Group's transaction counterparties and contractually obligated counterparties are banks, financial institutes and corporate organizations with good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.  The finance department evaluates the counterparty's credit condition when investing in bond investment without an active market, and do not expect to have any significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nPlease refer to note 13(a) for the Group provide financial guarantees to subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Group' s management supervises the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe loans and borrowings from the bank form an important source of liquidity for the Group. Please refer to note (6)(l) and note (6)(n) for unused short-term and long-term credit lines as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## (v) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe Group buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market  risks.  Generally  the  Group  seeks  to  apply  hedge  accounting  in  order  to  manage volatility in profit or loss.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (TWD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY).  The currencies used in these transactions are denominated in TWD, USD, and CNY.\n\nAt any point in time, the Group hedges specific percentage of its estimated foreign currency exposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following six months. The Group also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange contracts are excluded from designation as the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash  flows.  The  Group  assesses  whether  the  derivative  designated  in  each  hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group does not borrow funds with variable interest rates, therefore there is no risk of cash flows.\n\n## (z) Capital management\n\nThe Group maintains the capital based on the current operating characteristics of the industry, future development,  and  changes  in  external  environment,  to  assure  there  is  financial  resource  and operating plan to support working capital, capital expenditures, research & development expense, debt redemption and dividend payment and so on. The management decides the optimized capital by using appropriate debt-to-equity ratio, interest-bearing liabilities-to-equity ratio or other financial ratios. To maintain a strong capital base, the Group enhances the return on equity by optimizing debt-to-equity ratio. The Group's debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the reporting date was as follows:\n\n|                                              | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Total liabilities                            | $ 16,332,304        | 12,525,632          |\n| Total equity                                 | 10,643,594          | 9,872,543           |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities                 | 6,701,323           | 2,711,040           |\n| Debt-to-equity ratio                         | % 153               | % 127               |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities to equity ratio | % 63                | % 27                |\n\n(Continued)",

('the Company'), which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit of the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Certification of Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants, and the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China. Furthermore, we conducted our audit of the  financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 in accordance with  the  Regulations  Governing  Auditing  and  Certification  of  Financial  Statements  by  Certified  Public Accountants,  Rule  No.  1090360805  issued  by  the  Financial  Supervisory  Commission,  and  the  auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Certified Public Accountants Code of Professional Ethics in Republic of China ('the Code'), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters we judged shall be presented in the auditors' report as follows:\n\n## 1. Operating Revenue- Revenue Recognition of Vender Management Inventory (VMI)\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(o) revenue for operating revenue recognition (including VMI). Information regarding sales revenue and revenue from contracts with customers is shown in note (6)(s) of the financial statements, respectively.",

The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Company, should be based  on  the  circumstance  of  VMI  client  delivery.  Both  parties  reconcile  periodically  to  ensure  the consistency in the amount and timing of sales recognition. Therefore, revenue recognition, VMI is one of the key judgmental areas for our audit.\n\n## Audit Procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedures included: understanding and testing the related controls surrounding the aforementioned sales and collection cycle, reconciling the account records between Acbel Polytech Inc. and VMI client delivery, selectively conducting external confirmations on VMI and assessing the operating revenue recognition (including VMI) of the Company to determine whether related accounting policies are applied appropriately.\n\n## 2. Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(g) Inventories and note (5) of the financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate of inventory valuation, respectively. Information regarding the inventory and related expenses are shown in note (6)(g) of the financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for the inventory of the Company is expected. Therefore, the test of inventory valuation is one of the significant evaluations in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow-moving inventories to determine whether policies of the Company and accounting policies are applied. In addition, in order to verify the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Company' s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. Unless the management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the investment in other entities accounted for using the equity method to express an opinion on this financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

At the end of each subsequent reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies using the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated into the functional currencies using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the translation.\n\nExchange differences are generally recognized in profit or loss, except for those differences relating of the following, which are recognized in other comprehensive income:\n\n- 1) an investment in equity securities designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income;\n- 2) a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that hedge is effective; or\n- 3) qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that hedges are effective.\n\n## (ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into the presentation currency at the exchange rates at the reporting  date.    The  income  and  expenses  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  into  the presentation currency at the average exchange rate. Exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Company disposes of only part of investment in an associate of joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planed nor likely in the foreseeable future, exchange differences arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income.",

Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issuing equity instruments do not affect its classification.\n\n## (e) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes should be recognized as cash equivalents.\n\n## (f) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is an account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. An account receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortized cost; Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## 1) Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nA  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  hold  assets  to  collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is the amount at which the  financial  asset  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  plus/minus,  the  cumulative amortization using the effective interest method, adjusted for any loss allowance. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, as well as impairment, are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 2) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI )\n\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nSome accounts receivables are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling by the Company, therefore, those receivables are measured at FVOCI. However, they are included in the trade receivables' line item.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment' s fair value in other  comprehensive  income.  This  election  is  made  on  an  instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\n(Continued)",

Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Company's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.\n\n## 3) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nAll financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI described as above are measured at FVTPL, including derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset, which meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortized cost (including cash and cash equivalents, amortized costs, notes  and  accounts  receivable,  other  receivables(current  and  non-current),  guarantee deposit paid and other financial assets) and contract assets.\n\nThe Company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (ECL), except for the following which are measured as 12-month ECL:\n\n- \u00b7 debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n- \u00b7 other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument)  has  not  increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nLoss allowance for account receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Company' s historical experience and informed credit assessment as well as forwardlooking information.\n\n(Continued)",

Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the  Company in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses  whether  financial  assets  carried  at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ' credit-impaired' when  one  or  more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- \u00b7 the  lender  of  the  borrower,  for  economic  or  contractual  reasons  relating  to  the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.\n\n(Continued)",

For corporate customers, the Company individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However,  financial  assets  that  are  written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## 5) Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe  Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash  flows  in  a  transaction  in  which  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of ownership  of  the  financial  asset  are  transferred  or  in  which  the  Company  neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nThe Company enters transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of balance sheet but retains either all or substantially all the risks and rewards of the transferred assets.

Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative, or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.",

The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 5) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of balance sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as fair value hedges.\n\nAt  inception  of  designated  hedging  relationships,  the  Company  documents  the  risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Company also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nThe fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss except when the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument designated at FVOCI in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe carrying amount of a hedged item not already measured at fair value is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hedged risk with a corresponding entry in profit or loss. For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument. Where hedging gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, they are recognized in the same line as the hedged item.",

The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (g) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is based on weighted average costing principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\n## (h) Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment in associates includes goodwill arising from the acquisition, less, any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe financial statements include the Company's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of those associates after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Company  from  the  date  on  which  significant  influence  commences  until  the  date  on  which significant influence ceases.\n\nThe  Company recognizes any changes of its proportionate share in the investee within capital surplus,  when  an  associate' s  equity  changes  due  to  reasons  other  than  profit  and  loss  or comprehensive income, which did not result in changes in actual significant influence.\n\nGains and losses resulting from transactions between the Company and an associate are recognized only to the extent of unrelated Company's interests in the associate.\n\nWhen the Company's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interests in an associate, it discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the recognized interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## (i) Investment in subsidiaries\n\nWhen preparing the parent-company-only financial statements, investment in subsidiaries which are controlled by the Company is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the net income, other comprehensive income and equity attributable to shareholders of the Company in the  parent-company-only  financial  statement,  are  equal  to  those  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n(Continued)",

However, for the leases of land and buildings in which it is a lessee, the Company has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and nonlease components as a single lease component.\n\n## (ii) As a lessee\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.",

If the transfer of an asset satisfies the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Company recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company will continue to recognize the transferred asset and shall recognize the financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (iii) As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Company makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then the lease is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Company considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\n## (l) Intangible assets\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Company intends to, and has sufficient resources to, complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to  initial  recognition,  development  expenditure  is  measured  at  cost,  less  accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nOther intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.",

The estimated useful lives of computer software for current and comparative periods are 3~5 years.\n\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each annual reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\n## (m) Impairment - non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## (n) Provisions\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, based on historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  of  all  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated probabilities.\n\n(Continued)",

The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The accounting policies for the Company's main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n## (i) Sale of goods\n\nThe Company manufactures and sells electronic components to electronic manufacturers. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Company has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe  Company often offers volume discounts to its customers based on aggregate sales of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term, which is consistent with the market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed through the grid, and the revenue is calculated according to the fee agreed with Taiwan Power Company.\n\n## (iii) Financing components\n\nThe Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated in retained earnings within equity. The Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Company recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\n## (iii) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized  for  the  amount  expected  to  be  paid  if  the  Company  has  a  present  legal  or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (q) Share-based payment\n\nThe grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as employee expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards which related service  and  non-market  performance  conditions  are  expected  to  be  met,  such  that  the  amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.\n\n(Continued)",

The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.

Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits (losses) at the time of the transaction;\n- (ii) temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- (iii) taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred taxes are measured at tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reserve, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the following criteria are met:\n\n- (i) the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and against current tax liabilities; and\n- (ii) the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either:\n- 1) the same taxable entity; or\n- 2) different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realize the assets and liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n(Continued)",

The  calculation  of  basic  earnings  per  share  is  based  on  the  profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe  management  continues  to  monitor  the  accounting  estimates  and  assumptions.  The  management recognizes any changes in accounting estimates during the period and the impact of those changes in accounting estimates in the next period.\n\nThere are no critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.\n\nBesides, for those uncertainties due to accounting assumptions and estimations, information about the significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year is stated below:\n\n## Inventory valuation\n\nInventories are supposed to be measured based on the lower of cost or net realizable value. Due to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, which tends to devalue the inventories, the Company evaluates the costs of inventories using the net realizable value. Inventory valuation is based on the demand of the products during the specific period; therefore, the value of inventories may be variable due to the nature of fast-paced industry.

Of the remaining balance, 10% is to be appropriated as legal reserve. Only if the legal reserve attaining to the paid-in capital could be the exception, besides, special reserves are supposed to set aside or reversed in accordance with the relevant regulations or as required by the government. And then any remaining profit together with any undistributed retained earnings shall be distributed according to the distribution plan proposed by the Board of Directors and submitted to the stockholders' meeting for approval.\n\nThe Company explicitly stipulate in its Articles of Incorporation to authorize the distributable dividends and bonuses, in whole or in part, which may be paid in cash after a resolution has been adopted by a majority vote at a meeting of the board of directors attended by two thirds of the total number of directors; and in addition thereto, a report of such distribution shall be submitted to the shareholders' meeting.\n\nThe  Company' s  industry  is  currently  in  a  gentle  growth  phase.    To  take  the  capital requirements of the Company and the shareholders into account, the Company's remaining balance is partially distributed as cash dividends to stockholders, and the amount of cash dividends should not be lower than 50% of the total dividends.\n\n## 1) Legal reserve\n\nIf the Company experienced profit for the year, the distribution of the statutory earnings reserve, either by new shares or by cash, shall be decided at the shareholders meeting, and the distribution amount is limited to the portion of legal reserve which exceeds 25 percent of the paid-in capital.\n\n## 2) Special reserve\n\nIn accordance with order No. 1010012865 issued by the FSC on April 6, 2012, a portion of current-period earnings and undistributed prior-period earnings shall be reclassified as a special earnings reserve during earnings distribution. The amount to be reclassified should equal to the current-period total net reduction of other shareholders'  equity. Similarly, a portion of undistributed prior period earnings shall be reclassified as a special earnings reserve (and is not qualified for earnings distribution) to account for cumulative changes to other shareholders' equity pertaining to prior periods. Amounts of subsequent reversals pertaining to the net reduction of other shareholders' equity shall qualify for additional distributions.",

However,  if  the  Company  has accumulated deficits, the profit should be reserved to offset the deficit.\n\nThe  aforementioned  profit  for  the  year  is  the  earnings  before  tax,  excluding  directors'  and supervisors' remuneration.\n\nThe aforementioned employees' compensation will be distributed in shares or cash.  The recipients may include employees of the Company' s affiliated entities that are owned more than 50% of shareholdings by the Company.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration  amounting  to  $60,929  and  $44,549,  respectively,  and  directors'  remuneration amounting to $15,820 and $17,345, respectively. The estimated amounts mentioned above were calculated based on the net profit before tax, excluding the remuneration to employees, directors of each period, multiplied by the percentage of remuneration to employees, directors as specified in the Company's articles. These remunerations were expensed under operating costs or operating expenses during 2020 and 2019. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based on the closing price of the Company's shares, one  the day before  the  date  of  the  Board  of  Directors'   meeting.  The  amounts,  as  stated  in  the  financial statements, are identical to those of the actual distributions in 2020 and 2019.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2019  and  2018,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration  amounting  to  $44,549  and  $23,130,  respectively,  and  directors'  and  supervisors' remuneration amounting to $17,345 and $9,252, respectively. The actual amount is the same with the  abovementioned  estimated  amount.  The  related  information  is  available  on  the  Market Observation Post System Website.",

A weakening (strengthening) 5% of each major foreign currency against Company entities'  functional currency as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 would have affected the net profit before tax as followings:\n\n|                       | 2020        | 2019      |\n|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| USD (against the TWD) |             |           |\n| Strengthening 5%      | $ (276,155) | (108,630) |\n| Weakening 5%          | 276,155     | 108,630   |\n\nSince the Company has many kinds of functional currency, the information on foreign exchange gain (loss) on monetary items is disclosed by total amount.  For the years  2020 and  2019,  foreign  exchange  gain  (loss)  (including  realized  and  unrealized  portions) amounted to $204,107 and $152,643, respectively.",

Regarding  the liabilities with variable interest rates, the analysis is on the basis of the assumption that the amount of liabilities outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding throughout the year. The rate of change is expressed as the interest rate increases or decreases by 0.25% when reporting to management internally, which also represents management of the Company's assessment on the reasonably possible interval of interest rate change.\n\nIf  the  interest  rate  had  increased  or  decreased  by  0.25%,  the  net  profit  before  tax  was illustrated below for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which would be mainly resulted from the bank savings and short-term borrowings with variable interest rates.  Since the interest of time deposits, financial assets at amortized cost and short-term borrowings were fixed, changes in market interest of the aforementioned financial assets will have no effect on the net profit before tax.\n\n|                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Increased by 0.25% | (459)  | 42     |\n| Decreased by 0.25% | 459    | (42)   |\n\n## (v) Fair value\n\n## 1) Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial instruments used for hedging, and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured on a recurring basis. The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, including the information on fair value hierarchy were as follows;  however,  except  as  described  in  the  following  paragraphs,  for  financial instruments not measured at fair value whose carrying amount is reasonably close to the fair value, and for equity investments that has no quoted prices in the active markets and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured,  disclosure of fair value information is not required:\n\n(Continued)",

However, if no quoted prices are available, the discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair values.\n- 3) Valuation technique of financial instruments measured at fair value\n- a) Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments trade in active markets are based on quoted market prices. The quoted price of a financial instrument obtained from main exchanges and onthe-run bonds from Taipei Exchange can be used as a basis to determine the fair value of the listed companies' equity instrument and debt instrument of the quoted price in an active market.",

For  more  disclosures  about  the quantitative  effects  of  these  risks'  exposures,  please  refer  to  the  respective  notes  in  the accompanying financial statements.\n\n## (ii) Structure of risk management\n\nThe  Company' s  finance  department  provide  business  services  for  the  overall  internal department. It sets the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk arising from both the domestic and international financial market operations.  The  Company  minimizes  the  risk  exposure  through  derivative  financial instruments.  The  Board  of  Directors  regulated  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative financial  instruments  in  accordance  with  the  Company' s  policy  about  risks  arising  from financial instruments such as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the investments of excess liquidity. The audit committee and internal auditors of the Company continue with the review of the amount of the risk exposure in accordance with the Company's policy and the risk management policies and procedures.  The Company has no transactions in financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) for the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the board of directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Company's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Company's credit limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed  periodically.  Customers  that  fail  to  meet  the  Company's  benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Company only on a prepayment basis.",

However, management also considers the demographics of the Company's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk. The Company' s customers are mainly from the high-tech industry.  In order to mitigate account receivable credit risk, the Company constantly assesses the financial status of the customers, and requests the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Company  regularly  accesses  the  collectability  of  accounts  receivable  and  recognizes allowance  for  accounts  receivable.  The  impairment  losses  are  always  within management's expectation.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records and the degree of cooperation. Customers that are graded as ' high risk'  are placed on a restricted customer list and monitored by the finance department more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.\n\nThe Company set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade and other receivables. The allowance for bad debt account consists of specific losses relating to individually significant exposure and the unrecognized losses arising from similar assets groups. The allowance for bad debt account is based on historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investment\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial instruments are measured and monitored by the Company's finance department. Since the Company's transaction counterparties and contractually obligated counterparties  are  banks,  financial  institutes  and  corporate  organizations  with  good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.  The finance department evaluates the counterparty's credit condition when investing in bond investment without an active market, and does not expect to have any significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nThe Company could only provide financial guarantees to subsidiaries under its policy. Please refer to note 13(a) for the Company provide financial guarantees to subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Company manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Company's management supervises the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe  loans  and  borrowings  from  the  bank  form  an  important  source  of  liquidity  for  the Company.  Please refer to note (6)(k) and (6)(m) for unused short-term credit lines as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n(Continued)",

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe  Company buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. Generally, the Company seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  respective  functional  currencies  of  the Company's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (TWD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY).  The currencies used in these transactions are denominated in TWD, USD, and CNY.\n\nAt any point in time, the Company hedges specific percentage of its estimated foreign currency exposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following six months. The Company also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe  Company designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange contracts are excluded from designation as the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Company's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Company assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company does not borrow funds with variable interest rates, therefore there is no risk of cash flows.",
