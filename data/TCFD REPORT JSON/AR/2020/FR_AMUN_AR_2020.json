However, Amundi successfully passed this test of resilience. The company's business lines sustained their momentum with contributions from all client segments, and financed internal growth investments thanks to continued productivity gains. Its cost/income ratio (51.7%) remained amongst the best in the industry. Corrected for market effects, results for 2020 are in line with the company's 2018-2020 plan. On the back of this strong performance and our sound financial structure, the Board has submitted a proposed dividend of 2.90 euros per share to the Annual General Meeting. This is equivalent to 65% of the Group's share of net income.\n\nThroughout this turbulent year, Amundi continued paving the way forward with new initiatives: creating a new joint\n\nventure  with  Bank  of  China, acquiring Banco Sabadell Asset Management in Spain and launching Amundi Technology.\n\nAmundi is entirely aligned with all three dimensions (client, human and societal) of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's project. As a leader on ESG issues,  Amundi  is  able  to  offer clients of the Group's networks and third-party  distributors  savings solutions that meet their expectations regarding social and environmental  goals.  Consistent with objectives announced in 2018,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmundi's ever more numerous initiatives to foster a form of finance that better respects the environment and promotes social cohesion contribute to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's ambition  to  become  Europe's  leading  company  for responsible investment.\n\nPaving the way forward also includes tending to management succession. After 14 years helming the Group, Yves Perrier has\n\n'In 2020, Amundi continued its trajectory of profitable growth and entered a new phase of its commitment to sustainability as a responsible investor.'\n\n100% of Amundi's actively managed funds now take ESG criteria into account (1) .

Both Amundi and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group owe a great deal to Yves Perrier.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has nominated  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  to succeed Yves as CEO and I have proposed that he take my place as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChair of the Board of Directors so that Amundi continues to benefit from his unparalleled experience.

        "page_content": "## Environment and Strategy\n\n## A unique positioning\n\nSince its creation in 2010, Amundi has based its development on a strategic vision: to offer simple investment solutions tailored to the needs of retail and institutional clients, in France and abroad, by developing all its areas of expertise and establishing a presence in the main international investment regions.\n\nThis strategy is based on four pillars: a comprehensive, high-performance range of products and services, strong advisory capabilities, excellent operational efficiency and a strong commitment to social responsibility. It is also based on a unique organisational model: a structure that is both global and local, client centric and coupled with an industrial approach to the business.\n\nThis strategy has been confirmed by a significant increase in assets under management and earnings, which have increased 2.6-fold between 2010 and 2020..\n\n## Accelerating basic trends confirm the\n\n## value of Amundi's development model\n\n## Continued pressure on margins\n\nFor several years now, the financial sector as a whole has been confronted with persistently low interest rates. This situation, accentuated by the concerted actions of central banks in response to the Covid-19 crisis, is reflected in lower returns on the assets in which client savings are invested and consequently greater pressure on asset managers' margins, while encouraging the development of passive management, which benefits from low costs. This pressure on margins is compounded by growing competition  from  the  large  US  asset  management companies, which benefit from a powerful domestic market: the US market accounts for 50% of the global market.\n\n## Increased demand for comprehensive offerings, covering all areas of expertise\n\nIn an uncertain environment marked by persistently low interest rates, clients - both retail and institutional - are looking for tailored, flexible solutions adapted to the market context. These solutions must therefore be able to include both traditional assets, under active or passive management, and real assets (real estate, private debt, private equity and infrastructure, amongst others). This represents an opportunity for players with a full range of expertise and allocation capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increasingly demanding regulation\n\nSince the 2008 crisis, increasing regulatory requirements have required significant investments and led to industrial logic.\n\n## Stronger client needs for services and new uses\n\nDistributors are also subject to pressure on margins, stricter regulatory requirements, particularly in terms of advisory services, and changing client expectations. As a result, they are increasingly looking for partners capable of offering them a complete range of solutions: operational services, management and advisory solutions, as well as digital tools, made even more essential by the health crisis. Similarly, institutional clients may request advisory services or need to outsource all or part of their investment processes.",

        "page_content": "## Growing investor expectations for ESG issues\n\nBeyond economic considerations, the asset management industry is also facing ESG challenges. Investors now want to be more responsible towards the environment, society and in terms of governance. They are therefore looking for investment solutions that fully integrate these factors. This trend has accelerated: in 2020, 49% of flows in medium and long-term assets went to funds with an ESG (1) dimension.\n\n## New opportunities in Asia\n\nLastly, the crisis of 2020 accelerated the shift in economic growth  from  Western  countries  to  Asia.  This  has accentuated the need for savings solutions among the middle classes in emerging Asian countries, particularly in China and India.\n\n## An effective strategy that remains unchanged\n\nThe strategy implemented by Amundi since 2010 is fully in line with these developments. It is based on the following priorities:\n\n## 1. Accelerate our development in our two client segments, Retail and Institutional, by:\n\n- consolidating our leadership as a preferred partner of networks and distributors, building on a range of solutions, services and tools adapted to each distribution channel,\n- increasing  penetration  among  institutional  clients, leveraging our full range of expertise and our advisory and services offering.\n- 2. Support this development with a highperformance management offering that is constantly being enriched, by continuing to invest in fast-growing areas of expertise (in particular passive management and real assets) and in new solutions (discretionary management, to name\n\njust one).\n\n## 3. Consolidate our leadership in Europe and roll out more extensively in Asia, building on\n\nour direct presence,  our  joint  ventures  and  new partnerships, notably the acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management and the creation of a new subsidiary in China in partnership with Bank of China.\n\n## 4. Leverage the efficiency of our industrial\n\nmodel to keep costs among the lowest in the industry, a key competitive advantage  in  an  environment  of persistently low interest rates. The constant search for productivity gains and economies of scale enables us to finance the investments necessary for development, while ensuring that our offers remain competitive.\n\n## 5. Transform technology into a new growth driver by:\n\n- continuing to invest in our IT platform and promoting it to external clients through our Amundi Technology offering;\n- enriching the range of support services for distribution networks by deploying innovative, customised digital tools.\n\n## 6. Strengthen our positioning as a responsible\n\ninvestor, a commitment at the very core of Amundi's model, which is embodied in both:\n\n- the widespread consideration of extra-financial criteria in all our management activities and in our engagement policy vis-\u00e0-vis issuers;\n- the  development  of  specific  innovative  solutions  to meet the growing demand of our clients.\n\n## 7. Favour organic development strategy that applies  to  all  our  businesses,  areas  of  expertise  and geographies. This strategy may be complemented\n\nby external acquisitions if they create sufficient value to enable to accelerate the implementation of our strategy.",

This strategic positioning, which has not changed since Amundi was created, is part of an asset management industry that has undergone some profound changes (see pages 8 and 9).\n\n## 1.1.1 A unique positioning as a European leader with a global focus\n\nSince its creation at the beginning of 2010, Amundi has been able to combine growth and profitability, becoming the European leader in asset management with a global presence. Between 2010 and 2020, Amundi's assets under management have multiplied by 2.6, primarily through organic growth:\n\n## Development of Amundi's assets under management (3) from 2010 to 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestments\n\nAAGR: Average Annual Growth Rate.\n\nThis growth was accompanied by the successful transformation of Amundi from a captive asset manager into an open platform, with particularly strong growth outside France (notably in Asia and Europe), and outside of the Group networks (4) .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given its origins, it has developed a unique partnership approach with distribution networks (particularly banking networks), thereby positioning the Group internationally as the key player in this segment. Most notably, Amundi's value proposition is based on a range of products, services and tools adapted to each partner distribution network.\n\nLocally-based (local networks) or centralised (for cross-border flagship funds) teams exclusively serve partner networks and third party distributors to provide the best response to their specific needs, including the deployment of innovative and customised digital tools to adapt to changes in the distribution environment.\n\n- /uni25A0 Amundi is the market leader in France/uni00A0 (1) thanks to the quasi-exclusivity partnership it has with the Group's networks (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, LCL) and its partnership with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, which was renewed for a further five years in November 2020. The terms of this partnership are that Amundi will remain the main supplier\n- of savings products and solutions for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's networks.\n- /uni25A0 Outside France, at the time of the Pioneer acquisition in 2017, Amundi entered into a ten-year distribution agreement with the UniCredit networks in Italy, Germany, Austria and in Eastern Europe. Amundi also remains the preferred supplier for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale networks in Italy (CA Italie), the Czech Republic (Komer\u010dni Banka) and Poland (CA Polska). Amundi is also in partnership with BAWAG P.S.K. in Austria and Resona in Japan. Since/uni00A0July 2020, Amundi has been embarking on a new long-term strategic partnership in Spain with Banco Sabadell, alongside the acquisition of Sabadell AM. This new distribution agreement will be in place for 10 years.\n- /uni25A0 This distribution capacity is complemented by third-party distributors in Europe, Asia and the US, private banks, distribution platforms and a network of independent wealth management advisers, for whom dedicated offers and specific commercial initiatives are deployed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach client segment has its own sales, marketing and customer service teams which are often located in close proximity thanks to Amundi's presence in more than 35 countries. These teams are tasked with designing products and services that address the specific needs of clients. They accomplish this with the support of management platforms, back-o/ffice and risk management functions and an integrated IT infrastructure.\n\nThis type of organisation facilitates client access to Amundi's international expertise, a high level of customisation in the products o/ffered, and economies of scale.",

The Chinese asset management market is expected to grow more than 10% per annum between 2019 and 2025. (5) .\n\nThe new subsidiary, in which Amundi holds 55%, is the first majority foreign-capital company in China to offer Wealth Management products. The implementation of this project was completed quickly, and in accordance with the timetable announced: the regulator's authorisation was obtained in September 2020, the teams and infrastructure were put in place shortly thereafter, and the operational start-up took place in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the launch of the first products intended primarily for the BOC network.\n\nThe subsidiary, which is expected to achieve financial equilibrium from the end of 2021, aims to achieve \u20ac60 billion in assets under management and more than \u20ac50 million in net income (at 100%) by 2025.\n\n- /uni25A0 In addition, Amundi has joint ventures , which are predominantly Asian, operating in India (with State Bank of India, the largest bank in the country (1) ), in China, (with Agricultural Bank of China, the third largest Chinese bank (2) ), in South Korea (with Nonghyup Bank, one of the top five banking groups in Korea (3) ) and in Morocco (with the Wafa banking group).\n\n## ASIA, A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY\n\nIn Asia, a rapidly developing region that is becoming increasingly significant in the global asset management market, Amundi has for many years held solid positions in all the region's major markets (\u20ac298 billion in total assets (6) ) , focusing on high-growth countries such as China and India.\n\nThe development strategy has been pragmatic, with a twopronged approach combining joint venture partnerships with large retail banks (7) (market leaders) and wholly-owned subsidiaries. This ambitious policy in Asia has paid off: Amundi's assets have multiplied seven-fold in 10 years and represent 17% of its total assets at the end of 2020.\n\nBy way of an example, SBI FM, the joint venture undertaken in partnership with the largest (8) Indian bank, is now the market leader (assets of \u20ac136 billion at the end of 2020, which have been growing sharply since 2018), with Retail business developing successfully and a well-established franchise among institutional investors.\n\nFor Asia as a whole, the Amundi Group aims to achieve target assets under management of \u20ac500 billion by 2025.\n\n1",

These services represent a significant market, valued at more than \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion (1) worldwide, which is favoured by the tendency among service providers to refocus on their core business.\n\nOffered in all countries in which Amundi operates, these solutions are Cloud-based and cover portfolio management, with ALTO Investment, wealth advice, advisory solutions through ALTO Wealth & Distribution, as well as employee and collective savings. They are intended for asset managers,\n\nretail banks and private banks, as well as institutional clients and asset servicers. They can be supplemented by bespoke services, such as market data management, order execution and middle o/ffice services.\n\nThis o/ffering leverages Amundi's expertise and know-how: 700 R&D engineers and project managers, based in two hubs (Dublin and Paris).\n\nThis new growth opportunity for Amundi could generate revenues of up to \u20ac150 million in 2025.\n\n## 1.1.4 Amundi, a responsible investor and company\n\nActing as a responsible financial institution is a core commitment of Amundi's development strategy. This commitment is reflected in its ESG management (2) and the range of ESG investment solutions that are tailored to the growing needs of its clients. It is also reflected in the Company's corporate social responsibility policy (CSR). This policy is the foundation of the commitments Amundi has made to its clients, employees and society in general.\n\nA pioneer since its creation, Amundi has considered the inclusion of ESG (3) as one of its founding pillars. In 2018, an ambitious plan was announced to expand that approach (4) , applying ESG criteria across all of its investment expertise and developing specific initiatives dedicated to funding the energy transition and social inclusion by doubling assets under management from \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac20 billion.\n\nThese commitments, announced in 2018, are met:\n\n- /uni25A0 100% of actively-managed, open-ended funds (5) now include ESG criteria ; the objective for each fund's portfolio is to have a better ESG rating than its benchmark universe;\n- /uni25A0 assets under management for specific initiatives (funding the energy transition and social inclusion) totalled \u20ac22 billion at the end of 2020;\n- /uni25A0 At the end of 2020, the Amundi Solidarit\u00e9 fund reached \u20ac330 million in assets under management, versus \u20ac200 million in 2018;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi's ESG Analysis now covers 10,000 issuers (vs. 5,500 in 2018);\n- /uni25A0 numerous partnerships and innovations were initiated with public entities (including IFC (6) , EIB (7) and AIIB (8) ), to develop climate-specific products and solutions.\n\nTotal assets managed as responsible investment increased from \u20ac276 billion at the end of 2018 to \u20ac378 billion at the end of 2020, including \u20ac331 million (versus \u20ac219 million at the end of 2018) in assets held for the Fonds Finance et Solidarit\u00e9s .\n\nThis increase in assets under management has benefited from continued innovation in ESG products and solutions, illustrated by active participation in new sustainable finance initiatives, partnerships with recognised service providers in energy transition and the development of appropriate measurement tools (low carbon, climate change, etc.) that promote the development of thematic products that directly\n\ncontribute to energy transition objectives.\n\nThe engagement policy has been strengthened with two main priorities relating to dialogue with issuers and voting policy:\n\n- /uni25A0 contribution to energy transition;\n- /uni25A0 contribution to social cohesion.\n\nAmundi's contribution to international initiatives continued, and a report entitled 'Responsible Capitalism: An Opportunity for Europe' was published in September 2020 by the Institut Montaigne and the Comit\u00e9 M\u00e9dicis, a think tank supported by Amundi.\n\nFurthermore, in its annual PRI (9) evaluation in September 2020, Amundi achieved an A+ rating (highest rating) in all the categories it entered, confirming that we have applied our ESG strategy within our various asset classes.\n\nIn a world where clients' expectations in terms of more responsible investments and environmental requirements are increasingly high, Amundi intends to strengthen its position as a responsible investor in order to combine financial and non-financial value creation.\n\n1",

This may be supplemented by external growth operations if these enable Amundi to accelerate the implementation of this strategy by creating value.\n\n## COVID-19: A CRISIS THAT CONFIRMED THE ROBUSTNESS OF AMUNDI'S BUSINESS MODEL\n\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic was an intense global crisis without modern precedent. This health crisis has become an economic crisis; this is reflected in the sharp drops and increased volatility on financial markets. As far as Amundi is concerned, the main financial impact comes from the sensitivity of the managed assets to this fall in the financial markets (equity, rates, etc.), with the resultant e/ffect on their valuation and on net asset management revenues (see sensitivity table in section 4.6); the fall in the financial markets also had a negative impact on the financial results.\n\nOverall, Amundi has managed to cope with this crisis and continue the Company's normal operations thanks to the robustness of its IT platform, e/ffectiveness of its BCP (1) and the rapid roll-out of teleworking, which was implemented to protect employees' health and to maintain a high level of operational e/fficiency for clients.\n\nMaintaining this high level of service to our customers was achieved through immediate communication regarding the continuity of our service and ability to provide support, as well as the implementation of digital tools to support partner networks in understanding the market environment and conducting sales activities remotely.\n\nLastly, the financial impact of the crisis was reduced by the diversification of the Group's assets by segment/asset class/geography, by the low cost-to-income ratio and an adjusted cost base.\n\nThe scale and duration of this crisis remains difficult to predict.",

The objectives were as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 Activity: \u20ac150 billion in cumulative inflows between 2018 and 2020. This target was exceeded, with a cumulative net inflow over the period of \u20ac195 billion.\n- /uni25A0 Operational e/fficiency: an adjusted cost-to-income ratio (1) of less than 53% over the period. In 2020, the cost-toincome ratio was 51.7%, significantly better than the target. The cost-to-income ratio was 50.9% in 2019 and 51.5% in 2018.\n- /uni25A0 Profitability: a doubling of adjusted net income (1) compared to 2015 (the year of Amundi's IPO), i.e. an adjusted net income of \u20ac1,050 million. In 2020, adjusted net income was \u20ac962 million, but this would exceed \u20ac1 billion if the market e/ffect were excluded (2) .\n- /uni25A0 Dividend: a distribution rate of 65% of net income. The dividend payment policy was in line with the objective for the 2018-2020 period, with the exception of the dividend for 2019 due to the ECB's recommendation that institutions under its supervision should suspend all payments.\n\nIn June 2019, as part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Medium-Term Plan 2022, Amundi confirmed its strategic ambitions with two financial objectives, based on the assumption that the market e/ffect over the 2018-2022 period would be neutral:\n\n- /uni25A0 Profitability: an average annual growth target of/uni00A0+5% for adjusted net income (1) between 2018 and 2022. Between 2018 and 2020, the average annual growth rate was ~3.5%, excluding market e/ffect (2) .\n- /uni25A0 Operational e/fficiency : an adjusted cost-to-income ratio (1) that is less than or equal to 53%. Between 2019 and 2020, the average cost-to-income ratio was 51.3%, significantly better than the maximum set.\n\n## Non-financial objectives\n\nA pioneer since its creation, Amundi has considered the inclusion of ESG (3) as one of its founding pillars. In 2018, an ambitious plan was announced to expand that approach, applying ESG criteria across all of its investment expertise and developing specific initiatives dedicated to funding the energy transition and social inclusion by doubling assets under management from \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac20 billion.\n\nThese commitments, announced in 2018, are met:\n\n- /uni25A0 100% of actively-managed, open-ended funds (4) now include ESG criteria ; the objective for each fund's portfolio is to have a better ESG rating than its benchmark universe.\n- /uni25A0 Assets under management for specific initiatives (funding the energy transition and social inclusion) totalled \u20ac22 billion at the end of 2020 (versus \u20ac10 billion at the end of 2018). The objective, to double the amount, was achieved.\n- /uni25A0 At the end of 2020, the Amundi Solidarit\u00e9 fund reached \u20ac330 million in assets under management, versus \u20ac200 million in 2018 (the objective is to reach \u20ac500 million by the end of 2021).\n- /uni25A0 Amundi's ESG analysis now covers 10,000 issuers, versus 5,500 three years ago (the objective is to cover more than 10,000 issuers by the end of 2021).\n- /uni25A0 Numerous partnerships and innovations were initiated with public entities (including IFC, EIB and AIIB), to develop climate-specific products and solutions.\n\n1",

With a float of nearly 30% since April 2017, liquidity showed noticeable improvement, which helped to attract new investors.\n\n## Stock market indices\n\nThe security became part of the French SBF 120 index on 18/uni00A0March 2016. In/uni00A0November 2017, the share also joined the MSCI index family, thanks to the improved liquidity resulting from the capital increase of/uni00A0April 2017.\n\nAmundi is also a member of the responsible investment indices ESG FTSE4Good and Euronext Vigeo Eiris, which reflects its good CSR (1) profile (see Chapter/uni00A03 of this Universal Registration Document).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2) Data as of 31 December 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Relations with shareholders and/uni00A0the/uni00A0financial community\n\nIn addition to the required regulated financial disclosures, Amundi has, since its listing, implemented a policy regarding disclosure and communication with the financial community that is aimed at maintaining a relationship based on trust:\n\n- /uni25A0 quarterly results: Amundi's senior management presents quarterly results to the market via conference calls or faceto-face meetings;\n- /uni25A0 relations with investors and shareholders: the management or the Investor Relations team meet around 400 French and foreign institutional investors during roadshows and at general or industry-specific conferences;\n- /uni25A0 sell-side analysts: as of 31 December 2020, the Amundi stock is covered by 22 French and foreign brokers. The majority of these brokers see a positive outlook for the Amundi share (15 'buy' ratings, 6 'hold' ratings and 1 'sell' rating) (2) . Their average target price was \u20ac73.35;\n- /uni25A0 investor and financial analyst opinions on Amundi have remained very positive: the share price trajectory since initial listing has highlighted the Group's capacity for growth and the resilience of its results, thanks to its diversified business model. Despite the many challenges facing the asset management sector, Amundi is seen as a sound player with a significant growth outlook.",

Under such a scenario, the Company will inform its shareholders through a press release.\n\nThe Amundi AGM to be held on 10 May 2021 will be asked to approve the renewal of the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors to perform transactions on Amundi shares, which will enable the continued operation of the share buyback programme currently in progress, as described below in section/uni00A01.2.8.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.8 Description of Amundi share buyback programme to be submitted to/uni00A0the next AGM of 10 May 2021\n\nDuring the AGM to be held on 10 May 2021, shareholders will be asked to renew for a period of 18 months the share buyback authorisation granted to the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the provisions of Article/uni00A0241-2 of the AMF General Regulation, the description of this programme can be found below.\n\n## Number of securities and portion of the/uni00A0share capital directly held by Amundi\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the number of shares directly held by Amundi was 685,055 shares, i.e. 0.3% of the share capital.\n\n## Breakdown of securities held according to/uni00A0objective\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the shares held by Amundi could be broken down as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 591,587 shares intended to cover the commitments to employees under the performance share plan;\n- /uni25A0 93,468 shares held under the liquidity contract for market making purposes.\n\n## Share buyback programme objectives\n\nUnder the share buyback programme that will be submitted to the combined AGM of 10 May 2021, the shares may be acquired at any time within the limits permitted by legal or regulatory provisions in e/ffect, including during takeover bids or public exchange o/ffers initiated by the Company or those targeting the securities of the Company, particularly in view of the following allocations:\n\n- /uni25A0 the allocation or sale of shares to employees as part of a profit sharing agreement or the implementation of any company or group savings schemes (or a similar scheme) under the terms and conditions provided by law, particularly Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A03332-1 et seq. of the French Labour Code;\n- /uni25A0 the allocation of performance shares pursuant to the provisions of Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-59, L./uni00A022-10-60/uni00A0and L./uni00A0225197-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code;\n- /uni25A0 generally, to honour the obligations associated with share allocation programmes for employees or company o/fficers of the issuer or an associated company;\n- /uni25A0 the distribution of shares at the time of the exercise of the rights attached to securities giving access to the capital through reimbursement, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or in any other way;\n- /uni25A0 the cancellation of all or of a portion of the securities thus bought back;\n- /uni25A0 the stimulation of the secondary market or of liquidity for Amundi shares by an investment services provider under the terms of a liquidity contract in compliance with the Code of Conduct recognised by the AMF.\n\nThe goal of this programme is also to facilitate the implementation of any market practice that may be permitted in the future by the AMF, and more generally, the completion of any other transactions that are compliant with regulations in e/ffect. Under such a scenario, the Company will inform its shareholders through a press release.\n\n## Maximum amount allocated to the/uni00A0buyback programme, maximum number and/uni00A0characteristics of the securities that/uni00A0may be/uni00A0acquired\n\nPurchases of Company shares may involve a number of shares such that, as of the date of each buyback, the total number of shares purchased by the Company since the start of the buyback programme (including those involved in said buyback) does not exceed 10% of the shares making up the share capital of the Company on that date (taking into account transactions impacting this number after the AGM of 10 May 2021), i.e. for information purposes, as of 31 December 2020, an upper limit for buybacks of 20,258,595 shares. It is moreover specified that (i) the number of shares acquired in view of their retention and subsequent assignment under the terms of a merger, demerger or contribution may not exceed 5% of the Company's share capital; and (ii) when the shares are bought back to promote liquidity under the conditions defined by the AMF General Regulation, the number of shares taken into account to calculate the 10% limit stipulated above is the number of shares purchased, minus the number of shares resold during the validity of the authorisation.\n\nThe overall amount allocated to the share buyback programme cannot exceed \u20ac1/uni00A0billion. The securities that Amundi intends to acquire are exclusively shares.\n\n## Maximum authorised unit purchase price\n\nThe maximum purchase price of the shares under the buyback programme will be \u20ac120 per share (or the exchange value of this amount on the same date in any other currency). It is proposed that the AGM delegates to the Board of Directors, in the event of a change in the par value of the share, a capital increase via the capitalisation of reserves, the allocation of performance shares, the split or reverse split of securities, the distribution of reserves or any other assets, the redemption of share capital, or any other transaction involving the share capital or equity, the power to adjust the aforementioned maximum purchase price to take into account the impact of these transactions on the value of the share.\n\n## Duration of the share buyback programme\n\nThe share buyback programme may be implemented for a period of 18 months from the date of the AGM of 10 May 2021.\n\nThe authorisation presented to shareholders during this AGM will supersede, e/ffective 10 May 2021, any prior delegation, up to its unused portion where applicable, granted to the Board of Directors to transact on the Company's shares.\n\n1",

She has been a member of the Executive Committee since 2013 and of the General Management Committee since 2016. She heads the following businesses: CPR AM, the ETF, indices & smart beta, and the Distribution and Wealth division. She has been a key player in Amundi's success, thanks to the development of the index/ETF business and of CPR AM, as well as her active contribution to the General Management. Val\u00e9rie Baudson will become a member of the Executive Committee and Deputy General Manager of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\n## /uni25A0 Yves Perrier will become Chair of the Board of Directors.\n\nYves Perrier, who has led the company for the past 14 years, was the architect behind the creation of Amundi in 2010 and steered its development. Today, Amundi is the European asset management leader and one of the top players globally. Under the leadership of Yves Perrier, the company saw substantial development achieved through organic growth, supplemented by successful external growth operations, in particular the acquisition of Pioneer in 2017. Assets under management have multiplied by 2.5 since 2010 and earnings have virtually doubled since its Initial Public O/ffering in 2015. The company's stock market capitalization has also virtually doubled since the IPO. Going beyond its economic performance, Amundi has confirmed its position as a leader in ESG, particularly by applying extra-financial criteria across all its management operations.\n\nThe Board considers that this change in governance will ensure that Amundi continues to develop in line with the strategy that has been implemented successfully since it was launched.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Appointments Committee, the Board of Directors also decided the following other matters:\n\n- /uni25A0 to renew the term of o/ffice as Non-voting member of Jean Michel Forest, Chair of Caisse R\u00e9gionale de Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Loire Haute Loire, and not to renew the term of o/ffice of Gianni Franco Papa, retired former senior executive at UniCredit;\n- /uni25A0 to propose to the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, the renewal for a three-year term of o/ffice of the following three directors:\n- /uni25A0 Mich\u00e8le Guibert, Regional Director of Caisse R\u00e9gionale des C\u00f4tes d'Armor, who was co-opted to the Board during the course of the year to replace Ren\u00e9e Talamona. Mich\u00e8le Guibert was selected primarily for her expertise in the area of risk management, compliance and internal audit. This expertise fully justifies her position as a member of the Risk Management Committee,\n- /uni25A0 William Kadouch-Chassaing, Deputy General Manager in charge of Finance of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who brings his expertise in the field of accounting and financial information, as well as banking regulations,\n- /uni25A0 Michel Mathieu, who has solid experience as a senior executive of a banking institution, by virtue of his position as Chief Executive O/fficer of LCL.\n\nThe Board also called upon the Meeting not to renew the directorship of Henri Buecher, Chair of Caisse R\u00e9gionale du Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Alsace Vosges, who is to retire. To replace him, the Board will propose that the Meeting appoints Patrice Genti\u00e9, Chair of Caisse R\u00e9gionale du Cr\u00e9dit Agricole d'Aquitaine.\n\nFurthermore, \u00c9ric Taz\u00e9-Bernard informed the Board of his intention to step down as Director elected by the employees at the end of the next General Meeting in favour of his deputy, Estelle M\u00e9nard, Deputy Head of Global Thematic Equity Management at CPR Asset Management, an Amundi Group company.\n\nFinally, Andr\u00e9e Samat also announced to the Board of Directors that she would be retiring and resigning from her role as Director of the Company during the course of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For any information pertaining to these items, please refer to Articles/uni00A012 and 14 of the Articles/uni00A0of Association as well as Articles/uni00A02 and 3 of the Rules of Procedure provided in their entirety in Chapter/uni00A08 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nTerm and staggering of mandates: in accordance with recommendation 13.2 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the expiration of the three-year terms of o/ffice of directors is appropriately spread over time. Each year, the term of o/ffice of four directors expires, allowing for the renewal of the entire Board over time.\n\nBoard Diversity Policy: the Board of Directors' diversity policy seeks to ensure an adequate balance and appropriate distribution of experience, skills, cultures and seniority, in order to best meet the needs of the Company . The profiles of each Board member are presented in section/uni00A02.1 'Overview of the Company O/fficers'.\n\nWith regard to cultural diversity , it should be noted that apart from the non-voting member, Gianni Franco Papa, who is an Italian national, and whose term of o/ffice has not been renewed by the Board, the other members of the Board who are French nationals have an international profile or professional experience, particularly in Asia and Europe, which aligns perfectly with Amundi's development strategy.\n\nThis diversity policy also incorporates a gender equality policy in the composition of the Board and its committees. The Board exceeds the applicable French legal requirements in this respect , with five out of twelve directors being women (42%) (1) . Each of the Board's specialised committees also includes a woman amongst its members, two of whom are committee chairs (see section 2.2.4 - Overview of the Committees).\n\nThis desire for balanced gender representation also extends to the Company's internal organisation (see section/uni00A02.3.3 Overview of the Group's management bodies). The Board of Directors discusses this issue annually during its review of the Report on Professional Equality, on the heels of an in-depth\n\nanalysis by the Compensation Committee. It should be noted that in 2019, the Board had approved four main areas of focus that were developed through initiatives which implementation began in 2020. These four main areas of focus which should guide the actions of the company's HR function, include equal pay and encouraging women towards positions of responsibility. In 2020, these concrete measures enabled Amundi to improve its Gender Equality Index rating, with a score of 83 points , compared with 81 in 2019.\n\nTraining/Seminars: the directors are usually asked to take part in two training sessions during the year, which aim both to enhance their knowledge and skills and to give them a more thorough understanding of the Company's business lines and strategic challenges. The themes change each year, depending on the regulatory situation, the Company's business topical matters, or the needs expressed by the members of the Board. During/uni00A02020, the health crisis resulted in both meetings having to be adjusted. The first session took the form of information documents sent to the directors. The second session took place online at the end of the year. The directors were able to deepen their knowledge of the business through presentations on liquidity risk on the one hand, and Amundi's voting and commitment policy on the other. In addition, and in response to requests they made in 2019, the directors also received training in the digital tools available to them and information on regulatory updates in terms of compliance.\n\nMeetings without Senior Executives and Company O/fficers in attendance: the end-of-year training session was an opportunity for directors to meet without the Chair of the Board or the Chief Executive O/fficer attending.\n\nAssessments: in 2020, the Board carried out two formal selfassessments at the initiative of the Appointments Committee and as recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code. One of these assessments related to the collective functioning of the Board (collective self-assessment) and the other consisted of an individual self-assessment of competencies, supplemented again this year by an individual declaration by each director. The assessment took the form of online panels of theme-based questions. Members completed the collective questionnaire anonymously to preserve their freedom of expression.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The assessment of the collective functioning of the Board measures the e/ffectiveness of its functioning, composition and organisation. For 2020, each director gave their assessment of the preparation and implementation of the Board's work, through, among others, an assessment of the frequency and quality of meetings. They also voted on the quality of the Committees and training courses, as well as, this year, on the quality of the work carried out by the Board, despite the circumstances caused by the health crisis. The Appointments Committee prepared a summary and presented it to the Board: this summary highlighted an overall satisfaction rating of 98.94%, stable compared to the previous year, despite the public health situation that had prevented several meetings being held in person.\n\nIn 2020, the Board members rated particularly well the availability and quality of the teams in the Board's secretariat, reception and the atmosphere (100% very satisfied), as well as the conduct of meetings by the Chair (92.78% very satisfied). A more historical analysis of results over the past five years has revealed a significant improvement in satisfaction ratings in terms of the added value of the work carried out by the committees, as well as an overall assessment of the way in which the Board functions, reflecting an improvement over time in the good level of cooperation between its members.\n\nWith this aim of nurturing this collegiate spirit in mind, the directors also suggested organising a seminar for Board members, if the health situation so permits.\n\nThe self-assessment and individual declaration pertains to the Board member's skills, potential training needs, availability, independence, potential conflicts of interest, good character, and compliance with ethics rules. Individual feedback notably enables the Appointments Committee to support its analysis regarding the Board's collective competence and the actual contribution of each member (see 'Profiles of Individual Company O/fficers' and 'Skills' below). The feedback from each member also helps to refine the training programmes according to the needs that have been conveyed.\n\nSuccession plan: in 2018, the Appointments Committee presented to the Board a succession plan procedure pertaining to Senior Executives and Company Officers. In particular, it stipulates di/fferent Committee actions depending on the independent or non-independent classification of the Company O/fficer to be recruited. In addition, in the case of the Chief Executive O/fficer, the procedure states that the Appointments Committee will analyse the candidate(s) proposed by the majority shareholder.\n\nThis procedure was updated in 2020, in parallel with changes made to the remit of the Appointments Committee, to include monitoring the membership of the governing bodies of Amundi Group subsidiaries, by delegation to Senior Management, thus enabling a consistent and uniform overall system.\n\n## 2.2.1.2.1  Directors\n\nCompetence: a brief biography describing in broad terms the curriculum vitae of each Member of the Board as at 31 December 2020 is provided in the individual forms presented in Chapter 2.1 'Overview of the Company O/fficers'.\n\nIn accordance with banking regulations, the profile of each director was thoroughly examined by the European Central Bank (ECB) at the time of their appointment. At this time the Appointments Committee also specifically analyses reputation, availability and skills both on an individual and collective level.\n\nMoreover each director has declared three areas of excellence as their individual contribution to the collective competence of the Board (see section/uni00A02.1 'Overview of the Company O/fficers' of this Universal Registration Document). This provided the opportunity for a new expertise on social and environmental issues to appear on the Board in 2020. These areas of expertise are enhanced by skills that are developed each year thanks to Board training and meetings.\n\nDuring 2020, the directors saw an improvement in their competence, particularly in the areas of social and environmental issues, asset management and risk management. They also expressed a desire to receive training in 2021 to refine their knowledge of Amundi's developments in terms of asset management, international deployment and technology, in line with the strategic orientations the Company has adopted and undertaken.\n\nOn the basis of the review conducted by the Appointments Committee in 2020 on the assessment of the individual and collective skills of the Board of Directors, the collective competence of the Amundi Board of Directors remains similar to the profile shown in the assessment of the previous year. It is characterised by a predominance in strategic planning, with strong expertise in the areas of risks and ESG and balanced expertise in the areas of banking, governance and finance, as well as asset management and marketing.\n\nThus, the collective competence of the Board appears balanced and tailored to the needs of the Company.\n\nIndependent Directors: the Board of Directors refers to the following eight criteria as stipulated by Article/uni00A09 of the AFEP-MEDEF/uni00A0Code:\n\n## SUMMARY OF ARTICLE/uni00A09.5 OF THE AFEP-MEDEF CODE:\n\nCriterion 1. Employee or Company O/fficer in the last five years: Not to be or have been in the last five years:\n\n- \u25a0 an employee or executive o/fficer of the Company;\n- \u25a0 an employee, executive o/fficer or director of a company consolidated by the Company;\n- \u25a0 an employee, executive o/fficer or director of the parent company or a company consolidated by the parent company.\n\nCriterion 2. Cross-directorships: Not to be an executive o/fficer of a company in which the corporation holds a directorship, directly or indirectly, or in which an employee appointed as such or an Executive Company Officer of the corporation (current or having been for less than five years) has held a directorship.\n\nCriterion 3. Significant business relations: Not be a client (1) , supplier, commercial banker, investment banker or advisor that is material to the Company or its Group, or for a significant part of whose business the Company or its Group accounts. The evaluation of the significant or non-significant relationship\n\n<!-- image -->",

Family ties: Not to be related by close family ties to a Company O/fficer.\n\nCriterion 5. Statutory Auditor: Not to have been an auditor of the Company within the previous five years.\n\nCriterion 6. More than 12 years' service: Not to have been a director of the Company for more than 12 years. Loss of the status of independent director occurs on the date on which this period of 12 years is reached.\n\n## Criterion 7: Status of non-executive Company Officer: A\n\nnon-executive Company Officer may not be considered independent if they receive variable compensation in cash or securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or Group.\n\nCriterion 8. Status of major shareholder: Directors representing major shareholders of the Company or its parent company may be considered as independent so long as these shareholders do not participate in the control of the Company. However, above a 10% threshold of capital or voting rights, the Board, on the basis of a report from the Appointments Committee, shall systematically query whether the person can be considered as independent, taking into account the composition of the Company's capital and the existence of any potential conflict of interest.\n\nThe table below summarises the individual analysis of each director in relation to these eight criteria:\n\n| Director/Independence  criterion (1)   | Criterion 1   | Criterion 2   | Criterion 3   | Criterion 4   | Criterion 5   | Criterion 6   | Criterion 7   | Criterion 8   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Xavier Musca                           | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      |\n| Yves Perrier                           | /uni2716      | /uni2716      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | NA            | /uni2716      |\n| Henri Buecher                          | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2716      |\n| Virginie Cayatte                       | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2714      |\n| Laurence Danon-Arnaud                  | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2714      |\n| Mich\u00e8le Guibert                        | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2716      |\n| William Kadouch-Chassaing              | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2714      |\n| Robert Leblanc                         | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2714      |\n| Michel Mathieu                         | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2716      |\n| H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Molinari                        | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2714      |\n| Christian Rouchon                      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2716      |\n| Andr\u00e9e Samat                           | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2716      |\n| \u00c9ric Taz\u00e9-Bernard                      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2716      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | /uni2714      | NA            | /uni2714      |\n\nThe process of evaluating the independence of directors is the responsibility of the Appointments Committee.\n\nIn fact, having taken into account the individual statements of each member, every year the Appointments Committee analyses, for each independent director, any business relationships with the companies in which they hold other positions or functions and identifies any potential financial flows. This dual approach enables it to confirm to the Board that no such connections exist.\n\nDuring its meeting of 9 February 2021, the Board of Directors, having heard the recommendations made by its Appointments Committee, deemed that Virginie Cayatte, Laurence DanonArnaud, Robert Leblanc and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Molinari fulfilled all criteria permitting them to be qualified as independent members pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Board also noted that the investments made by the funds managed by the Amundi Group as part of its third-party asset management activities, in companies in which a director may hold o/ffice, are not included in its analysis.\n\n## 2.2.1.2.2  Director elected by the employees\n\nIt is reminded that under Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-27-1 paragraph/uni00A03 of the French Commercial Code, the Company is not required to include a director representing employees on its Board of Directors, as the parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., is itself subject to this obligation. Amundi is therefore exempt from the AFEP-MEDEF Code requirements on this point.\n\nNevertheless, the Board of Directors wished to use the optional regime set out in Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-27 of the French Commercial Code, under which a director may be elected by the Company's employees, if permitted by the Company's Articles/uni00A0of Association. As the General Meeting of 12 May 2016 approved this amendment to the Articles of Association, the Board now includes a Director elected by the employees. The aforementioned article also states that the director elected by the employees should not be taken into account when applying the rules relating to the requirement for gender balance under Article L. 225-18-1 of the same Code.\n\n\u00c9ric Taz\u00e9-Bernard, elected director on 12/uni00A0October 2016, was re-elected on 17/uni00A0April 2019 for a new three-year term with Estelle M\u00e9nard as his deputy. As already mentioned in Section 2.2.1.1.3, he has announced his intention to step down in her favour at the end of the next Meeting.",

In this way they fulfil their role as advisors to the Board and may give advice and recommendations.\n\nIt is specified that non-voting members are considered to be full members of the Board and accordingly comply with all rules applicable to directors (Stock Market Ethics Charter and Directors' Charter).\n\n## 2.2.1.3 Declarations concerning Company/uni00A0O/fficers\n\nAll the statements below have been drawn up on the basis of the individual statements by each director and non-voting member.\n\n## 2.2.1.3.1  No family ties\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, as of the filing date of this Universal Registration Document, there are no family ties among the members of the Board of Directors listed above and the members of the Company's Senior Management.\n\n## 2.2.1.3.2  No convictions\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, during the last five years: (i) none of the above persons has been convicted of fraud, (ii) none of the above persons has been associated with any bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation, (iii) no accusation and/ or o/fficial public sanctions have been pronounced against any of the above persons by statutory or regulatory authorities (including designated professional bodies), and (iv) none of the above persons has been disqualified by a court from acting as a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of any company, or from being involved in the management or performance of business of any company.\n\n## 2.2.1.3.3  Conflicts of interests\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, and subject to the relationships described in note 9.2 'Related Parties' of the consolidated financial statements (Chapter/uni00A06 of this Universal Registration Document), as of the filing date of this Universal Registration Document, there are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties owed to the Company by the members of the Board of Directors or the Company's Senior Management and their private interests.\n\nHowever, it should be remembered that, for historical reasons linked to the Partnership Agreement between the Company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, of 17/uni00A0June 2015, that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole made a commitment to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to ensure that, so long as all of the distribution agreements with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and Komer\u010dn\u00ed Banka and the management mandate with Sogecap are in e/ffect, a director of the Company will be appointed based on a proposal made by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (1) . Accordingly, William Kadouch-Chassaing was appointed as member of the Company's Board of Directors to replace Laurent Goutard in 2018. During 2020, William Kadouch-Chassaing occasionally found himself faced with conflicts of interest that did not allow him to participate in certain Board deliberations, mainly during the Board discussions on the renewal of the agreements between Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Amundi in November 2020.\n\nA number of directors were appointed in their own name based on a proposal by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, the majority shareholder: Xavier Musca, Yves Perrier, Henri Buecher, Michel Mathieu, Christian Rouchon, Andr\u00e9e Samat and Mich\u00e8le Guibert. The majority shareholder also proposed the appointment of Patrice Genti\u00e9 to replace Henri Buecher.\n\nAt the filing date of this Universal Registration Document no restrictions have been accepted by the members of the Board of Directors or the members of the Company's Senior Management on the sale of their shares in the Company, other than the following: (i) rules to prevent insider trading and (ii) recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code obliging directors to hold shares (except the director elected by the employees), translated as the requirement to hold 200 shares set out in Article/uni00A010 of the Articles/uni00A0of Association.\n\nFinally, no service agreement has been signed that binds any members of the administrative or management bodies to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, and providing benefits at its conclusion.\n\nElements relating to the management of conflicts of interest are mainly covered by the Company's Directors' Charter, as detailed below:\n\n## APPENDIX 1 TO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE - ARTICLE 9 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND INSIDE INFORMATION\n\nThe director reads and complies with Amundi's Market Ethics Charter.\n\nFurthermore, the director informs the Board of any conflicts of interest including potential ones, in which they could be directly or indirectly implicated. They refrain from participating in the discussions and taking decisions on the subjects concerned.\n\nThe director refrains from using for their personal benefit or for the benefit of whomsoever the inside information to which they have access. The director refrains from carrying out any\n\ntransaction on Amundi shares during the 30 calendar days that precede the publication of the yearly and half-yearly results and during the 15 calendar days that precede the publication of the quarterly financial information, as well as the day of the said publications.\n\nThe director must, in application of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), declare any personal transaction on a financial instrument if they consider that they potentially are in a situation of conflicts of interest or if they hold confidential information likely to be considered as inside information and acquired in relation to their duties as director.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The dates corresponding to these windows are provided to them at yearend for the following financial year.\n\n## 2.2.2 Activities of the Board of Directors during 2020\n\nIn 2020, the activities of the Board of Directors carried on at a sustained level, with five Board meetings and three written consultations, in accordance with the temporary provisions authorised in connection with the health crisis. The directors were genuinely involved, with an overall attendance rate of 96.7% at 22 Committee and Board meetings during the course of the year.\n\n## Health crisis\n\nDuring 2020, the Board of Directors was obviously concerned about the impact of the Covid-19 health crisis on the Company's activities and employees.\n\nIn particular, it ensured that the liquidity risks of the funds were well-managed, as was the action taken in terms of human resources and IT to enable all Group employees to work remotely or on site, as appropriate throughout the year, under satisfactory and secure conditions. Furthermore, three times during the year, the Board was required to make decisions quickly using the written consultation procedure, as authorised by law during the period. Thus, ahead of the General Meeting in 2020, the Board amended the resolutions initially planned as regards the distribution of a dividend, on the one hand, in order to take into account the recommendations of the ECB, and on the other, as regards the Chief Executive O/fficer's compensation for 2020, to reflect his wish to waive a substantial portion of what had initially been awarded. Finally, at the end of September, the Board authorised its Chair to apply to the Commercial Court to extend the dividend distribution period beyond 30 September, on the assumption that the ECB would review its position on the matter.\n\n## Business, non-financial challenges and/uni00A0strategy\n\nEach quarter the Board of Directors examined the change in overall performance of the products managed by all the management companies of the Amundi Group, as well as changes in the inflow of the various client segments. It also\n\ncarefully monitored the contribution to earnings made by the joint ventures. It also decided this year to look more closely at the progress the Company had made in the area of CSR and ESG, in accordance with its objectives.\n\nIn the non-financial domain, in December 2020 the Board also adopted a procedure to ensure that social and environmental issues are taken into proper consideration in the various areas of its competence and reinforcing some of the duties of its specialised committees, where it considered it necessary to do so.\n\nWith regard to strategy, the Board also expressed its opinion on specific cases during 2020. In this regard, it monitored progress towards the launch of Amundi BoC Wealth Management, in association with Bank of China, enabling Amundi to confirm its ambition as regards the Asian market, as unveiled in the financial press release issued in October 2020. It also ensured the smooth integration of Sabadell Asset Management, a company acquired from Banco Sabadell, the Spanish bank with which Amundi has signed a distribution contract.\n\nFinally, 2020 provided an opportunity for the Board to renew distribution agreements with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord networks and to look at other opportunities for external growth.\n\n## Examination of financial statements and/uni00A0financial information, and relations with/uni00A0the Statutory Auditors\n\nIn addition to preparing the annual parent company and consolidated financial statements, the Board also examined the half-yearly and quarterly results for 2020. On each of these occasions it heard from the Statutory Auditors, who presented their findings. It approved all the financial documentation prepared in this regard, having taken into account the proposed improvements put forward by the Audit Committee.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Board of Directors also made decisions on the presentation of the 2021 budget and the financial trajectory of the Company for the 2022-2023 period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

After taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the three candidates selected, the Board decided to follow the recommendation of its Audit Committee and propose that the next General Meeting appoints Cabinet Mazars, which has a strong presence in the financial sector, to replace Ernst & Young, whose term of o/ffice is expiring.\n\n## Risks and internal control\n\nEach quarter, the Board of Directors examines in detail the changes and events of internal control via a presentation by the Head of the Support and Control division and the report of the Risk Management Committee, presented by its Chair.\n\nIt also approves the annual internal control report prepared pursuant to banking regulations and provided to the ACPR, as well as the half-year report on internal control provided to the majority shareholder.\n\nDuring 2020, the Board was also made aware of a notice of complaints sent by the AMF as part of an investigation conducted from 2017 to 2019 and monitored the measures taken by the management in respect of this matter and ensured the Company's full cooperation connection with this procedure.\n\n## Governance, gender equality and compensation\n\nIn addition to the preparation of General Meetings that each year requires work adapting the Board and its operating rules to regulatory changes, the work of the Board of Directors on governance and compensation-related matters was primarily focused on the following topics in 2020:\n\n- /uni25A0 the co-opting of Mich\u00e8le Guibert as a director to replace Ren\u00e9e Talamona, who resigned;\n- /uni25A0 approving the principles of the compensation policy for 2020, as well as ensuring it complies with the applicable regulations in the area of asset management and banking with regard to the categories of identified sta/ff;\n- /uni25A0 the compensation of senior executives and company o/fficers as well as the allocation of compensation among the members of the Board;\n- /uni25A0 implementing a capital increase reserved for employees;\n- /uni25A0 analysing the Report on gender pay equality and the progress made in 2020 in the area of gender equality, as well as setting objectives in the gender equality policy;\n- /uni25A0 amending the rules of procedure to take into account any agreed changes.\n\n## Regulated agreements and the procedure for/uni00A0evaluating current agreements\n\nDuring the course of the 2020 financial year, no regulated agreements within the meaning of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-38 of the French Commercial Code were signed. The Board of Directors noted the continuation of just one agreement that was concluded and authorised during a previous year, and which continues to fall within the scope of application of the regime of regulated agreements, namely the contract for the charge-back of 80% of the overall compensation and related expenses of Yves Perrier.\n\nThe partnership agreement with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA on industrial agreements concluded with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group, which previously fell within the scope of regulated agreements, came to an end with the renewal of the agreements being concluded directly between Amundi and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the procedure adopted in 2020 on assessing agreements relating to current transactions and concluded under normal conditions, the Board verified that the Audit Committee had carried out the work necessary to implement it properly.\n\nIt should be remembered that the procedure approved by the Board of Directors is based on the following key principles:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure;\n- /uni25A0 the procedures to be performed to evaluate the agreements are based on criteria set by the Audit Committee which refer to those established by the Commission Nationale des commissaires aux comptes (French National Board of Auditors);\n- /uni25A0 individuals who may have a direct or indirect interest in an agreement are excluded from the evaluation process;\n- /uni25A0 the Company's Statutory Auditors or the Audit Committee are consulted over legal disputes;\n- /uni25A0 finally, the Board of Directors shall oversee any work carried out by the Audit Committee in this regard.\n\n## 2.2.3 Overview of the Specialised committees and their activities in 2020\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Articles/uni00A0of Association and the applicable banking regulations, the Board has set up specialised committees that are tasked with carrying out detailed examinations of specific matters relating to the Board of Directors' mandate. These committees have no decisionmaking powers. Their task is to study any issue relating to the Company that is submitted to them by the Board or by the Chair, to carry out preliminary work and prepare for the decisions by the Board in the form of reports, proposals, opinions, information or recommendations.\n\nThe committee members are appointed by the Board of Directors, which may remove them at any time. A member of a committee may resign his or her functions at any time. All members of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncommittees and anyone attending the committee meetings are bound by professional confidentiality.\n\nThe Chair of each committee will call the meetings and validate the meeting agenda or the main purpose, taking into consideration the requests of members, and in accordance with the committee's powers. The Board of Directors may also make a specific request to each committee within the scope of its powers, and may ask the Committee Chair to call an exceptional meeting on that topic.\n\nEach committee may meet by any means, including via video or teleconference. It may also give its opinion by written consultation.",

The Code can be viewed at www.afep.com or www.medef.com\n\nThe Company complies with all the recommendations in this Code.\n\nAs regards 2020, however, the following points should be noted:/uni00A0\n\n## ARTICLE/uni00A022\n\n## TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS FOR COMPANY OFFICERS\n\n'When an employee is appointed as an Executive Company Of/ficer, it is recommended to terminate his or her employment contract with the company or with a company af/filiated to the group, whether through contractual termination or resignation.'\n\nYves Perrier is a member of the Executive Committee and Deputy Managing Director, Head of/uni00A0the Savings and Real Estate division of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. In this respect, he oversees other activities of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, such as some of the real estate activities conducted by the subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Immobilier, and consequently, he has an employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. By virtue of the above responsibilities, Yves Perrier will continue to bene/fit from this employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. until he retires.\n\n## ARTICLE/uni00A023\n\n## OBLIGATION OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND COMPANY OFFICERS TO HOLD SHARES\n\n'The Board of Directors de/fines a minimum number of registered shares that Senior Executives and Company Of/ficers must retain through to the end of their term of of/fice. This decision is reviewed at least on each extension of their term of of/fice.'\n\nThe Company's Articles/uni00A0of Association require that each director holds at least 200 shares of the Company. The decision to acquire additional shares is to be made by each director individually. In this respect, the Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Of/ficer, who is also a director, comply with the Articles/uni00A0of Association.\n\nAs the requirement to hold a minimum number of shares is imposed by the Articles/uni00A0of Association, this number is not reviewed at each reappointment.\n\nNo other special provisions have been put in place for the Senior Executives and Company Of/ficers. In fact, no share options or performance shares have been granted to senior executives and company of/ficers and a substantial part of executive company of/ficers' compensation depends on and/or is indexed to Amundi's share performance.\n\n| ARTICLE/uni00A025                                                               | COMPENSATION OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND COMPANY OFFICERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 25.5                                                                            | DEPARTURE OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND COMPANY OFFICERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Payments for assumption of  duties, termination of of/fice and  non-competition | Yves Perrier's contract as Chief Executive Of/ficer of Amundi does not foresee any severance pay  in case of a termination of his of/fice within Amundi. If Yves Perrier were to receive any severance pay, it would be on the basis of the termination of  his employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and the end of his term of of/fice within Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and this compensation would not be subject to performance conditions. This  compensation would be at the sole charge of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and would not be subject to any  reinvoicing to Amundi. This compensation would correspond to two years of compensation (/fixed + variable). |\n\n## 2.2.5 Rules of Procedure of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors' Rules of Procedure are detailed in full in chapter/uni00A08 of this Universal Registration Document and on the Company's website: about.amundi.com/ in the section/uni00A0Shareholders/Our Group/The governance.\n\nThey consist of four main sections, related to the powers of the Chair of the Board, the powers of the Board and of the Chief Executive O/fficer, the functioning of the Board, and to its specialised committees.\n\nTwo Charters (Directors' Charter and Stock Market Ethics Charter) are attached to the Rules of Procedure. All directors and\n\nnon-voting members are required to accept these regulations individually when taking o/ffice.\n\nDuring 2020, the Board of Directors made two amendments to its Rules of Procedure to expand the remits of its specialised committees, particularly so as to take social and environmental issues into account. The Rules of Procedure were also modified following amendments made to the Articles of Association after approval by the General Meeting, to enable the Board to make decisions by means of written consultation in certain specific circumstances, in accordance with the new provisions of the French 'Soihili' law (1) .\n\nRecommendation 22-3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code regarding the termination of the employment contract of a Company Of/ficer does not apply to 'employees of a group of companies who act as Senior Executives and Company Of/ficers in a listed or unlisted subsidiary of the Group'. Yves Perrier's contractual position therefore complies with the Code.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This Chief Executive O/fficer is assisted in the performance of his general duties by two management bodies: a General Management Committee and an Executive Committee.\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0511-58 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, which stipulates that the Board of Directors of a credit institution cannot be chaired by the Chief Executive O/fficer, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on 15/uni00A0September/uni00A02015, decided that the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and of Chief Executive O/fficer of the Company would remain separate.\n\n## 2.3.1 The Chair of the Board and his duties\n\nXavier Musca has chaired the Company's Board of Directors since 28/uni00A0April 2016, having been a director since 2012.\n\nIn fulfilment of his legal duties, the Chair of the Board of Directors:\n\n- /uni25A0 draws up the agendas for Board meetings and ensures directors have the information they need to make informed decisions;\n- /uni25A0 encourages and promotes discussion within the Board;\n- /uni25A0 ensures that the decisions taken by the Board are clear.\n\nXavier Musca is also a member of the Strategic and CSR Committee, Appointments Committee, and Compensation\n\nCommittee, giving him a full and comprehensive vision of the smooth functioning of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to the minimum bimonthly meetings with the Chief Executive O/fficer of the Company, in 2020 the Chair was heavily involved in the Company's handing of the health crisis and with ensuring the smooth-running of its operating activities. He also assists the Company in its strategic thinking regarding external growth, both in his role as Chair and in his capacity as representative of the majority shareholder.\n\nBiographical information about Xavier Musca, who is also a member of the Board of Directors, is included in section/uni00A02.1 'Overview of the Company O/fficers'.\n\n## 2.3.2 The Chief Executive O/fficer and his powers\n\nYves Perrier was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company on 18/uni00A0September 2007, and was reconfirmed when Amundi was formed on 23 December 2009 (1) . The Board of Directors' meeting of 15/uni00A0September 2015 decided to reappoint him in his role for an indefinite period.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles/uni00A0of Association (Article/uni00A015) and the Board of Directors' Rules of Procedure (Article/uni00A02.1) on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer, 'The Chief Executive O/fficer has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the Company. They exercise these powers within the limit of the corporate purpose and subject to those powers that the law expressly grants to the shareholders' meetings and the Board of Directors. They represent the Company in its dealings with third parties.\n\nHe must, however, obtain the prior agreement of the Board of Directors for the following transactions:\n\n- /uni25A0 the establishment, acquisition or disposal of any subsidiaries and investments in France or abroad where the overall investment is over \u20ac100 million;\n- /uni25A0 any other investment or divestiture of any kind whatsoever of over \u20ac100 million.\n\nIf urgency makes it impossible to convene a Board meeting to vote on a transaction falling into one of these categories, the Chief Executive Officer must take all necessary measures to obtain the opinion of all of the directors and, at the very least, of the members of the Strategic Committee, before making a decision. Where this is not possible, the Chief Executive O/fficer may, by agreement with the Chair, make any decision in the Company's interest in the areas listed above. They must report on any such decisions at the next Board meeting.\n\nAny significant transaction outside the announced strategy of the Company is subject to prior approval by the Board of Directors.'\n\nBiographical information about Yves Perrier, who is also a director, is included in section/uni00A02.1, 'Overview of the Company O/fficers'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.3.3 The Group's Management Bodies\n\n## 2.3.3.1 Overview of the Group's Management Bodies\n\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer is supported by a General Management Committee within the Amundi Group that is involved in all major decisions of a commercial, organisational and HR management nature. Among other things, this Committee coordinates Amundi's core business lines, balances priorities and makes the Group's major governance decisions.\n\nIn addition, a larger Executive Committee ensures the consistent and e/ffective deployment of the strategy in all countries in which the Amundi Group is present. This Committee, the membership of which includes the Heads of the key countries in which Amundi operates, monitors business developments and ensures the right balance is struck between the over-arching policies of the Amundi Group and their interpretation and implementation at the local level.\n\nIn addition to these two management bodies is the Senior Leadership Team, a group of approximately 150 senior executives spread across the various geographic locations of the Amundi Group.\n\n## 2.3.3.2  Diversity and gender equality policy\n\n## Diversity and gender equality policy within the Group:\n\nThe management bodies detailed above are diverse in terms of geographical and gender representation (21.4% of members of the General Management Committee are women and 28.6% of the Executive Committee), thereby ensuring that the Amundi Group as a whole is represented in terms of diversity and gender balance.\n\nIn December, the Board of Directors made sure that the Group had made progress in 2020 in terms of gender equality.\n\nHaving noted a significant improvement in Amundi's Gender Equality Index rating, with a score of 83 points , compared\n\nwith 81 in 2019, the Board particularly welcomed the fact that the number of women on the Executive Committee increased sharply by 54%: 28.6% in 2020 compared with 18.5% in 2019.\n\nThe Board also noted the following progress:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Company's commitment to the '30% Club France Investor Group': Amundi is one of six management companies that are calling upon French large caps to draw up an action plan to ensure that at least 30% of their governing bodies are women by 2025;\n- /uni25A0 practical support for female talent to access positions of responsibility: in 2020, Amundi continued with its policy to support female talent through various leadership training programmes, although due to the unique circumstances that prevailed during the year, only nine were able to take up these courses (versus 19 in 2019);\n- /uni25A0 increasing the consideration of gender diversity in HR processes , paying particular attention to talent pools , 42% of which are now women, consistent with the percentage of women in the company, ensuring one third of the people in the succession plans for key posts in the company are women and, finally, including the systematic consideration of gender diversity during the Peoplereviews conducted for all employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors has committed management to continuing its e/fforts in 2021, in particular by leading specific initiatives to increase the visibility and recognition of female managers.\n\nFurthermore, it has set two objectives for gender representation:\n\n- /uni25A0 30% female membership of the Executive Committee by 2022; and\n- /uni25A0 35% female membership of the Senior Leadership team in 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.4.1 General principles applicable to the compensation of all Amundi employees and senior executives\n\n## 2.4.1.1 Principles\n\nAmundi's compensation policy is established in such a way as to be in line with the Company's corporate interest, its values, its economic and commercial strategy and its long-term objectives. The compensation policy, on the one hand, gives priority to striking a fair balance between performance and sound, controlled risk management and, on the other hand, the development of increasingly responsible and sustainable investment. It thus contributes to the sustainability of the Company in the interest of all stakeholders alike: investors, shareholders, customers and employees.\n\nAmundi's compensation policy applies to all Amundi employees including senior executives, and is based on the principle of nondiscrimination, particularly with regard to gender.\n\nAll employees are entitled to all or some of the following items of compensation, depending on the responsibilities held and place of work:\n\n- /uni25A0 the fixed compensation rewards the missions, responsibilities and ongoing achievements as part of the position held by the employees;\n- /uni25A0 individual variable compensation measures individual contributions to collective performance and is broken down into two parts:\n- /uni25A0 the annual bonus recognising individual performance,\n- /uni25A0 the performance share plan (known as the LTI) aimed at motivating certain executives to achieve the sales and financial objectives of Amundi's Medium-Term Plan communicated to the market;\n- /uni25A0 the collective variable compensation ensures employees' share in the returns of financial performance generated by Amundi;\n- /uni25A0 the employee benefits o/ffer protection to employees and their families and help them prepare for retirement.\n\nThe overall amount of variable compensation is approved by the Board of Directors after review by the Compensation Committee and is determined on the basis of a percentage of the gross operating income before variable compensation.\n\nThe allocation of this overall amount within the di/fferent business lines and entities is based on the contribution of each team to the collective performance.\n\nThe individual allocation of items of variable compensation is determined on a discretionary basis and is based on management's assessment of individual risk-adjusted performance. To this end, Amundi's variable compensation scheme:\n\n- /uni25A0 takes into account, when allocating individual bonuses, respect of risk limits and client interest;\n- /uni25A0 foresees objective, quantitative and qualitative criteria, as well as an appropriate timescale (short- to long-term), depending on the o/ffice held;\n- /uni25A0 sets quantitative criteria for investment managers that link risk to performance (Information Ratio/Sharpe Ratio at 1, 3 and 5 years);\n- /uni25A0 takes into consideration the opinion of an ad hoc committee in the allocation and the vesting of deferred variable compensation, which makes it possible to adjust variable compensation according to the risk recorded ex post .\n\nSince 2008, a portion of the variable compensation is deferred in accordance with the economic strategy, long-term objectives and sound risk management. The highest variable compensation amounts are therefore partly deferred and spread out over a minimum period of three years. They are only paid if the performance conditions are met and in the absence of risky professional behaviour during the period.\n\n## 2.4.1.2 Governance\n\nAmundi oversees the compensation policies and practices applicable to all Amundi entities to ensure consistent compliance with Group-wide guidelines of the compensation policy and their rigorous application in compliance with applicable regulations in force (AIFM/UCITS V and CRD IV).\n\nThe Human Resources Department, under the direct supervision of the Senior Management, is responsible for implementing the compensation policy.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, permanent control functions play a role in the process of reviewing variable compensation, specifically for 'identified sta/ff'. This applies primarily to the Risk Management Department and Compliance Department.\n\nAn ad hoc committee that includes the executives from the Investment business line, the Human Resources Department and the control functions reviews compliance with risk limits and the compliance procedures implemented for the investment management and negotiating functions.\n\nThese items are referred to Senior Management and the managers concerned so that the implementation of the compensation policy takes them into account.\n\nAmundi's Compensation Committee provides an opinion on the compensation policy to enable the Board of Directors to make informed decisions. It monitors the implementation of this compensation policy in particular for the 'identified sta/ff' referred to below.\n\nEach year, Amundi's Risk Management Committee also ensures the compatibility of the compensation policy with the Company's economic and prudential situation.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of policies applicable pursuant to the CRD IV regulation falls under the compensation governance implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The final compensation awarded to Yves Perrier was approved by the General Meeting on 12 May 2020. The amount of one million euros that Yves Perrier waived was paid into the Solidarity Fund for the Elderly created by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\n## Employee share ownership\n\nIn order to involve the Group's employees not only in the growth of the Company but also in the creation of economic value, on 30 July 2020 the Board of Directors decided to use the delegation of powers granted by the General Meeting of 16 May 2019 to carry out a capital increase reserved for all Amundi employees. The overall employee subscription rate for this scheme was 30.2%, with a peak subscription rate of 45.8% in France.\n\n## Long-term incentive plans\n\nThree long-term incentive plans were delivered in 2020 which had been approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorisations given by the Shareholders' Meetings of 30 September 2015 and 18 May 2017:\n\n- /uni25A0 the plan established by the Board of Directors on 9 February 2017 has been delivered to the beneficiaries, as the Board of Directors at its meeting on 11 February 2020 noted that the collective performance conditions had been duly achieved;\n- /uni25A0 the second tranche of the plan established by the Board of Directors on 13 December 2017 has been delivered to the beneficiaries, as the Board of Directors noted, during its meeting held on 10 December 2020, that the level of achievement of the collective performance conditions was higher than the forecast target of the Medium-Term Plan;\n- /uni25A0 the first tranche of the plan established by the Board of Directors on 1 August 2018 has been delivered to the beneficiaries, as the Board of Directors noted, during its meeting held on 10 December 2020, that the level of achievement of the collective performance conditions was higher than the forecast target of the Medium-Term Plan.\n\nIn the 'Significant events' section of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, detailed information is given regarding the capital increase reserved for employees and in Note 6.5 regarding the performance share plans.\n\n## 2.4.2 Compensation of 'Identified sta/ff' (AIFM/UCITS V and CRD IV)\n\nSince asset management represented the majority of the Group's business in 2020, Amundi's policy is aligned with the regulatory framework specific to this business sector. Accordingly, for management companies, the compensation policy applicable to all of Amundi's 'identified sta/ff' is determined in accordance with the AIFM/UCITS V Directives applicable to them. For some Amundi Group entities with the status of credit institutions or investment firms, a limited number of employees are governed by the CRD IV Regulation as described in section 2.4.2.1.2. In accordance with the compensation policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, Amundi's banking scope is subject to the same compensation policies as its asset management scope (application of the most e/fficient regulations for the purposes of sound risk management and alignment of interests), which involve in particular:\n\n- /uni25A0 more stringent rules and thresholds for deferred compensation than those proposed by CRD IV;\n- /uni25A0 the indexation of deferred variable compensation according to the principles defined in section 2.4.2.2;\n- /uni25A0 linking the payment of the deferred bonus to the absence of risky professional behaviour.\n\nThe compensation of CRD IV 'identified staff' whose professional activities have a significant impact on the risk profile of the relevant entities for the year 2020 is the subject of an 'Annual report on the compensation policy and practices applicable to CRD IV identified sta/ff' prepared in accordance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith the applicable regulations presented in section 2.4.2.3. It is specified that this compensation policy will change with regard to 'identified sta/ff' in 2021 in order to take account of the transposition into French law of Directive EU No. 2019/878 of 20 May 2019 (CRD V).\n\nIn addition, Amundi has put in place a mechanism allowing for the non-payment of deferred compensation not yet paid in the event of serious events arising involving questionable and unlawful practices, particularly in terms of risk-taking.\n\nThe policy applicable to the Chief Executive O/fficer of Amundi for the 2020 financial year is described in section 2.4.3.3.\n\n## 2.4.2.1 Scope of 'Identified sta/ff' (AIFM/ UCITS V AND CRD IV)\n\n## 2.4.2.1.1  AIFM/UCITS V 'Identified Staff'\n\nThe compensation policy that applies to identified staff is aligned with Amundi's general principles and stems from a highly controlled regulatory environment that imposes rules on the structure of their compensation.\n\n'Identified sta/ff' includes all categories of employees who have an impact on the Group's or their entity's risk profile by virtue of their function, level of authorisation or their compensation, as well as employees in the control functions of the Group or its entities.",

This process is supervised by the Compensation Committee.\n\nUnder EU Directives AIFM 2011/61 of 8 June 2011 and UCITS V 2014/91 of 23 July 2014, the 'identified staff' of asset management companies, alternative investment funds and UCITS are defined as those who simultaneously:\n\n- /uni25A0 belong to a category of employees that has an impact on the risk profile of the Group's management companies managing AIFs or UCITS-type funds, by virtue of the positions held;\n- /uni25A0 receive a high variable compensation.\n\n## 2.4.2.1.2  CRD IV 'Identified Staff'\n\nAmundi's 'identified sta/ff' within the meaning of CRD IV are identified based on the consolidated scope (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.) and the sub-consolidated scope (Amundi) under the joint responsibility of the Human Resources, Risk Management and Compliance departments.\n\nThe following are therefore defined as 'identified sta/ff' within the Amundi Group in accordance with the qualitative and quantitative identification criteria established by CRD IV:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Chief Executive O/fficer and the Head of the Business Support and Control functions of Amundi, who are both executive directors of Amundi S.A. ;\n- /uni25A0 the Chief Executive O/fficer and the Deputy CEO of Amundi Interm\u00e9diation;\n- /uni25A0 the Chief Executive O/fficer and the Deputy CEO of Amundi Finance.\n\n## 2.4.2.2  Compensation policy for 'Identified Sta/ff' (AIFM/UCITS V AND CRD IV)\n\nAmundi's compensation policy aims at ensuring an adjustment of compensation to performance in the medium- to long-term and e/ffectively preventing conflicts of interest.\n\n## Rules for deferred payments applicable to bonuses\n\nVariable compensation awarded to 'identified sta/ff' is deferred for a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded as of the first euro, by tranches over a minimum of three years, as soon as it attains a materiality threshold agreed upon with the regulator.\n\n'Identified sta/ff' are also subject to bonus vesting and indexation conditions.\n\nEach deferred compensation tranche only becomes vested based on performance conditions, the absence of risky professional behaviour and continued employment on the vesting date. The non-achievement of these conditions may lead to a decrease, or even a definitive loss of the amount to be vested.\n\nThe deferred portion of the bonus is indexed on a basket of funds that are representative of the activity of the Group or of its entities, thus encouraging the alignment of employee compensation with the Company's performance in the medium to long term. The employees concerned are not authorised to use personal hedging strategies intended to counteract the e/ffects of this indexation on the risk that is part of the management of deferred variable compensation.\n\nThe deferred payment rules specifically applicable to the Amundi Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the 2020 compensation policy are detailed in paragraph 2.4.3.3.\n\n## Vesting conditions of the rights attached to/uni00A0performance/uni00A0share plans\n\nWhen these individuals receive performance shares, specific conditions for the vesting of the rights underlying performance share plans are set as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 the shares allocated by the Board of Directors during its meeting of 9 February 2017, and which were to be vested on 9 February 2020, were subject to vesting conditions that are similar to those for deferred bonuses ( i.e. continued employment condition over three years, performance conditions, absence of risky professional behaviour) in compliance with the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by Amundi's General Meeting of Shareholders (30 September 2015);\n- /uni25A0 the shares allocated by the Board of Directors during its meeting of 13 December 2017 are subject to similar conditions to the plan above ( i.e. performance conditions, absence of risky professional behaviour and presence on the vesting date), except for the continued employment condition which is four years, with the performance conditions being tied to the achievement of the objectives of the Medium-Term Plan and in compliance with the authorisation given to the Board of Directors by Amundi's General Meeting of Shareholders of 18 May 2017;\n- /uni25A0 the additional shares allocated by the Board of Directors during its meeting of 1 August 2018 are subject to similar conditions as those of the 13 December 2017 plan ( i.e. performance conditions, absence of risky professional behaviour and presence on the vesting date), except for the continued employment condition which is three years, with the performance conditions being tied to the achievement of the objectives of the Amundi Group Medium-Term Plan, and in compliance with the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by Amundi's General Meeting of Shareholders of 18 May 2017;\n- /uni25A0 the additional shares allocated by the Board of Directors during its meeting of 12 December 2019 are subject to similar conditions as those of the 13 December 2017 plan ( i.e . performance conditions, absence of risky professional behaviour and presence on the vesting date), except for the continued employment condition which is two years, with the performance conditions being tied to the achievement of the objectives of the Amundi Group Medium-Term Plan, and in compliance with the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by Amundi's General Meeting of Shareholders of 16 May 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, Amundi's variable compensation system ensures its sound financial condition:\n\n- /uni25A0 by establishing the total variable compensation amount according to the Group's financial performance;\n- /uni25A0 by making the payment of deferred variable compensation conditional upon the achievement of the Group's financial performance objectives.\n\nThe Amundi variable compensation system is consistent with sound and controlled risk management:\n\n- /uni25A0 by specifying, as criteria used in the awarding of individual bonuses, that risk and compliance regulations must be respected as well as, for investment managers, the quantitative criteria associating risk to performance (Information ratio/ Sharpe ratio at one, three and five years);\n- /uni25A0 by including the opinion of an ad hoc committee in the allocation and the vesting of deferred variable compensation, which makes it possible to adjust variable compensation according to the risk recorded ex post.\n\nThe compensation policy specifically applicable to Amundi's Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of the 2020 financial year is described in section 2.4.3.3 of the Universal Registration Document. The policy applicable to Amundi's Chief Executive O/fficer for the 2021 financial year is described in sections 2.4.4.5 and 2.4.4.7 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Scope of identified sta/ff\n\nThe scope of Amundi CRD IV 'identified sta/ff' is described in section 2.4.2.1.2 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Rules for deferred payments applicable to 'identified sta/ff'\n\n## Rules for deferred payments applicable to bonuses\n\nThe deferred payment rules applicable to bonuses for identified staff are described in paragraph 2.4.2.2 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe deferred payment rules specifically applicable to the Amundi Chief Executive O/fficer for 2020 are detailed in section 2.4.3.3 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

In order to ensure that the Chair of the Board of Directors is independent when carrying out his duties, he is not eligible for any variable compensation.\n\n## 2.4.3.2.2  Compensation awarded or paid to the Chair of the Board of Directors\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, the General Meeting of Shareholders must vote on the fixed, variable and exceptional components constituting the total compensation and benefits in kind paid or awarded during or in respect of 2020 to the Chair of the Board of Directors.\n\nAs Xavier Musca waived payment for his work as director for 2020, there will be no ex post vote by the General Meeting in 2021 as per Article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code. No other form of compensation or benefit was paid or allocated to him by the Company during or in respect of the 2020 financial year.\n\nInformation on compensation paid or awarded by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Xavier Musca as Deputy CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. will be published in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Universal Registration Document for the year ended 31 December 2020, given that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shares are listed on the Euronext Paris regulated market.\n\n## 2.4.3.3  Compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n## 2.4.3.3.1  Reminder of the general principles of the 2020/uni00A0policy\n\nThe compensation policy for the Amundi CEO is set by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee.\n\nThe implementation of this policy is subject to detailed proposals reviewed by the Compensation Committee and subsequently validated by the Board of Directors. The validation process considers both the items of compensation of the past year and the parameters and criteria applicable to the compensation for the following year.\n\n## Employment contract\n\nYves Perrier, CEO of the Company, has an open-ended employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and receives no direct compensation from the Company for his work as CEO. This contract is maintained insofar as Yves Perrier holds other positions within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group. He is a member of the Executive Committee and Deputy Chief Executive O/fficer of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group in charge of the Savings and Real Estate division. (1)\n\nInsofar as the compensation and benefits paid by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Yves Perrier under this employment contract are 80% (excluding retirement expenses) re-invoiced to Amundi each year, the remaining 20% being charged to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. (as well as all retirement expenses), this section describes Yves Perrier's compensation as set out in the said employment contract. The information presented below therefore represents 100% of the compensation awarded to or paid to Yves Perrier.\n\n## 2.4.3.3.2  Compensation awarded or paid to the Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, the Shareholders' Meeting is asked to vote on the following fixed, variable and exceptional components constituting the total compensation and benefits in kind paid or awarded in respect of 2020 to Yves Perrier, Chief Executive O/fficer. These items arise from the application of the principles and criteria for the compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer for the 2020 financial year as approved by 95.85% by the General Meeting of Shareholders of 12 May 2020 in its eighth resolution. These items are detailed in full in the table below.",

It noted that these objectives were reached overall and established the variable compensation of the Chief Executive Of/ficer on this basis.\n\nThe total achievement rate (detailed below) is 102.4%, which would result in a theoretical variable compensation  of  \u20ac2,048,000  by  applying  the  contractual  compensation  parameters.  However, pursuant to the CRD IV regulation, the Board capped variable compensation at twice the amount of /fixed compensation, i.e. \u20ac2,000,000.\n\nThe Board of Directors also noted that if the impact of the market downturn on management fees and /financial results had been neutralised, the overall achievement rate of the objectives would have increased from 102.4% up to 108.0% (with

The project will be /finalised in/uni00A02021 (regulatory authorisations, client report and implementation of an external certi/fication audit);\n- /uni25A0 the doubling (from \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac20 billion) of themed initiatives to /finance energy transition and social inclusion: at the end of 2020, these initiatives amounted to \u20ac21 billion;\n- /uni25A0 the extension of rating coverage from 5,500 to 8,000 issuers. In 2020, Amundi covers 10,000 issuers. Furthermore, in 2020, Amundi divested its portfolios of companies affected by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's exclusion policies (coal, tobacco producers).\n- 2) Several signi/ficant innovations for Amundi's positioning on the ESG market were launched in Europe and Asia:\n- /uni25A0 a new investment methodology according to the three objectives of the Paris Agreements with the AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank);\n- /uni25A0 an initial range of ETFs eligible for the European Commission's 'Paris Aligned Benchmark' label;\n- /uni25A0 the CPR Social Impact fund (the /first Global Equity investment fund focusing on reducing social inequality);\n- /uni25A0 launch of the ESG Improvers product family on the equity and bond markets.\n- 3) Today Amundi is recognised as a global key player in responsible investment:\n- /uni25A0 for Morningstar, in 2020 Amundi was number one in the management of open-ended ESG funds worldwide;\n- /uni25A0 in Morgan Stanley's 2021 outlook, Amundi is the only /financial company chosen as one of the 15 stocks in which the bank recommends investing to bene/fit from market trends on ESG.\n- /uni25A0 The strengthening of Amundi's managerial structure continued with:\n- 1) organisational adjustments to support the strategic challenges embodied by the launch of a 'Third-party distribution - Wealth Management' division;\n- 2) a strengthening of the management team by broadening the responsibilities of senior executives on the Executive Committee and with new members joining this body;\n- 3) the recruitment and promotion of high-level executives to head key international activities (including the United Kingdom, Spain, China JV and Korea JV);\n- 4) a progression of the number of women on the Executive Committee, going up from 18.5% in/uni00A02019 to 28.6% in 2020.\n- /uni25A0 The steering of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's societal project made progress on many fronts:\n- 1) the de/finition of a doctrine for the Group that will be discussed in-house;\n- 2) the implementation of non-/financial reporting;\n- 3) the introduction of governance at Group level and at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. level;\n- 4) increased recognition of the Group by all stakeholders.\n\nThese factors led the Board to set the achievement rate for managerial objectives at 121.7%.\n\nBeyond assessing the performance objectives assigned to the Chief Executive Of/ficer for the 2020 /financial year, the Board highlighted the major strategic initiatives that were accomplished in 2020:\n\n- /uni25A0 the renewal of distribution agreements with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale;\n- /uni25A0 the creation of a new joint venture in China, which is now operational;\n- /uni25A0 the acquisition of Banco Sabadell AM;\n- /uni25A0 the launch of the Amundi Technology business line.\n\nThe Board also noted that Amundi had weathered the crisis that marked 2020 without any operational disruption or the use of short-time working or any other form of government support.\n\n- (1)  For details of the amounts paid to Yves Perrier in financial year 2020, refer to Table 2 in Section 2.4.3.4.

The structure of the performance conditions applicable to the deferred portion of the annual variable compensation awarded for 2020 is identical to that applicable to the annual variable compensation awarded for 2021, both for Yves Perrier (until 10 May 2021) and for Val\u00e9rie Baudson (from 11 May 2021).\n\nYves Perrier will retain his right to receive unvested tranches of his deferred compensation if he leaves the Company except in the event of resignation or dismissal for gross or serious misconduct. Deferred compensation will however be paid if departure is due to retirement, disability, death or exceptional circumstances attested by the Board of Directors. In these cases, the unvested tranches of deferred variable compensation will be paid on their normal due date calculated based on the level of accomplishment of the performance conditions.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the compensation policy, in the event that risky professional conduct is observed during the vesting period or the holding period, the Amundi Board of Directors has the option of reducing all or part of any deferred variable compensation not yet received, even if the performance conditions are met.\n\n## Indexation applicable to the deferred portion of the Chief Executive Officer's annual variable compensation\n\nThis deferred portion of variable compensation is also 85% indexed on the Amundi share price evolution and 15% on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price evolution.\n\n| Exceptional  compensation                  | None                                                                                   | No exceptional compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Stock options,  performance  shares or any | None None                                                                              | Yves Perrier was not awarded any stock options in 2020.

This calculation, which is based on financial data (salaries and wages, average headcount) relating to the compensation awarded to the Chief Executive Officer, also allows comparison with other companies. Based on the compensation awarded, this global pay ratio was 21.0 for 2020, down 0.9 points compared to 2018, with 2019 being marked by the Chief Executive O/fficer's waiver of 50% of the variable compensation awarded to him.

defined for the Senior Executives and Company Officers complies with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the previous provisions of Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code (repealed by Order No. 2019-1234 of 27 November 2019), on the acquisition of the conditional annual supplementary definedbenefit pension rights.\n\nBy virtue of his position in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, described above, Yves Perrier is covered by the supplementary retirement plan for senior executives of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., which supplements the basic and mandatory supplementary retirement plans.\n\nThis scheme combines a defined-contribution plan (Article 83 of the French General Tax Code) and a top-up defined-benefit retirement plan (Article 39 of the French General Tax Code).\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the PACTE Law and Order No. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019, the defined-benefit plan, which falls within the provisions of Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code, has been permanently closed since 4 July 2019 and the conditional rights it provided were crystallized on 31 December 2019. Accordingly, no new additional rights are granted within this scheme for periods of employment after 1 January 2020. Consequently, the following clarifications on the defined-benefit plan only concern rights accrued up to 31 December 2019.\n\nThese rights are determined after deduction of the annuity constituted within the defined-contribution plan.\n\nUpon termination, Yves Perrier's total retirement income is capped, taking into account all company and mandatory basic and supplementary retirement plans, at 14 times the annual social security ceiling as of that date, and at 70% of reference compensation (1) .\n\nTotal gross annual entitlements under the defined-benefit plan were estimated at \u20ac322,000 at 31 December 2020, corresponding to 20% of the reference compensation defined below or 11% of the compensation due in respect of 2020 (fixed and variable). Both ratios are below the 45% ceiling recommended in the AFEP-MEDEF Code (fixed and variable compensation due in respect of the reference period). These plans are entirely managed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and are not re-invoiced to Amundi.\n\n## Defined-contribution retirement plan\n\nThe payment of contributions under the defined-contribution retirement plan is conditional upon one year of service. The beneficiary will receive payment of a retirement supplement once he is able to demonstrate entitlement to his pension under a mandatory pension plan.\n\nYves Perrier is a beneficiary of vested pension rights under this plan, the amount of which is based on the accrued savings converted into a lifetime payment starting the day of entitlement. Contributions to this scheme, calculated on the basis of the gross salary, capped at eight times the annual social security ceiling, are set at a rate of 5% paid by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and 3% by Yves Perrier. It also includes contributions to the supplementary retirement plan of agricultural organisations resulting from the agreement of 31 January 1996 (the so-called '1.24% plan').\n\nThe gross annual amount of the annuity on the closing date for the 2020 financial year is estimated at \u20ac11,000.\n\nThis estimated amount is the gross amount before the taxes and social security contributions applicable at the closing date, particularly income tax payable by natural persons.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s contributions to the retirement plan are exempt from social security contributions and charges, within the limits set in Article L. 242-1 of the French Social Security Code, and may be deducted from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s taxable income.",

        "page_content": "## Defined-benefit retirement plan\n\nThe defined-benefit retirement plan consists of contingent rights subject, in principle, to a condition of continued employment within the Company at retirement.\n\nThe retirement pension benefit under the defined-benefit retirement plan is reserved for participants who:\n\n- /uni25A0 have at least five years of service within the Group;\n- /uni25A0 have reached the age of retirement at the rights entitlement date or who are 60 years old and can demonstrate that they are entitled to full pension rights according to the general social security regime;\n- /uni25A0 are eligible for the plan the day before they become entitled to pension rights;\n- /uni25A0 are already entitled to basic and supplementary individual retirement pensions under all mandatory retirement plans in and outside France and from the international organisations from which they might benefit, (excluding any rights under the Agirc category C plan).\n\nSpecific rules are provided for by the agreement for beneficiaries who would be considered by the social security as permanently unable to work or for participants who might have been dismissed.\n\nUntil 31 December 2019, the annual vesting of rights was subject to the Amundi Group achieving, during the year considered, at least 50% of the Group's budgeted objective for consolidated net income Group share, it being specified that this condition is nevertheless deemed satisfied if the Amundi Group does not achieve this objective as a result of an adverse market environment that affects Amundi's competitors in a similar manner.\n\nThe pension rate was equal to 0.3% of the reference compensation as defined above for each confirmed quarter up to a maximum of 120 quarters, corresponding to an annual increment of 1.2% maximum per year.\n\nThe entitlements built up within the Group prior to the e/ffective date of the current regulations are maintained and, where appropriate, are included with the entitlements resulting from the implementation of the regulations in force, including for the calculation of the cap for the annuity paid.\n\nThe estimated gross annual amount of this annuity at the 2020 reporting date was valued at \u20ac322,000, including \u20ac141,000 in rights deemed to originate from the crystallised capital at 31 December 2009 under the closed previous scheme, and \u20ac181,000 in additional rights for the new scheme e/ffective from 1 January 2010.\n\nThis represents 20% of the reference compensation (as defined above) or 11% of the compensation due (fixed and variable) in respect of 2020, both ratios being below the ceiling of 45% (of fixed and variable compensation over the reference period) set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThis estimated amount is gross of taxes and social charges applicable at the closing date, notably personal income tax and social contributions of between 7% and 14% (depending on the size of the annuity) payable by the beneficiary.\n\nManagement of the defined-benefit retirement plan is outsourced to an organisation governed by the French Insurance Code. Funding of the outsourced assets is accomplished via annual premiums entirely funded by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and subject to the 24% contribution required by Article L. 137-11 of\n\nthe French Social Security Code, in return for exemption from social security contributions and charges provided for in the same article. These premiums do not generate any tax charges for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nThe contingent rights under the supplementary defined-benefit plan are conditional upon the beneficiary still being employed by the Company at maturity and are estimated based on ten years' service as of the closing date, which corresponds to 12% of the reference compensation as of 31 December 2020.\n\nIn accordance with the Order of 3 July 2019, the rights of this defined-benefit pension scheme were crystallized on 31 December 2019. No additional rights are granted for periods of employment after 1 January 2020, and the benefit of these past rights remains uncertain and is conditional on his continued employment.\n\n## Severance or other benefits due or likely to become due as a result of termination or change of position\n\n## Severance pay\n\nYves Perrier is not entitled to any termination compensation under the employment contract, in the event of termination of his o/ffice with Amundi.\n\nIf Yves Perrier were to receive termination compensation, it would be as a result of the termination of his employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the end of his office with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., set out in the 'Employment contract' paragraph of section 2.4.3.3.1. This compensation would be at the sole charge of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and would not be subject to any reinvoicing to Amundi.\n\nIn the event that his employment contract were to be terminated, Yves Perrier would receive a contractual compensation of an amount equal to twice the amount of his fixed and variable compensation allocated over the twelve months preceding termination of his employment contract, a portion of which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. collective bargaining agreement.\n\n## Compensation under a non-compete clause\n\nYves Perrier's contract does not provide for a non-compete clause in the event of termination of his o/ffice with Amundi. Nor does his employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. provide for a non-compete clause in the event of termination of his o/ffice with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\n## 2.4.3.3.4  Other benefits\n\nYves Perrier has a company car provided by the Company corresponding to the line 'Benefits in kind' in table 2 below.\n\n## 2.4.3.4  Standardised summary tables\n\n## Compensation and benefits paid to Xavier Musca, Chair/uni00A0of the Board of Directors\n\nAs a reminder, Xavier Musca waived payment of compensation for the 2020 financial year in respect of his work as a director. The company did not pay him any form of compensation or benefits in respect of his office as Chair of the Board of Directors, which he has held since 28 April 2016. Information on the compensation and benefits paid by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Xavier Musca in respect of his position as Chief Executive O/fficer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. is available in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.

This policy aligns with the corporate interest of Amundi and contributes to its continuity while forming part of its business strategy as described in Chapter 1 of this Universal Registration Document. To this end, it forms part of and complies with the general framework described in section 2.4.1, in particular for Senior Executives and Company O/fficers, and, with regard to the Chief Executive O/fficer in particular, by means of mechanisms that align interests such as the indexation of deferred compensation to the share price and/or representative baskets of funds.\n\nWhere performance criteria are established for variable compensation and share-based compensation for particular Company Officers, such as the Chief Executive Officer, the evaluation of their performance is based on the comparison between the result obtained and the defined target.\n\nDetailed proposals on the implementation and revision of this policy, analysed by the Compensation Committee which is composed of two-thirds of independent directors and chaired by an independent director, are duly validated by the Board of Directors which is required to comply with the principles set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code and in the Company's Directors' Code of Conduct, particularly with regard to the management of potential conflicts of interest. These Board approvals relate both to compensation items for the previous financial year and to the compensation policy for the coming year, taking\n\ninto account shareholders' votes on resolutions relating to the compensation of directors and executive o/fficers, at the last General Meeting. With regard to the Chief Executive O/fficer, these approvals are based on analyses that specifically allow the CEO's compensation to be compared with that of the executive directors of comparable companies in the business sector. The Board of Directors also takes into account the compensation and employment conditions of the employees when taking decisions regarding Company O/fficers. As such, the Company's performance and the average and median compensation of employees over the last five financial years are taken into account.\n\nThis policy and the components of its implementation have been submitted to the vote of the General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company since 2018 and, to the extent that they remain applicable and relevant, comply with the provisions of the following regulations:\n\n- /uni25A0 the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (AFEP-MEDEF Code), as revised in January 2020, and all the guidelines contained therein;\n- /uni25A0 the regulatory framework set by the French Monetary and Financial Code for credit institutions and investment firms relating to the compensation of identified staff, which includes Amundi's Chief Executive O/fficer;\n- /uni25A0 the provisions of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe provisions of the compensation policy applicable to senior executives and company o/fficers, subject to their approval by the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, are intended to apply to newly appointed company o/fficers or those whose appointment is renewed after the General Meeting, on the understanding that the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, reserves the right to decide on the adjustments required to take account of the individual situation of the executive o/fficer in question and of the responsibilities conferred by their appointment. These items will apply until\n\n<!-- image -->",

This change led the Board of Directors, at its meeting of 31 March 2021, on the proposal of the Compensation Committee, to change the compensation policy in relation to the policy applicable to the Chief Executive O/fficer in 2020, to take specific account of the following factors:\n\n- /uni25A0 2021 is a transition year, which a/ffects the choice of targets set for annual variable compensation;\n- /uni25A0 for Val\u00e9rie Baudson, this Chief Officer position is a new role, which the Board of Directors reflected in the level of compensation proposed;\n- /uni25A0 Yves Perrier held an employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. for his responsibilities with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and, as such, enjoyed the benefits associated with this employment contract, with 80% of his compensation re-invoiced to Amundi. These terms and conditions were specific to Yves Perrier and do not apply to Val\u00e9rie Baudson who, prior to her appointment, was an employee of the Amundi Group. Accordingly, the Board of Directors amended the compensation policy, with specific regard to the suspension of the employment contract, social welfare guarantees and end-of-o/ffice conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the entry into force of the CRD V Directive in 2021 led the Board of Directors to change the compensation policy applicable to deferred variable compensation, by extending the vesting period of the deferred portion from three up to five years.\n\nThe compensation policy thus defined is described below and is subject to the vote of the General Meeting of 10 May 2021 in application of Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code. The compensation set out below will only apply to Val\u00e9rie Baudson from when she is appointed and provided that the General Meeting approves this compensation policy.\n\n## Employment contract\n\nThe Board of Directors noted that on the date of her appointment, Val\u00e9rie Baudson will have a total of over 25/uni00A0years' service within the Group, reflecting her skill set, her deep understanding of business challenges and contribution to the Group's development since 1 January 1995.\n\nAs such, it did not seem appropriate to the Board to deprive Valerie Baudson of the potential benefits arising from her employment contract, which she would no longer be able to enjoy if it were terminated. In accordance with the doctrine of the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (French Financial Markets Authority) and the Haut Comit\u00e9 du Gouvernement d'Entreprise (High Committee for Corporate Governance), the Board considered that Val\u00e9rie Baudson's length of service and personal situation are su/fficient grounds to maintain her employment contract. However, this contract will be suspended, which specifically means that Val\u00e9rie Baudson will not benefit, during her term of o/ffice, from any related compensation, whether arising from her employment contract, the applicable contractual stipulations or the legal and regulatory provisions in force. She will thus only receive compensation in respect of her corporate o/ffice, in line with the terms and conditions described below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Up to this target amount, the said variable compensation is allocated:\n\n- /uni25A0 for two thirds of the total in the form of cash bonus, i.e. \u20ac800,000 on an annual basis for the target amount;\n- /uni25A0 for one third in the form of performance shares, i.e. \u20ac400,000 on an annual basis for the target amount.\n\n## Ceiling for total variable compensation\n\nAny allocation above the \u20ac1,200,000 target will be made exclusively in the form of cash bonus. Total variable compensation may reach a maximum of \u20ac1,360,000 in the event of outperformance, i.e. 170% of /fixed compensation. Furthermore, this complies with Article L. 511-78 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, as amended as a result of the transposition of the CRD IV Directive, and upheld in the CRD V Directive which states that total variable compensation may not exceed 200% of annual /fixed compensation, even if the objectives are exceeded.\n\nThe structure of the compensation proposed on an annual basis for Val\u00e9rie Baudson, Chief Executive O/fficer, can be summarised as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

It will apply to total variable compensation as a whole.\n\nAfter the end of the /financial year 2021, the Board of Directors will meet to determine the amount of the total variable compensation awarded to the Chief Executive Of/ficer on a pro rata temporis basis.\n\n## Terms and conditions for deferral and indexation of total variable compensation\n\nThe deferral and indexing procedures applicable to total variable compensation are de/fined in compliance with the CRD V Directive, which stipulates that:\n\n- /uni25A0 50% of the total variable compensation awarded is paid in the form of instruments;\n- /uni25A0 60% of the total variable compensation awarded is deferred over a /five-year period;\n- /uni25A0 tranches paid in the form of instruments (indexed cash or performance shares) are subject to a holding period of one year.\n\nThe calculation of the compensation to be deferred in respect of the /financial year is based on the total variable compensation including performance shares awarded in respect of that year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

AMUNDI'S CSR COMMITMENTS\n\n## 3.1.1 Amundi's CSR challenges\n\nAs a pioneer in the field of responsible investment, Amundi has implemented a policy that seeks to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into its management strategies, beyond traditional financial analysis. We developed as well specific initiatives to promote the energy transition and support the social and solidarity economy. As a leading European asset manager with more than \u20ac1,729/uni00A0billion in assets under management as of the end of 2020, Amundi launched an ambitious three-year action plan in autumn 2018 to take its ESG commitments to a new level.\n\nAmundi's responsibility is also to apply the principles of sustainable development to its own operations. Reducing and managing its environmental impact, eliminating discrimination, promoting equal opportunity, ensuring transparency and integrity in its governance, developing a long-term philanthropic policy and encouraging the social involvement\n\nof its employees are Amundi's CSR objectives. This policy is carried out both in France and abroad.\n\nFurthermore, considering the general issues inherent to asset managers, Amundi's specific challenges, the commitments of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and the analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of its activities, the Company has made three principal commitments:\n\n- /uni25A0 commitment to our clients: act as a responsible financial institution and deliver on the client promise;\n- /uni25A0 commitment to our employees: make individual and collective development central to our responsibility as an employer;\n- /uni25A0 commitment to society and the world around us: act as a community-minded, eco-aware citizen.\n\n## 3.1.2 Amundi's participation in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's FReD/uni00A0initiative\n\nSince 2012, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has deployed the FReD initiative (2) in its various entities, including Amundi. This tool for managing and measuring progress in the area of CSR makes it possible to manage the challenges of CSR and promotes the involvement of the executives and of the entire workforce. In\n\n2019, FReD became the tool for implementing and managing the social and environmental commitments of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The participative approach consists of defining six projects each year to be implemented in each entity in the three areas of CSR: economy, society and environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Amundi is notably a member of the AFG (1) , EFAMA (whose Standing Committee Stewardship & ESG is now co-chaired by an Amundi representative), IFA, ORSE, SFAF, French, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Canadian, Japanese and Australian closed-end investment trusts, and of the French association 'Entreprises pour l'Environnement'. Amundi is also a member and director of Finansol and one of its representatives is a member of the SRI Label Committee.\n\nIn addition, a member of Amundi's Senior Management chairs the Paris Europlace Investors' Committee and a member of the Executive Committee is Vice-Chair of Finance for Tomorrow. Amundi's Director of Public A/ffairs chairs the Paris Europlace Working Group on the cost of financial and non-financial data. Lastly, a member of the Amundi Responsible Investment Department has been appointed to the AMF's Climate and Sustainable Finance Committee, while another has been appointed a member of the European Lab Project Task Force on Reporting of Non-financial Risks and Opportunities.\n\nAs a key player in the management of assets, Amundi has played an active part in the work and consultations surrounding the European projects for the regulation of ESG investment, namely disclosure regulations, taxonomy regulations. Amundi has contributed to the work of the AFG, particularly the work of the Responsible Investment Committee. Amundi strives to reconcile the e/ffectiveness of markets and of its asset management business with the promotion of a more responsible investment model that is more oriented to serving the economy. As a European leader in asset management and pioneer of SRI management, Amundi has been able to share its vision and experience with the various players involved in the project in Brussels, following on from the contributions already made in 2018 and 2019 at the HLEG (High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance).\n\nMore generally, Amundi has contributed to the regulatory work carried out by the AFG, AFIC, ASPIM and AMAFI and Paris Europlace for France, as well as that of the EFAMA in Brussels and the AFME and ICMA in London. Lastly, Amundi's subsidiaries in Europe belong to the professional associations of their respective countries.\n\nIn 2020, Amundi responded to at least ten consultations on European or French regulations under development or revision.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group, which is obliged to prepare and implement a vigilance plan to better identify and prevent the risks of serious impacts from its activities on fundamental human rights and freedoms, personal health and safety and on the environment.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as the Parent company, reports on the effective implementation of the measures laid out in the vigilance plan for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group as a whole, and therefore including Amundi. Further details on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's vigilance plan are presented in Chapter/uni00A03 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 3.1.6 Respect for human rights\n\nThe commitment to respect human rights is fundamental at Amundi, both as an advocate of responsible management and as an employer. Respect for human rights is one of the criteria used to rate issuers and, together with the environmental criteria, constitutes the basis for Amundi's exclusion policy (see section/uni00A02.1 Promoting responsible finance). Specifically,\n\nrespect for human rights is taken into account in the ESG rating through the criterion 'Local communities and human rights'. When a business commits serious and repeated human rights violations without taking e/ffective measures to remedy those violations, this constitutes a breach of the 10 principles of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Following discussions with that business, Amundi can therefore exclude it from its investment universe.\n\nFor several years, Amundi has maintained a shareholder commitment with many companies on the subject of the living wage in order to ensure that direct employees, regardless of their country of establishment and the development of social law in that country, receive a salary that enables them to live with dignity and to meet their needs and those of their family. The results of this commitment are used to refine the ESG rating of companies supplied by Amundi and taken into account by managers when setting up funds.\n\nThe human rights aspect is also present in the analysis of the supply chains of businesses in some sectors where vigilance is particularly important in order to prevent human rights violations. Particularly migrant workers, who are at greater risk, require special attention in the context of monitoring programmes that can be put in place by ordering companies.\n\nThis commitment is also reflected in Amundi's HR policy, in the form of actions to promote diversity, the fight against discrimination, the importance of social dialogue and collective bargaining, and compliance with freedom of association (see section 4.2).\n\n## 3.2 ACTING AS A RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\n\nActing as a responsible financial institution is a founding principle of Amundi and a central commitment of its development strategy. This choice is based on two convictions. The first is that of having a clear conscience with respect to investors' responsibility to allocate savings by taking into account not just financial criteria but also its impact on society in general. The second is the conviction that taking into account environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\ncriteria in investment policies has a positive impact on financial performance. This commitment is reflected in our various management processes through challenges associated with ESG integration, exclusion and voting policies, and of course in the range of responsible solutions and services that Amundi has developed to support its various clients in their ESG strategy.\n\n## 3.2.1 An ambitious action plan\n\nIn 2018, an ambitious plan was announced to expand this approach, including objectives aimed in particular at applying ESG criteria across all management operations and developing specific initiatives (funding the energy transition and social inclusion) by doubling assets under management from \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac20 billion. The year 2020 was marked firstly by completion of the ESG plan for 2018-2021, secondly by the continuation of the innovation policy, and lastly by an increased recognition of Amundi as a key player.\n\n## Commitments met\n\nThese commitments, announced in 2018, are met:\n\n- /uni25A0 active management: 100% of open-ended funds (1) now include ESG criteria ; the objective for each fund's portfolio is to have a better ESG rating than its benchmark universe;\n- /uni25A0 specific initiatives: assets under management for specific initiatives (funding the energy transition and social inclusion) totalled \u20ac22 billion at the end of 2020;\n- /uni25A0 solidarity: at the end of 2020, the Amundi Solidarit\u00e9 fund reached \u20ac331 million in assets under management, versus \u20ac200 million in 2018;\n- /uni25A0 ESG analysis: in 2020, Amundi covered 10,000 issuers; the objective was to go up from 5,500 issuers to 8,000);\n- /uni25A0 'Climate' solutions: numerous partnerships and innovations were initiated with public entities (including IFC (2) , EIB (3) and AIIB (4) ) to develop climate-specific products and solutions.\n\nThe total assets under management in Responsible Investment increased from \u20ac276 billion at the end of 2018 to \u20ac378 billion at the end of 2020.\n\n## An active ESG innovation policy in 2020\n\nThis increase in assets under management has benefited from the continuation of the active ESG innovation and development policy:\n\n- /uni25A0 Launch of AIIBAmundi Climate Change Investment Framework , using for the first time a holistic approach to build portfolios resistant to climate risks, based on the three key objectives of the Paris Agreement;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi was selected by a group of French institutional investors (including the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts) to manage the first Equity index fund aligned with the Paris Agreement;\n- /uni25A0 Three ETFs were launched replicating the PAB (Paris Aligned Benchmarks) climate indices, thereby broadening the range of 'climate transition' solutions;\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, Amundi implements sector-specific exclusions for the coal and tobacco industries, which were strengthened at the end of 2020.\n\n## /uni25A0 Commitment with issuers\n\nA key pillar of our responsible investor vision, commitment is demonstrated during analysts' exchanges with companies throughout the year and through individual or\n\ncollaborative actions on the major challenges of sustainable development.\n\n## /uni25A0 ESG voting policy\n\nAmundi's voting policy is in line with its vision as a responsible investor and with the desire to help companies move towards more sustainable objectives.\n\n## /uni25A0 Responsible investment solutions\n\nAmundi o/ffers its clients solutions tailored to the various ESG challenges and approaches: best-in-class funds, labelled funds, thematic funds and impact funds. In 2020, Amundi continued to innovate across all asset classes to develop this range.\n\n## /uni25A0 Innovative partnerships\n\nLastly, through innovative partnerships with major public investors, Amundi is developing solutions to finance the energy transition.

In order to rate more than 10,000 issuers worldwide, Amundi's ESG rating is initially based on a consensus between the analyses of partners who supply non-financial data.\n\nThe analysis methodology is based on 37 criteria, including 16 generic criteria, common to all sectors, and 21 specific criteria, relevant to the challenges of the various sectors.\n\nTo be effective and accurate, the ESG analysis should systematically target the major criteria relating to the company's business sector. The weighting allocated to the selected criteria is a crucial element of the ESG analysis. In each sector, ESG analysts weight four to five key criteria more heavily. The more the company faces a major risk for a given criterion, the more demanding the ESG analysts will be in terms of the quality of its practices.\n\nThe ESG rating is a weighted average of the ratings for the E, S and G aspects. Each aspect is itself the weighted average of the benchmark criteria that comprise it, with each of the 37 analysis criteria also rated from A to G. Ultimately, the company is awarded an overall rating ranging from A to G. A single rating is given to each issuer, regardless of the selected benchmark universe. The ESG rating given to companies is thus 'sector neutral', i.e. no sector is favoured or penalised. ESG ratings are updated monthly by our proprietary SRI expert tool (1) based on data provided by rating agencies. News from issuers is monitored continuously and controversies and alerts are taken into account immediately for updating the analysis. Analysts regularly readjust their analysis methodology according to the environment and current events, particularly if controversies arise.\n\n## A targeted exclusion policy\n\nAmundi applies a targeted exclusion policy, which is the pillar of its fiduciary responsibility. It is applied in all its active management strategies and consists of excluding companies whose practices do not comply with ESG convictions or with international agreements and frameworks and their transposition into national laws. Amundi thus excludes:\n\n- /uni25A0 any direct investment in businesses involved in the manufacture, trading, stocking or servicing of antipersonnel mines or cluster munitions, in accordance with the Ottawa and Oslo conventions;\n- /uni25A0 businesses producing, stocking or marketing chemical, biological and depleted uranium weapons;\n- /uni25A0 businesses that severely and repeatedly contravene one or more of the 10 principles of the Global Compact.\n\nThese are G-rated issuers according to Amundi's rating system.\n\nFurthermore, Amundi implements targeted sector exclusions specific to the coal and tobacco industries, which apply to all active management strategies for which Amundi has full portfolio management discretion.\n\nIn 2020, 617 issuers (Corporates and States) were excluded from the managed portfolios (2) .\n\n## Coal policy\n\nCoal is the largest single contributor to climate change attributable to human activity. Since 2016, Amundi has applied a sector-specific policy to thermal coal, which excludes certain companies and issuers. Every year, Amundi strengthens its exclusion policies. In particular, exclusion thresholds based on the exposure of income to thermal coal have been reduced on an annual basis to 25% income exposure for mining companies and 25% income exposure for coal-fired electricity generation and/or coal mining for all companies that are not committing to a transition trajectory in line with the climate commitments of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group (companies with more than 50% of their income exposed being completely excluded). These commitments are the result of the Group's climate strategy, in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreements of 2015. This strategy is based on the research and recommendations of a Scientific Committee, which takes into account the energy scenarios of the IEA (International Energy Agency), Climate Analytics and Science-Based Targets. At the end of 2020, as part of an update to its policy on the thermal coal sector, Amundi broadened its coal exclusion policy, which now excludes any company that develops or plans to develop new thermal coal operating capacities.\n\n## Tobacco policy\n\nSince October 2018, Amundi has limited the ESG ratings of companies in the tobacco sector to E, on a scale from A to G (with G-rated companies being excluded). This limit aims to penalise investment in this type of company, which should be o/ffset by investments in more virtuous companies. Amundi's policy applies to the tobacco sector as a whole, particularly suppliers, cigarette manufacturers and distributors. In May 2020, Amundi became a signatory to the Tobacco-Free Finance Pledge and extended its exclusion policy so as to exclude producers of cigarettes and complete tobacco products. The decision to strengthen the tobacco policy has taken into account concerns related to public health, as well as the violation of human rights, poverty, the environmental consequences and the considerable economic cost associated with tobacco, estimated at over USD 1,000 billion per year worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Companies manufacturing complete tobacco products are thus excluded and companies involved in the manufacturing, supply and distribution of tobacco are limited to an ESG rating of E.\n\n## An active commitment policy\n\nAmundi has implemented a commitment policy based on three main approaches: thematic commitment, ongoing commitment and shareholder dialogue. This policy is an essential component of Amundi's fiduciary responsibility and its role as a responsible investor.\n\nAmundi's commitment strategy covers a range of ESG themes that have a strong impact on the major challenges that society faces. However, two themes are given priority because they are systemic risk vectors for our societies and opportunities for companies that can incorporate them positively:\n\n- /uni25A0 global warming and the deterioration of ecosystems, which threaten to cause destructive chain reactions;\n- /uni25A0 growing inequality that leads to social divisions endangering the economic and political stability of democracies. In this period of health crisis, fair distribution of added value seems even more necessary.\n\nAs part of our thematic commitments on the living wage, we participated in a collective statement on the importance of prioritising worker safety and long-term relations with suppliers in managing the crisis. As part of the Living Wage Financials Platform, we engaged certain companies specifically on this subject. In terms of exercising votes, we were particularly vigilant about resolutions relating to dividends, in order to ensure that companies took a cautious approach to the situation.\n\nIn 2020, we engaged in dialogue with 878 issuers on the subjects of ESG analysis, commitment and voting.\n\nAmundi has a policy committing it on specific issues, helping companies move towards better practices. The ESG analysis and Corporate Governance teams publish this work in an annual commitment report, available at www.amundi.com. In 2020, specific thematic commitments focused in particular on the circular economy, the strategy of alignment with the Paris agreements and the living wage.\n\n## Voting and shareholder dialogue\n\nSince 1996, Amundi has followed its own voting policy (1) , updated annually, that includes environmental and social criteria. Shareholder commitment is an increasingly influential driver of climate and social issues. Amundi intends to play its full role as a responsible investor and is thus gearing itself up to support resolutions on climate or social issues.\n\nThe voting policy is reviewed annually at the start of the year for implementation at the start of the voting campaign. It is based on the lessons of the previous campaign. Corporate Governance analysts submit proposals for changes to their voting practices to Amundi's Senior Management (Voting Committee) on the main pillars: Shareholders' rights, Boards, Committees and Executive Bodies, Financial Operations and Executive Compensation Policies. At the end of this iterative process, the integration of new principles, the abandonment of others and their implementation in the form of rules of application are validated by the Voting Committee.\n\nIn the context of exercising the voting rights of its UCITS-type funds, Amundi may be faced with situations where there are conflicts of interest, particularly with Group entities. To avoid this contingency, a procedure has been set up allowing those conflicts to be resolved. It is primarily formulated around a preestablished list of issuers where a potential conflict of interest has been identified. For these companies, the proposals for voting on resolutions will, in line with Amundi's voting policy, be submitted to the Voting Committee (chaired by Amundi's Deputy CEO) for validation ahead of the AGM.\n\n| Voting campaign        | 2020   |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| AGMs dealt with        | 4,241  |\n| Resolutions dealt with | 49,968 |\n\nIn 2020, the voting scope continued to broaden compared to 2019. The increase in the number of voting funds is the result of a systematic review of funds that hold or may hold shares. Furthermore, funds of an ESG nature voted on all issuers in the portfolio from the first euro, regardless of the geographic area of investment (Europe/Non-Europe).\n\nWe focused on checking that the compensation policies and/ or the compensation reports submitted for voting included an ESG criteria component. In addition, we very often supported shareholder resolutions demanding greater transparency on matters of ecological and the energy transition. We thus record 86% of votes in favour of shareholder resolutions on climate at the General Meetings of companies in which Amundi participated as an investor. Going forward, the objectives are to increase shareholder dialogue with issuers against which we cast one or more opposing votes in 2020. Lastly, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic consequences on corporate life, Amundi has been stricter on the dividend distribution and share redemption policy. In particular, we paid close attention to the dividend policy of companies that made use of government assistance aimed at maintaining workforce employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

In passive management, new ETF and index-based solutions replicating ESG or SRI indices were also launched.\n\n## Responsible Investment business line\n\nAmundi's Responsible Investment business line defines and implements Amundi's sustainable finance strategy in all its aspects, for various management types: analysis and rating of companies, commitment and voting, integration of ESG factors and design of sustainable investment solutions, key indicators of portfolio sustainability, ESG promotion and participation in local work and initiatives. It brings together 34 specialists, including:\n\n- /uni25A0 ESG, commitment and voting analysis: This international team of 20 experts covers Paris, Dublin, London and Tokyo. ESG analysts meet, engage and maintain dialogue with companies in order to improve their ESG practices, with\n\n## 3.2.4 Climate action\n\nThe challenges associated with the energy transition are at the heart of Amundi's responsible investment strategy, which continued its commitments to a low carbon economy in 2020. These commitments are part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Climate strategy and the governance implemented for that purpose. As of 31 December 2020, assets supporting the energy transition and green growth reached \u20ac21.9/uni00A0billion, a significant increase over 2019 (+78%).\n\nThe asset management industry faces financial risks associated with climate change. For Amundi, these risks are not specific, as they are covered by the ESG approach that Amundi has placed at the heart of its raison d'\u00eatre (1) as a responsible investor. Indeed, the ESG approach implemented since the creation of Amundi and expanded since 2018 is based in particular on integrating non-financial criteria (ESG) into management processes, on a targeted exclusion policy,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- the responsibility to rate these companies. ESG analysts work alongside a team of voting policy specialists and in dialogue prior to General Meetings. Based in Paris, they define the voting policy applicable at the General Meetings of companies in which Amundi invests on behalf of its clients;\n- /uni25A0 ESG methods and solutions: This team of four quantitative analysts is responsible for maintaining and developing Amundi's ESG rating system and for selecting external data providers to generate proprietary ESG scores. They help analysts and portfolio managers to incorporate ESG considerations into their investment decisions and sales development teams to create innovative solutions by incorporating data related to sustainable development into financial products (ESG ratings, climate data, impact measures, controversies, etc.). They are also responsible for implementing the ESG exclusion rules specific to clients.\n\nMany departments are involved in assisting, reporting and supporting Amundi's responsible investment process. A real time distribution interface means fund managers are granted access to the ESG ratings of issuers (Corporates and States), in the same way as financial ratings.\n\n## Dedicated governance\n\nWith the support of these teams, Amundi drives governance dedicated to responsible investment:\n\n- /uni25A0 the ESG Strategic Committee, to define and validate the ESG policy and the Amundi Group's strategic guidelines;\n- /uni25A0 the ESG Rating Committee, to define and validate the ESG rating;\n- /uni25A0 the ESG Voting Committee, to examine and validate Amundi's commitments and exercise of voting rights, and to ensure the consistency of these with the key ESG engagement themes;\n\nthrough specific initiatives on the energy transition and portfolio decarbonisation.\n\nAmundi o/ffers turnkey investment solutions in the form of either open-ended funds or bespoke funds run as investment mandates or dedicated funds. These solutions form part of a range of financial innovations: index-based solutions aligned with the Paris agreements, green bond funds, thematic funds, joint management company with EDF, etc., and of a series of measures, such as strategic partnerships sealed with major public institutions and participation in initiatives such as the Green Bond Principles, the IIGCC (2) and the AIGCC (3) , aimed at engaging investors in the transition to a low carbon economy.",

        "page_content": "## Financing the energy transition\n\nInvestments in green finance most often relate to the areas of energy e/fficiency and green infrastructure. They are designed to address the environmental, social and economic issues that represent the increasing scarcity of natural resources, as well as the management of environmental damage linked to water, air, soil, waste and ecosystems.\n\nAs part of our climate solutions package, we o/ffer thematic funds dedicated to financing the energy transition in the main asset classes, thereby making the fight against climate change accessible to all investors.\n\n## Innovative partnerships\n\nAmundi is at the forefront of major innovations to develop green asset financing, through major partnerships to generate both supply and demand for new green financing projects.\n\nIn 2018 and then 2019, Amundi launched three climate funds with:\n\n- /uni25A0 the IFC (World Bank International Finance Corporation): launch of the largest emerging green bond fund (USD 2 billion);\n- /uni25A0 the European Investment Bank (EIB): to accelerate energy transition projects in Europe with the 'Green Credit Continuum' fund (\u20ac1 billion);\n- /uni25A0 the AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank): bond portfolio of USD 500/uni00A0million aimed at combating climate change.\n\nIn 2020, Amundi and the AIIB developed an innovative framework, the Climate Change Investment Framework, which considers three variables - green financing, limitation of climate risks and resistance to climate change - to analyse the ability of issuers to confront climate change. In addition\n\nto this bond portfolio, the programme plans to leverage an additional USD 500/uni00A0million from institutional investors wishing to take part in the fight against climate change.\n\n## Development of climate metrics\n\n## The carbon footprint of the portfolios\n\nAmundi chose Trucost, the world leader in environmental research and carbon data, to calculate the carbon impact (1) of its funds. This helps us both to take account of CO 2 related to assets under management in the reporting of funds and to develop innovative strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of investment portfolios.\n\n## Temperature trajectories\n\nIn 2020, we used a new methodology for estimating the temperature of portfolios developed by WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) and the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) across four of our equity portfolios. This pilot project represents a new stage in our ESG research work to strengthen the forward-looking assessment of corporates. It also helps to identify the degree of action required to align climate trajectories, particularly through engaging with issuers to set more ambitious emission reduction targets based on scientific data.\n\n## Energy Transition score\n\nAmundi, together with other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities, has developed an 'Energy Transition' score to incorporate the challenges and opportunities of the energy transition into investment decisions. This is a measure of the level of commitment and the ability of corporates to adapt their economic model to the challenges posed by combating global warming and the energy transition.\n\n## 3.2.5 Social and Solidarity Impact Investing\n\nIn 2020, Amundi continued to reinforce its social and solidarity impact investment activity in line with its ambition, announced in 2018, to become the sector leader. The Amundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 fund is now the leading social and solidarity investment fund in France with \u20ac331 million in assets under management at the end of 2020.\n\nThe year 2020 was characterised by the Covid-19 global health crisis. First of all, we focused a significant part of our e/fforts on the support, assistance and monitoring of companies present in the portfolio. Nearly \u20ac40 million was therefore reinvested to strengthen and develop the economic model of companies already present in the portfolio. We were particularly vigilant about the cash position of supported companies. At the same time, we made new investments, nearly \u20ac7 million, in iconic companies with new trends based on the social economy and solidarity around co-working, environmental protection and a more equal sharing of value with short supply chains and recycling.\n\nWith a growth of 13% in its assets under management, Amundi's social impact management continued to develop in 2020; this momentum is explained, as in 2019, by a growing interest on the part of private individuals, via solidarity-based employee savings, and on the part of institutional investors for meaningful investments.\n\nOur five investment themes are unchanged and in 2020 they seek to address the fundamental needs of men and women: to have access to proper housing, recognised work, healthcare, education and appropriate training, to protect the environment and to support solidarity entrepreneurship. These factors combined help ensure stronger social cohesion.\n\nIn 2020, we consolidated our partnerships with France Active Investissement and ADIE, regional solidarity funders. These partnerships allow us to reach a large number of start-up or small-scale companies, while the Amundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 fund supports ESS companies with scaling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Within the portfolio companies, we supported in particular the development of innovative solutions for inclusive habitat: Homnia, which o/ffers co-tenancy solutions for people with disabilities, and Vivre en b\u00e9guinage that brings 'beguinage' community living for seniors right up to date.\n\nOur website (https://amundi.oneheart.fr) has been enhanced by a section on 'the solidarity village'; the portfolio companies are shown there in an entertaining way within a virtual village\n\nto illustrate pathways to revival, enlivenment and inclusion. This may help local authorities, for example, to come up with ideas to identify more inclusive projects as part of urban centre renovation and revitalisation projects.\n\n| Solidarity-based savings - Key  figures   | 31 December  2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| AuM                                       | \u20ac3,779m             |\n| Variation 2020/2019                       | +13.1%              |\n| Number of social companies /financed      | 43                  |\n| Number of Finansol certi/fied funds       | 5                   |\n\n## 3.2.6 The commitment of the Real and Alternative Assets division\n\n## Amundi Immobilier\n\nIn 2020, Amundi Immobilier continued its Responsible Investment approach applied to its entire portfolio, both for the selection and management of its assets. Accordingly, in 2020, the rating of approximately 240 of our assets was updated. In 2020, Amundi Immobilier began to roll out its Supplier Charter, now systematically incorporated into calls for tender. Amundi Immobilier's responsible investment approach reflected in its Responsible Investment Charter is public and accessible on its website. The quality of buildings is reinforced by obtaining labels. In 2020, Amundi Immobilier certified four buildings in order to enhance their environmental performance. A guide to environment-friendly behaviour was circulated to tenants encouraging them to do something for the environment every day. In 2020, Amundi Immobilier increased the greening of its assets by around 40,000/uni00A0m 2 , accounting for nearly 200,000/uni00A0m 2 (roofs, terraces, open ground), thereby working towards local biodiversity, adapting towns and cities to climate change and reconnecting users with nature. Over the year, the solar power capacity installed across the property portfolio managed by Amundi increased by 20%, approximately 700,000 kWh in 2020, rising to more than 4,600,000 kWh.\n\nPursuing better control of energy consumption across our entire portfolio Amundi Immobilier has made a commitment alongside Deepki to deploy a platform for the automatic collection of energy data. In the long term, this platform must drive the reduction of energy consumption across the assets. Lastly, during this year, Amundi Immobilier had several of its funds assessed by the non-financial rating agency GRESB, an international organisation comparing the ESG performance of real assets. Two funds performed very well by obtaining a rating of over 80/100, i.e. 4 out of 5 stars - OPCIMMO with a rating of 83 and AREPE with a rating of 81 - thus placing them above the average assessment for their comparison universe.\n\n## Amundi Private Equity Funds\n\nFollowing Amundi's example, Amundi PEF has incorporated the ESG approach for over five years as a lever for creating value in its investment decisions and throughout the holding period for its investments.\n\nDuring the audits of the equity, infrastructure and private debt funds, the ESG policies of the managers are carefully reviewed and made part of the total assessment of the investment proposals. To expand this approach during the investment period, Amundi PEF analyses pertinent quantitative and qualitative ESG indicators, across managers and across their underlying investments. As an active shareholder participating in corporate governance, Amundi PEF also ensures that ESG issues are discussed in Board meetings and that these companies make progress on these issues throughout the duration of the investment (five years on average). Our commitment approach involves recommendations covering periods that vary in length, adapted to the company and its sector.\n\nAmundi PEF and the extra-financial analysis teams are already integrated into the market working groups alongside the other investment capital players of the Parisian association France Invest. Amundi is also an active contributor to France Invest's ESG guide.\n\nIn 2020, Amundi PEF participated in the annual evaluation of PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) and was awarded a rating of A+, i.e. the highest rating.\n\n## Private debt\n\nSince its creation in 2012, the Private Debt business has applied Amundi's ESG principles tailored to the specific features of this asset class. The ESG approach to private debt is based on the sector-based approach taken upstream by Amundi's ESG analysts. The approach is then passed on by the Private Debt team managers and analysts via questionnaires and personal interviews. In 2020, Amundi's Private Debt team continued to go from strength to strength and to further diversify its expertise. It currently manages \u20ac6/uni00A0billion in corporate senior debt, real estate debt and acquisition debt.",

        "page_content": "Consideration of ESG criteria is an integral part of the private debt investment process, from the investment selection phase and until the loans and bonds mature. This is an ESG best e/fforts policy. In terms of exclusion, private debt valuations apply an exclusion policy to their investments in line with that of Amundi. Each opportunity presented to the investment committee is subject to due diligence relating to the ESG risks identified. This due diligence is an integral part of the analysis criteria and helps to inform credit analysis, conducted concurrently. It is a way for investors to guard against longterm risks (financial, regulatory, operational and reputational) and to fully exercise their responsibility. ESG due diligence is carried out through each valuation, in collaboration with Amundi's ESG teams and, depending on the issuers, may include questionnaires, discussions with management or sector-based study reviews by non-financial rating agencies.\n\nThe analysis document presented to the investment committee for approval highlights ESG points of note, if necessary. As part of portfolio monitoring, each issuer invested by private debt funds is reviewed on recent performance at least once a year. In the event of improvement or deterioration at ESG level, the management team brings it to the attention of the investment committee in order to inform overall performance. In the event that an ESG aspect is downgraded (such as a controversy arising), which is contrary to Amundi's exclusion policy or likely to have an adverse impact on credit, the committee may, at its discretion, approve corrective measures designed to protect investors' capital and their reputation. Corrective measures\n\nmay take the form of a redemption request (in accordance with documentation clauses relating to controversies in particular), disposal on the secondary market in the case of liquid assets or enhanced monitoring with the borrower. Regular dialogue with borrowers can usually allow teams to anticipate issues and react quickly. Investors are provided with an annual report on ESG performance.\n\n## Amundi Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique\n\nIn 2016, Amundi entered into a partnership with EDF as part of the financing of the Amundi Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique (ATE) energy transition. ATE is an asset management company dedicated to green infrastructure and the energy transition, which aims to establish a robust and sustainable energy model in the face of energy supply issues, price changes, resource depletion and environmental protection requirements. ATE has investment capacity of \u20ac2 billion and has made several investments in solar farms in France with an installed capacity of 110.4/uni00A0 MW. In June 2020, Amundi launched AMUNDI \u00c9NERGIES VERTES, the first energy transition fund eligible for life insurance policies investing directly in green infrastructure. This is a new investment vehicle that allows private individuals to participate in financing the energy transition while benefiting from the appeal of investing in real assets. Amundi \u00c9nergies Vertes was placed third in the AGEFI Coupoles de la Distribution innovation awards.\n\n## 3.3 KEEPING THE PROMISE TO CLIENTS\n\nOur commitment is to provide our clients with high-performing, transparent investment and saving solutions as part of a longlasting relationship based on mutual trust.\n\nAmundi is organised around two main business lines:\n\n- /uni25A0 supplying savings products that meet the needs of private individuals in our partner networks and of third-party distributors;\n- /uni25A0 developing specific investment solutions for our institutional clients and corporate clients' customers.\n\nSince 2016, Amundi has been hosting an advisory committee composed of leading experts to discuss the global economic and geopolitical outlook, analyse its impacts on the financial markets in each of the major geographic regions and sharpen our understanding of clients' financial needs, particularly in countries where we have decided to establish a presence.\n\n## 3.3.1 Developing a long-lasting relationship with/uni00A0partner networks and/uni00A0their/uni00A0clients\n\nAmundi is a historic partner in four banking networks in France (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks, LCL, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord) and in 14 other networks in Europe and Asia. The Amundi teams work closely with each of the partner networks in identifying the needs and the most appropriate resources and services for their clients. For example, nearly 130 people at Amundi in France are dedicated to the relationships with the four long-standing partners.\n\nBeyond the partner networks, Amundi is developing a growing business with other French and foreign distributor networks (banks, insurance companies, brokers), which most often distribute savings solutions built by Amundi using open architecture and intended for customers of their networks.\n\nAmundi's dedicated teams in charge of these partnerships rely on the excellent knowledge held by each of these networks of the varied needs of their di/fferent client segments. They work closely with their correspondants on identifying the investment vehicles and services that are best suited to the needs of their clients. In this way, the characteristics of each product, the composition of the ranges on o/ffer and the associated services and communication are developed together and validated periodically by Products and Services Committees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

The objective is to remain informed of local developments on each of its partners' markets in terms of savings behaviour and potential new savings solutions made possible by regulatory developments, and to monitor the o/fferings of competitors in order to help our contacts to o/ffer their private clients the products that best meet their needs.\n\nThe theme of responsible savings is enjoying increasing interest from savers. At the beginning of 2020, Amundi conducted a survey with the MOAI agency on savers and responsible investment. This study enabled us to identify the expectations of private individuals and to use operational elements to guide our action. The study will be repeated in 2021.\n\n## Supporting our partner networks in France and abroad\n\nFor Amundi, developing the expertise of the teams of advisors of our partner networks when it comes to our savings products and solutions is a priority. In the particular healthcare context of 2020, Amundi adapted its support system for clients by favouring digital formats, particularly web conferencing. The teams in charge of distribution networks have adapted their communication plan, by providing numerous web conference training sessions and by setting up regular videoconference calls with their clients. Online awareness campaigns were also deployed with client advisors and the events initially planned as face-to-face were digitalised. To launch the new o/fferings, Amundi developed a number of digital tools: podcasts, product videos, and sales and training guides.\n\n## Specific actions carried out with networks to promote responsible finance\n\nIn 2020, the theme of ESG and responsible finance was prioritised in events organised by Amundi or in which Amundi took part and spoke. For example, in 2020, more than 3,000 employees of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Bank network (retail\n\nmarket, asset market and Private Banking) and more than 18,000 asset-based clients were made aware of responsible investment. A global communication plan for Responsible Investment was deployed and written communications are regularly disseminated. In 2020, Amundi broadened its o/ffer of responsible solutions with the completion in June 2020 of a new range and the launch of an Climate Impact o/ffering. These launches were supported by an extensive, fully digitalised communication system: podcasts, product videos, sales and training guides and a communication kit for advisors.\n\nIn 2020, many distributors set up responsible ranges for their clients. Amundi supported them in this process by helping them to define their range, by labelling new funds and by providing regular support on regulatory developments in Europe.\n\n## Product validation\n\nThe Products and Services Committee, a decision-making and governance body chaired each/uni00A0month by the Head of Retail Marketing, formally validates the creation and development of investment vehicle ranges and the associated services on o/ffer. No product can be marketed without the favourable opinion of the Risk, Legal and Compliance business lines represented on this committee. Approval requests to supervisory authorities are then completed before the teams responsible for the product's distribution deploy all the necessary resources in conjunction with the partner networks.\n\n## Measuring client satisfaction\n\nAmundi is mindful of the opinions of its distributors and in 2020 it continued to regularly measure the satisfaction of its distribution networks through the Client Recommendation Index. In 2020, the campaigns were repeated for the Regional Banks of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and LCL in France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and UniCredit in Italy, KB in the Czech Republic and extended for the first time to the UniCredit networks in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic. The CRI survey of CA and LCL networks for 2020 revealed very positive levels and a significant increase compared to 2019; the CRI increased from 25 to 31 in 2020 for the Regional Banks and from 59 to 65 for LCL.\n\n## 3.3.2 Establishing relationships of trust with our corporate and institutional clients and o/ffering them solutions tailored to their needs\n\nInstitutional clients (Sovereign, Institutional, Corporate) expect an asset manager to have a detailed and thorough understanding of their specific needs and to provide appropriate solutions, all within a relationship of trust built over time.\n\n## Understanding the needs of institutional clients\n\nIn 2020, the Institutional Division acquired a number of external studies. In addition, specific studies are carried out with clients and/or prospective clients. The annual Amundi CREATE survey of European Pension Funds, launched in 2014, was repeated. It\n\nwas conducted with 158 pension funds and covers the themes of asset allocation in uncertain times, the growth of 'targetbased' investing and ESG as the cornerstone of investment.\n\n## Supporting our institutional clients\n\nIn the particular healthcare context of 2020, Amundi adapted the support system for its clients by favouring digital formats. The events initially planned as face-to-face were digitalised and new channels of communication were developed with the launch of the Outerblue podcast channel and the launch of a series of videos on major themes normally dealt with at the",

Specific training on responsible finance topics were organised for clients taking part in the annual Executive Training Programme. Amundi is prompt to promote the ESG theme whenever it communicates and when organising events. Awareness of responsible finance is also being raised with the publication of documentary series and research work, for example on the importance of ESG factors in value generation for various asset classes in Europe and the United States.\n\nAmundi has also expanded its range of responsible solutions intended for its institutional clients with the launch of new ESG funds: ESG Improvers, ESG ETFs, as well as the Amundi Social Bond Fund and the specific funds for green bonds (Emerging Corporate Green Bond, Climate ETFs).\n\nTo help its institutional clients work to promote the energy transition, Amundi has launched, in partnership with AIIB, a benchmark tool for assessing the risks associated with climate change in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement.\n\n## Quality of client service\n\nAmundi o/ffers client service that meets the expectations and needs of its clients, whether in setting up a dedicated fund or mandate, or as part of the operational, administrative and reporting aspects of its/uni00A0day-to-day relationships.\n\nThe Client Service Department stands behind the quality of the service rendered, the responsiveness and the honouring of the Group's commitments through its everyday interactions with\n\nall the links in the Amundi value chain. The company carries out a continuous e/ffort to improve the quality of its services. To date, these commitments have meant that Amundi receives a very limited number of complaints.\n\nAmundi is committed to handling complaints as promptly as possible and to providing consistent and systematic quality in its answers. Where necessary, the implementation of action plans is monitored by the Risk Management Department's Permanent Control team. The complaints process is part of the set of/uni00A0monthly performance indicators. In practice, in 2020, the number of client complaints decreased compared to the previous year and a reduction in the time for handling client complaints was recorded. More than three quarters of complaints in 2020 related to the quality of the o/ffering (dissemination of Net Asset Values or reporting), with the remaining quarter being linked to one-o/ff or specific issues.\n\nIn 2020, Amundi again achieved ISAE 3402 certification, an internationally recognised standard for the quality of a risk management policy, through the assessment of the operational relevance and efficiency of its key controls pertaining to services provided to clients, thereby reflecting ongoing rigour in process organisation and improvement.\n\n## Measuring the satisfaction of institutional clients\n\nAmundi continues its efforts to measure the satisfaction of its institutional clients. In this regard, the Customer Recommendation Index measurement, launched in 2019 for our main European clients, was extended to new European countries (Austria, Nordics, etc.) and to Asia (under test) in 2020, with the addition of new questions to refine diagnosis, particularly on the commercial relationship and client relationship. The process is under construction. It will be continued in 2021.\n\n## 3.3.3 An independent compliance and risk management structure to/uni00A0guarantee our/uni00A0commitment to our clients\n\nAmundi has an integrated and independent control system to respect the orientations and constraints set by its clients. In this way, the Risk and Compliance functions help strengthen the reliability of Amundi's products and services and help us meet our obligations to our clients.\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe Compliance teams play an essential, preventive role ensuring compliance with regulations, Good Conduct Codes and professional standards, which they safeguard. They look after the clients' interest, ensure the integrity of the market and the independence of our activities.\n\nIn order to ensure that clients are protected, Compliance validates all newly created products and substantial modifications of existing products above and beyond the regulatory requirements. For partner networks, this responsibility also extends to sales and marketing documents intended for the networks' clients or prospects and for the advisors. For client complaints, the Compliance Department\n\nensures that all complaints are handled and processed in accordance with the law, regulations and procedures. It approves all replies to clients before they are sent.\n\nTo conduct its mission, the Compliance Department has formalised a 'Set of Compliance Procedures' detailing the compliance rules that apply, particularly those laid out in the Code of Professional Ethics, the Compliance Manual and the Anti-Money Laundering Manual, and that are carried out through written procedures. This set of procedures is distributed to local managers and applies to all entities.\n\n## Key compliance highlights of 2020\n\nIn 2020, the high volatility of the markets led to a significant increase in the number of alerts. To address this, Compliance implemented a di/fferentiated process for certain alerts. This adjustment was made in line with the recommendations issued by the regulator in April 2020, which recognised that 'the number of alerts may have increased significantly and that each player must be discerning and take market conditions into account'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

It is structured around four themes: respect for market integrity, financial security, including international sanctions and antimoney laundering/combating the financing of terrorism, professional ethics and the prevention of fraud and corruption. All employees (permanent and fixed-term, international volunteering, work-study or equivalent depending on local legislation) of Amundi Group entities in France and abroad are a/ffected.\n\nBecause of the lockdown period associated with Covid-19 requiring the majority of Group employees to work from home, Amundi decided to deploy only three main sessions and catch-up courses in 2020: International sanctions, AML/ CFT and the fight against corruption.\n\n## Regulatory training provided in 2020 (France scope)\n\n| % employees trained                   | 97.60%   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|\n| Number of employees trained           | 2,407    |\n| Number of training hours              | 4,886    |\n| Number of training sessions           | 7,958    |\n| Number of training hours per employee | 2.03     |\n\n## Ethics\n\nIn line with the dissemination of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's code of ethics in 2017 and Amundi's code of conduct in 2019, the internal regulations of Amundi's 13 French entities, as well as the IT charter and the compliance ethics appendix attached to it, have been updated. A communications initiative was carried out at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group level in Q4 2020 to strengthen the ethical culture of employees.\n\nTo prevent unethical and criminal behaviour, Amundi, within the framework of the Sapin 2 Law, has set up a new whistleblowing tool (BKMS) to support any Company employee, any external employee or any supplier who wishes to exercise their right to report. This tool, already deployed within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, guarantees an environment of strict confidentiality that allows the facts to be exposed and discussed with the person designated to handle whistleblowing while protecting the whistle-blower's identity. The tool was rolled out in all 36 Amundi entities in October 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management\n\nControlling risks and honouring its obligations are basic to the relationship of trust that Amundi has with its clients. Amundi's Risk Management function is highly integrated, in order to give the Group a consistent, systematic approach to measuring and monitoring risks for all its activities.\n\nThe function is based on a worldwide online business line organisation and the sharing of methodologies and tools common to all Risk teams. The organisation and controls deployed evolve regularly to ensure a risk management continually adapted to the Company's challenges and provide customers with the assurance that our explicit commitments and compliance with regulatory obligations are being implemented. Investments are audited by sta/ff who are independent of fund management personnel. It is integrated with Amundi's Business Support and Audit Division, whose main mission is to protect the client's interest. Its role is to ensure, through a dedicated information system, that the investment constraints requested by clients or required by regulations are observed.\n\nRisk control personnel install and monitor an internal system to regulate management processes, in three phases:\n\n- /uni25A0 devising, in systematic fashion, internal control rules and regulations specific to each investment strategy, based on a preliminary identification of the risk factors that underlie performance;\n- /uni25A0 overseeing on a daily basis the management actions taken, to check that the investment decisions and the positions in the portfolios are in keeping with the management rules and the objectives sought;\n- /uni25A0 evaluating ex post the quality of the management processes, based on independent measurements made using proven methodologies.\n\nTo ensure its adherence to principles of fiduciary duty, Amundi prepares and sends two documents to its clients, the prospectus and the KIID (Key Investor Information Document), describing the conditions under which the fund is managed, as well as the relationship between yield and the level of risk associated with such management. Several indicators reflecting the risk level of funds are included in these documents. They are calculated independently by the Risk Management Department.\n\nAmundi regularly updates its risk management system in the light of new regulations, new activities and market challenges. More specifically, for 2020, in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, Amundi changed its risk management system and, more specifically, the liquidity risk management system, in order to preserve the liquidity of its funds and to serve the subscriptions and redemptions recorded in the interests of its private and institutional clients.",

These risks and opportunities associated with ESG will vary depending on the country, the business sector and characteristics specific to an issuer, such as size and geographical footprint.

The charter provides all employees with a reference framework both in France and internationally. It underlines the commitments made by the Group and the good practices that need to be observed.\n\nAmundi provides its clients with information on the implementation of rights and procedures for processing the personal data it collects.\n\nAs an employer, Amundi guarantees that the personal data of its employees will be protected and that their private life will be respected by means of an employee charter.

There is a focus on internal sta/ff, which allows for long-term investment in the company's human resources. Amundi's employment policy must also allow employees to develop skills and maintain their employability over the long term.\n\n## Change in headcount\n\nIn 2020, the 4.5% increase in Amundi's workforce was marked by the Group's external growth, with two major transactions:\n\n- /uni25A0 the acquisition of SABAM in Spain with the integration of 126 employees;\n- /uni25A0 the creation of a 'Bank of China Wealth Management' majority joint venture in China, with the recruitment of 44 people.\n\nIn total, we recruited 334 people and recorded 232 departures. Young people under the age of 30 comprise 33% of new hires. In 2020, we also continued to recruit experienced profiles to support Amundi's development and pursued our policy of insourcing service providers. The Amundi Group's exit rate stands at 5.1%, compared to 7.1% in 2019.\n\n| Permanent/fixed-term recruitment  (in number)       | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Worldwide                                           | 334    |\n| of which France                                     | 161    |\n| Permanent/fixed-term departures  (in/uni00A0number) |        |\n| Worldwide                                           | 232    |\n| of which France                                     | 62     |\n\n## Internal mobility\n\nFor Amundi, internal mobility is a priority tool for adapting employment:\n\n- /uni25A0 functional mobility to anticipate changes in business lines and encourage employees to move towards developing sectors;\n- /uni25A0 geographical mobility to support the development of certain places of business and promote cross-functionality between countries.\n\nIn 2020, despite a di/fficult public health situation, Amundi recorded 206 (1) /uni00A0 internal transfers and 46/uni00A0 transfers internationally. Our HR policies and tools aim to support employees, with special monitoring for those who change business line, and to enhance all the company's business lines. Management committees comprised of the human resources managers of each business line regularly review the positions that need to be filled and the employees being transferred, thereby promoting the coordination of supply and demand. In terms of individual support, in addition to interviews and career management, Amundi makes a virtual coaching tool (JobMaker) available to employees, which helps them prepare their personal development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo develop international mobility, a mobility committee has been set up specifically at international level, thereby encouraging better management of the Group's various employment pools.\n\n## Training\n\nFor Amundi, training is an important driver for the Company's development. It implements a set of actions with the following objectives, which are directly linked to its strategic ambitions:\n\n- /uni25A0 to maintain a high level of performance in the position by ensuring a match between the activities, responsibilities and skill level required for each employee;\n- /uni25A0 to develop employability regarding professional projects and the company's needs.\n\nThe skills development plan is set annually to meet individual and collective needs in line with the company's structuring projects and the regulatory and technical developments in each business line. As a contributor to both development and commitment, professional mobility is monitored on an individual basis and supported through training. Similarly, employees returning from long-term leave are trained without prior arbitration and over the course of the year as soon as the need is reported.\n\nIn 2020, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, the Company continued to roll out its training plan by adapting its implementation procedures. The majority of the training package was offered as distance learning. Each employee concerned therefore had the choice of accepting the distance learning method or postponing their training to 2021 in a faceto-face format, subject to the health conditions required at the appropriate time.\n\nIn parallel with the traditional deployment of the training plan, the Company implemented two programmes to support teams and managers during the first and second lockdowns in 2020. A comprehensive system was proposed to enable each employee to work comfortably and efficiently from home, along with organisation and communication within so-called hybrid teams. The multidisciplinary approach covered all the needs raised by the issue of working remotely in a crisis context: a webinar on the fundamentals of remote working, virtual classes to support managers on sensitive topics (psychosocial risks, team commitment), workshops for natural teams to jointly create operating charters, web conferences on work life quality themes of trust, resilience, PSR risks (isolation, porous work/life boundary) and the provision of guides and fact sheets for managers. This system was supplemented by a wealth of individual and collective support (traditional coaching, coaching boost, hotline managers, co-development workshops).\n\nManagerial training for 2020 focused as a priority on training new managers taking up positions and raising awareness of new working methods.",

It takes into account the economic environment, competitiveness and the labour market. As these factors may differ from one country to another, Amundi adapts its compensation policy to local situations and regulations. The compensation policy is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee chaired by an independent director and composed of directors that are either independent or who do not hold an executive function within Amundi. It complies with regulatory standards (AIFMD/ UCITS V, MIFID and CRD IV).\n\nThe key components of Amundi's compensation scheme are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 a fixed salary in line with duties and responsibilities, taking into account specific local and market conditions;\n- /uni25A0 variable compensation which breaks down into an annual bonus determined by the manager, and a long-term incentive:\n- /uni25A0 the annual bonus rewards an employee's contribution to Amundi's performance and is based on both individual and collective factors,\n- /uni25A0 the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) is granted to a select group of key executives in the form of Amundi performance shares, designed to motivate managers to achieve financial targets set out in the Amundi Business Plan. Under the authorisation given by the Annual General Meeting of 16/uni00A0May 2019, the Amundi Board of Directors\n\napproved the introduction on 12/uni00A0December 2019 of a new performance share plan for certain beneficiaries. This plan follows the same objectives as previous plans, namely the alignment of the interests of the Group's senior executives in achieving the commercial and financial objectives of Amundi's Medium-Term Plan;\n\n- /uni25A0 collective variable compensation which ensures employees in France share in the profits of Amundi's financial performance. The total amount is set as a function of a benchmark figure adjusted for changes in net income, in assets under management, and in the cost-to-income ratio. In 2020, the average amount of collective variable compensation was more than \u20ac9,500, in line with Amundi's 2019 results.\n\nIn 2020, Amundi's priorities in implementing the compensation policy were as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 to promote the development of young employees and those who take on new responsibilities;\n- /uni25A0 to pay attention especially to entry-level salaries, which in France resulted in the payment of exceptional bonuses amounting to at least \u20ac600 to 65% of employees whose overall compensation is less than \u20ac80,000, as well as a bonus enhancement for certain support departments. This bonus recognised Amundi's good results in 2019;\n- /uni25A0 in addition, an exceptional purchasing power bonus in the amount of \u20ac450 was paid to employees who received, over the 12 months preceding the payment date, an overall gross annual compensation less than three times the annual value of the SMIC (minimum wage), i.e. \u20ac55,419.12.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

In 2008, Amundi signed the Diversity Charter, in which it committed to comply with and promote the principle of non-discrimination. Amundi has a policy that respects professional diversity. This commitment is specifically reflected in the requirement for fairness in the main human resources procedures: recruitment, compensation, training, evaluation and professional promotion.\n\n## Gender equality in the workplace\n\nWith regard to gender equality in the workplace, our actions are driven by two key points:\n\n- /uni25A0 vigilance regarding equal pay for the same job.\n\nThe actions carried out by Amundi in 2020 dealt with two aspects: the static aspect and the dynamic aspect.\n\n- /uni25A0 The static aspect comprises the initiatives aimed at determining whether there is a difference in the treatment of men and women, by means of a calculation of the gender equality index. This index returned a score of 84 out of a maximum of 100 points, based on the following indicators: equality of rates of individual wage increases (excluding promotions), promotion rate, proportion of female employees whose wages were increased after returning from maternity leave.\n- /uni25A0 The dynamic aspect comprises all the actions aimed either at reducing unfair gaps or at preventing them before they arise. This aspect comes into play through initiatives that have been in place for several years:\n- -financial packages aimed at reducing unfair pay gaps;\n- -a guarantee to female employees returning from maternity leave of a pay increase equal to at least the average increase granted during the period of leave, as part of the annual compensation campaign. All female employees returning from maternity leave benefit from this measure;\n- -as part of the 2020 campaign, Amundi implemented the non-prorating of women's bonuses for the period corresponding to statutory and conventional maternity leave (excluding nursing leave).\n- /uni25A0 encouragement of women into management positions. For this theme, our actions aim to eliminate all the obstacles (trust, visibility, representations, maternity) that could slow down their careers).\n- /uni25A0 In 2020, all the actions undertaken helped to record a sharp increase in the number of women on Amundi's Executive Committee, reaching 28.6% as of 31 December 2020 compared with 18.5% in 2019, and exceeding the figure of 30% for female executives.\n- /uni25A0 In terms of support, due to the unique nature of 2020, only nine women (versus 31 in 2019) were supported through the various Group leadership training programmes dedicated specifically to young talent. We have also continued our e/fforts to take greater account of gender diversity in HR processes: talent pools are now 42% women, consistent with the percentage of women in the company; one in three people in the succession plans for key posts in the company are women. Finally, the issue of diversity is now systematically addressed at People Reviews for all employees.\n- /uni25A0 Internationally, actions are also being undertaken to encourage women into management positions. In Dublin, several senior female executives took part in a training course entitled 'Leaders on the Rise - Shaping Future Female Talent', with the aim of creating a support network for ambitious women managers. In the United Kingdom, Amundi is committed to gender equality by complying with the Women in Finance Charter, particularly on the theme of gender equality in positions of responsibility.\n- /uni25A0 In November 2020, Amundi made a commitment alongside six French management companies to create the '30% Club France Investor Group' to promote better gender diversity within the SBF 120 governing bodies. This group of investors calls on French large caps to draw up an action plan to ensure that their governing bodies comprise at least 30% women by 2025.\n- /uni25A0 For its part, Amundi's objective is to achieve 30% women in its Executive Committee in 2022 and 35% in the Senior Leadership Team in 2025.\n\n| Percentage of women in the company   | 31/12/2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|\n| In workforce                         | 41.70%       |\n| In management                        | 35.00%       |\n| In Senior Leadership Team (1)        | 30.10%       |\n| On Executive Committee               | 28.60%       |\n| On Management Committee              | 21.40%       |\n| In country management                | 33.30%       |\n| On Board of Directors                | 41.70%       |\n\n- (1)  The Senior Leadership Team brings together employees in the first tier of management of the Amundi Group, i.e. around 150 people.",

        "page_content": "## Parenthood\n\n## Employer-employee communication\n\nIt is important for Amundi to allow women to combine motherhood and their careers. Amundi also includes men in its policy, as they are also a/ffected by issues of parenthood and work-life balance. To this end, Amundi has decided, from 1/uni00A0January 2020, to introduce 16 weeks of maternity leave in all its places of business worldwide, and to supplement this scheme with a systematic HR interview to prepare the return from maternity leave, as well as five days of paid paternity leave. These measures fall within the framework of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Human Project (1) and that of the International Framework Agreement signed in July 2019 by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and UNI Global Union. This agreement covers human rights, fundamental labour rights and the development of employer-employee social dialogue. It aims to allow all the Group's employees to take advantage of a single base of social benefits, regardless of the country where they work, through a number of commitments to support people with disabilities, as well as parenthood and provident schemes.\n\nAware of the di/fficulties encountered by parents during the first lockdown, Amundi has borne part of the childcare costs (whether the parent is working remotely or at the o/ffice). In addition, educational assistance was o/ffered for employees' children.\n\n## Awareness actions\n\nTraining, awareness, communication and the fight against unconscious bias and stereotypes are an integral part of Amundi's global action plan to achieve progress in the area of diversity. In France, the training programme on the fight against discrimination continued in 2020. The programme, which is mandatory for managers and human resources recruiters, was extended from 2019 to include all employees on an optional basis via a serious game hosted on Phileas.\n\nLastly, the Amundi Women Diversity network had 485 members as of the end of/uni00A0December 2020, including 142 men. In Ireland, diversity and inclusion were highlighted in 2020 with the creation of the Women in Amundi Ireland network and the publication of a series of Intranet interviews on the careers of several female employees. These topics will also be picked up in 2021, with the creation of a Diversity and Inclusion Committee and the launch of a 'Voices from the Shadows' campaign to encourage all employees to make a commitment on this subject. In the United States, a series of actions to promote diversity was deployed in 2020: mandatory training on unconscious bias, awareness events, the 'Light on Diversity' series published on the Intranet and disseminated by email.\n\n## Cultural diversity\n\nAmundi also promotes cultural diversity within its various entities. In the United States, the year was punctuated by the organisation of events and publications aimed at educating employees on celebrations from various cultures. With a di/fferent theme every month, a minority or a di/fferent culture came under the spotlight. In Ireland, as part of Diversity and Inclusion Week, several nationalities were highlighted in order to enhance diversity within the entity.\n\nAmundi's social policy is to engage in constructive dialogue with the various employee representative bodies, whether through formal or ad hoc bodies. Amundi recognises that social dialogue and healthy employee representative bodies contribute to its development.\n\nIn 2020, social dialogue in France was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic crisis. Four agreements were signed with the social partners:\n\n- /uni25A0 agreement on mandatory annual negotiation for 2020;\n- /uni25A0 agreement on the exceptional purchasing power premium for 2020;\n- /uni25A0 agreement on the procedures for taking leave in the Covid19 context;\n- /uni25A0 agreement on a new accidental death and disability scheme.\n\nFrom the end of February 2020, social dialogue has constantly been an essential driver in addressing the health crisis and adapting work organisation. The aim is to ensure business continuity while protecting employees' health and helping to limit the spread of the epidemic. Social dialogue has particularly intensified with trade unions and within the ESC (2) and occupational health and safety (CSSCT) (3) bodies. At each new stage of the health crisis, the quality and regularity of discussion enabled the implementation of specific measures tailored to employee protection on the following themes: remote working, prevention, psychosocial risks, protection measures, return to site, taking leave, etc. All measures implemented are in compliance with government instructions.\n\nSince the first lockdown, remote working has become widespread. For on-site employees, health conditions have been enhanced, with the disinfection of premises and distribution of sanitising gel and masks. Working hours have been arranged to avoid employees taking public transport during rush hours.\n\nWith the belief that sustainable performance is a process of reconciling the search for efficiency with attention to employee well-being, Amundi will engage in discussions with social partners in 2021 on the quality of life at work, which will include a remote working component.\n\n## Quality of life in the workplace\n\n## Psychosocial risks prevention policy (PSR)\n\nAmundi's policy on the prevention of PSR and on quality of life in the workplace is one of ongoing improvement and integration into HR policies. It is notable for its interdisciplinary approach - relying on managers, the Human Resources Department, occupational medicine, and employee representatives (4) .\n\nIn France, specific governance of psychosocial risks in the workplace is entrusted to a monitoring committee that meets quarterly and tracks the various indicators, in addition to/uni00A0the monthly meetings of a management committee dedicated to the HR monitoring of at-risk employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

These actions have been enhanced to provide a suitable response to the potential consequences of the health crisis: isolation, loss of community involvement, work overload/underload, hyperconnectedness/disconnect, work/life balance, stress, etc.\n\nA system for supporting remote working for managers and employees is currently deployed, with a dual objective of maintaining the collective bond and strengthening remote managemen. This includes distribution of guides on remote working, training for managers and employees, management coaching and self-help conferences.\n\nOther specific mechanisms, opened during the health crisis, are o/ffered to employees:\n\n- /uni25A0 remote medical consultation: at no additional cost, Amundi employees can take advantage of a remote medical consultation service for any general medical problem;\n- /uni25A0 a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. psychology unit: in addition to the traditional listening space that already existed, this remotely accessible unit provides 24/7 moral support to employees;\n- /uni25A0 dedicated psychological support by specialised teams for employees with disabilities.\n\nInternationally, entities are also committed to the prevention of psychosocial risks by o/ffering management training and by launching awareness campaigns. In Austria, an assessment of workplace stress factors was carried out in 2019 following the merger with Pioneer Investments and the relocation of the company. The action plan scheduled to roll out in 2020 has been postponed until 2021 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Ireland, the topic of mental health was one of the priorities for 2020, with the promotion of World Mental Health Day in October, the distribution of a series of online tips and a prevention kit comprising five virtual classes, and the raising of awareness through the 'Mental Health Champions/Mental Health First Aiders' programme launched in 2019.\n\n## Health policy\n\nAs a result of the health crisis, most of the health measures in the workplace scheduled for 2020 were heavily impacted or even cancelled. However, in January, Amundi was able to organise seven hours' training for 14 employees, enabling them to update their knowledge of first aid. In partnership with the \u00c9tablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang (the French blood bank service), we held two donor sessions in the year, in February and September, with 154 volunteer employees.\n\nTo combat the pandemic, the Occupational Health Department set about implementing measures tailored to the health situation:\n\n- /uni25A0 thermographic cameras installed at the entrance to each building;\n- /uni25A0 individual health kits distributed, containing surgical masks, a sanitising solution and a disinfectant spray for all volunteer employees present on site;\n\n- /uni25A0 office equipment such as screens and chairs sent to employees whose state of health justified it;\n- /uni25A0 a protocol implemented for detecting, tracing and tracking contacts and symptomatic/confirmed cases;\n- /uni25A0 employees with disabilities and/or at risk monitored and supported with telephone calls and email exchanges.\n\n## Well-being at work\n\nFor several years now, Amundi has established measures intended to improve quality of life in the workplace and to help employees achieve a better work-life balance.\n\nExceeding the legal requirements in France, the Company acts through:\n\n- /uni25A0 the organisation of work: meetings that comply with the team's working hours, defined planning ahead of time, periods when accessible in the context of remote working, etc.;\n- /uni25A0 measures to make parenthood easier: standard breastfeeding leave, children's sick days, paternity leave, maternity and parenthood guides, etc.;\n- /uni25A0 measures aimed at improving working conditions for seniors (two days of remote working for the over-57s), facilitating the transition between work and retirement (assisted part-time, personalised review information, retirement preparation training, end-of-career leave, transition leave financed by the European Works Council);\n- /uni25A0 solutions to make everyday life easier: company concierge services, dedicated gym, take-away in addition to the company restaurant;\n- /uni25A0 systems dedicated to caregiving staff: practical guide, Responsage platform (information and advice service), donations of days;\n- /uni25A0 supporting the social endeavours of the Works Council: access to childcare centres, help with childcare costs, universal service employment vouchers (CESU), etc.\n\nInternationally, Amundi is also committed to improving the quality of life at work for its employees. In Austria, an annual assessment of the working environment, and particularly of individual workstations, is carried out. In Ireland, a comprehensive well-being programme was deployed in 2020. This programme includes workshops, individual consultations, on-site vaccinations and a seminar.\n\n## Commitment\n\n## Talent commitment\n\nTo facilitate the implementation of an employment policy that places priority on internal mobility, and to allow everybody to evolve and develop within the Group, each employee has an assigned HR business partner and individualised employee management.\n\nIn collaboration with the management, employee management\n\ncontributes both to the adaptation of resources to the needs of the business and to the individual development of employees. The organisation of employee management is aligned with the management structure and incorporates matrix management. It is set at an initial local level with a direct hierarchy, then organised by business line with dedicated contacts and a cross-sectional vision.",

        "page_content": "The role of the HR business partner includes several levels of support:\n\n- /uni25A0 employee reviews between HR business partner and management covering all scopes;\n- /uni25A0 succession plans put in place to ensure succession for key positions;\n- /uni25A0 support for employees in di/fficult circumstances.\n\nThese exchanges between HR and management are an opportunity to identify employees with high potential for development within the business. Talent management continued in 2020 as it adapted to the health crisis. The NOVAMUNDI (young talent development programme) cohorts have completed their work digitally and several of\n\ntheir projects will be implemented within the Group. The year 2020 also saw the resumption of the Top 150 event through the creation of the Senior Leadership Team.\n\n## Measurement of employee commitment\n\nEvery year, Amundi carries out a survey to measure the commitment of its employees. Known as the 'Engagement and Recommendation Index (ERI)' this approach is used within all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities. In 2020, Amundi carried out the survey in France and in all its other places of business around the world. More than 4,400 employees were surveyed, giving a participation rate of 73%. The Amundi commitment score was 80% favourable responses, up 8 points from 2019.\n\n| Commitment survey       | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Participation rate      | 59%    | 76%    | 73%    |\n| Amundi commitment score | 70%    | 72%    | 80%    |\n\n## Employee share ownership\n\nThe development of employee share ownership is an integral part of Amundi's compensation and social benefits policy. As in 2019, a capital increase transaction specifically for employees was carried out in autumn 2020. This transaction allowed eligible employees to subscribe to Amundi shares with a 30%\n\ndiscount on the reference price. More than 1,350 employees, in nine countries, have subscribed to this capital increase. Employee ownership in Amundi's share capital represents 0.7%, compared to 0.5% before the transaction. A director elected by the employees for a three-year term is responsible for representing the employees on the Board of Directors.\n\n## 3.5 ACTING AS A COMMUNITY MINDED, ECO-AWARE/uni00A0CITIZEN\n\nFor Amundi, acting as a community-minded citizen means promoting inclusion, carrying out solidarity initiatives with partners over the long term, adopting responsible purchasing practices and reducing its environmental impact.\n\n## 3.5.1 Inclusion\n\nAmundi formalised its commitment to social inclusion at the end of 2018 by signing the PAQTE agreement. The Pact with the Neighbourhoods for all Companies (Pacte Avec les Quartiers pour Toutes les Entreprises, PAQTE) supports actions already initiated and encourages businesses to work for the residents of priority urban policy districts (Quartiers Prioritaires de la Politique de la Ville, QPV).\n\n## Policy for hosting young people in training\n\nAmundi contributes significantly to the training of young people through internships o/ffered to recently graduated students from diverse areas of study and through work-study, which enables a young person to both finance his or her education and gain his or her first work experience. In 2020, despite the organisational di/fficulties associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, Amundi maintained its policy of welcoming young people for training. As such, nearly 900 young people, mainly in France (71%), joined the company on long-term internships, work/study contracts, international volunteering (VIE) or training through research (CIFRE). Amundi was awarded the HappyTrainees label for the seventh consecutive year in 2020; this recognises companies for the quality of the welcome and assistance they o/ffer young people.\n\n## Disability\n\nIn 2020, Amundi continued its voluntary activities to incorporate people with disabilities based on four pillars: recruitment, retention in employment, use of the sheltered employment sector (1) and raising employee awareness. In 2019, Amundi signed the 'Manifesto for the inclusion of people with disabilities in economic life', thereby committing itself to continue its actions to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\nIn France, a sixth disability agreement was signed for three years at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group level. It sets Amundi's objective over this period to recruit eight people with disabilities across all types of employment contract: permanent, fixed-term, work-study and temporary. In 2020, Amundi recorded nine recruitments of employees with disabilities, one permanent and eight work-study employees, bringing the number of employees with disabilities to 65 as of 31 December. As is the case every year, Amundi has taken actions to raise awareness among its employees and promote the inclusion of people with disabilities. In 2020, Amundi renewed its financial support for the 'Autistes sans fronti\u00e8res' (Autism without borders) association.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

In the field of culture, Amundi continued its support for its long-standing partners, namely Villa M\u00e9dicis, of which it is the main sponsor, the Grand Palais and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de Chaillot, as well as the Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte (started in 2019). In the current climate, some sales departments have allocated their end-of-year gift budget to support associations such as H\u00f4pitaux de Paris-H\u00f4pitaux de France, to support the creation of SMEs (through ADIE microfinance) or to help companies in difficulty (60,000 recoveries). Amundi also helped Lebanon, which was severely affected by the economic crisis and a double explosion, through donating to the Fondation de France for the reconstruction of the Saint Joseph University Hospital in Beirut and its university hospital, the H\u00f4tel-Dieu de France. Lastly, for the tenth consecutive year, Amundi continued to provide financial support for Action Contre la Faim (ACF, Action Against Hunger)\n\nInternationally, support for associations was heavily impacted by the health crisis. Amundi Ireland made a financial donation to the Mater Foundation to support hospital sta/ff, who are on the frontline of the battle against the crisis. In the United States, Amundi also targeted hospitals by encouraging all its employees to make donations to the Boston Medical Center. Amundi USA maintained its commitment to the re-integration of homeless people hard hit by the health crisis, by supporting the Horizons for the Homeless association and also Rosie's Place, which provides a safe haven and decent living conditions for homeless women. In Italy, Amundi actively mobilised against food insecurity among the Italian population by financially supporting the Food Bank. Lastly, Amundi Germany supported the actions of Klinik Clowns, whose mission is to promote healing and to bring joy to the sick through laughter.\n\nAmundi's contributions amounted to a total of \u20ac2.7/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\n## Employee commitment\n\nAmundi's commitment to social responsibility has also led to involving employees in joint projects with charitable organisations.\n\nIn France, for the eighth consecutive year, Amundi ran its sponsorship programme called 'Give A Hand', aimed at promoting employee commitment to the voluntary sector. In addition to the traditional programme, Amundi launched a special Covid-19 edition dedicated to the fight against the pandemic. Some 18 projects were financed in this way, taking the total number of solidarity projects supported for 2020 to 28. Because of the public health situation, Amundi did not organise this year's toy collection with Rejou\u00e9, or the collection of clothing with La Cravate Solidaire; both these associations work on the professional integration of people experiencing di/fficulties. Nevertheless, Amundi rea/ffirmed its support for these associations by doubling its annual financial contribution.\n\nInternationally, a large proportion of employee solidarity initiatives, such as collections, donations and sports events, were organised for the Red Cross.\n\n- /uni25A0 In Japan, several employees and their families took part in a 30-kilometre bicycle race near Mount Fuji. The funds collected were paid to the Japanese Red Cross.\n- /uni25A0 In Austria, employee commitment also focused on the Red Cross by organising a collection of essential products such as clothing and hygiene products intended for the homeless and refugees.\n- /uni25A0 In Germany, employees supported the Red Cross through donations, matched by Amundi. Employees also joined with 37 other companies to organise a campaign to give Christmas presents to disadvantaged children and young people in and around Munich.\n\nLastly, in the UK, employees were encouraged to provide financial support for the British Heart Foundation, a charitable organisation that funds research related to heart and circulatory diseases.",

This policy is part of the Group's Ethical Charter and is based on commitments including the United Nations Global Compact, the Diversity Charter and the Charter on the Mediation of Responsible Supplier Relations. All of the commitments set forth in these texts relate to respect for human rights and compliance with labour regulations, the fight against all forms of discrimination, the promotion of diversity, environmental protection and business ethics.\n\nAs part of the 2022 Medium-Term Plan (MTP), the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Purchasing business line set out its action plan, entitled 'ACTE 2022'. This plan aims to:\n\n- /uni25A0 boost the Group's performance and risk control;\n- /uni25A0 create value for the regions and business lines;\n- /uni25A0 translate the purchasing policy into responsible actions;\n- /uni25A0 maintain responsible behaviour with its suppliers.\n\nIn 2020, Amundi used the three MTP pillars to address these objectives:\n\n- /uni25A0 the societal pillar , with renewal of the Responsible Supplier and Purchasing label, incorporating the CSR /a.altspect into /a.altll procurement c/a.altses, incre/a.altsing the CSR weighting in rating grids to 15%, the Group IT white paper including CSR, monitoring indicators on supplier risks, a new EcoVadis 2020 rating campaign after that of 2017 and an action plan on improving payment deadlines;\n- /uni25A0 the human pillar with the professionalisation of CSR in purchasing. 'Buy Responsibly' training on the fundamentals of CSR purchasing was taken by all Amundi buyers between 2019 and 2020;\n- /uni25A0 the relationship excellence pillar with regard to its suppliers and internal clients: a 360\u00b0 assessment by our specifiers concerning the relationships and services delivered by the purchasing teams and support functions, a quality survey of Group suppliers (including over 64% very small companies and SMEs). The survey confirmed a very good perception of the relationship (90.3% overall, 90.7% for very small companies/SMEs, 90.3% for intermediate-sized enterprises and 88.3% for large companies) and positive points such as:\n- /uni25A0 the feeling that the Group regards its suppliers sympathetically;\n- /uni25A0 e/ffective management of the supplier relationship;\n- /uni25A0 an EcoVadis assessment approach;\n- /uni25A0 contractual commitments respected.\n\nMany actions have been taken to provide the best support to our suppliers during this period of Covid-19 and to limit the financial impact of this health crisis on their financial year. As of 18 March 2020, purchasers of business, IT and real estate services contacted their suppliers to reassure them of Amundi's support during this period and to tell them about the health measures put in place to protect their employees on our sites. Invoices for March 2020 were paid throughout the month, despite the compulsory halting of services in mid-March. All IT service contracts and remotely manageable businesses were maintained. Support for our catering providers on o/ffsetting a portion of their revenue was provided in conjunction with Group Purchasing. Specific attention was given to suppliers in situations of economic dependency (25% of revenue) through the production of quarterly indicators that increase our business's awareness of the financial risk associated with this dependency (reminder of thresholds, meetings with suppliers confronting economic dependency and action plans to limit the impact of this dependency on their companies in the short or medium term).\n\nIn 2021, the Purchasing business line will pursue the MTP objectives. In December, the annual agreement of the Purchasing business line, bringing together all Purchasing entities of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, defined clear objectives for 2021: Listen more to our suppliers and double our inclusive purchasing in 2021. Lastly, despite the health situation and the organisation of remote working teams, invoice processing was a priority objective for the Purchasing and Finance teams from the first lockdown and payment deadlines maintained an 82% rate of invoices settled within the deadline over 2020.\n\n## Use of sheltered sector companies\n\nAmundi continued its policy of using the sheltered employment sector in 2020. Revenue assigned to companies in the adapted sector (EA/ESAT (2) ), amounting to \u20ac0.5 million in 2019, was almost maintained in 2020 (\u20ac0.4 million), with the fall recorded as a result of the impact of Covid-19 on building services. However, in order to limit the impact of Covid-19 on these companies during the first lockdown, distributions of packed lunches were arranged, produced by an ESAT, which allowed the company to remain open over the period and a distribution of sanitising gel in o/ffices was entrusted to an adapted company from October.\n\nUse was also made of the sheltered sector for as yet underdeveloped activities (IT services, contact platforms for disabled freelancers/entrepreneurs) and a partnership with 'Inclusion' began in December 2020 to provide access to profiles from the sheltered sector through the digital platform Malt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Nevertheless, conscious of the importance of applying the principles of social responsibility to its operations, the company undertakes to reduce its environmental impact by managing its buildings and resources responsibly and by controlling its CO 2 emissions. In addition, Amundi regularly conducts actions to raise employee awareness of eco-friendly initiatives.\n\n## Responsible management of buildings and/uni00A0resources\n\n## Building environmental certification\n\nAmundi's registered office in Paris complies with environmental standards. It has a BBC (1) E/ffinergie label and HQE Exploitation (2) and BREEAM (3) certification. In 2019, as part of the complete renewal of our HQE Exploitation certification, Amundi was rated as 'Exceptional' in terms of Management and Sustainable Use, a score maintained in 2020 thanks to the continuation of improvement actions. For its part, Amundi ESR, the subsidiary based in Valence (Dr\u00f4me), is located in a building that meets environmental standards. The Amundi o/ffices in Munich, Boston and Milan are all within LEED (4) certified premises.\n\nThe Amundi site in Paris took part in the 2020 edition of the CUBE competition, a national competition organised by the IFPEB (French Institute for Building Performance), which consists, for voluntary candidates, in reducing energy consumption over a year. The aim of our participation was to formalise our commitment and encourage employees to get involved in e/fforts to reduce energy consumption.\n\n## Audit and energy efficiency\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, Amundi's premises in Paris are subject to regular energy audits. The last audit was carried out in 2019. In terms of energy e/fficiency, Amundi continues to implement the actions in place since 2015, such as reducing the operating times of ATUs (5) , installing LED lighting and using window switches to cut fan units when windows are open, thus reducing operating times. The introduction of an Energy Performance improvement plan with our technical maintenance service provider in 2019 enabled us to achieve a 5% energy saving. In 2020, e/fforts continued on optimising the settings and operating parameters of air conditioning, heating and plumbing equipment.\n\nAt the Valence site, a project to optimise the automatic lighting, heating and air conditioning system is scheduled for 2021-2022. Reducing the switch-on time windows of initiating devices should allow savings of between 1 hour and 1 hour 30 minutes per working day depending on the type of device or network concerned.\n\nA process to improve the energy e/fficiency of sites is also underway in international entities, favouring low-consumption electronic devices and optimising automated lighting, heating and air conditioning systems. In the United Kingdom, a motion detection lighting system is in place to reduce the site's power consumption. Several entities have also put in place an automatic switch-on and switch-o/ff system for computers. In Italy, this involves around 450 workstations.\n\n## Green IT policy\n\nAmundi seeks to control the environmental impact of its information systems in several ways:\n\n- /uni25A0 All IT equipment intended for users (screens, workstations, phones, printers) complies with international energy e/fficiency standards;\n- /uni25A0 All computer equipment purchased is certified or complies with recognised international standards;\n- /uni25A0 Lastly, o/ffice IT equipment (workstations, printers, laptops, small items, etc.) is recycled by the service provider ATF GAIA, a WEEE certified company contracted by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. Equipment components that are not re-used for resale are systematically sent to a certified partner. Amundi also recycles its used magnetic cartridges. There are bins for recycling used toner drums. In the United States, an end-of-life device management programme is also in place. Devices are recycled or put up for sale on the second-hand market.\n\n## Responsible use of paper\n\nAmundi pursues a responsible paper policy both in France and abroad, with the objective of reducing its use of paper, promoting careful use of paper and recycling used paper.\n\n- /uni25A0 With regard to o/ffice equipment: automatically configuring printers to double-sided, black and white, swipe cards for making copies, lower-weight paper, the use of certified paper and, in France, electronic invoicing.\n- /uni25A0 With regard to communication media: printing on certified paper, selecting printers certified by Imprim'Vert and regularly making more documents available in electronic form.\n- /uni25A0 With regard to desktop publishing: Amundi ESR, the account-keeping subsidiary responsible for employee savings schemes, continued its e/fforts to reduce its paper consumption. In 2020, this activity recorded a rise in subscriptions to its e-services from 66% to 69%, which reduced the amount of printed paper used by 2% over the year. In total, the reduction in paper consumption in\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "2020 was nearly 5% compared with 2019, despite Amundi ESR recording an increase of nearly 10% in the number of accounts managed.\n\nSeveral initiatives were implemented in 2020 to reduce paper consumption or increase the use of recycled paper. At the Paris headquarters, till receipts for the Company restaurant are no longer printed systematically. Several entities are continuing their e/fforts to go paperless: creation of electronic signatures in Italy, digitalisation of meeting handouts and reports. For the first year, the United Kingdom ordered virtual greeting cards. Amundi is switching its subscriptions to newspapers and magazines to their digital versions. In the United Kingdom, only 10% of employees subscribe to paper publications. In 2020, several entities, including Germany, reduced the number of on-site printers. In Italy, recycled paper has almost entirely replaced standard paper.\n\nAwareness initiatives are conducted with employees. In Japan, the entity plans to set up a 'Smart Printer Day' to raise employee awareness of responsible printing. In Austria, it is planned to add a banner to raise awareness of responsible printing onto email signatures for 2021.\n\n## Responsible waste management\n\nAmundi has implemented a responsible waste management policy for several years in France and has promoted selective sorting through the voluntary use of recycling bins since 2013. Recyclable waste (1) (paper, plastic cups and bottles, cans, printer supplies, batteries and waste electrical and electronic equipment [WEEE]) is managed by CEDRE, a sheltered workshop employing people with disabilities. In addition to selective sorting, Amundi runs a Cleaning Week scheme each year at its Paris premises with a view to sorting and clearing superfluous paper. Every year, the recycling work entrusted to CEDRE generates 9.84 Beneficiary Units (disabled employment equivalents).\n\nEvery year, Amundi strives to integrate more recyclable materials into its sorting line. In 2018, a cigarette butt recycling initiative was introduced for our buildings in Paris and Valence. Co/ffee capsules are also recycled in the UK, Austria and Ireland. In Japan, waste sorting bins can be used to sort 15 di/fferent types of waste. Biodegradable consumables were introduced into the cafeteria of the Paris site from 2019. Biowaste is collected from the Company restaurant. The grease traps are biologically treated in-house in both buildings, resulting in less discards and fewer truck movements to clean the traps and dispose of the grease at an external station.\n\n| Waste  (in/uni00A0tonnes)   |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Recycled waste (1)          |   11.6 |\n| Non-recycled waste          |   84.5 |\n| Volume of recycled paper    |   92.5 |\n| TOTAL                       |  188.6 |\n\n## Actions taken to reduce food waste\n\nThe partner of the Paris Company restaurant carefully manages its services in order to minimise the amount of food wasted on a daily basis. The year 2020 was an unusual year. Firstly, the main restaurant was closed more than half the time, particularly during lockdown periods. Secondly, the measures taken to combat the pandemic structurally generate more waste (packaging of cutlery, meal packs prepared and distributed for take-away in individual packaging).\n\n## Removing plastic\n\nIn 2020, as part of a responsible consumption approach, several entities set up initiatives to reduce their plastic consumption. In Japan, recyclable bags are made available to employees to reduce the use of disposable bags when shopping for lunch outside. In France, co/ffee machine cups were removed from early 2020. In Italy, plastic stirrers for co/ffee will be replaced in 2021 by 100% recyclable wooden stirrers. In Ireland, stirrers were completely removed in 2020. In the United States, plastic capsules were also replaced in order to offer an entirely plastic-free co/ffee break.\n\nIn handling the health crisis, Amundi has reduced its plastic consumption and its waste production. In Ireland, sanitising gel dispensers are filled from 5-litre containers. Amundi France and Ireland have provided all their employees with fabric masks to reduce the use of disposable masks.\n\n## Educating employees about 'acting green'\n\nIn France and internationally, Amundi runs communication and awareness actions for its employees on environment-friendly behaviour: awareness campaign for responsible printing in several entities (Austria already recorded a significant reduction in the amount of printing), an awareness campaign for sorting in several entities, promotion of environmentally responsible travel methods in the United States and Italy. Amundi provides employees with quantitative and qualitative reporting every quarter on the volumes of waste sorted and recycled. In the United Kingdom, an awareness campaign for employees to adopt environmentally responsible behaviours is planned for 2021. In 2021, Amundi USA will launch an internal survey to understand how employees wish to commit to and support these various causes.\n\nIn terms of preserving biodiversity, Amundi has installed beehives at its premises in Paris and Valencia. Income from the sale of honey to employees goes to the NGO Plan\u00e8te Urgence.\n\n## Control of CO 2 emissions\n\n## Amundi carbon footprint in 2018\n\nEvery three years, Amundi prepares a complete carbon footprint, accounting for its scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, across the entire company. The latest footprint focuses on data for the 2018 reference year. It is calculated according to the GHG protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol). Total emissions recorded in 2018 amounted to 47,000/uni00A0tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq), i.e. 9.3/uni00A0tonnes of CO 2 eq per employee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Other countries also have a portion of green energy in their energy mix. This is the case for Germany. Several solar panels were installed in Italy in 2019, generating 30,000 kWh per year. Amundi's green energy share reached 52% in 2020.\n\n## Travel\n\nThe Amundi travel policy applicable to all its entities worldwide demonstrates its desire to reduce its CO 2 emissions: validation of the need to travel, prior authorisation for travel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nabroad, mandatory rail for journeys of under three hours, ban on taxi journeys within Paris between 8 am and 8 pm, categorisation of rental vehicles according to the number of passengers, weekly reporting of forthcoming travel to Executive Committee members. Since 2019, new functions have been introduced within the reservation system to better justify travel (internal (intra-group) travel or external travel for participation at a conference or client visits) and avoid trips for which a videoconference meeting would be more appropriate. Business travel was significantly reduced in 2020.\n\n## Control of CO 2 emissions\n\nAmundi annually calculates CO 2 emissions in two major categories: energy and business travel.\n\nOwing to travel constraints due to the Covid-19 pandemic, CO 2 emissions related to business travel were down fivefold in 2020. However, figures for CO 2 emissions linked to energy consumption were stable over the period, with buildings remaining open throughout the year.",

Amundi encourages its employees to opt for using public transport by paying for transport expenses. In France, Amundi covers 80% of public transport expenses (e.g. Navigo card or V\u00e9lib' card in Paris). In France, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom, Amundi is putting support in place to encourage its employees to opt for cycling to get to their workplaces: setting up bicycle mileage allowances, assistance with purchasing a bicycle, a self-service bicycle o/ffering and an increase in the number of bicycle parking places.\n\nSeveral electrical charging points have been installed in Amundi car parks. In Germany and in Valence, the project\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis in progress and the terminals are expected to enter into service in 2021-2022. When selecting company cars, Amundi favours the use of fuel-e/fficient and hybrid vehicles. In Italy and Germany, a transformation of the fleet is underway.\n\n## Amundi carbon offsetting\n\nIn 2019, Amundi joined the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. carbon o/ffset scheme/uni00A0 (1) via the Livelihoods fund to o/ffset its CO 2 emissions linked to energy and transport, i.e. 15,000 tonnes of CO 2 per year. This fund finances agroforestry, rural energy and ecosystem restoration projects.\n\n## 3.6 METHODOLOGY AND INDICATORS\n\n## 3.6.1 Methodological note\n\n## HR data\n\nThe HR reporting scope covers the entire Amundi Group as of 31 December 2020. The workforce of the consolidated and non-consolidated Amundi Group entities is taken into account (excluding minority joint ventures) and includes Sabadell AM, a management company acquired by Amundi in 2020, and BOC Wealth Management, the joint venture launched at the end of 2019 with Bank of China, in which Amundi holds a majority stake.\n\nCertain HR indicators are only available for France. This data is identified as such in the table of indicators. The scope for France includes the following entities: Amundi/uni00A0SA, Amundi Asset Management, CPR Asset Management, \u00c9toile Gestion, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Gestion, BFT Investment Managers, Amundi Finances, Amundi Immobilier, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation, Amundi Private Equity Funds, Amundi IT Services, Amundi ESR and Amundi Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique (2) .\n\nPresentation of HR data : unless otherwise indicated, the population covered is that of 'active' employees, presented as full-time equivalent (FTE). The concept of 'active employees' implies a legal bond in the form of a standard permanent or fixed-term employment contract (or similar, for international activities), a presence on the payroll and in the position on the last/uni00A0day of the period, and working hours equal to or greater than 50%.\n\nChanges in the methodology for calculating HR indicators relating to age: we have changed our methodology for 2020 figures. The figures for 2019 and 2018 were adjusted compared to those published in the previous report.\n\n## Environmental data\n\nThe environmental reporting scope covers France and subsidiaries with more than 100 employees, with the exception of Sabadell AM. The 2020 scope includes the following countries: France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, Austria,\n\nGermany, Japan and the United States. The environmental data covers 85.9% of the Amundi Group workforce. If certain data were unavailable for part of the reporting scope, the coverage rate is recalculated and mentioned next to each indicator.\n\n## Methodology for calculating responsible investment assets under management\n\nThe sum of responsible investments managed by Amundi takes into account, for the entire Group scope, the AuM of all open-ended funds, mandates and dedicated funds with a responsible investment objective.\n\nThe typology applied is as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 multi-dimensional ESG integration: funds using ESG ratings in a certified or customised framework;\n- /uni25A0 environmental: funds designed to contribute to the energy transition, invest in green assets or reduce the carbon footprint of a portfolio;\n- /uni25A0 social: funds aiming to finance the social and solidarity economy.\n\nThere is no double counting. If a fund falls under more than one theme, only the dominant theme is counted.\n\n## Methodology for calculating the beneficiaries of social impact management\n\nAmundi has developed a specific analysis method for impact companies, assessing the continuity of the company's economic model and its impact objectives as well as its results. This analysis is based on a sector-wide approach comprising quantitative and qualitative criteria as well as criteria specific to the company. For each company, Amundi measures the number of beneficiaries and then calculates its impact ratio: this is the number of beneficiaries created per \u20ac10,000 invested. Based on Amundi's investment in the company, this ratio allows reporting of the aggregated total number of beneficiaries, per impact theme, generated since the fund was created in 2012./uni00A0The impact analysis is updated annually. Amundi does not calculate the impact of the Danone Communities and Amundi AFD Avenir Durables funds.",

Amundi has chosen to calculate its carbon emissions on scopes 1, 2 and 3, which correspond to the entity's direct and indirect emissions. The\n\ndata was collected over 2018 for all Amundi Group entities with more than 100 employees, i.e. a coverage rate of 89.2%. The data was extrapolated for entities with fewer than 100 employees.\n\n## Methodology and scope for calculating the carbon footprint of portfolios under management\n\nAmundi has retained the provider Trucost for carbon emission data (expressed in/uni00A0tonnes of CO 2 ) from private issuers. This data relates to scopes 1 and 2 and a part of scope 3 corresponding to indirect emissions related to the first-tier suppliers ('Scope 3 upstream first tier'). The data received is then incorporated into the Amundi information system and assigned to an issuer. For companies for which we have not received a value from\n\nTwo indicators are calculated:\n\n## Carbon emissions in/uni00A0million euros invested\n\nThis indicator is used to quantify the carbon emissions resulting from the investment in the portfolio. It is calculated according to the following formula:\n\n(\n\nPortfolio's emissions\n\n)\n\n=\n\ntCO\n\n2\n\n\u20acm invested\n\nRated portfolio assets (\u20acm)\n\nWith:\n\nCompany's emissions in the portfolio i (tCO 2 )= Participation share i (%) \u00d7 Company's emissions i (tCO 2 )\n\nAnd\n\nParticipation share i (%)\n\n=\n\nAmount invested in a company (shares or debt) i (\u20acm)\n\nCompany value (shares+debt) i (\u20acm)\n\n## Carbon emissions in/uni00A0million euros of turnover\n\nThis indicator is used to quantify the carbon intensity of the value chain of issuers in the portfolio. It is equal to the weighted sum of the carbon footprints of the securities of which it is comprised, i.e.:\n\nPortfolio emissions (tCO 2 /\u20acm of revenue) = \u2211 n i Company's relative overall weighting in the portfolio i (%) x\n\nCompany's emissions i (tCO 2 )\n\nRevenue i (\u20acm)\n\n## Methodology for calculating the coal exposure of portfolios under management\n\nBased on data supplied by Trucost, an ESG supplier specialising in environmental data, Amundi identifies the issuers having activity (electricity generation, extraction) linked to thermal coal.\n\nIn the absence of Trucost data, a rate of 0% is allocated to companies not identified as being linked to coal (as a result of the sector in particular) or otherwise the percentage declared by the company (public report, website or direct information).\n\nTwo indicators are calculated, the methodology of which is detailed below:\n\n## Weighted exposure of portfolios in billions of euros\n\nFor each of the issuers identified, its coal exposure ( i.e. the percentage of revenue from coal-related activities) is multiplied by the amount invested in the company in question:\n\n\u2211 n i Company's exposure i (\u20ac) x X% of coal in the sales revenue of the company i\n\n## Proportion of portfolios exposed to thermal coal as %\n\nThe weighted exposure of portfolios is compared to the total amount of Amundi Group investments in order to calculate the share of portfolios exposed to thermal coal:\n\n\u2211 n i Company's exposure i (\u20ac) x X% of coal in the sales revenue of the company i\n\nTotal amount of Amundi Group investments\n\n\u2211 n i Company's emissions in the portfolio i (tCO 2 )\n\nTrucost, these are supplemented by inherited data from the parent company, where applicable.\n\nThe calculation of a portfolio's carbon footprint initially consists of calculating the amount of rateable assets in the portfolio. Non-rated and non-rateable securities (securities issued by States, derivatives, UCITS-type funds, etc.) are excluded. The amount of rated assets is then determined, i.e. the amount of the assets for which we have Trucost data.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main highlight was Amundi's 100% acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management from Banco Sabadell on 30 June 2020.\n\n## 4.2 MARKET CONTEXT IN 2020\n\n## 4.2.1 Macro-economic and financial environment in 2020\n\nIn 2020, the global economy experienced an exceptional shock. The series of Covid-19 infection waves caused significant restrictions on business, which heavily weighed down GDP. However, the rapid and massive support provided by the central banks and state budgets helped to prevent a collapse of household income in developed countries and a systemic financial crisis. At the end of the year, the initiation of vaccination campaigns o/ffered a sign of hope. In the interest rate markets, bond yields fell sharply under the effect of unprecedented monetary easing measures. Equity markets, for their part, recovered strongly after a sharp fall at the end of Q1.\n\n## United States\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis hit the US economy after three years of above-potential growth. In 2020, each quarter's GDP profile was defined by the infection waves and the restrictions on travel and business imposed by the authorities in response. There were net declines in Q1 and, in particular, in Q2 (-5% and -31.4% annualised respectively), followed by a very strong rebound in Q3 (+33.1%). Although the service industry was clearly more a/ffected than the manufacturing sector, the recovery did a/ffect the entire economy and the business climate improved. After very heavy job losses, the unemployment rate started to decrease from a peak of 14.7%\n\nin April to 6.7% in November, which is still much higher than the pre-crisis rate (3.5% in February) with a lower participation rate. Inflation slowed considerably in the middle of the year, then recovered, though still remained far o/ff the targeted rate. To avoid a collapse of the economy during the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced significant easing measures which reinforced the impact of the extraordinary budgetary expansion that had been implemented through three major support plans worth approximately 14% of GDP.\n\n## Euro zone\n\nGDP growth was already decelerating when Covid-19 brought many sectors to a halt at the end of Q1. Economic activity reflected the effects of infection waves and lockdowns, contracting by 3.7% in Q1 and by 11.7% in Q2 before bouncing back by 12.5% in Q3, although this remained well below its level at the end of 2019. In Q4, the economy probably contracted again, albeit less severely than in Q2. The crisis hit the service industry very hard, mainly those businesses that service daily needs, while the manufacturing sector held up better. Inflation fell steadily, entering negative territory in the latter part of the year, despite stronger than usual food price momentum, as service prices were being eroded, and some countries decided to make temporary VAT reductions.

Huge supportive e/fforts were also mobilised at the EU level, particularly the SURE and Next Generation EU programmes. For its part, the ECB responded with highly expansionist measures, including notably a new asset purchase plan, in addition to reinforcing its already existing programmes.\n\n## Emerging countries\n\nNo emerging countries have escaped the pandemic, many having recorded double-digit GDP declines in Q1 and/or Q2, a sharp depreciation in their currencies and unprecedented capital outflows. To combat the virus and to minimise the negative impact of this crisis on the economy, governments have massively increased their spending. The expansion of public deficits, despite the financial support provided by international institutions, placed a significant burden on the most vulnerable countries and increased the risk for external financing. Moreover, rating agencies lowered the sovereign rating of several countries. The central banks were also highly proactive and significantly eased their monetary conditions via reductions in interest rates and/or QE. While the economic situation improved in emerging economies in Q3, particularly in Asia, some countries were having to deal with a second wave of the epidemic. Governments and central banks remain determined to support growth even though their room for manoeuvre has become considerably more restricted.\n\n## Rates\n\nIn many ways, 2020 was an exceptional year. The whole world was heavily affected by the Covid-19 crisis. The lockdown measures adopted to contain the virus severely affected economic activity to an extent not previously experienced during peacetime. Governments and central banks also distinguished themselves by the speed, coordination and scale of the measures taken to address the crisis. The central\n\n## 4.2.2 The asset management market\n\nSource: Amundi and Broadridge Financial Solutions - FundFile & ETFGI/Open-ended funds (excluding dedicated mandates and funds) as of the end of December 2020 (1) .\n\nIn 2020, due to the uncertainties surrounding the health and economic situations, investors mainly retained a significant proportion of liquid funds and placed their assets in money market funds to await future investment. Furthermore, bond products, invested primarily in corporate debt, benefited from the renewed incentive policies of the central banks. Lastly, equity products invested in business sectors (healthcare, information & technology) or countries (China) that had sustained business activity and maintained high growth prospects were the third main factor of net inflows.\n\nResponsible and sustainable investment (ESG) continued to grow strongly with nearly \u20ac1,800/uni00A0billion of assets spread across all asset classes and client segments. The net inflow\n\nbanks implemented asset repurchase programmes on an unprecedented scale. Central bankers will continue to hold rates unchanged while adjusting their asset purchases in order to maintain accommodative financing conditions. In this context, sovereign interest rates recorded sharp falls: German 10-year rates (-34 bps over the year to -0.57%) and US 10-year treasuries (-100 bps, to 0.92%). The ECB's actions helped to narrow peripheral sovereign debt spreads. In fact, the ECB increased the scale of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and extended its duration. Furthermore, the availability of information surrounding vaccine development, the prospect that sovereign rates will remain low for an extended period and the direct support from central banks have been very positive for the credit markets. Credit spreads have narrowed to almost pre-crisis levels.\n\n## Equities\n\nBetween the shock of the pandemic, the extent of the recession and falling financial results, the resilience of the equity markets seemed far from certain last spring when the first wave of Covid-19 hit Europe hard before reaching the United States.\n\nHowever, the rapid and massive reaction of central banks and the increase in budgetary support plans combined with the initial health measures helped to avoid the worst. This allowed markets to begin recovering at the end of March, before reaching high levels in November when the first vaccines were announced.\n\nHowever the extent of this recovery varied from region to region. For example, although the United States (+19.2%) and Emerging Asia (+23.2%) ended the year with a sharp rise, Europe remained in the red (down -4.3%).\n\nThese divergences are linked to two phenomena. First of all, on the economic front, there has been a more marked recession in Europe. Furthermore, the sectoral composition of the MSCI Europe proved very unfavourable; Technology, which was among the top performers this year, was underrepresented and vice versa for Energy and Financials.\n\nmomentum, already very strong in the preceding years, reached a record level of \u20ac331 billion (49% of the world's long-term UCI flows), particularly in the areas linked to the environment and renewable energy, demonstrating investors' growing appetite and the resilience of these products in periods of turbulence.\n\nPassive management attracted nearly \u20ac490 billion of net subscriptions, with the assets of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in particular having reached their highest level since their creation (\u20ac6,600 trillion, up by more than 25% in 2020). Passive management experienced strong demand throughout the world, particularly in the United States (+\u20ac230/uni00A0billion), in Europe (+\u20ac150/uni00A0billion), particularly under the impetus of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which reached almost \u20ac1,000/uni00A0billion in assets, and in Asia (+\u20ac108/uni00A0billion).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

(1) Adjusted data: excluding amortisation of the distribution contracts and, in 2017 and 2018, excluding Pioneer-related restructuring costs.\n\n(2) Restatement of the impact in 2020 of the decline in the average EuroStoxx index\n\n- (2). Restatement of the impact in 2020 of the decline in the average EuroStoxx index and the financial income in the amount of ~-\u20ac50 million after tax.\n\nIn 2020, Amundi posted profitability that was in line with the trajectory of the 2018-2020 plan (1) , which forecast that net income would almost double in comparison to its level at listing. This adjusted income, at \u20ac962 million (2) , appears on the surface to be down compared to 2019 but is stable excluding the impact of the market decline (3) in 2020.\n\nThis high level of result factors in several opposing e/ffects:\n\n- /uni25A0 Net revenue/uni00A0 2 was a/ffected by negative market e/ffects in 2020. However, net management revenues held up well, at \u20ac2,634 million. Management fees were impacted by the market downturn (4% decline in the average level of the EuroStoxx index vs. 2019), by an unfavourable mix e/ffect and by reduced revenues associated with structured products. Performance fees, on the other hand, rose significantly (\u20ac200 million, or +17.1%). The average margin (4) on assets was down slightly, at 17.4 base points of assets (compared with 18.4 base points in 2019), particularly given the mix e/ffects. Finally, the impact of the market decline was particularly noticeable on financial income, which fell from \u20ac44 million to -\u20ac38 million. Total net revenue (\u20ac2,595 million) was down 4.1% compared to 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /uni25A0 The significant fall in operating expenses (-2.6% compared to 2019) confirmed Amundi's ability to adapt its costs , despite scope e/ffects (consolidation of Sabadell AM in the second half of the year and creation of the new JV with BoC in China in Q4). The result is a cost/income ratio of 51.7% 2 , still far below the announced maximum of 53%.\n- /uni25A0 The contribution from equity-accounted entities (mostly Asian joint ventures) rose significantly to \u20ac66 million, compared to \u20ac46 million in 2019, thanks to better results in China (\u20ac16 million) and India (\u20ac39 million).\n\nAfter tax and risk costs, adjusted net earnings/uni00A0 2 amounted to \u20ac962/uni00A0million (-4.7%).\n\nAccounting net income (5) for the 2020 financial year amounted to \u20ac910/uni00A0million, i.e. -5.2% compared to 2019.\n\nAccounting net earnings per share stood at \u20ac4.50, i.e. -5.4% on 2019.",

At/uni00A0the same time, a Deferred Tax Liability of \u20ac27/uni00A0million was recognised. Thus the net amount is \u20ac81/uni00A0million which is amortised using the straight-line method over 10 years from 1/uni00A0July 2020.\n- /uni25A0 In the Group's income statement, the net tax impact of this amortisation is \u20ac8 million over a full year (or \u20ac11 million before tax), posted under 'Other revenues', and is added to existing amortisations of distribution contracts:\n- /uni25A0 with Bawag in the amount of \u20ac2 million after tax over a full year (\u20ac3 million before tax);\n- /uni25A0 with UniCredit in the amount of \u20ac38 million after tax over a full year (\u20ac55 million before tax).\n\nNote: amortisation of the SG contract (per year: \u20ac10 million after tax, \u20ac14 million before tax) ended on 1 November 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10.4",

        "page_content": "## 4.4.1.1 Changes to the balance sheet in/uni00A02020\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the balance sheet total amounted to \u20ac28.9/uni00A0billion, compared with \u20ac24.3/uni00A0billion as of 31 December/uni00A02019.\n\nThis increase is mainly due to an increase in assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss related to EMTN issues to Retail clients for \u20ac1.7 billion over the year, an increase in refinancing credit lines with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA for \u20ac2.2 billion, and reinvesting income for the 2019 financial year that, in accordance with the ECB's recommendations, was not distributed.\n\nDerivatives with assets represented \u20ac3,090 million as of 31 December 2020 (compared to \u20ac3,096 million as of 31 December 2019).\n\nThis amount mainly represents the following items:\n\n- /uni25A0 the positive fair value of performance swaps recorded on the Amundi Finance balance sheet. This subsidiary acts as the counterparty for structured funds and by hedging a symmetrical transaction with a market counterparty; as a result, the performance swap outstanding assets recorded as assets appear in equal amounts as liabilities on the Group balance sheet. Netted out, these transactions create no market risk;\n- /uni25A0 the positive fair value of interest rate and performance swaps entered into as part of structured EMTN issues.\n\nDerivatives with liabilities represented \u20ac2,619 million as of 31 December 2020 (compared to \u20ac2,664 million as of 31 December 2019).\n\nThese amounts mainly reflect the negative fair value of derivatives contracted as part of the structured funds or EMTN business and relate to the corresponding asset item, as described above.\n\nThe financial assets at fair value through profit or loss showed balances of \u20ac13,432 million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac10,704/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019, up by 25.5%. They mostly comprised:\n\n- /uni25A0 assets backing EMTN issues (measured symmetrically at optional fair value through profit and loss), in the amount of \u20ac9,673/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac8,004 million as of 31 December 2019, an increase of 20.9% related to the growth of the business. These hedging assets are: bonds issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and fund units held by Amundi Finance \u00c9missions, and term deposits placed by LCL \u00c9missions at LCL;\n- /uni25A0 investments in seed money (\u20ac301 million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac322 million as of 31 December 2019), down by -6.5%;\n- /uni25A0 voluntary investments (excluding Emir sovereign securities) of \u20ac3,351 million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac2,279 million as of 31 December 2019, an increase of +47.0%. This trend reflects the strengthening of liquidity reserves during the year in response to the high level of market volatility;\n- /uni25A0 non-consolidated equity interests, excluding those measured at fair value through non-recyclable equity through profit and loss, for \u20ac107/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac99 million as of 31 December 2019, an increase of \u20ac8.1 million.\n\nFinancial liabilities optionally designated at fair value through profit and loss in the amount of \u20ac10,086/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac8,418/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019, an increase of 19.8%, represented the fair value of the structured EMTNs issued by the Group as part of broadening its range of solutions for Retail clients.\n\nFinancial assets designated at fair value through equity showed assets of \u20ac607/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac610/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019, stable across the years. This item presents non-consolidated equity interests optionally recognised at fair value through non-recyclable equity through profit and loss in the amount of \u20ac141/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020, compared with \u20ac194 million as of 31 December 2019 down by 27.5%, as well as government securities (\u20ac467/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac416/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019, an increase of 12.3%), held under the EMIR regulation to underwrite derivatives.\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost were made up of loans and receivables from credit institutions and amounted to \u20ac2,429/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared with \u20ac1,185/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019, a significant increase associated particularly with the strengthening of short-term liquid assets. As of 31 December 2020, they broke down into \u20ac2,316/uni00A0million of short-term deposits and cash and \u20ac114/uni00A0million of medium to long-term loans.\n\nLiabilities at amortised cost are made up of debts owed to credit institutions and total \u20ac2,968 million as of 31 December 2020, compared with \u20ac817/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019. As of 31 December 2020, amounts due to credit institutions were made up of short-term loans totalling \u20ac1,130/uni00A0million and medium to long-term loans totalling \u20ac1,838/uni00A0million with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group SA. This increase resulted from the creation of significant liquidity reserves in the context of the health crisis and in a highly uncertain market environment.\n\nSubordinated debt, which totalled \u20ac304/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020, comprised subordinated debt subscribed with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. as part of financing the acquisition of the Pioneer Group subsidiaries. This subordinated debt matures in 2027.\n\nAccruals, prepayments and sundry assets amounted to \u20ac1,921/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac1,807 million as of 31 December 2019, up by 6.3%. This item records the collateral paid for the intermediation activity of Amundi swaps for \u20ac251/uni00A0million (compared to \u20ac293/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019) and other accruals, prepayments and sundry assets for \u20ac1,670/uni00A0million (compared with \u20ac1,514/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019), particularly management fees outstanding.\n\nAccruals, deferred income and sundry liabilities amounted to \u20ac2,762/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020 compared to \u20ac2,766/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019. This item records the collateral received for the intermediation activity for \u20ac651 million (compared with \u20ac809 million as of 31 December 2019) and other accruals, deferred income and sundry liabilities for \u20ac2,111/uni00A0million (compared with \u20ac1,957/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2019), particularly the refunds to be paid to the distributors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This increase is mainly due to the value allocated to the distribution agreement in the Banco Sabadell network during the acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management and the amortisation of the value of distribution agreements in the UniCredit, Bawag and Banco Sabadell networks from 1 July 2020.\n\nGoodwill totalled \u20ac5,996 million as of 31 December 2020, compared to \u20ac5,712 million as of 31 December 2019. This change was due firstly to the goodwill recognised in the context of the takeover of Sabadell Asset Management and secondly to exchange rate fluctuations over the period on goodwill denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nGoodwill includes the following principal items:\n\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac378/uni00A0million of goodwill recognised upon the transfer by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez of its asset management business in/uni00A0December 2003;\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac1,733/uni00A0million of goodwill assigned in 2004 to asset management upon the acquisition of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.;\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac708/uni00A0million of goodwill from the contribution of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's asset management business to Amundi/uni00A0S.A. in/uni00A0December 2009;\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac2,537/uni00A0million of goodwill relating to the acquisition of Pioneer Group subsidiaries on 3/uni00A0July 2017;\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac335 million of goodwill relating to the acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management on 30 June 2020.\n\nProvisions amounted to \u20ac165/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020, compared with \u20ac159 million as of 31 December 2019.\n\nThe Group's shareholders' equity including earnings for the period ended 31 December 2020, were \u20ac9,695/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac8,900 million as of 31 December 2019, up 8.9%. This positive net change of +\u20ac795 million is mainly due to the net e/ffect of the following items, taking into account the absence of dividend distribution by Amundi for 2019:\n\n- /uni25A0 net income for the financial year of +\u20ac910/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 change in 'gains and losses recognised directly in equity' at -\u20ac150/uni00A0million.\n\nNon-controlling interests came to \u20ac54 million as of 31 December 2020 and mainly corresponded to the share held by BOC Wealth Management in the equity of Amundi BOC Wealth Management.\n\n## 4.4.1.2 Investment portfolio\n\nIn summary, the breakdown of the investment portfolio between seed money and voluntary investments by asset class over the last two financial years is as follows:\n\n## Asset classes\n\n| 31/12/2020 (in \u20ac/uni00A0millions)   |   Money market  instruments | Bonds*   |   Equity and  multi-asset |   Others | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Seed money                          |                           1 | 55       |                       130 |      115 | 301     |\n| Voluntary and other investments     |                         928 | 2,772    |                        56 |       62 | 3,818   |\n| TOTAL                               |                         929 | 2,826    |                       186 |      177 | 4,119   |\n\n- * Including \u20ac467 million of (mainly Emir) sovereign securities in voluntary investments\n\n## Asset classes\n\n| 31/12/2019 (in \u20ac/uni00A0millions)   |   Money market  instruments | Bonds*   |   Equity and  multi-asset |   Others | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Seed money                          |                           2 | 83       |                       146 |       91 | 322     |\n| Voluntary and other investments     |                         196 | 2,455    |                        56 |       64 | 2,771   |\n| TOTAL                               |                         198 | 2,538    |                       202 |      155 | 3,093   |\n\n- * Including \u20ac413 million of Emir sovereign securities in voluntary investments",

Tangible equity (1) amounted to \u20ac3.2/uni00A0billion, an increase of \u20ac0.5/uni00A0billion compared to the end of 2019. This change mainly reflects the capital generated by the net income for the 2020 financial year (\u20ac910 million), which more than o/ffset the impact of goodwill from the acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management in July 2020.\n\nThe Core Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stands at 20.0% (compared to 15.9% (2) as of the end of 2019), which is much higher than the regulatory requirements. From 1 January 2020, Amundi is no longer subject to any additional regulatory requirements under the SREP process (3) . Amundi will continue to manage its balance sheet in a way which maintains a CET1 ratio which exceeds its regulatory requirements.\n\nAs a reminder, in May 2020, rating agency Fitch reiterated Amundi's A+ rating with a stable outlook, the best in the sector.\n\nThe only commitment received was the financing guarantee received under the syndicated multi-currency revolving loan agreement for \u20ac1,750/uni00A0million signed on 23/uni00A0October 2015 with an international syndicate of lenders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The aim of the LCR is to strengthen the shortterm resilience of banks' liquidity risk profiles by ensuring they have enough unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be easily and immediately converted into cash on private markets in the event of a hypothetical 30-calendar day liquidity squeeze. Credit institutions have been subject to limits on this ratio since 1/uni00A0October 2015, with a minimum ratio of 100% as from 2018.\n\nIn addition, it is noted that on 23/uni00A0October 2015, the Amundi Group signed a syndicated multi-currency revolving credit agreement of \u20ac1,750/uni00A0million with an international syndicate of lenders, with an initial maturity of five years from the date of the agreement (renewed in/uni00A0October 2017 and with maturity on 23/uni00A0October/uni00A02022). The purpose of this agreement is to increase the Group's liquidity profile in all currencies it covers and to secure access to that liquidity particularly if needed to deal with outflows in some funds. It includes two covenants, for which the requirements were met as of 31 December 2020:\n\n- /uni25A0 a minimum level of tangible equity. As of 31 December 2020, this amounted to \u20ac3.2 billion;\n\n## 4.5. OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## 4.5.1 Transactions with related parties\n\nThe main transactions entered into with related parties are described in note/uni00A09.2.3 'Related parties' to the condensed consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2020.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-37-4, 2 of the French Commercial Code, the Corporate Governance report (which will be included in Chapter/uni00A02 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document) shows that there were no agreements covered by the provisions of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-38 signed in 2020 and submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting for approval.\n\n## 4.5.2 Main risks and internal control\n\n## 4.5.2.1 Main risks\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 225-100-1, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the French Commercial Code, a description of the main risks and uncertainties facing the Company is presented in Chapter 5 of this 2020 Universal Registration Document (URD).\n\nFurthermore, information on financial risks arising from climate change and a presentation of measures the Company is taking (CSR issues, Corporate Social Responsibility) to mitigate these by applying a low-carbon strategy are presented in Chapter 3 of this 2020 Universal Registration Document (URD).\n\n- /uni25A0 a level of financial leverage (gearing), being the ratio of net debt to tangible equity. This gearing ratio was 0.4% as of 31 December 2020.\n\n## Note: definitions of debt:\n\nIt is specified that the net debt used to calculate the gearing is contractually defined as the sum of financial debt less shortterm assets (cash, deposits with central banks and money market assets in the voluntary investment portfolio).\n\nCompared to the net financial debt from an economic perspective presented in the table above, the net debt used to calculate the gearing thus excludes voluntary investments in bonds (line c) and net margin calls (line e) and was \u20ac13 million as of the end of December 2020.\n\nThe NSFR ( Net Stable Funding Ratio ) is a stock ratio (whereas the LCR is a cash flow ratio) that compares assets that have an actual or potential maturity greater than one year with liabilities that have an actual or potential maturity greater than one year. The definition of the NSFR allocates a weighting to each element of the balance sheet (and to certain o/ff-balance sheet items) that reflects their potential to have a maturity greater than one year.\n\nThe Amundi Group is subject to European regulations on this matter (Regulation 575/2013 as amended by Regulation 2019/876 of 20 May 2019). As such, Amundi must maintain an NSFR ratio of at least 100% from 28 June 2021. The Group believes that it is already in a position to comply with this requirement.\n\nThe statutory Auditors' Special Report dated 09 April 2021, as incorporated in the 2020 Universal Registration Document in Chapter/uni00A08, 'Special report by the statutory auditors on regulated agreements and regulated commitments' , informs you that there are no agreements falling under Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-38 of the French Commercial Code and describes the essential features and procedures of the agreements and commitments previously approved in previous financial years and which continued to be performed during the 2020 financial year.\n\nAs its primary function is asset management, essentially managing assets on behalf of third parties, Amundi is not directly exposed to the risks associated with climate change.\n\n## 4.5.2.2  Internal control\n\nThe main features of the internal control and risk management procedures put in place by the Company relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information are presented in Chapter/uni00A05 of this 2020 Universal Registration Document (URD).",

Alongside this, the partnership for the distribution of Amundi products through the Banco Sabadell network in Spain has started successfully.\n\nHaving begun in February 2020, the integration of Sabadell AM and the commercial partnership are well underway, with the promotion of the first products managed by Amundi in the Banco Sabadell network and the integration of Amundi funds into the product ranges of Banco Sabadell (private banking and retail banking). The migration of Sabadell AM's IT systems to the Amundi platform (inc. ALTO (2) ) took place in Q4 2020. Targeted synergies (\u20ac20 million before tax in 2022) are confirmed, and integration is according to plan: Sabadell AM has thus received net inflows of \u20ac300 million since the acquisition. The potential for value creation is significant: accretion of Amundi's adjusted net earnings per share of +5%\n\nfor the whole year, taking all synergies into account, and a return on investment of more than 10% over the three years.\n\nThis acquisition and the partnership with Banco Sabadell (Spain's second largest bank (3) , with 1,900 branches and 7 million customers) enable Amundi to significantly strengthen its position in Spain (in the top five players, with assets doubled in the fourth largest market in the eurozone), to consolidate its European leadership, and to again deploy its unique business model aimed at serving Retail networks.\n\n## New JV created with Bank of China Wealth Management\n\nWith the creation in Q4 2020 of the new subsidiary in partnership with BoC Wealth Management, Amundi is now in a unique position in China, allowing it to cover the main segments of the Chinese asset management market through its partnerships with two major banks: ABC (third-largest Chinese bank with over 400 million Retail clients and 23,000 branches) and BoC (fourth-largest Chinese bank with 300 million Retail clients and 11,000 branches) (4) . Growth in the Chinese asset management market is expected to reach more than 10% per annum between 2019 and 2025.\n\nThe new subsidiary, in which Amundi holds 55%, will be the first majority foreign-capital company in China to o/ffer Wealth Management products. The implementation of this project was completed quickly, and in accordance with the timetable announced: the regulator's authorisation was obtained in September 2020, the teams and infrastructure were put in place shortly thereafter, and the operational start-up took place in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the launch of the first products intended primarily for the BOC network.\n\nThe subsidiary, which is expected to achieve financial break-even from the end of 2021, aims to achieve \u20ac60 billion in assets under management and more than \u20ac50 million in net income (at 100%) by 2025.\n\nFor Asia as a whole, the Amundi Group aims to achieve target assets under management of \u20ac500 billion by 2025.\n\n## Creation in February 2021 of Amundi Technology, a/uni00A0new technology services business line\n\nSince its creation in 2010, Amundi has benefited from its own high-grade IT platform, with which it has/uni00A0ensured the quality of management and services for clients, successfully integrated acquisitions (specifically Pioneer), and had a major competitive advantage in terms of cost.\n\nSince 2016, these cutting-edge technology services (specifically ALTO Investments) have been marketed to external clients, reaching 24 user clients in France and Europe by the end of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This will include dedicated IT and sales teams, with a total of more than 700 people working in Paris and Dublin. The potential market (technology services for asset managers, wealth managers and distributors in Europe and Asia) is large (>\u20ac1.5 billion), and has strong potential (growth estimated at nearly 10% per year).\n\nThe target revenue is \u20ac150 million by 2025, compared to \u20ac25/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\n## 4.6.1.2 Evolution of governance\n\nDuring its meeting on 9 February 2021, the Board of Directors approved the following changes which will be e/ffective after the AGM to take place on 10 May 2021:\n\n## Val\u00e9rie Baudson will succeed Yves Perrier as/uni00A0Amundi's CEO\n\nVal\u00e9rie Baudson joined the company 14 years ago. She has been a member of the Executive Committee since 2013 and of the General Management Committee since 2016. She heads the following businesses: CPR AM, the ETF, indices & smart beta, and the Distribution and Wealth division.\n\nShe has been a key player in Amundi's success, thanks to the development of the index/ETF business and of CPR AM, as well as her active contribution to the general management.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Baudson will become a member of the Executive Committee and Deputy General Manager of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\n## Yves Perrier will become Chair of the Board of/uni00A0Directors\n\nYves Perrier, who has led the company for the past 14 years, was the architect behind the creation of Amundi in 2010 and steered its development. Today, Amundi is the European asset management leader and one of the top players globally.\n\nUnder the leadership of Yves Perrier, the company saw substantial development achieved through organic growth, supplemented by successful external growth operations, in particular the acquisition of Pioneer in 2017. Assets under management have been multiplied by 2.5 since 2010 and earnings have virtually doubled since its Initial Public O/ffering in 2015. The company's stock market capitalization has also virtually doubled since the IPO.\n\nGoing beyond its economic performance, Amundi has confirmed its position as a leader in ESG, particularly by\n\napplying extra-financial criteria across all its management operations.\n\nThis governance evolution ensures continuity of Amundi development, in line with the strategy implemented successfully since its creation.\n\n## 4.6.1.3 Entry into exclusive negotiations for the acquisition of Lyxor by Amundi\n\nAmundi announced on 7 April 2021 the opening of exclusive talks with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for the acquisition of Lyxor (1) for a purchase price of \u20ac825 million all-cash (which means \u20ac755 million excluding excess capital) (2) .\n\nFounded in 1998 and a pioneer in ETFs in Europe, Lyxor manages \u20ac124 Bn in assets (3) Lyxor is a major player in the ETF business (\u20ac77 Bn (4) , 3 rd player in Europe with a market share of 7.4% (5) ) and has developed well-recognized expertises in active management (\u20ac47 Bn), notably with its top-level management platform (6) .\n\nThis transaction makes Amundi the leading European asset manager in ETFs, with \u20ac142 Bn in combined AuM, a market share of 14% in Europe (7) , and a diversified profile, in terms of client base as well as in terms of geography.\n\nAmundi would have powerful leverage to accelerate its growth path in the fast-growing ETF market, while complementing its active management o/ffering, particularly in liquid alternative assets and in advisory solutions.\n\nGiven the high potential of synergies, this transaction - in line with Amundi's financial discipline - would be strongly valuecreating with :\n\n- /uni25A0 An enterprise value representing a P/E 2021e of 10x (8) (with cost synergies alone).\n- /uni25A0 An EPS accretion of around 7% (with cost synergies alone) (9) .\n- /uni25A0 A Return on Investment of more than 10% within 3 years (with cost synergies alone).\n\nThis acquisition is fully in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group's strategy, which intends to reinforce the group's positioning in the savings industry.\n\nThe transaction will be finalized by February 2022 at the latest, after consultation with employee representative bodies, and subject to obtaining the necessary authorizations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As far as Amundi is concerned, the main financial impact comes from the sensitivity of the managed assets to this fall in the financial markets (equity, rates, etc.), with the resultant e/ffect on their valuation and on net asset management revenues; the fall in the financial markets in 2020 also had a negative impact on the financial results.\n\nAmundi's results in 2020 demonstrate its resilience, with net inflows holding up and income remaining at a high level. The financial impact of the crisis was reduced by the diversification of the Group's assets by segment/asset class/geography, by the low cost/ income ratio and by the downward adjustment of costs.\n\nThe scale and duration of this crisis remains di/fficult to predict.\n\n## Key sensitivities\n\n| Changes in the equity  markets   | -/+ 10%     | -/+ \u20ac25/\u20ac30bn in Assets under  Management (AUM)   | -/+ \u20ac80-85m in net revenues (run rate, excl. performance fees)   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes in interest  rates       | -/+ 100 pts | +/- \u20ac30-35bn in Assets under  Management (AUM)    | +/- \u20ac35-40m in net revenues (run rate, excl. performance fees)   |\n\nThese sensitivities do not include an indirect e/ffect on net inflows from market fluctuations.\n\nSee also Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 4.7 SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE\n\n|                                    | 31 December 2018         | 31 December 2018   | 31 December 2019         | 31 December 2019    | 31 December 2020         | 31 December 2020   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                    | Number  of/uni00A0shares | % of  capital      | Number  of/uni00A0shares | % of share  capital | Number  of/uni00A0shares | % of  capital      |\n| Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group              | 141,057,399              | 69.9%              | 141,057,399              | 69.8%               | 141,057,399              | 69.7%              |\n| Employees                          | 602,329                  | 0.3%               | 969,010                  | 0.5%                | 1,234,601                | 0.6%               |\n| Treasury shares                    | 814,081                  | 0.4%               | 1,333,964                | 0.7%                | 685,055                  | 0.3%               |\n| Free /float                        | 59,230,545               | 29.4%              | 58,802,932               | 29.1%               | 59,608,898               | 29.4%              |\n| NUMBER OF SHARES AT END  OF PERIOD | 201,704,354              | 100.0%             | 202,163,305              | 100.0%              | 202,585,953              | 100.0%             |\n\nOf note since the end of 2019:\n\n- /uni25A0 A slight fall in % of holding in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group (linked to the capital increase reserved for employees in November 2020), from 69.8% of capital to 69.7%.

Consequently, risk culture is essential to all of the Company's business units. Amundi constantly ensures that its organisation and its processes enable it to identify risks correctly and contain them at each stage of its products' lives. This approach is characterised by the sharing of experiences and best practices in terms of understanding and managing risk, facilitated by:\n\n- /uni25A0 operating across business units;\n- /uni25A0 the systematic representation of control functions (Risk and Compliance) within the various committees: products, investments, customer service, etc.;\n- /uni25A0 combining the applications and risk measurement methods onto a single IT platform, creating a set of guidelines shared by all teams;\n\n## 5.2 RISK FACTORS\n\nIn accordance with regulation (EU) 2017/1129, this section sets out the main risk factors to which Amundi is exposed.

Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAmundi's primary business is asset management and, consequently, it is governed by the various regulatory frameworks associated with this activity. Amundi is also classi/fied as a credit institution and is therefore  also  subject  to  monitoring  by  the  banking  supervisory authorities. As a consequence, Amundi is exposed to:\n\n- /uni25A0 developments and increases in regulatory requirements;\n- /uni25A0 regulatory reforms that could have an impact on Amundi's clients (banks, insurance companies or pension funds), encouraging them to review their investment strategies;\n- /uni25A0 non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or any change in the interpretation or implementation of these.\n\n## IV.  Risk of business interruption\n\n- /uni25A0 Unavailability of information systems (loss of hardware, viral attack, crashing of a database, etc.).\n- /uni25A0 Unavailability of the working environment (inaccessibility of the site, failure of technical equipment).\n- /uni25A0 Unavailability of personnel (public transport strike, epidemic, /flood, etc.).\n\n## I. Promises made to clients\n\nThe risk associated with managing assets for a third party arises from a failure to align management practices with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients.\n\nThe vast majority of risks related to investments made on behalf of third parties are borne by the clients. As such, the main risk is the liquidity risk in relation to the liabilities of open-ended funds.\n\nFailure to comply with the investment rules could result in:\n\n- /uni25A0 the implementation of support measures in the event of a lack of liquidity on certain asset classes to enable clients to withdraw their investment;\n- /uni25A0 Complying  with  these  requirements  is  costly  and  may  impact Amundi's growth.\n- /uni25A0 Regulatory reforms could have a /financial impact on Amundi's clients and encourage them to review their investment strategies to  the  detriment  of  Amundi  and/or  reduce  client  interest  in Amundi products, leading to an adverse impact on assets under management and its earnings.\n- /uni25A0 Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in sanctions, bans  on  certain  business  activities,  a  loss  of  clients  or  other penalties that could have an adverse effect on Amundi's reputation and its earnings, as applicable.\n- /uni25A0 Non-availability of IT systems (cyber-attack or other) preventing the completion of market transactions\n- /uni25A0 Potential losses from breaches\n- /uni25A0 having to compensate clients in the event of adverse market developments as a result of non-compliance with investment constraints;\n- /uni25A0 a penalty imposed by the regulator.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the risks relating to non-compliance with investment rules and from failure to align management practices with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients accounted for 34% of RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) in respect of operational risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

Risk of process failure, human error\n\nAmundi's communication and information systems, as well as those of its clients, service providers and counterparties, may be subject to operational failure. It is also impossible to totally exclude the risk of someone making an unintentional error while they are performing a task. The consequences of operational failure or human error vary depending on the type of incident, it could be a matter of compensating a client, penalties imposed by the regulator, damage to Amundi's reputation, etc.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the risks relating to failure of an operational process or human error accounted for 43% of RWA in respect of operational risk.\n\n## III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAsset management is Amundi's core business. Amundi is an international group operating in numerous countries, primarily in Europe (as of 31 December 2020, France accounted for \u20ac932 billion in assets under management, compared with \u20ac180/uni00A0billion in Italy and \u20ac225 billion in the rest of Europe), with \u20ac298 billion in Asia and \u20ac95 billion in the rest of the world. Consequently, Amundi is subject to a variety of regulatory and supervisory regimes in each of the countries in which it operates. In addition, certain Amundi entities, as authorised credit institutions or investment companies, are subject to regulation by the banking supervisory authorities. Moreover, as a significant subsidiary of a banking group, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Amundi is subject to additional bank regulatory requirements.\n\nThese regulations subject Amundi's business activities to a pervasive array of detailed operational requirements. Complying with these requirements is costly and may impact Amundi's growth.\n\nOther specific regulatory reforms could also a/ffect some of Amundi's clients, such as banking, insurance and pension fund clients, which could cause them to review their investment strategies or allocations to the detriment of Amundi and/or reduce the interest these clients have in Amundi's products. These regulatory reforms could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on Amundi's AuM, earnings and financial position.\n\nNon-compliance by Amundi with applicable laws or regulations, or any changes in the interpretation or application of these, could result in the imposition of sanctions, temporary or permanent bans on conducting certain business activities, a loss of clients or other penalties that could have a material adverse effect on Amundi's reputation or business and, consequently, a material adverse e/ffect on its earnings.\n\nAs an international Group operating in multiple jurisdictions, Amundi has structured its commercial and financial activities to comply with the tax regulations that apply to it. Since it is not always possible to draw clear-cut and definitive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninterpretations of the tax legislation of the various countries in which the Amundi entities are located or operate, the Group cannot guarantee that its tax a/ffairs will not be subject to challenge by the relevant tax authorities. In general, any breach of the tax legislation of a particular country could result in tax adjustments and, if applicable, penalties, fines and interest on arrears.\n\nIn addition, the tax legislation of the various countries in which the Amundi entities are located or operate is subject to change (particularly in the event of changes in the position of the tax authorities and/or the interpretation of the law by a court).\n\nThese various risk factors may result in an increase in Amundi's tax burden and have a material adverse e/ffect on its business, its financial position and its earnings.\n\n## IV. Risk of business interruption\n\nAmundi's infrastructure is crucial to its competitiveness. This infrastructure includes its technological capacity, data centres and work spaces. A significant proportion of Amundi's critical activities are concentrated in a limited number of geographical areas, primarily Paris, but also London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Boston (United States). External events, whether deliberate, accidental or natural, could impact Amundi's ability to operate. Such events could include:\n\n- /uni25A0 unavailability of the local work environment due to site inaccessibility (one building or a group of buildings) or the failure of technical equipment (blackout, dead telecommunications devices, etc.);\n- /uni25A0 unavailability of personnel due to a public transport strike, epidemic, flood, etc.;\n- /uni25A0 physical unavailability of the information systems caused by the physical destruction of data centre hardware or devices giving network access to the Data Centre;\n- /uni25A0 unavailability of data centre software caused by malicious act, error or accident (virus attack, hacking, accidental destruction of a database or a database-altering computer bug);\n- /uni25A0 widespread unavailability of workstations caused, for example, by a massive virus infecting the workstations.\n\nDespite Amundi's efforts to ensure business continuity in the event of such an incident, there could be an adverse impact on its ability to operate, which could lead to a drop in the volume of assets under management or a reduction in its earnings. Such an incident could also impact Amundi's ability to comply with its regulatory obligations, which could a/ffect its reputation, or result in regulatory sanctions or fines. In addition, a breakdown or failure of Amundi's information systems could a/ffect its ability to determine the net asset value of the funds it manages, making it vulnerable to complaints from its clients and harming its reputation.",

Business risk\n\nThe vast majority of Amundi's revenue consists of management fees calculated according to the assets under management. Its earnings are therefore sensitive to factors that impact the performance of its assets:\n\n- /uni25A0 The value of financial instruments could decrease (direct impact on the value of assets under management and indirect impact on deposit-taking).\n\nThe volume of assets under management largely depends on the value of the assets held in the funds and portfolios managed by Amundi, in particular bonds, equities, money market products, currencies and real assets.\n\nFluctuations in the financial markets, particularly movements in interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and the value of equities may lead to significant variations in the value of the assets managed by Amundi. Adverse movements in the financial markets may also reduce the amount of new investment and result in investors withdrawing assets from the funds and portfolios Amundi manages, further impacting the volume of assets under management and therefore Amundi's revenue.\n\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 epidemic had an impact on Amundi's business and its financial situation, particularly during the first half of the year. This pandemic had and could continue to have an adverse effect on Amundi's business and financial situation. It is an intense crisis, the scale and duration of which are di/fficult to predict, although the peak of the crisis seems to have passed in the principal countries in which Amundi operates. After a major shock in March, the equity markets bounced back during the course of 2020 as a result of the measures taken by the central banks at the end of March. However, for the whole of 2020, the average performance of the equity markets was below that of 2019 (-7% for the CAC 40 and -4% for the EuroStoxx index). The exceptional circumstances generated by the pandemic initially led to increased risk aversion on the part of savers and investors, followed by a gradual improvement.\n\nNevertheless, this crisis could continue to have an impact on Amundi's revenue and business. Given ongoing uncertainties, not only regarding the duration and scale of the pandemic, but also regarding the pace of the recovery, the effectiveness of vaccine measures and changes to lockdown measures, it is difficult to predict the overall impact the pandemic will have on the economies of the countries in which Amundi operates and on the global economy.\n\nSensitivity to changes in the interest rate and equity markets (excluding the indirect e/ffect of market fluctuations on net inflows) are noted in the following table.\n\n| Changes in the equity  markets   | -/+10%     | -/+\u20ac25/\u20ac30bn in Assets under Management (AuM)   | -/+\u20ac80-85m in net revenues (run-rate, excluding performance fees)   |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes in interest  rates       | -/+100 pts | -/+\u20ac30-35bn in Assets under Management (AuM)    | -/+\u20ac35-40m in net revenues (run-rate, excluding performance fees)   |\n\n## /uni25A0 Demand from Amundi's clients depends on factors that are beyond its control and have an overall impact on the asset management market.\n\nExternal factors such as the macroeconomic, health or tax environment could affect investors' willingness to save and/or invest in financial products and, consequently, reduce investors' interest in financial products as a whole or in Amundi products. These changes, the extent and implications of which are very unpredictable, could have a material adverse impact on Amundi's assets under management and its revenue.\n\n- /uni25A0 In France, Amundi is largely dependent on the distribution networks of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale groups.\n\nAmundi focuses on two client segments: individual and institutional investors. The individual investor segment includes the distribution of savings solutions for clients of partner networks in France and abroad and third party distributors.\n\nIn France, Amundi is supported by the networks of banks affiliated to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale groups, with which it has distribution agreements guaranteeing it quasi-exclusivity in the distribution of a significant portion of its products. As of 31 December 2020, the products distributed in France under these distribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

If one of these contracts were to terminate and not be renewed, Amundi's assets under management could be significantly reduced, as could its fees, adversely impacting its earnings.\n\nOn the international front, Amundi has a 10-year distribution agreement, in place since 2017, with the UniCredit network in Italy, Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe. In addition, Amundi remains the preferred supplier for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale networks in Italy (CA Italie), the Czech Republic (Komer\u010dni Banka) and Poland (CA Polska). Amundi is also in partnership with BAWAG P.S.K. in Austria and Resona in Japan. As of 31 December 2020, the products distributed through international partner distribution networks amounted to \u20ac146 billion in assets under management. In 2020, Amundi also embarked upon a new long-term distribution agreement in Spain with Banco Sabadell and acquired Sabadell AM.\n\nThis distribution capacity is supplemented by third-party distributors, private banks and asset management advisors. As of 31 December 2020, the products distributed through these third-party distributors amounted to \u20ac185 billion of Amundi's assets under management.\n\nFurthermore, Amundi is a shareholder in joint ventures operating in India, China, South Korea and Morocco. As of 31 December 2020, the products distributed through these joint ventures amounted to \u20ac239 billion of Amundi's assets under management.\n\nThese agreements may be terminated or not renewed for commercial or legal reasons. Furthermore, these thirdparty distributors that distribute Amundi products are not bound by any exclusivity clause. In other words, if a bank in this distribution network were to decide to replace Amundi's products with those of a competitor, or to reduce the resources dedicated to promoting and distributing Amundi's products, or if it were to charge higher fees for the distribution of Amundi's products, this could have an adverse impact on Amundi's assets under management and its earnings. In addition, factors a/ffecting the competitive environment or the reputation of these distribution networks, as well as any potential default by these entities, could have an adverse e/ffect on Amundi's reputation and earnings.\n\n## /uni25A0 Management fee rates are subject to competitive pressure and market pressure.\n\nAmundi's management fees are usually a percentage of its assets under management and vary according to the type of product, the geographic market and other factors. As of 31 December 2020, the revenue generated by fees and other income from customer activities amounted to \u20ac2.434/uni00A0billion (excluding performance fees).\n\nFees are subject to intense competitive pressure: the fees charged on Retail products must be disclosed in accordance with the regulations in force, and those charged to institutional investors are usually determined by a formal competitive process. The fees applied on the asset management market have been subject to significant competitive pressure in recent years. A reduction in the scale of fees would have a direct and adverse e/ffect on Amundi's earnings.\n\nAmundi operates in a fiercely competitive environment: Amundi is the largest European asset manager in terms of assets under management and is one of the top 10 asset management companies worldwide (Source: IPE 'Top 500 Asset Managers', ranking published in June/uni00A02020 based on assets under management at the end of December 2019). The asset management industry is highly competitive and entry barriers are moderate. Amundi's main competitors are asset management companies, insurance companies and financial services companies, many of which offer investment products that are similar to those o/ffered by Amundi. Competition within the industry is driven by several factors, including the performance of investments, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of the services and products provided, the image and reputation of the company, the e/ffectiveness of distribution channels and the ability to develop new investment strategies and new products to meet the changing needs of investors. Individual investors are faced with a wide range of investments from which to choose, and even more so now with the ever-expanding online investment o/ffering. Furthermore, institutional investors generally select managers through a competitive bidding process. This increasingly intense competition could result in a fall in the volume of assets managed by Amundi and therefore its results, particularly if it results in reduced fees. Furthermore, where its activities in the issue of structured EMTNs are concerned, Amundi faces competition from the largest French and international banking groups. In addition, new domestic and international operators may enter the markets in which Amundi operates and, in so doing, intensify competition, which could have a material adverse e/ffect on Amundi's business, earnings and outlook. Finally, products marketed as asset management products are in competition with other categories of investment o/ffered to investors (various marketable securities, bonds, regulated and unregulated savings products, property investments, etc.).\n\nIn addition, many competitors o/ffer products that are similar or comparable to those o/ffered by Amundi. If competitors' products fail or perform badly, this could result in a loss of confidence in Amundi's similar products, regardless of how they perform. Any loss of confidence in a given product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity problems for those products, which could adversely a/ffect Amundi, resulting in a fall in its assets under management and reduced earnings.\n\n## /uni25A0 Amundi's inability to recruit and retain its employees could result in the loss of clients and provoke a drop in its assets under management.\n\nAmundi's success depends on the talent and hard work of its highly-qualified employees and on its ability to plan for the Company's long-term future growth, by identifying employees who may ultimately play key roles at Amundi. The market for portfolio managers, investment analysts, product specialists, sales sta/ff and other qualified professionals is competitive, and the factors that a/ffect Amundi's ability to attract and retain these employees are, in particular, its reputation, the compensation and benefits it o/ffers, and its commitment to the e/ffective planning of management succession, including by developing and training qualified employees.

Amundi's reputation could be damaged by factors such as poor investment performance, legal proceedings, action taken by a regulator, misconduct or violation of applicable laws or regulations. Negative publicity in relation to any of these factors could damage Amundi's reputation, expose it to regulatory sanctions and have an adverse impact on its relations with clients, third-party distributors and other commercial partners.

Non-financial risk\n\nNot complying with investors' expectations in terms of ESG o/fferings or corporate social responsibility could lead to a loss of clients and a/ffect Amundi's brand image and reputation.\n\nAmundi takes measures to meet the expectations of its various stakeholders regarding corporate social responsibility. Non-financial risk is addressed in policies pertaining to the operation of the Company (Purchasing policies, Human Resources policies, etc.) that are implemented by the relevant business units.\n\nNon-financial risks in portfolios managed on behalf of third parties are controlled by investment limits established based on internal ratings determined by a dedicated team of analysts who analyse ESG criteria. The various parameters selected to create this rating and the investment limits applicable to portfolios as an aggregate and/or to individual portfolios depending on the financial management processes, are subject to specific governance involving the risk monitoring teams. In 2018, Amundi announced its objective to incorporate extra-financial (ESG) criteria into its investment processes.\n\nAmundi has developed an ESG o/ffering and intends to extend it. Total ESG assets under management increased from \u20ac323/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019 to \u20ac378 billion at the end of/uni00A02020 (see Chapter 3 for the details of Amundi's corporate social responsibility and ESG measures).\n\nbrokerage, as Amundi is the intermediary between the funds and banking counterparties. Amundi is also exposed to credit risk on its investment portfolio.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, RWA for credit risk stood at \u20ac5.1/uni00A0billion out of a total RWA of \u20ac12.3 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

Default risk\n\nAmundi is exposed to default risk on its investment portfolio as well as through guarantees given on some of the products it o/ffers to clients. This risk is monitored continuously by the Credit Analysis team of the Risk Management Department which alerts the Credit Committee if the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty deteriorates. The Credit Committee sets the individual limits on issuer risk for securities held directly or by the guaranteed funds. It also sets the counterparty risk limits on market transactions.\n\nStructured funds benefiting from guarantees granted by Amundi mainly consist of three types: structured funds,\n\nconstant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds and Italian pension funds.\n\nStructured funds are intended to deliver a predefined return, based on a formula that is usually linked to share prices or indexes. The structure usually includes a form of capital protection.\n\nCPPI funds are intended to offer partial exposure to the returns of risky assets, along with a guarantee that is defined at the outset.\n\nItalian pension funds are designed to protect the capital of subscribers until retirement age (except in the case of early exit).\n\nThe following table shows amounts guaranteed as of 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019:\n\n| In \u20ac/uni00A0millions                                 | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Structured funds                                     | 7,064        | 8,175        |\n| Constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds | 6,052        | 7,466        |\n| Italian pension funds                                | 3,050        | 2,770        |\n| Other guaranteed funds                               | 2,076        | 1,925        |\n| TOTAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS                  | 18,242       | 20,336       |\n\nThe liability relating to these funds corresponds to the amount of risk to which the Amundi Group as guarantor is exposed on the measurement date. Depending on the types of funds and the form of the guarantee, it is linked to the amount initially invested or the value of assets under management on the date the liability is measured, or to the specified structure in the case of structured funds.\n\nThe Risk Management Department continuously monitors the adequacy of assets held relative to returns due from the funds.\n\nFund assets may comprise the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 direct acquisition of debt obligations;\n- /uni25A0 acquisition of equities whose performance may be swapped with top-tier banks;\n- /uni25A0 repurchase agreements with top-tier banks;\n- /uni25A0 purchase of fund units (multi-asset investments).\n\nExcept for the Italian pension funds, the main risk to which the guarantor is exposed in relation to these funds is the risk of default on securities acquired directly by the fund.\n\nAssets that expose the guarantor to credit risk are permanently monitored by an independent credit analysis team within the Risk Management Department. Exposures for each issuer are subject to limits set by the Credit Committee. Exposures are monitored on the basis of their nominal amount. The credit quality measurement process includes an internal system that gives a ranking based on issuer quality.\n\nAssets exposing the guarantor to credit risk are subject to:\n\n- /uni25A0 prior authorisation of each investment from the independent credit analysis team. The exposure for each issuer has limits placed upon it. There is no sector or geographic restriction a priori but the assets must be rated at least investment grade at the time they are acquired;\n- /uni25A0 monthly reports in terms of exposure, limits and ratings.\n\n## II. Counterparty risk on market transactions\n\nTo ensure that clients receive the promised returns in structured vehicles (structured funds or structured EMTNs), derivative agreements are entered into with external bank counterparties selected through a tender process. As of 31 December/uni00A02020, the total nominal amount of transactions concluded between Amundi Finance and its market counterparties was \u20ac43.7/uni00A0billion.\n\nOnce the funds and the EMTNs have been sold, the transactions are hedged so as to only create limited market risk. However, they do result in liquidity and counterparty risk.\n\nThe notional amount of the performance swaps on funds and EMTNs being marketed as of 31 December 2020 was \u20ac485 million compared to \u20ac969/uni00A0million at 31 December 2019. Performance swaps are written with market counterparties in a notional amount equal to the projected level of sales. The fund is committed only to the actual level of sales. Amundi bears the risk of a variance between the projected level of sales and the actual level. These are short-term liabilities (average marketing time is three months). A provision appraised by experts is recognised on the reporting date should there be a variance in current transactions between the projected level of sales and the actual level. No provision had been made as of 31 December 2020.\n\nTo reduce the funds' counterparty risk associated with these transactions - to which Amundi is exposed as guarantor Amundi deals with the counterparties on its own account. These are all large financial institutions. These transactions are centralised by Amundi Finance, an Amundi subsidiary that specialises in guarantee activity. Counterparties used for derivatives brokerage are pre-authorised by the Credit Committee which sets the limits of separate exposures. The transactions are executed under master agreements with exchange of collateral, which substantially reduces Amundi's counterparty risk.",

        "page_content": "Although transactions are executed under master agreements with exchange of collateral in order to reduce Amundi's counterparty risk, Amundi may nevertheless incur significant losses in the event of default by major counterparties. In the event that one or more of the financial institutions defaults, Amundi should complete these transactions and seek other counterparties in order to enter into new transactions. In addition, Amundi's credit risk may be amplified if the collateral held by Amundi cannot be sold or is liquidated at a price that is not su/fficient to recover the amount owed to Amundi as a result of its exposure to derivatives.\n\n## III. Equity investment risk\n\nWhen it makes strategic equity investments in the share capital of a company, Amundi's degree of control may be limited and any disagreement with other shareholders or with the management of the entity concerned could have an adverse impact on Amundi's ability to influence the policies of that entity. Amundi is exposed to the risk that the value of the capital securities it holds could fall.\n\nInterests in equity-accounted entities amounted to \u20ac295/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020.\n\n## IV.

Risk of price fluctuations in the investment portfolio\n\nThe investment portfolio includes surplus capital voluntary investments and seed money. Seed money is used to launch new funds. Portfolios mainly consist of investments in funds managed by Amundi and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe investment portfolio is supervised by:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Seed Money Committee, which meets monthly to validate and monitor Seed Money investments and divestments;\n- /uni25A0 the Financial Management Committee, which meets up to twice per quarter and establishes guidelines pertaining to the voluntary investments portfolio and ensures the monitoring of the risk structure of the investment portfolio; overall portfolio investment limits as well as limits for each underlying asset are set by the Risk Management Department annually.\n\nFor most French entities, day-to-day cash management (relating to the Company's operations) is governed by a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncentralised cash management agreement. The voluntary investment and seed money portfolios are largely managed centrally at the Group level.\n\nThe investment portfolio is principally divided into fixedincome and money market exposures as detailed in table 4.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nFluctuations in the financial markets, particularly movements in interest rates, issuer credit spreads, exchange rates and the value of equities may lead to significant variations in the value of Amundi's own investments and a/ffect its net revenue and/or capital. Market risk is measured by Value at Risk (VaR), a statistical measure used to estimate the financial risk level of an investment portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss over a given holding period at a given confidence level. Amundi's VaR is a historical VaR. Amundi measures VaR at a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period, based on a historical observation period of one year. It amounted to \u20ac55/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020.",

        "page_content": "Other indicators are also used to monitor the portfolio: unrealised capital gains or losses, sensitivity to changes in interest rates, spreads, and share prices and historical and hypothetical stress indicators.\n\n## II. Foreign exchange risk\n\nAmundi's primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is structural, related to its investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures. Amundi's policy is not to systematically hedge against all such exposure. Although Amundi's currency positions are not significant, exchange rate fluctuations could a/ffect Amundi's earnings and financial position.\n\nIn 2020 it was decided to hedge the most significant exposures (in USD, JPY and GBP) with a view to optimising hedging costs in relation to the impact of this risk, in order to immunise the CET1 ratio against this risk. These hedges amounted to \u20ac164/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020.\n\nOperational foreign exchange positions are subject to a global limit. This limit requires foreign-currency revenues to be regularly converted into euros. It also requires any foreigncurrency investment made in connection with the investment portfolio to be hedged. Amundi's operational foreign exchange positions are not material.\n\n## III. Real estate risk\n\nSince the end of 2013, Amundi has developed a business in issuing index-linked bonds:\n\n- /uni25A0 bonds whose structure is linked to the equity markets: these issues are hedged by derivatives and pose no market risk for Amundi;\n- /uni25A0 bonds whose structure is benchmarked in part to the real estate market: these issues are hedged using the same principles as equity-linked issues, but they expose Amundi to the risk of changes in real estate prices, because of the capital guarantee attached to them. This type of risk has its own set of restrictions.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the nominal amount of structured securities issues amounted to \u20ac9,360 million, including \u20ac1,379/uni00A0million in bonds that were partly indexed to real estate.\n\nAmundi invests a proportion of the income from these securities in units of real estate investment funds managed by one of its entities. These securities expose Amundi to real estate risk, given that it is usually obliged to pay the principal of the securities on maturity, irrespective of the performance of the underlying real estate investment funds.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Amundi may be exposed to liquidity risk, as it may be unable to sell shares/units of the underlying funds su/fficiently quickly to generate the liquidity required to meet redemption requests, particularly in times of market disruption.\n\n## 5.3 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## 5.3.1 Internal control and risk management system\n\nAmundi's internal control system notably complies with the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0511-41), the Order of 3/uni00A0November 2014 concerning the internal control of companies in the banking, payment services and investment services sector, which are subject to regulation by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR), the AMF General Regulation and guidelines on corporate governance, particularly those issued by the European Banking Authority and the Basel Committee.\n\nThe structure of the internal control system also consistently conforms to the guidelines laid down by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, which are aimed at ensuring a consolidated approach to risk as part of the controls carried out by the Group, the majority shareholder. These external guidelines are supplemented by Amundi's own charters, standards and internal procedures in the areas of risk monitoring, including IT and accounting, compliance checks and internal audit.\n\nThe internal control system applies equally to all Amundi Group entities (excluding joint ventures in which Amundi is the minority shareholder) and covers the management and control of activities, as well as the measurement and monitoring of risk. The system implemented by Amundi is adapted to suit the various operational units and subsidiaries depending on their specialist areas, and particularly with regard to their regulatory obligations.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the risk appetite framework and the risk limits that apply to the Group. The governance of the internal control system stipulates that the Board of Directors' Risk Management Committee is to systematically report back the results of controls and significant incidents in light of this framework.\n\nThe resources, tools and reports used in this regulatory environment mean that Senior Management and the Board of Directors can be given regular reports on the functioning of the internal control system and its adequacy with regard to the Group's risk profile.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

It is implemented by all operational units under their hierarchy. Level/uni00A01 Permanent Control is designed to ensure compliance with internal procedures relating to the operational processes, and their compliance with current laws and regulations, professional standards and codes of conduct. It makes it possible to prevent or detect any risk arising as a result of Amundi's activities.\n\nThe executives of the operational units are individually responsible for managing the risk associated with their activities. They are responsible for the definition, efficient deployment and regular updating of the Permanent Control system within their units.\n\nThe control system takes into account the regulatory framework and internal procedures. It is understood that these procedures must evolve and be adapted to our clients' expectations. They must take into account improvements that\n\nare expected in relation to any actual or potential incidents, as well as the recommendations made by Internal Audit.\n\nThe operational units obtain the resources necessary to perform these controls and regularly communicate the results to the Department to which they report, the Risk Management Department, the Compliance Department, and the Security Department.\n\nThey prepare reports to their hierarchy at least once a year, including a list of the key indicators and controls used to monitor the risks to which they are exposed, as well as a summary of the results of the controls carried out.\n\nIn the event of the significant deterioration of a risk, the operational units alert their hierarchy without delay, as well as the control functions.\n\nThe quality and relevance of the Level/uni00A01 controls and the e/ffective relaying of their results for Level/uni00A02 control functions is an essential factor in the e/fficiency of Level/uni00A02 controls.\n\nThe design of the internal control system relies on two main cornerstones:\n\n- /uni25A0 systems for the measurement, monitoring and control of risk: financial risk, operational risk (operational processing, accounting and financial information, information systems), legal risk and non-compliance risk;\n- /uni25A0 Level/uni00A01 Permanent Control system is carried out by the operational units, Level/uni00A02 Permanent Control is ensured by the Risk, Compliance, and Security functions and periodic controls are performed by Internal Audit.\n\nAmundi's internal control system covers all of the Group within France and internationally, except for the joint ventures in which Amundi holds a minority interest.",

        "page_content": "## Level/uni00A02 Permanent Control\n\nLevel/uni00A02 Permanent Control is performed jointly by three control functions, which are independent from the operational units:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Risk Management function;\n- /uni25A0 the Compliance function;\n- /uni25A0 the Security function.\n\nCollectively, these three functions are responsible for the cooperative and coordinated management of the entire Permanent Control system to verify that it provides comprehensive cover of the risks Amundi is exposed to. These control functions report to the Company's Second Executive Director, the Head of Amundi's Business Support and Control Division.\n\n## Coordination within Amundi as a whole\n\nAmundi's Risk Management, Compliance, and Security Departments are responsible for the overall steering of the Permanent Control system of the Amundi Group. Accordingly, they define the approach and principles for implementation within the Group's various entities. They coordinate the control plans and organise the reporting of the findings.\n\nThe Risk Management, Compliance, and Security functions act in a collective and complementary manner in their respective fields of competence by ensuring the consistency and e/ffectiveness of the controls carried out by the operational departments.\n\nThe Risk Management, Compliance, and Security functions take into account the Level/uni00A01 controls implemented by the business units and the resulting reports relayed when defining their own Level/uni00A02 controls. The frequency and comprehensiveness of these Level/uni00A02 controls depend on the annual risk assessment and mapping exercise carried out by each of the three functions.\n\nLevel/uni00A02 control functions are not a substitute for the Level/uni00A01 controls carried out by the operational departments.\n\nThe Risk Management function is responsible for monitoring the risk to which Amundi is exposed on its own account and as manager on behalf of third parties, with the exception of non-compliance risk and IT risk.\n\nIn this regard, the Risk Management function:\n\n- /uni25A0 continuously checks that the company and its clients are not exposed to financial risk beyond their risk tolerance;\n- /uni25A0 ensures that investment constraints are complied with;\n- /uni25A0 checks that operational risk is controlled.\n\nThe Compliance function is responsible for monitoring non-compliance risk and continuously ensures compliance with legislative or regulatory provisions and professional and ethical standards, particularly in terms of:\n\n- /uni25A0 market integrity;\n- /uni25A0 financial security;\n- /uni25A0 protection for clients and unitholders;\n- /uni25A0 professional ethics;\n- /uni25A0 prevention of fraud and corruption.\n\nIn this context, the Compliance function checks that employees have a minimum level of knowledge regarding the regulatory and ethical environment and financial techniques.\n\nThe Security function is responsible for monitoring the risk associated with the information system (IT infrastructure, applications and data) as well as the risk relating to personal data protection (under the European regulations on the handling of personal data and the free circulation of these data), business continuity, and the protection of persons and property.\n\n## Consolidated performance indicators for/uni00A0the/uni00A0Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole Group\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has established a set of key indicators (classified as 2.2c controls) in various fields, which include: Credit risk, financial risk, accounting risk, non-compliance risk, business continuity plan, security safety prevention, IT risk, and operational risk.\n\nAn individual responsible for each category is appointed within Amundi to establish the relevant indicators using the 2.2c indicators proposed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. as a methodological benchmark. This is done for all Amundi Group entities. This individual retains the audit trail of the controls completed and the results obtained.\n\nAmundi's Risk Management Department is in charge of coordinating the collection and consolidation of the results of controls carried out based on indicators defined by the individuals responsible for each category on behalf of Amundi, and providing them to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.\n\n## Level/uni00A03 controls\n\nAmundi's Internal Audit is in charge of the Group's periodic control; it ensures the lawfulness, security and e/ffectiveness of all operations and risk control activities across all Amundi entities. It intervenes via audit plans approved by the Board of Directors' Risk Management Committee to cover the activities at frequencies appropriate to the risks of each activity. Each audit results in a report and recommendations, to which the audited entities respond. The effective implementation of recommendations is monitored twice yearly by Amundi's Internal Audit. The General Internal Audit Department of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. also conducts audits of the Amundi Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

It ensures that the internal control system is subject to constant monitoring to verify its adequacy and e/ffectiveness. Senior Management is informed of the main malfunctions identified and the corrective measures applied.\n\nThe Board of Directors:\n\n- /uni25A0 on the recommendation of Senior Management, approves the risk appetite in view of the Group's defined strategy;\n- /uni25A0 is informed at least twice a year, through presentations by Senior Management, about the Group's consolidated risk situation and earnings, the status of the risk monitoring and internal control system and the earnings from operations and the internal control findings.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors is informed of significant incidents that exceed certain thresholds which are reviewed annually by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. Lastly, it reviews the annual report on internal control once a year.\n\n## 5.3.2.1 Internal control committees\n\n## Internal Control Committee\n\nThe Internal Control Committee, chaired by the Head of Amundi's Business Support and Control Division, ensures the consistency, e/ffectiveness and completeness of the internal control system and coordinates Periodic Control, Permanent Control, Risk Management, Compliance and Security activities. Other members of this committee include Amundi's Head of Risk Management, Head of Compliance, Head of Security, Head of Legal A/ffairs and Head of Internal Audit. It meets 11 times a year.\n\nThe duties of the Committee include:\n\n- /uni25A0 assessing the internal control system and the control system implemented;\n- /uni25A0 examining the major risks of any kind to which Amundi is exposed and changes to the risk and performance measurement systems, and ensuring the adequacy of the internal control system to correctly oversee these risks;\n- /uni25A0 making any decision necessary to remedy weaknesses in the internal control system;\n- /uni25A0 monitoring the implementation of commitments made as a consequence of internal and external audits;\n- /uni25A0 deciding on corrective measures for shortcomings revealed by the audits as well as by the operating and control reports available to those responsible for the control or management functions of the entity.\n\n## Risk Management Committee\n\nAmundi's Group Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Head of the Business Support and Control Division, is the main risk governance body. It meets 11 times a year.\n\nThe objectives of the Committee are to set the risk management policy governing all Amundi Group entities (risks taken on behalf of third parties and on its own account). Accordingly, it has complete authority to:\n\n- /uni25A0 define Amundi's risk policy;\n- /uni25A0 approve management strategies and investment processes;\n- /uni25A0 approve methodologies used to calculate risk indicators;\n- /uni25A0 approve credit and counterparty limits;\n- /uni25A0 set overall limits;\n- /uni25A0 make decisions about the funds' use of new financial instruments;\n- /uni25A0 determine the risk framework for each product and activity;\n- /uni25A0 review the findings of audits performed;\n- /uni25A0 make the decisions necessary to resolve any exceptions discovered.\n\nDecisions made by the Group Risk Management Committee apply to all Group entities.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee delegates the specific duties entrusted to it to several sub-committees. Thus:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Valuation Committee sets the valuation policy;\n- /uni25A0 the Credit Committee approves the per issuer limits on supervised funds and own account and counterparty limits on all funds;\n- /uni25A0 the Operational Risk Management Committee handles the monitoring of incidents related to operational processes and defines the measures to enhance these processes.\n\nThe local Risk Committees, chaired by the local General Manager, have the authority to adapt the policy framework applicable to investments to particular local regulations or market conditions, though always complying with the decisions of the Group Risk Management Committee. These committees meet at least quarterly.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The scope covered includes operational risk, market risk, credit and counterparty risk, legal risk, etc.\n\nAmundi has put in place an organisation to manage risk which is based on a high level of integration of the Risk Management business unit across the whole of the Amundi Group, with the following objectives:\n\n- /uni25A0 uniformity of the risk monitoring processes;\n- /uni25A0 the pooling of resources adapted to suit the various entities;\n- /uni25A0 a high level of team expertise, by means of dedicated centres of competence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

The goal of these departments is to integrate all risk and performance factors and indicators for each fund analysed and to ensure the internal consistency of these indicators and their suitability to a fund's objectives. Within these departments, Senior Risk Managers (SRM) consult with Senior Investment Managers to oversee the risks of each asset class managed;\n- /uni25A0 in each subsidiary that manages assets, a Risk team oversees the risks and reports functionally to a department head;\n- /uni25A0 teams specialised by field of expertise and brought together in a dedicated department whose mission is to ensure consistency across business lines of the approach taken for each type of risk. The main missions of this department are to define the standards and methods for measuring risk, produce the risk indicators and provide expertise in applying these measurements to the portfolios;\n- /uni25A0 the department is organised around the following seven areas of expertise:\n- /uni25A0 implementation and administration of the monitoring software for regulatory and contractual constraints,\n- /uni25A0 measurement and attribution of performance,\n- /uni25A0 calculation of credit and market risk indicators, definition and control of the valuation policy,\n- /uni25A0 supervision of the monitoring system for operational risk and accounting risk, as well as co-ordination of the work done on permanent control at consolidated level,\n- /uni25A0 establishment of a list of authorised counterparties and, for certain managed portfolios, the setting of issuer limits,\n- /uni25A0 the steering and implementation of solutions for the Risk Management department and cross-business projects,\n- /uni25A0 establishment of a list of authorised counterparties for all managed portfolios and the setting of per issuer limits for certain managed portfolios;\n- /uni25A0 a dedicated team in charge of steering the operational risk monitoring system. This team's main role is to:\n- /uni25A0 map operational risk at the Amundi level,\n- /uni25A0 collect information about operational incidents,\n- /uni25A0 monitor all action plans designed to mitigate this risk,\n- /uni25A0 contribute to calculating the capital requirement,\n- /uni25A0 contribute to the Permanent Control system.\n\nAmundi takes a comprehensive approach to managing operational risk. All teams and managers are involved in managing operational risk.\n\nTo make risk monitoring more consistent, the risk management information system is shared by all entities within the internal control scope, including the following applications:\n\n- /uni25A0 applications for managing constraints and risk limitations;\n- /uni25A0 applications for measuring market risk;\n- /uni25A0 systems for performance measurement and attribution.\n\nPeriodic reports are provided to Senior Management and to the Board of Directors on the controls carried out by the Risk Management function. In 2018, Senior Management was regularly updated by:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Risk Management function's Monthly Scorecard, which provides a detailed review of the Group's exposure to various risks, and sensitive matters;\n- /uni25A0 the update given by the Head of Risk Management to the Executive Committee; and\n- /uni25A0 the Risk Management business unit's various governance committees which Senior Management takes part in, including Amundi's Group Risk Management Committee which is the head committee of the Risk Management system.\n\nThe Board of Directors also receives regular information through presentations given by the Risk Management Committee, which cover:\n\n- /uni25A0 the risk management system, its current state and any changes to it;\n- /uni25A0 a summary of risks, changes in risk, the level of the main risk limits and usage of those limits.\n\n## 5.3.3.1.2  Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2020\n\nWork to improve and adapt the risk monitoring system continued throughout 2020. The main highlights of this were:\n\n- /uni25A0 aligning the funds' liquidity risk management systems with the ESMA guidelines (stress tests for money market funds);\n- /uni25A0 adapting the risk monitoring system during the Covid-19 crisis;\n- /uni25A0 acquiring Sabadell AM in the first half of 2020 and integrating it into the Group's management system.\n\nIn terms of changes to the control system:\n\n- /uni25A0 activities performed on behalf of third parties:\n- In the context of the Covid-19 crisis, the following measures were taken:\n- /uni25A0 funds' liquidity levels increased,\n- /uni25A0 swing pricing parameters adjusted,\n- /uni25A0 Amundi's communications on liquidity adjusted in line with clients' demands;\n- /uni25A0 activities performed on our own account:\n- /uni25A0 limits adjusted in response to the increase in margin calls as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3.3.2  Compliance function\n\n## 5.3.3.2.1  Organisation of the Compliance business/uni00A0unit\n\nAmundi's Compliance business unit is organised as a centralised function that is independent of operational services. The duties of Amundi's Head of Compliance are carried out totally independently. A feature of this independence is a dual reporting system; reporting hierarchically, on the one hand, to the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and operationally, on the other, to Amundi's Deputy General Manager, the Head of the Business Support and Control Division.\n\nThe Compliance Business Unit ensures that the prevention and control systems for non-compliance risk are consistent and effective throughout the entities that are monitored on a consolidated basis by Amundi. Along with the Risk Management and Security business units, it constitutes the second line of defence of the Group's internal control system. The Compliance business unit relies on the controls formalised by the managers of the operational units, who are primarily responsible for and the guarantors of the e/ffective deployment of the internal control system and ensure that the transactions carried out comply with laws and regulations and internal standards.\n\nIts main tasks are:\n\n- /uni25A0 to disseminate a culture of compliance within the Group;\n- /uni25A0 to define the framework of compliance standards;\n- /uni25A0 to assist the Group's managers and employees with carrying out their business activities;\n- /uni25A0 to help the business units assess non-compliance risk and implement and monitor the corresponding controls;\n- /uni25A0 to represent the Group in its dealings with regulators, national authorities and professional associations in conjunction with the Group's other control functions;\n- /uni25A0 to inform and, if applicable, warn Senior Management of a non-compliance risk.\n\nAmundi's Compliance business unit which is structured as a globally integrated function, brings together all of the Compliance teams of Amundi and its subsidiaries. It is itself incorporated into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Compliance business unit. Its structure is designed to preserve the independence of the entities' Compliance Managers, to ensure that the resources allocated to the e/ffective management and control of noncompliance risk are adequate and proportionate and to ensure information is transparent.\n\nIn each country, the Compliance business unit must ensure that the activities and operations of the entities within the Amundi Group comply both with local regulations and with any other regulations and any of the Group's internal rules that apply to them. Every year, the Compliance Department of each entity and subsidiary:\n\n- /uni25A0 maps the risk of non-compliance with legislative and regulatory provisions with the aim of identifying major areas of risk and determining the regulatory procedures to be put in place and setting out any remedial action. In the event of a significant risk being identified, the escalation procedure will be implemented and Senior Management and the Board of Directors notified, if necessary;\n\n- /uni25A0 prepares the annual Compliance report for the entity's Board of Directors and forwards it to Amundi's Head of Compliance. This annual Compliance report sets out the conditions for ensuring Compliance, essential information and the lessons learned from measuring and monitoring non-compliance risk.\n\nBased on the annual reports of its subsidiaries, as well as on the results of its own controls, Amundi's Compliance Department produces the annual Compliance report for Amundi's CEO and Board of Directors, and informs the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\n## 5.3.3.2.2  Risk monitoring scheme\n\nThe main non-compliance risks are grouped together by level of risk in the following categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 Market integrity;\n- /uni25A0 Professional ethics,\n- /uni25A0 Financial security;\n- /uni25A0 Protection for clients and unitholders;\n- /uni25A0 Prevention of fraud and corruption.\n\nNon-compliance risks are identified and assessed each year for each compliance topic within the 'non-compliance risk mapping'. These maps are drawn up by each Group entity and consolidated at the Amundi level.\n\nThe Compliance Department's control plan is aligned with the non-compliance risks identified in the risk mapping. It is reviewed periodically and validated by the Compliance Committee at the start of the year.\n\nThe Compliance procedures are based on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s compliance procedures and include the specific characteristics of the business units o/ffered by Amundi and its subsidiaries, particularly asset management. They apply to all entities in the Amundi Group. These Compliance procedures are accompanied by a set of compliance checks that are common to all entities, ensuring consistent implementation of controls across the entire scope.\n\n## Market integrity\n\nRegulations require Amundi investment service providers to act in an honest, fair and professional manner that promotes market integrity. The Group ensures compliance with market integrity through checks on transactions and the way they are executed in the markets (time-stamping, pre-allocation of orders, partial execution, management of market abuse alerts, monitoring of threshold crossings, application of best execution criteria, etc.).\n\nThe Compliance Department's work also covers NAV figures (examining requests to suspend/recalculate a net asset value), and validating and checking the exercise of voting rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n## Monitoring of order allocation\n\nThe system in place is based on a strict separation of the Portfolio Management and Trading business units. Portfolio managers' orders are placed and processed by the Trading business unit. The procedure is aimed at establishing an audit trail for each stage of the process, which involves investment management, the trading desk and the middle office. It is based on the use of a single in-house tool which systematically time stamps and pre-allocates orders from the moment they are entered into the IT systems.\n\nThe order placement system uses a default model whereby, in the event of partial execution, the allocation of partial quantities is determined in proportion to the quantities initially requested. This method ensures the fair allocation of traded quantities.\n\n## 'Best selection' procedure\n\nAmundi has committed to take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result when executing orders. Amundi has implemented a selection and execution policy that applies to all financial instruments covered by Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) that are traded on financial markets by intermediaries. Due to their status, Group asset management companies do not have access to financial markets. In order to obtain the best execution possible, Amundi has chosen to use Amundi Interm\u00e9diation for its transmission and order execution activities. Amundi Interm\u00e9diation has been approved by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) as an investment company able to provide Reception and Transmission of Orders (RTO) services and order execution on behalf of third parties relating to all financial instruments specified in Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0211-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nAll steps are taken to ensure that orders are executed in the client's best interest and contribute to market integrity by taking into account specified criteria such as price, liquidity, rapidity, cost, etc., depending upon their relative importance according to the various types of orders transmitted. Amundi Interm\u00e9diation regularly re-examines the conditions and mechanisms it uses for order execution. In the absence of internal or external events requiring a review during the course of the year, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation's execution policy is reviewed on an annual basis during the selection committees. This review is formalised in the reports drawn up by these committees.\n\n## Professional ethics\n\nAmundi employees undertake to comply strictly with the applicable ethical standards in accordance with the law, and with the regulations and codes of conduct in force. Compliance with ethical standards is an essential element of the quality of service that Amundi is committed to delivering to its clients.\n\nIn order to protect and prioritise the interests of its clients, Amundi has implemented a policy for identifying, preventing and managing any conflicts of interest that may arise during the course of its business. The system for preventing conflicts of interest is based partly on a map that identifies situations posing a risk of a conflict of interest, the preparation and rating of conflict of interest scenarios, and a set of controls covering risky situations. Up to and including Senior Management, Amundi is also organised into business units to separate the various functions likely to give rise to conflicts of interest.\n\nThe holding of inside or confidential information is governed by special procedures that reiterate the obligations of the employees concerned and require the compilation of insider lists and confidentiality lists. Employees on those lists are informed of the fact, and they are reminded of the relevant conduct rules at that time.\n\nAmundi aims to develop and promote a strong culture of compliance in accordance with the laws and regulations in force. The Compliance Department provides Amundi employees with mandatory training sessions, available in e-learning or face-to-face format.\n\n## Financial security\n\nAmundi has set up an effective system of anti-moneylaundering and combatting the financing of terrorism. The measures taken by Amundi enable it to ensure compliance with all of its financial security obligations.\n\nThe Financial Security system is based on the following fundamental principles:\n\n- /uni25A0 the implementation of an appropriate framework, including a set of written procedures and training for employees;\n- /uni25A0 a risk classification system that ensures appropriate due diligence measures are taken which are proportionate to the risks posed by clients and their transactions, as well as an e/fficient warning system;\n- /uni25A0 a control system based on governance, permanent control and periodic control;\n\n## Protection for clients and unitholders\n\nAs an investment services provider, Amundi:\n\n- /uni25A0 ensures that information about the products o/ffered to clients and UCI unitholders is clear, transparent and not misleading;\n- /uni25A0 ensures that clients and unitholders are treated fairly;\n- /uni25A0 refrains from placing the interests of a group of clients, unitholders or shareholders ahead of those of another group of clients, unitholders or shareholders.\n\nIn particular, the Compliance Department ensures that any information produced is balanced and of high quality, verifies that clients are o/ffered appropriate products, approves all new products or any substantial change to an existing product, and checks that responses to any complaints submitted by clients and unitholders comply with procedures.\n\n## Prevention of fraud and corruption\n\nWithin Amundi, the system for preventing the risk of fraud applies to all Amundi businesses and o/ffices in France and worldwide. It aims to manage the consequences of fraud in the broadest sense, whether this involves financial loss, regulatory risk or reputational risk. This system is built around three pillars: prevention, detection and management of fraud. Due to its international dimension and the diversity of its activities, Amundi has included the detection of the risk of money laundering, tax fraud and tax evasion within the scope of its normal due diligence measures.",

This adjustment was carried out in line with the recommendations issued by the regulator;\n- /uni25A0 establishment of an Adjudication Committee for clients with an incomplete KYC profile in order to approve whether or not to continue the business relationship;\n- /uni25A0 migration of the International Sanctions screening tool to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's 'Fircosoft' tool.\n\nOverhaul of the Fraud Prevention and Anti-Corruption Committee from March 2020 (meeting every six months), and implementation of a new tool to support any company employee, external employee or supplier who wishes to exercise their whistle-blower's rights.\n\n## 5.3.3.3  Security function\n\nThe Security Department is organised in a centralised fashion while still relying on local correspondents. It combines divisions with di/fferent expert departments in charge of the security of persons and property, business continuity, information systems security or personal data protection.\n\nThe activity and controls carried out by the Security function are regularly reported to Senior Management through the monthly Internal Control Committee meetings or the Security Committee meetings held four times a year and chaired by the Company's Second Executive Director, the Head of Amundi's Business Support and Control Division. Likewise, the Board of Directors receives regular reports from its Risk Management Committee on the risk control system managed by the Security function, as well as the results of any controls carried out.\n\nThe resources dedicated to the security of information systems (IS), under the responsibility of the Chief Information Security O/fficer (CISO), are separate from the Information Systems Department (ISD), which reports hierarchically and functionally to the department responsible for Operations (OST). The CISO is tasked with defining the security policy for IS, managing its proper execution as well as implementing a strategy to anticipate and prevent any breaches to the integrity, confidentiality, availability or traceability of the overall system. It is also responsible for protecting the information systems, detecting any malicious acts or acts that breach internal policy and for responding to such acts.\n\nThe IT risk control function relies on Level/uni00A01 and Level/uni00A02 permanent controls (including vulnerability scans and regular intrusion tests) and revolves around a/uni00A0monthly operational committee (the IT Security Steering Committee) and the Security Committee, which meets four times a year.\n\nAmundi's overall business continuity system derives from the regulations and also from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group procedures that include disaster scenarios. It is adapted to Amundi's own business and each subsidiary has its own version that incorporates the local regulatory framework and the activities of each entity. Based on an analysis of the criticality of the various business lines, and regularly reviewed so as to take into account any changes in risks and the associated disaster scenarios, the business continuity plan includes a 'crisis management' component and is designed to meet the Company's need to resume business rapidly.\n\nThe results of the associated control plan are presented to the Security Committee.\n\n## 5.3.3.4  Periodic control\n\nThe Amundi Internal Audit Department reports hierarchically to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. General Internal Audit Department and operationally to Amundi's Senior Management. The Periodic Control system includes a central Internal Audit team, which covers the entire Amundi scope, and decentralised Internal Audit teams in several of its subsidiaries, which report to local management and to Amundi's Head of Internal Audit.\n\nIntegrated within the Internal Audit business unit of the majority shareholder, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Amundi's periodic control system is based on the tools and methods adopted by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, in particular with regard to audit mapping, planning and conducting audits, monitoring implementation of recommendations issued and reporting on follow-up to its work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

It also factors in requests from Amundi's Senior Management, the Internal Audit business unit of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The objective of the multi-year program is to cover the audit scope (which is based on the scope of the monitored entities) over a maximum of five years, with an average frequency of three years used.\n\nIn addition, Internal Audit conducts half-yearly audits to follow up the implementation of all of its recommendations, as well as ensuring quarterly follow-up of some important recommendations. All work carried out by Amundi Internal Audit, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. General Internal Audit Department and by supervisory authorities are subject to this formal monitoring system which ensures that remedial actions are implemented within the deadlines agreed with the entity's management at the end of the audit. The system also enables the Head of Internal Audit to issue alerts to the Board when necessary, as set out in Article/uni00A026 of the Order of 3/uni00A0November/uni00A02014.\n\nThe 2019 audit plan was not fully completed as a result of organisational developments, which meant that some audits were postponed to 2020 or replaced by other assignments, changes that were subject to the prior approval of the governance bodies of the Amundi Group.\n\nThe audit conclusions were presented to Senior Management and the Board of Directors' Risk Management Committee, who were also kept updated regarding the progress made to implement the recommendations.\n\nFinally, the approach taken by Amundi's Internal Audit function is subject to an ongoing quality improvement process.\n\n## 5.3.3.5  Specific internal control system for accounting and financial information; role and responsibilities in the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information\n\nUnder the authority of the Senior Management, Amundi's Finance Department is responsible for preparing the accounting and financial information. In particular, the Finance Department:\n\n- /uni25A0 draws up the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0and the accounting rules and principles set and distributed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- /uni25A0 prepares the financial statements of each entity in accordance with current local accounting standards;\n- /uni25A0 prepares the various regulatory, prudential and fiscal reports;\n- /uni25A0 produces the various pieces of management information necessary to steer the activities;\n- /uni25A0 ensures that Amundi's financial communications are issued to investors.\n\n## Permanent controls on accounting and/uni00A0financial/uni00A0information\n\nThe accounting and financial information control system within the Finance Department is based on checks carried out on the one hand by the Accounting, Management Control and Cash Management teams, and on the other, by an accounts auditing unit reporting directly to the Chief Financial O/fficer. This system is supported by permanent accounting controls provided by an independent team reporting to the Risk Management function.\n\nThe permanent accounting control objectives are designed to ensure adequate coverage of the major accounting risk which could alter the quality of the accounting and financial information in terms of:\n\n- /uni25A0 compliance of data with regard to the legal and regulatory provisions, and the standards of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- /uni25A0 reliability and accuracy of the data, so that it provides a true picture of the earnings and financial position of Amundi and of the entities within its scope of consolidation;\n- /uni25A0 security of the data preparation and processing procedures, limiting the operational risk with regard to Amundi's commitment to the information published;\n- /uni25A0 prevention of the risk of fraud and accounting irregularities.\n\nThe permanent controls on the accounting and financial information are based on an evaluation of the risks and controls of the accounting processes managed by the operational units. In particular, the risks monitored by the Risk Management Department, especially those related to the off-balancesheet commitments, are reconciled with Accounting in order to ensure that the information is complete and is properly evaluated in the financial statements.\n\nThe Head of Amundi's Permanent Accounting Control ensures that any corrective actions are implemented in order to reinforce the system of permanent accounting controls.\n\n## Relationships with statutory auditors\n\nIn accordance with current professional standards, the statutory auditors carry out work as they deem necessary on the accounting and financial information published:\n\n- /uni25A0 audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 a limited audit of the half-yearly consolidated financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 a reading of all the supporting materials for the published financial information.\n\nAs part of their legal mandate, the statutory auditors present their findings to the Audit Committee and to Amundi's Board of Directors.",

Amundi defines its risk appetite by including the essential dimensions of its business: the attractiveness of the products it o/ffers, the strength of its financial position and the pursuit of its short and long-term profitability objectives.\n\nThe formalisation of Amundi's risk appetite is instructive for Senior Management and the Board of Directors as they plan the Group's development trajectory and how that translates into each business unit's strategy.\n\nThis formalisation is the result of a coordinated and shared e/ffort among the Finance, Risk Management, Compliance and Security Departments and has as its goal:\n\n- /uni25A0 to engage the Directors of the Board and Senior Management in discussions and conversations about risk-taking;\n- /uni25A0 to formalise, standardise and specify the acceptable level of risk (framework of standards) relating to a given strategy;\n- /uni25A0 to fully integrate the risk/return relationship into the strategic steering and decision-making process;\n- /uni25A0 to have at hand sophisticated indicators and alert thresholds enabling Senior Management to anticipate an excessive deterioration in strategic indicators and to improve resilience by employing certain mechanisms in the event that an alert level is reached compared to standard risk appetite;\n- /uni25A0 to improve external communications with third parties, regulators and investors concerning earnings stability and the management of risk.\n\nAmundi's risk appetite framework for the 2020 financial year was set out at the Board of Directors meeting of 12/uni00A0December/uni00A02019. It was regularly reviewed during the financial year in order to adapt it to regulatory changes and to Amundi's profile.\n\n## Process for formalising the risk appetite framework\n\nIn line with the Group's policy, Amundi expresses its risk appetite in terms of key indicators, broken down into three levels of risk:\n\n- /uni25A0 appetite refers to the normal, recurring management of risk. This is expressed in the form of budget objectives in terms of solvency, liquidity and profitability, as well as operational limits pertaining to market, ALM and credit risk which, if breached, are immediately flagged and corrected by Senior Management;\n- /uni25A0 tolerance refers to managing a deteriorated risk level on an exceptional basis. When tolerance thresholds are breached, this immediately triggers a report to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee of the Amundi Board of Directors and, when appropriate, the Board of Directors itself;\n- /uni25A0 capacity refers to the maximum level of risk that Amundi could theoretically assume without violating its operational or regulatory constraints.\n\nWhen these thresholds are breached, the supervisory bodies of the Company are informed in proportion to the level of risk incurred.\n\nFurthermore, although Amundi chooses most of its risks as part of its strategic plan, certain risks such as operational risks and some non-compliance risks are inevitably going to be incurred, even though the protective measures and the control systems in place may limit their occurrence and their potential consequences. Amundi's appetite for any voluntary act that might create an operating loss or a violation of regulations and professional standards is quite obviously zero.\n\n## Key performance indicators in the risk profile as of/uni00A031 December 2020\n\nIn 2020, Amundi used nine key performance indicators to express its risk appetite and risk profile:\n\n## /uni25A0 four overall indicators of risk exposure:\n\n- /uni25A0 total Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) within the meaning of the CRD IV regulation: as of 31/uni00A0December 2020, Amundi's RWA totalled \u20ac12,342/uni00A0million,\n- /uni25A0 RWA in terms of credit risk (including threshold allowances and CVA) and market risk, which was \u20ac7,330/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020,\n- /uni25A0 RWA in terms of operational risk which was \u20ac5,012/uni00A0million as of 31 December 2020. This indicator shows the implementation of controls and supervision, the purpose of which is to reduce the impact of operational risk to the incompressible minimum,\n- /uni25A0 the CET1 solvency ratio, which stood at 20.0% as of 31/uni00A0December 2020;\n\n## /uni25A0 two indicators of balance-sheet liquidity:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Gearing or Debt ratio (net debt/tangible shareholders' equity): as of 31 December 2020, the Gearing ratio was 0.4%,\n- /uni25A0 the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR): Amundi's LCR as of 31 December 2020 was 153%;\n\n## /uni25A0 three profitability indicators:\n\n- /uni25A0 cost of risk, which takes into account credit risk (particularly default by an issuer or counterparty that may affect Amundi) in addition to operational risk and, where applicable, any market risk arising from the management of guaranteed funds and mandates; for 2020, Amundi's cost of risk was \u20ac22.8/uni00A0million,\n- /uni25A0 cost-to-income ratio, which reached 51.7% for the 2020 financial year, from an adjusted point of view,\n- /uni25A0 net income Group share, which for the 2020 financial year amounted to \u20ac910/uni00A0million.\n\nFor 2020 and as of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the various key indicators of the risk profile were situated within the acceptable risk range defined by Amundi and did not reach their tolerance thresholds, with the one-o/ff exception, during the first quarter 2020 only, of the cost-to-income ratio (which reached 54.1% during that quarter).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

The adjustments made (prudential filters) mostly involve deducting goodwill and intangible assets (net of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi principally holds CET1 capital, consisting of share capital and undistributed reserves. As part of the financing of the acquisition of Pioneer Investments, Amundi issued Tier 2 capital in the amount of \u20ac300/uni00A0million in 2017, maturing in 2027.\n\n## 5.4.1.2 Minimum regulatory requirements\n\nThe requirements for Pillar 1 are governed by the CRR regulation. The regulator also sets, on a discretionary basis, minimum requirements under Pillar 2.\n\n## Minimum requirements of Pillar 1\n\n- /uni25A0 Capital ratios before bu/ffers: since 2015, the minimum CET1 requirement has been set at 4.5% and the minimum Tier/uni00A01 requirement was increased to 6%. Finally, the minimum total capital requirement is 8%.\n- /uni25A0 These requirements are supplemented by capital bu/ffer requirements:\n- /uni25A0 the capital conservation bu/ffer (2.5% of risk-weighted assets);\n- /uni25A0 the countercyclical bu/ffer (between 0 and 2.5% of range of risk-weighted assets);\n- /uni25A0 systemic risk bu/ffers (generally between 0% and 3%, and up to 5% with European Commission approval, and more exceptionally over 5%) and for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) (between 0% and 3.5%) or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) (between 0% and 2%). These bu/ffers are not cumulative and, generally speaking, with some exceptions, only the highest will apply. Only the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group belongs to the systemically important institutions category. Amundi does not fall under these categories;\n- /uni25A0 these bu/ffers must be covered by CET1 capital.\n\n## Minimum requirements of Pillar 2\n\nSince 2017, the ECB has changed the methodology used, splitting the regulatory requirements into two parts:\n\n- /uni25A0 a 'Pillar 2 Requirement' (P2R). This requirement applies to all levels of capital and must be entirely made up of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1). Non-compliance with this requirement will automatically result in restrictions on distributions (additional Tier 1 capital instrument coupons, dividends, variable compensation). Consequently, this requirement is published;\n- /uni25A0 a 'Pillar 2 Guidance' (P2G). This requirement is not currently published.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, the Amundi Group has no longer had any additional capital requirements under the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process - SREP (P2G and P2R). As a result, as of 31 December 2020, the minimum regulatory level for compliance was 7.0% for the CET1 ratio and 10.5% for the Total Capital ratio. These levels included the requirements of Pillar 1, the capital conservation bu/ffer and the countercyclical bu/ffer.\n\n## 5.4.1.3 Capital ratios as of the end of 2020\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, Amundi's total capital ratio was 22.4% /uni00A0 (1) , compared to 18.4% /uni00A0 (2) in 2019. This increase is due to the sharp increase in Tier 1 capital (including the effect of not distributing the dividend for 2019), which more than o/ffset the increase in risk-weighted assets for operational risk, mainly linked to methodological or scope e/ffects (integration of Sabadell Asset Management).\n\nThe CET1 ratio stood at 20.0% /uni00A0(1) , significantly higher than the regulatory minimum for 2020, and up from 15.9% /uni00A0(2) at the end of 2019.\n\nThe reconciliation between accounting equity and regulatory capital is presented in section/uni00A04.3 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The key figures are set out in Section 5.5 below.\n\nAmundi has applied IFRS/uni00A09 to financial instruments since 1/uni00A0January 2018. This standard is being applied retrospectively. Accordingly, the impact associated with the new classification and the measurement principles for financial instruments and the writing down of credit risk was all taken into account with regard to Amundi's capital. This impact was not material for Amundi.\n\nFor credit risk purposes, risk-weighted assets are calculated using the standardised prudential method set out in the regulations. In practice, for the three main types of exposure:\n\n- /uni25A0 for the investment portfolio, risk-weighted assets are calculated on a transparent basis, taking into account assets actually held by the funds in which Amundi invests; riskweighted assets related to these underlying assets are valued for regulatory purposes using the standardised prudential method;\n- /uni25A0 for guarantees given to funds, risk-weighted assets are also calculated using the standardised approach with respect to recognition of the guarantee mechanism. The assets held by the funds benefiting from the guarantees are then estimated on a transparent basis using the standardised approach;\n- /uni25A0 for Amundi Finance's derivatives transactions, risk-weighted assets are valued according to the standardised prudential standards ('valued at their market value' method).\n\nIn 2020, \u20ac831/uni00A0million in risk-weighted assets were calculated for market risk, mainly linked to structural, unhedged foreign exchange exposures. At the end of 2018, Amundi received the\n\n## 5.4.2 Leverage ratio\n\nArticle/uni00A0429 of the CRR, setting out the terms and conditions relating to the leverage ratio, was modified by Delegated Regulation No./uni00A062/2015 of 10/uni00A0October 2014 published in the O/fficial Journal of the European Union on 18/uni00A0January 2015.\n\nSince the European regulation CRR 2 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 7/uni00A0June 2019, the leverage ratio has become a Pillar 1 minimum requirement with e/ffect from 28/uni00A0June 2021:\n\n- /uni25A0 the minimum leverage ratio requirement will be 3%;\n- /uni25A0 from 1/uni00A0January 2022, for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), and therefore for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, there will be an additional leverage ratio bu/ffer set at half of the entity's systemic bu/ffer;\n\nECB's permission to take into account deductions linked to goodwill and financial stakes for exposures denominated in US dollars and Chinese yuans.\n\nCapital requirements for operational risk are partially calculated using the advanced measurement approach (AMA) developed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and used by Amundi. Use of the AMA method was approved by the French Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel in 2007 and then confirmed in 2010.\n\nThe AMA model for capital calculation is based on an actuarial Loss Distribution Approach model, taking into account both internal and external factors.\n\nInternal factors (change in the entity's risk profile) include:\n\n- /uni25A0 changes in the entity's organisational structure, change in risk profile of the business and risk mapping, change in internal losses;\n- /uni25A0 quality of the risk management system and, in particular, the permanent control system.\n\nAs regards external factors, incidents occurring in other credit institutions are monitored based on external data, leading when necessary to adjustments to the stress scenarios used in the model.\n\nIn terms of type of operational risk, Amundi is mainly exposed to execution, delivery and process management risk and risk related to clients, products and business practices.\n\nFinally, concerning the large risk ratio, Amundi's biggest exposure was \u20ac462/uni00A0million at end of 2020, in compliance with the 25% threshold of total regulatory capital.\n\n- /uni25A0 finally, non-compliance with the leverage ratio buffer requirement will result in limitations on distributions and calculation of a maximum distributable amount (L-MMD).\n\nThe leverage ratio is the ratio of a bank's CET1 to its total exposures, i.e. total assets plus o/ff-balance sheet items after certain restatements for derivatives, intra-group transactions, financial securities transactions, items deducted from the numerator and o/ff-balance sheet items.\n\nSince 1/uni00A0January 2015, it has been mandatory to publish the leverage ratio at least once a year.\n\nAmundi's leverage ratio was 9.4% as of 31 December 2020, compared to 8.8% at the end of 2019.\n\n| In \u20ac/uni00A0millions   | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2019   |\n|------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Tier 1 capital         | 2,465        | 1,871        |\n| Leverage exposure      | 26,284       | 21,211       |\n| LEVERAGE RATIO         | 9.4%         | 8.8%         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

Economic capital is developed in accordance with the interpretation of the main regulatory standards:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Basel agreements;\n- /uni25A0 CRD 4 via its transposition into French regulations by the Order of 3/uni00A0November 2014;\n- /uni25A0 European Banking Authority guidelines;\n\nFor each of the risks recorded during the risk identification process, calculating economic capital requirements consists of:\n\n- /uni25A0 adjusting capital requirements calculated under Pillar 1 so that internal capital reflects the risks of each business activity from an economic standpoint;\n- /uni25A0 applying a quantile (probability of the occurrence of a default) at a defined level based on the Group's risk appetite in terms of external ratings;\n- /uni25A0 taking into account, in a prudent manner, the effects of diversification.\n\nIn addition to a quantitative aspect, Amundi's approach is also based on a qualitative aspect that completes the economic capital requirement measures.\n\n- /uni25A0 the prudential expectations relating to the ICAAP and the ILAAP.\n\n## 5.5 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS/RISK PROFILE\n\n|                                                                       | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCL.

This health crisis has become an economic crisis; this is reflected in the sharp drops and increased volatility on financial markets. As far as Amundi is concerned, the main financial impact comes from the sensitivity of the managed assets to this fall in the financial markets (equity, rates, etc.), with the resultant e/ffect on their valuation and on net asset management revenues; the fall in the financial markets also had a negative impact on the financial results.\n\nDespite this, Amundi has managed to cope in the face of adversity and continue the Company's normal operations thanks to the robustness of its IT platform, e/ffectiveness of its business continuity plans and the rapid roll-out of teleworking, which was implemented to protect employees' health and to maintain a high level of operational e/fficiency for clients.\n\nLastly, the financial impact of the crisis was reduced by the diversification of the Group's assets by segment/asset class/ geography, by the low cost-to-income ratio and an adjusted cost base.\n\nThe scale and duration of this crisis still remains di/fficult to predict.\n\n## Acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management\n\nAmundi acquired Sabadell Asset Management from Banco Sabadell on 30 June 2020.\n\nThe impact of this transaction, the definitive agreement for which was signed on 21 January 2020, is set out in detail in Note 9.3 (changes in scope).\n\n## Creation of a joint venture between Amundi and/uni00A0BOC/uni00A0Wealth Management\n\nOn 20/uni00A0December 2019, Amundi and BOC Wealth Management, a subsidiary of Bank of China, received approval from the\n\nChina Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to establish an asset management joint venture, a partnership that complements and accelerates Amundi's development strategy in China.\n\nThis joint venture, named Amundi BOC Wealth Management, has been fully consolidated since 1 October 2020, after administrative and regulatory authorisation was obtained.\n\n## Signature of a new partnership agreement between Amundi and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\n\nOn 30 July 2020, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Amundi announced in a press release the signature of a new five-year partnership agreement under which they will continue to develop their relationship in the investment solution distribution and Securities Services activities.\n\nThe outcome of this agreement is that Amundi will continue to operate as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale group's primary partner for the supply of savings and investment solutions for its retail banking and insurance networks.\n\nThis agreement took e/ffect in November 2020, i.e. on expiry of the previous agreement signed in 2009 and renewed in 2015 during the IPO of Amundi, and confirms Amundi's position as a reference partner in European Retail banking networks.\n\n## Capital increase reserved for Group employees\n\nOn 31 July 2020, a press release from the Amundi Group announced its intention to launch a capital increase for employees authorised in principle by the General Meeting of 16/uni00A0May 2019 for a maximum number of 1,000,000 shares.\n\nThe subscription period for this capital increase reserved for employees ended on 15 October 2020.\n\nNearly 1,350 employees from nine countries took part in this capital increase by subscribing to 422,648 new shares (or 0.2% of the share capital) for an aggregate amount of \u20ac18.6/uni00A0million.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, employees owned 0.6% of the share capital, compared to 0.5% previously.\n\nThis share issue brought the number of shares comprising Amundi share capital up to 202,585,953 shares.",

In fact, the lease term to be used to assess the right of use and the rent liability is determined in application of IFRS 16 within this enforceable period.\n\nAs soon as this final decision by IFRS IC was published, the Amundi Group set up a project to ensure compliance by the end of 31 December 2020.\n\nAmundi used a term corresponding to the earliest opportunity to terminate after five years has passed, as being the reasonably certain term of a lease. This term will be applied in the majority of cases when French commercial leases are initiated. The main exception to this will be a lease in which the Group has waived its interim three-year exit options (for example, in return for a reduction in rent); in this case, the term used will remain at nine years.\n\nThe application of this decision had no significant impact on the Group's equity.\n\n## Benchmark index reforms\n\nReforms to benchmark indices, often called 'LIBOR reforms', entered a new phase with the very gradual transition towards the use of risk-free interest rate indices (RFR: Risk Free Rates) in new contracts.\n\nAs it stands, the main benchmark indices used by the Amundi Group that are defined as critical by ESMA and which will be a/ffected by certain or potential transition, are the EONIA (which will be replaced on 3 January 2022), the EURIBOR and the WIBOR, the replacement of which is possible but is not expected to take place in the short term.\n\nThe Amundi Group has already started the transition from the EONIA to the \u20acSTR (transition no later than 3 January 2022) through the Benchmarks project. Furthermore, the EURIBOR, like any benchmark index, is likely to see its methodology change or be replaced in the long term. However, the scenario for replacing the EURIBOR in the short-term, according to a timetable that would be similar to that of the LIBOR transitions, is not envisaged at this stage.\n\nChanges published by the IASB in August 2020, which supplement those published in 2019, focus on the accounting consequences of replacing old benchmark interest rates with other benchmark rates following the reforms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

They allow entities not to derecognise or adjust the carrying amount of financial instruments to take into account the changes required by the reform, but rather to update the e/ffective interest rate to reflect the change in the alternative benchmark rate. As regards hedge accounting, entities will not have to discontinue their hedging relationships when they make the changes required by the reform.\n\nThe Group decided to apply these changes early as of 31 December 2020.\n\nFurthermore, as of 31 December 2020, the Amundi Group does not anticipate any significant impact on its financial accounts in connection with these reforms and therefore the transition phase currently in progress.\n\n## 1.1.2 Standards not yet adopted by the EU\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the Group has not applied the standards and interpretations published by the IASB and not yet adopted by the European Union. They will not become compulsory until the date set by the European Union and, therefore, the Group has not adopted these as of 31 December 2020.\n\n## 1.2 Presentation format of the financial statements\n\nAmundi presents its balance sheet in decreasing liquidity order. The assets and liabilities balance sheet is presented in notes/uni00A06.2.3. and 6.2.4.\n\nThe income statement is presented, by type, in note/uni00A06.2.1.\n\nThe main income statement aggregates are:\n\n- /uni25A0 net income, including net revenues from commissions and other customer activities (note/uni00A01.3.5) and net financial income;\n- /uni25A0 general operating expenses;\n- /uni25A0 cost of risk (note/uni00A01.3.12);\n- /uni25A0 the share of net income from equity-accounted entities;\n- /uni25A0 net gains or losses on other assets.\n\n## 1.3 Accounting methods and principles\n\n## 1.3.1 Use of assumptions and estimates for the/uni00A0preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the IFRS/uni00A0accounting standards implies that the Group carries out a number of estimates and retains certain assumptions it deems realistic and reasonable. The estimates relate to the identification of income and expenses and the valuation of assets and liabilities as well as the information in the notes/uni00A0to the financial statements.\n\nThe exercise assumes that Management applies its judgement based on the information available at the time the statements are prepared. Due to the uncertainties inherent in any valuation process, the Group revises its estimates based on information updated on a regular basis. It is therefore possible that the future results of the operations in question di/ffer from the estimates.\n\nFuture results can be impacted by a number of different factors, notably (but not exclusively):\n\n- /uni25A0 the economic and political environment in certain business sectors and countries;\n- /uni25A0 the risks associated with financial markets, including changes in the domestic and international markets as well as fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, equities and credit spreads. In line with the sensitivity of managed assets to any variation in financial markets (equity, rates, etc.), this may have an impact on the Amundi Group's net asset management revenues;\n- /uni25A0 changes in regulations and legislation;\n- /uni25A0 the risk of non-compliance with regulations and legislation.\n\nThe significant estimates made by the Group to prepare the financial statements relate primarily to:\n\n- /uni25A0 assessment of the recoverable amount of goodwill and other intangible assets (see Notes/uni00A01.4.6. and 5.13.),\n- /uni25A0 the fair value measurement of financial instruments (see notes/uni00A01.3.2. and 7),\n- /uni25A0 the valuation of provisions for guarantees granted to funds,\n- /uni25A0 the valuation of provisions for retirement commitments,\n- /uni25A0 the valuation of provisions for legal, tax, regulatory and non-compliance risks (please refer to Notes 1.3.2.10. and 5.14.).\n\nAll these assessments are carried out on the basis of the information available on the date of establishing the financial statements.\n\n## 1.3.2 Financial instruments\n\n## 1.3.2.1 Definitions\n\nIAS/uni00A032 defines a financial instrument as any contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument in another entity, i.e. any contract representing contractual rights or obligations to pay or receive cash or other financial assets.\n\nDerivatives are financial assets and liabilities that derive their value from an underlying, which require little or no initial investment and which are settled at a future date.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of IFRS/uni00A09 as adopted by the European Union.\n\nIFRS/uni00A09 sets new principles governing the classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of credit risk and hedge accounting, excluding macro-hedging transactions.\n\nPlease note, however, that Amundi has opted not to apply the general IFRS/uni00A09 hedging accounting model. Consequently, IAS/uni00A039 continues to be applied to all hedging relationships whilst awaiting future provisions for macro-hedging.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.2.2  Bases for measuring financial assets and/uni00A0liabilities\n\n## Initial measurement\n\nUpon initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are valued at fair value as defined by IFRS/uni00A013.\n\nFair value as defined by IFRS/uni00A013 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, on the primary or most advantageous market.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are valued based on their classification, either at their amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate (EIR) method for debt instruments, or at their fair value as specified by IFRS/uni00A013. Derivatives are always measured at fair value.\n\nAmortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured upon initial recognition, including the transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, less principal repayments, plus or minus accumulated amortisation, calculated using the e/ffective interest rate (EIR) method for any di/fference (discount or premium) between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a financial asset at amortised cost or at fair value through recyclable equity, the amount may be adjusted for impairment losses, if necessary.\n\n## 1.3.2.3  Financial assets\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nNon-derivative financial assets (debt or equity instruments) are classified in accounting categories in the financial statements that determine their accounting treatment and their subsequent measurement method. These financial assets are classified in one of the following three categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- /uni25A0 financial assets at fair value through equity (recyclable for debt instruments, non-recyclable for equity instruments).\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe classification and measurement of debt instruments depends on two criteria, the management model and the analysis of contractual characteristics (unless the fair value option is used).\n\n## The three management models\n\nThe management model is representative of the financial asset management strategy followed by Amundi's management in order to meet its objectives. The management model is specified for an asset portfolio and does not constitute an intention, on a case-by-case basis, for an isolated financial asset.\n\nThere are three separate management models:\n\n- /uni25A0 the 'hold to collect' model which aims to collect contractual cash flows over the life of the assets; this model does not necessarily mean that all assets are held to contractual maturity, but asset sales are strictly controlled;\n- /uni25A0 the 'hold to collect and sell' model which aims to collect cash flows over the life of the asset and to dispose of assets; under this model, the sale of financial assets and the receipt of cash are both essential; and\n- /uni25A0 the other/sale model whose primary objective is asset disposal.\n- This model mainly relates to portfolios that aim to collect cash flows via disposals, portfolios whose performance is measured on the basis of fair value and portfolios of financial assets held for trading.\n- When the strategy pursued by the Management for managing financial assets does not match either the 'holdto-collect' model or the 'hold-to-collect-and-sell' model, these financial assets are classified in an other/sale portfolio model.\n\n## Contractual characteristics ('solely payments of/uni00A0principal & interests' or 'SPPI' test)\n\nThe 'SPPI' test combines a series of criteria, examined on a cumulative basis, that make it possible to establish whether the contractual cash flows have the characteristics of a simple financing arrangement (payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding).\n\nThe test is fulfilled when the financing arrangement gives rise solely to payments of principal and where the payment of interest received reflects the time value of money, the credit risk associated with the instrument, the other costs and risks of a traditional loan agreement as well as a reasonable margin, whether the interest rate is fixed or variable.\n\nUnder a simple financing arrangement, the interest represents the cost of time elapsing, the price of credit and liquidity risk over the period and other components related to the asset's carrying cost (e.g. administrative costs, etc.).\n\nIn some cases, this qualitative analysis is not conclusive and quantitative analysis (or Benchmark Test) is carried out. This additional analysis consists of comparing contractual cash flows for the asset under consideration and cash flows for a benchmark asset.\n\nIf the di/fference between the financial asset's cash flows and those of the benchmark asset is deemed to be immaterial, the asset is deemed to be a simple financing arrangement.\n\nIn addition, a specific analysis will be conducted if the financial asset was issued by special purpose entities establishing an order of payment priority between financial asset holders by bundling multiple instruments together under contract and creating credit risk concentrations ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is given a level of subordination which specifies the order of distribution of the cash flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn this event, the SPPI test requires an analysis of the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset in question and of underlying assets according to the 'look-through' approach and of the credit risk carried by the subscribed tranches compared with the credit risk for the underlying assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

These securities are recorded on the trading date.\n\nThe initial fair value includes transaction costs.\n\nOn subsequent measurements, changes in fair value are recognised in non-recyclable equity. In the event of disposal, these changes are not recycled through profit or loss, the gain or loss on the disposal is recognised in equity.\n\nOnly dividends are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or group of financial assets) is fully or partially derecognised if:\n\n- /uni25A0 the contractual rights to the related cash flows expire;\n- /uni25A0 or are transferred or deemed to have expired or been transferred because they belong de facto to one or more beneficiaries and if almost all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn this case, any rights or obligations created or retained at the time of transfer are recognised separately as assets and liabilities.\n\nIf the contractual rights to the cash flows are transferred, but only some of the risks and rewards of ownership as well as control are retained, the entity will continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its involvement in the asset.\n\nFinancial assets renegotiated for commercial reasons in the absence of financial difficulties by the counterparty and with the aim of building or retaining a business relationship are derecognised on the renegotiation date. New loans to clients are recorded on that date at their fair value on the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition is dependent on the management model and the SPPI test.\n\n## 1.3.2.4  Financial liabilities\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\nBalance sheet financial liabilities are classified in these two accounting categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, either by type or designated as an option;\n- /uni25A0 financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss by type\n\nFinancial instruments issued primarily with a view to short-term buy-back, instruments forming part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments which are managed as a unit and which show signs of having a recent short-term profit-taking profile, and derivatives (apart from some hedging derivatives) are measured at fair value by type.\n\nChanges in the fair value of this portfolio are recognised through the income statement.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as an option\n\nFinancial liabilities meeting one of the three cases provided by the standard may optionally be valued at fair value through profit or loss: hybrid issues including one or more separable embedded derivatives, lessening or elimination of the distortion of the accounting treatment, or groups of managed financial liabilities whose performance is measured at fair value.\n\nThis option is irrevocable and is applied, on a mandatory basis, on the date of the instrument's initial recognition.\n\nOn the occasion of subsequent measurements, these financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss for changes in fair value unrelated to own credit risk and in nonrecyclable equity for changes in value linked to own credit risk unless this makes the accounting mismatch worse.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nAny other liabilities meeting the definition of a financial liability (apart from derivatives) are measured at amortised cost.\n\nThese liabilities are initially recorded at fair value (including transaction income and costs) and subsequently at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method.\n\n## Reclassification of financial liabilities\n\nThe initial classification of financial liabilities is irrevocable. No subsequent reclassification is authorised.\n\n## Distinction between liabilities and equity\n\nThe distinction between debt instruments and equity instruments is based on an analysis of the economic substance of contractual arrangements.\n\nA financial liability is a debt instrument if it includes a contractual obligation:\n\n- /uni25A0 to return cash, other financial assets or a variable number of equity instruments to another entity; or\n- /uni25A0 to exchange financial assets and liabilities with another entity under potentially unfavourable conditions.\n\nAn equity instrument is a non-repayable financial instrument that provides a discretionary return which highlights a residual interest in a company after deduction of all financial liabilities (net assets) and which is not qualified as a debt instrument.\n\n## Buy-back of treasury shares\n\nThe treasury shares purchased by Amundi, including shares held for hedging the performance share allocation plans, do not fall within the definition of a financial asset and are recognised as a deduction from the equity. They do not have any impact on the income statement.\n\n## Derecognition and modification of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised in full or in part:\n\n- /uni25A0 when it is extinguished; or\n- /uni25A0 when quantitative or qualitative analyses conclude that it has undergone a substantial change following restructuring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Any di/fference between the carrying amount of the liability that has been extinguished and the new liability will be recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\nIf the financial liability has not been derecognised, the original effective interest rate continues. A discount/premium is immediately recognised through profit or loss on the date of the modification and is then apportioned at the original e/ffective interest rate over the remaining life of the instrument.\n\n## 1.3.2.5  Provisions for credit risk\n\n## Scope of application\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A09, Amundi recognises impairments under Expected Credit Losses or ECL for outstanding assets on the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 financial assets that are debt instruments recognised at amortised cost or at fair value in recyclable equity (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n- /uni25A0 guarantee commitments covered by IFRS/uni00A09 and which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n\nEquity instruments (at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value in non-recyclable OCI) are not a/ffected by impairment provisions.\n\nCounterparty risk is calculated for derivatives and other instruments at fair value through profit or loss which is not pursuant to the ECL model.\n\n## Credit risk and provisioning stages\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of losses associated with the default of a counterparty leading to its inability to meet its commitments to the Group.\n\nThe credit risk provisioning process distinguishes between three di/fferent stages (Buckets):\n\n- /uni25A0 stage 1 (Bucket/uni00A01): from the initial recognition of the financial instrument (credit, debt security, guarantee, etc.), the entity recognises 12-month expected credit losses;\n- /uni25A0 stage 2 (Bucket/uni00A02): if the credit quality deteriorates significantly for a given transaction or portfolio, the entity recognises the expected losses to maturity (ECL to maturity);\n- /uni25A0 stage 3 (Bucket/uni00A03): when one or more default events occur in respect of the transaction or the counterparty and have a damaging e/ffect on estimated future cash flows, the entity recognises objective evidence of impairment. Subsequently, if the conditions for classifying financial instruments in Bucket/uni00A03 are not met, the financial instruments are reclassified in Bucket/uni00A02, then in Bucket/uni00A01, depending on the subsequent improvement in credit risk quality.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe definition of default for the requirements of provisioning for ECLs is identical to that used in management and for calculating regulatory ratios. A debtor is thus considered to be in default when at least one of the following two conditions has been met:\n\n- /uni25A0 significant payment arrears generally in excess of 90 days unless special circumstances show that the arrears are due to reasons unrelated to the debtor's situation;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /uni25A0 the entity deems it unlikely that the debtor will settle its credit obligations in full without recourse to measures such as the provision of surety.\n\nAn outstanding asset in default (Bucket/uni00A03) is said to be impaired when one or more events have occurred that have a harmful effect on this financial asset's estimated future cash flows. Signs/uni00A0of a financial asset's impairment include observable data on the following events:\n\n- /uni25A0 major financial di/fficulties experienced by the issuer or the borrower;\n- /uni25A0 a breach of contract, such as failed or late payment;\n- /uni25A0 the granting of one or more favours by one or more lenders to the borrower for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulties that the lender or lenders would not have envisaged under other circumstances;\n- /uni25A0 the increasing probability of the failure or financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- /uni25A0 the disappearance of an active market for the financial asset due to financial di/fficulties;\n- /uni25A0 the purchase or creation of a financial asset with a big discount, which reflects the credit losses su/ffered.\n\nIt is not necessarily possible to single out a particular event since the impairment of the financial asset may be the result of the combined e/ffect of several events.\n\n## The concept of expected credit loss (ECL)\n\nECL is defined as the probability-weighted estimate of discounted credit loss (principal and interest). It is the actual value of the di/fference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows (principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach aims to allow expected credit losses to be recognised as early as possible.\n\n## Governance and measurement of ECLs\n\nGovernance of the system used to measure IFRS/uni00A09 parameters is based on the organisation put in place under the Basel framework. The Group's Risk Management Department is responsible for defining the methodological framework and oversight of the system of asset provisioning.\n\nThe Group prioritises the internal rating system and current Basel processes when generating the IFRS/uni00A09 parameters needed to calculate ECLs. Assessment of the change in credit risk is based on an expected loss model and extrapolation based on reasonable scenarios. All available, relevant, reasonable and supportable information must be used, including forward-looking information.\n\nThe calculation formula incorporates the parameters of probability of default, loss in the event of default and exposure at the time of default.\n\nThese calculations are based on internal models applied within a regulatory framework where this exists, but with restatements to determine an economic ECL. IFRS/uni00A09 recommends a Point in Time analysis while taking account of historic loss data and Forward-looking macroeconomic data, whilst the prudential viewpoint is analysed Through The Cycle for the probability",

The estimated cash flow shortfalls expected from a secured financial instrument reflects the amount and the timing for recovering the collateral. In accordance with IFRS/uni00A09, the recognition of guarantees and collateral does not a/ffect the assessment of the significant deterioration in credit risk: this is based on changes in credit risk on the debtor without taking into account guarantees.\n\nThe models and parameters used are back-tested at least once a year.\n\n## Significant deterioration in credit risk\n\nOn each reporting date, all Group entities must assess the deterioration of the credit risk for each financial instrument since its initial recognition. This assessment of the change in credit risk leads entities to categorise their transactions by risk rating (Buckets).\n\nTo assess significant deterioration, the Group operates a process based on two levels of analysis:\n\n- /uni25A0 an initial level depending on Group rules and relative and absolute criteria imposed on Group entities;\n- /uni25A0 a second level relating to the assessment, certified by an expert for local Forward Looking data, of the risk carried by each entity on its portfolios that may lead the Group to adjust its criteria for downgrading to Bucket/uni00A02 (portfolio or sub-portfolio switching to ECL at maturity).\n\nAll financial instruments, save for some exceptions, are monitored for significant deterioration. No contagion is required to switch financial instruments from the same counterparty from Bucket/uni00A01 to Bucket/uni00A02. Monitoring significant deterioration must take account of changes to the main debtor's credit risk, without taking account of the warranty.\n\nFor outstanding assets comprising small loans and receivables with similar characteristics, the counterparty-by-counterparty review may be replaced by a statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, it is necessary to recover the initial internal rating and PD (probability of default).\n\nThe date of origination is understood to be the trading date, when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. For financing and guarantee commitments, the date of origination is understood to be the irrevocable commitment date.\n\nFor outstanding assets (other than securities) for which internal rating systems have been constructed (in particular, exposures monitored using authorised methods), the Amundi Group considers that all the information incorporated in such rating systems allows for a more relevant assessment than the sole criterion of payments more than 30 days past due.\n\nIf the deterioration since the date of origination ceases to be recorded, the impairment may return to 12-month expected credit losses (Bucket/uni00A01).\n\nTo compensate for the fact that some factors or signs of significant deterioration cannot be identified at the level of an individual financial instrument, the standard authorises the assessment of significant deterioration for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of financial instruments.\n\nThe construction of portfolios to assess deterioration on a collective basis may result in common characteristics such as:\n\n- /uni25A0 the type of instrument;\n- /uni25A0 the credit risk rating (including the internal Basel II rating for entities with an internal rating system);\n- /uni25A0 the type of collateral;\n- /uni25A0 the initial recognition date;\n- /uni25A0 the remaining term to maturity;\n- /uni25A0 the value of collateral relative to the financial asset, if it has an impact on the probability of a default occurring (for example, non-recourse loans in some jurisdictions or loan-to-value ratios).\n\nGroupings of financial instruments for the purpose of assessing changes in credit risk on a collective basis may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nFor securities, Amundi uses an approach that consists of applying an absolute level of credit risk in accordance with IFRS/uni00A09, beyond which exposures are classified in Bucket/uni00A02 and provisioned on the basis of ECL at maturity.\n\nThe following rules will apply for monitoring the significant deterioration of securities:\n\n- /uni25A0 securities ranked as 'Investment Grade' securities on the reporting date, will be classified in Bucket/uni00A01 and provisioned on the basis of a 12-month ECL;\n- /uni25A0 securities ranked as 'Non-Investment Grade' (NIG) securities, on the reporting date, must be monitored for significant deterioration, since the date of origination, and be classified in Bucket/uni00A02 (ECL at maturity) in the event of a significant deterioration in credit risk.\n\nRelative deterioration must be assessed upstream of the occurrence of a proven default (Bucket/uni00A03).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Prior to any write-o/ffs, Bucket/uni00A03 provisioning must be made (apart from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss).\n\nFor loans at amortised cost or at fair value in recyclable equity, the amount written o/ff is recorded under cost of risk for the principal and under net financial income for the interest.\n\n## 1.3.2.6  Financial derivatives\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nDerivatives are financial assets or liabilities classified, by default, as derivative instruments held for trading, unless they can be classified as derivative hedging instruments.\n\nThey are recorded in the balance sheet at their initial fair value on the trading date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nOn every reporting date, any change in the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- /uni25A0 in profit or loss for derivatives held-for-trading or as fair value hedges;\n- /uni25A0 in equity if these are derivatives used to hedge cash flows or a net investment in a foreign operation, for the e/ffective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\n## General framework\n\nIn accordance with the Group's decision, Amundi does not apply the 'Hedge accounting' section/uni00A0of IFRS/uni00A09 in line with the option given by the standard. All hedging relationships will continue to be documented in accordance with IAS/uni00A039 rules until, at the latest, the macro-hedging text is adopted by the European Union. The eligibility of financial instruments for hedge accounting under IAS/uni00A039 takes into consideration IFRS/uni00A09 principles governing the classification and measurement of financial instruments.\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A09, and in consideration of IAS/uni00A039 hedging principles, debt instruments at amortised cost and at fair value in recyclable equity are eligible for fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\n## Documentation\n\nHedging relationships must comply with the following principles:\n\n- /uni25A0 the aim of fair value hedges is to protect against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or a liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, due to the risk(s) hedged and which may a/ffect the profit or loss (for example, hedging of all or some changes in fair value due to interest rate risk on a fixed-rate debt);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /uni25A0 cash flow hedging is intended to provide protection from exposure to future changes in cash flows from a recognised asset or liability or a transaction that is considered to be highly likely, attributable to the risk(s) hedged and which could (in the case of a forecast transaction that has not yet been performed) a/ffect the profit or loss (for example, hedging of changes in all or some future interest payments on a floating-rate debt);\n- /uni25A0 hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation is intended to provide protection from the risk of an adverse movement in fair value arising from the foreign exchange risks associated with a foreign investment in a currency other than the euro which is Amundi's reporting currency.\n\nHedges must also meet the following criteria in order to be eligible for hedge accounting:\n\n- /uni25A0 the eligibility of the hedging instrument and the hedged instrument;\n- /uni25A0 there must be formal documentation from inception, including the individual identification and characteristics of the hedged item and of the hedging instrument, the nature of the hedging relationship and the type of risk hedged;\n- /uni25A0 the e/ffectiveness of the hedge must be demonstrated at inception and, retrospectively, by testing at each reporting date.\n\nFor interest rate hedges for financial asset or liability portfolios, the Amundi Group favours documentation of fair value hedging as permitted under IAS/uni00A039 adopted by the European Union (carve out version). In particular:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group documents these hedging relationships on the basis of the gross position of derivatives and hedged items;\n- /uni25A0 the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evidenced by means of timelines.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe change in value of the derivative at its fair value is recognised as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 fair value hedge: the change in value of the derivative is recognised in profit or loss symmetrically with the change in value of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk. Only the net amount of any ine/ffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 cash flow hedge: the change in value of the derivative is recognised in the balance sheet as a counterparty to a specific account in gains and losses recognised directly in recyclable equity for the effective portion, and any ine/ffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss. Any profits or losses on the derivative accrued through equity are then recycled in profit or loss when the hedged cash flows occur;\n- /uni25A0 hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation: the change in value of the derivative is recognised in the balance sheet as a counterparty to the translation difference in recyclable equity and any ine/ffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "When the conditions for benefiting from hedge accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively:\n\n- /uni25A0 fair value hedge: only the hedging instrument continues to be revalued as a counterparty to profit or loss. The hedged item is wholly recognised according to its classification. For debt instruments at fair value through recyclable equity, changes in fair value subsequent to the end of the hedging relationship are recorded, in full, in equity. For hedged items valued at amortised cost which were interest rate hedges, the revaluation surplus is amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n- /uni25A0 cash flow hedge: the hedging instrument is valued at fair value through profit or loss. The amounts accumulated in equity under the effective portion of the hedge remain in equity until the hedged element a/ffects profit or loss. For interest rate hedged items, net income is allocated according to the payment of interest. The revaluation surplus is therefore amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n- /uni25A0 hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation: the amounts accumulated in equity in respect of the e/ffective portion of the hedging remain in equity while the net investment is held. The income is recorded once the net investment in the foreign operation exits the scope of consolidation.\n\n## 1.3.2.7  Determining the fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is determined by maximising the use of observable input data. It is presented using the hierarchy defined by IFRS/uni00A013.\n\nIFRS/uni00A013 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, on the primary market or on the most advantageous market.\n\nFair value applies individually to each financial asset and financial liability. It can, exceptionally, be estimated by portfolio if the management and risk monitoring strategy allow and if appropriately documented. Accordingly, certain fair value parameters are calculated on a net basis when a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to market or credit risks. This is the case for the CVA calculation (Credit Valuation Adjustment) and the DVA calculation (Debit Valuation Adjustment).\n\nAmundi believes that quoted prices published in an active market are the best evidence of fair value.\n\nWhen such quoted prices are not available, fair value is established by using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable data and minimise the use of unobservable data.\n\n## Fair value of structured issues\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A013, Amundi values its structured issues by integrating the issue spread of the guarantor.\n\n## Counterparty risk on derivative instruments\n\nIn application of IFRS/uni00A013, Amundi incorporates into fair value the assessment of counterparty risk for derivative assets\n\n(Credit Valuation Adjustment - CVA) and, using a symmetrical treatment, the non-performance risk for derivative liabilities (Debit Valuation Adjustment - DVA or own credit risk).\n\nCVA makes it possible to determine expected counterparty losses from Amundi's perspective. DVA makes it possible to determine expected losses on Amundi from the counterparty's perspective.\n\nFor derivatives carried out with market counterparties, the CVA/DVA calculation is based on an estimate of expected losses given the probability of default and loss in the event of default. The methodology used maximises the use of observable market data. It is primarily based on market parameters such as registered and listed CDS (Credit Default Swaps) or Single Name CDS, or Index CDS in the absence of named counterparty CDS. Under certain circumstances, historical default parameters may also be used.\n\nNo CVA/DVA is calculated either for derivatives contracted by Amundi or for funds, taking into account that there is no historical default data and the guarantee provided by Amundi to the funds.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe standard classifies fair value into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques:\n\n## Level 1: fair value corresponding to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets\n\nLevel 1 is composed of financial instruments that are directly quoted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. These are stocks and bonds quoted in active markets (such as the Paris Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, etc.) and shares in investment funds listed on an active market and derivatives traded on an organised market, in particular futures.\n\nA market is deemed to be active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, broker, dealer, pricing service or regulatory agency, and the prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions under normal competitive conditions.\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities with o/ffsetting market risks, Amundi uses mid-prices as the basis for establishing the fair value of the positions. The current bid price is applied to assets held or liabilities to be issued (open long position) and the current asking price to assets to be acquired or liabilities held (open short position).\n\n## Level 2: fair value measured using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than those in Level 1\n\nThis data is directly observable (i.e. prices) or indirectly observable (data derived from prices) and generally meet the following criteria: this is data not specific to the entity, which is publicly available/accessible and based on a market consensus.\n\n## Level 2 consists of:\n\n- /uni25A0 stocks and bonds listed on an inactive market or unlisted on an active market, but for which fair value is established using a valuation methodology habitually used by market participants (such as the method of discounting future cash flows or the Black & Scholes method) and based on observable market data;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

For example, the fair value of interest rate swaps is generally derived from the yield curves of interest rates based on market interest rates observed on the reporting date.\n\nWhen the models used are consistent with standard models and on observable market parameters (such as yield curves or implied volatility ranges), the initial margin generated on the instruments valued in this way is recognised in profit or loss from inception.\n\n## Level 3: fair value for which a significant number of the parameters used for determination are not based on observable criteria\n\nIn the case of some complex instruments which are not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques that use assumptions not supported by data observable on the market for an identical instrument. These instruments are presented in Level 3.\n\nThese are mainly complex rate products, equity derivatives and structured credit products whose valuation requires, for example, correlation or volatility parameters that cannot be directly compared to market data.\n\nThe initial transaction price is deemed to reflect the market value and recognition of the initial margin is deferred.\n\nThe margin generated on these structured financial instruments is generally recognised in profit or loss spread over the period during which the parameters are deemed to be unobservable. When the market data becomes observable, the margin remaining to be spread is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe valuation methodologies and models used to value the financial instruments presented in Levels 2 and 3 incorporate all of the factors that market players use to calculate prices. They must first be validated by an independent audit. Determination of the fair value of these instruments takes into account both the liquidity risk and the counterparty risk.\n\n## 1.3.2.8  O/ffsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A032, Amundi o/ffsets a financial asset and a financial liability and reports the net balance if, and only if it has a legally enforceable right to o/ffset the amounts reported and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nThe effect of this offsetting is presented in table 5.4. concerning the amendment to IFRS/uni00A07 on disclosures regarding the o/ffsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.3.2.9  Net gains or losses on financial instruments\n\n## Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFor financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, this heading includes the following income statement items:\n\n- /uni25A0 dividends and other revenue from shares and other variable-income securities classified under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 changes in fair value of financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 gains and losses on disposal of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 changes in fair value and gains and losses on disposal or termination of derivatives not included in a fair value hedging relationship or cash flow hedge.\n\nThis heading also includes the ine/ffective portion of hedging transactions.\n\n## Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through equity\n\nFor financial assets at fair value through equity, this heading includes the following income statement items:\n\n- /uni25A0 dividends from equity instruments classified as financial assets at fair value in non-recyclable equity;\n- /uni25A0 gains and losses on disposals as well as net income associated with the termination of the hedging relationship on debt instruments classified as financial assets at fair value in recyclable equity;\n- /uni25A0 net income on disposals or termination of fair value hedging instruments for financial assets at fair value through equity where the item being hedged is sold.\n\n## 1.3.2.10 Financial guarantees given\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value, then subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- /uni25A0 the amount of impairment losses determined under the provisions of IFRS/uni00A09, section/uni00A0on 'Impairment'; or\n- /uni25A0 the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative revenue recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS/uni00A015 'Revenue from contracts with customers'.\n\nFor Amundi, the financial guarantees given are funds where capital or performance is guaranteed.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.3 Provisions\n\nAmundi identifies all (legal or constructive) obligations resulting from a past event for which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations, and for which the due date or amount of the settlement are uncertain, but can be reliably estimated. If required, the estimates are discounted when the e/ffect is significant.\n\nThis obligation can be legal, regulatory or contractual. It can also result from the Group's practices or from commitments that created a legitimate expectation on the part of third parties involved that the Group will assume certain liabilities.\n\nIf no reliable evaluation of the amount can be made, no provisions are recognised, but information is provided in the appendix, where appropriate.\n\nThe Group creates provisions for these obligations which cover:\n\n- /uni25A0 risks related to guarantees granted to funds;\n- /uni25A0 operational risks;\n- /uni25A0 employee benefits, including retirement commitments;\n- /uni25A0 disputes;\n- /uni25A0 legal, tax (excluding income tax), regulatory and noncompliance risks.\n\n## 1.3.4 Employee benefits\n\nThese are grouped into four categories in accordance with IAS/uni00A019 'Employee benefits':\n\n- /uni25A0 short-term benefits such as salaries, social security contributions, annual holidays, incentives, profit sharing and bonuses are those which are expected to be paid within 12 months following the financial year during which the services were rendered;\n- /uni25A0 long-term benefits (long-service awards, bonuses and compensation payable 12 months or more after the close of the financial year);\n- /uni25A0 severance pay;\n- /uni25A0 post-employment benefits, falling into one of two categories described below: defined-benefit plans and defined-contribution plans.\n\n## 1.3.4.1 Retirement plan - defined-contribution plans\n\nThere are several compulsory retirement plans to which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not have sufficient assets to cover all benefits corresponding to services rendered by the employees during the financial year and during prior years. Consequently, Amundi Group entities have no liabilities in this respect other than their contributions to be paid for the year ended.\n\n## 1.3.4.2  Defined-benefits plans\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A019, the commitments are assessed based on a set of actuarial, financial and demographic assumptions and using the Projected Unit Credit method. This method consists of allocating an expense corresponding to the rights vested over the period for each financial year of employment. The expense is calculated based on the future, discounted benefit.\n\nThe calculations for expenses for future social benefits are made on the basis of assumptions for discount rates, employee turnover and changes in wages and social security contributions developed by Management.\n\nThe discount rates are determined based on the average period of commitment, that is, the weighted average of the payment dates of future benefits. The underlying index used is the iBoxx AA Index.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 19, Amundi allocates all actuarial di/fferences recorded in gains and losses recognised directly in non-recyclable equity. Actuarial differences consist of adjustments related to experience (difference between estimated and actual experience) and the e/ffect of changes made to the actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe expected return of plan assets is determined on the basis of the discount rates used to evaluate the defined benefits obligation. The di/fference between the expected return and the actual return of plan assets is recorded in gains and losses recognised directly in non-recyclable equity.\n\nThe provision amount is equal to:\n\n- /uni25A0 the current value of the commitment for the defined benefits on the closing date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by IAS/uni00A019;\n- /uni25A0 less, if appropriate, the fair value of assets allocated to hedging the commitments. They can be represented by an eligible insurance policy. In the event that the obligation is fully hedged by a policy which exactly covers, in both amount and time, all or part of the benefits payable by virtue of the plan, the fair value of the latter is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation (i.e. the amount of the corresponding actuarial debt).\n\nAmundi has taken out an 'IFC' insurance policy (end-of-career allowance) with an insurance company in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nA provision to cover the retirement benefits is included in balance sheet liabilities in the 'Provisions' item for commitments which are not covered.\n\n## 1.3.4.3  Long-term benefits\n\nLong-term benefits are benefits which are paid to employees other than post-employment benefits, severance payments and equity-based compensation, but which are not due in full during the 12 months following the end of the financial year in which the corresponding services were rendered. They include, among other things, bonuses and other deferred compensation paid 12 months or more after the end of the financial year in which they were earned, but which are not indexed to shares.\n\nThe valuation method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment benefits in the defined-benefits category.\n\nThe long-term benefits which can be granted by Amundi consist primarily of the allocation of bonuses whose payment will be deferred to future financial years subject to meeting certain performance conditions set in advance and continued employment at the time of payment to the employees to whom they were granted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

As such, its business is subject to regular monitoring and investigation by various regulators. These inspections may reveal certain irregularities and may, in some instances, result in fines or other penalties. Following an investigation conducted from 2017 to 2019, the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers - AMF) notified grievances to Amundi on 12 June 2020. The grievances relate to the management of certain transactions carried out by two Amundi employees between 2014 and 2015. These transactions impacted assets managed on behalf of an institutional client, who was compensated. Various measures have been taken since then to ensure that such dysfunctions do not recur. The case has been referred to a Rapporteur, who will present his findings to the Enforcement Committee after having examined the matter. Amundi is fully cooperating in this procedure. To date, no sanction has been imposed on Amundi.\n\n## 1.3.6 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS/uni00A015)\n\nMost of the Group's revenue comes from third-party asset management in collective or individual portfolios (dedicated funds or mandates). It is essentially based on the assets under management in managed funds.\n\nThe net fees comprise net management fees which are equal to the gross management fees received after deduction of fees paid:\n\n- /uni25A0 The gross management fees compensate the portfolio management services. They are primarily calculated by reference to a percentage of the outstanding amounts managed;\n- /uni25A0 The fees paid are composed of:\n- i.  contractual retrocessions paid to distributors. These generally correspond to a percentage of the management fees,\n- ii.  custodian and valuation agent fees, where these are paid by the asset management company, as well as a limited number of associated administrative costs such as the ETF listing fees.\n\nNet fees are also composed of:\n\n- /uni25A0 fees paid to Amundi for the guarantee given to guaranteed funds or structured EMTNs. Various costs connected to the formation and the life of structured products are added to these fees;\n- /uni25A0 transfer fees paid by the fund in respect of the execution of sales and purchases of securities on behalf of funds by the Amundi trading desk;\n- /uni25A0 other fees for lower amounts, such as: entry fees, compensation for consulting services, borrowing and lending securities fees, account maintenance fees for Employee Savings Plans.\n\nPerformance fees are paid to the asset management company as provided by the contractual provisions. They are calculated on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the actual performance and the benchmark index as provided by the contract.\n\nIncome and expenses for fees are recorded in profit or loss according to the nature of the services they represent. Their recognition on the income statement must reflect the rate at which control of the goods or services sold is transferred to the customer:\n\nNet income from a transaction associated with a service provision is recognised under Fees upon transfer of control of the service provided to the customer, if this can be reliably estimated. Said transfer may be made as the service is rendered (ongoing service) or on a given date (one-o/ff service).\n\n- i. Fees remunerating ongoing services (management fees, for example) are recorded in profit or loss according to the stage of completion of the service provided.\n- ii. Fees received or paid for one-o/ff services are recorded, in full, in profit or loss when the service is provided.\n\nThe fees payable or receivable contingent upon meeting a performance target are recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- i. the amount of fees and commissions can be estimated reliably;\n- ii. it is likely that the future economic benefits resulting from the services rendered will flow to the Company;\n- iii. the stage of completion of the service can be reliably estimated, and the costs incurred for the service and the costs to complete it can be reliably estimated.\n\nThese performance fees are, therefore, recognised in the majority of cases in profit or loss at the end of the calculation period.\n\n## 1.3.7 Share-based payments (IFRS/uni00A02)\n\nIFRS/uni00A02 'Share-based payments' requires valuation of the transactions remunerated by payment in stock and similar instruments in the profit or loss and balance sheet of the Company. The standard is applicable to transactions carried out for employees, and specifically:\n\n- /uni25A0 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in equity instruments;\n- /uni25A0 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in cash.\n\nTwo plans in the Amundi Group are covered by IFRS/uni00A02:\n\n- /uni25A0 share-based payment plans initiated by the Amundi Group of the type where settlement is made by awarding equity instruments (allocating performance shares).\n- Share awards are measured at fair value at the time of the award. They are recognised in expenses under 'Employee expenses' o/ffsetting an equity account over the acquisition period of the rights.\n- When the award takes place after the services have been delivered, Amundi carries out a valuation of the services provided by the beneficiaries. The expense is recognised over the period during which these services were provided.\n- /uni25A0 Amundi and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share subscriptions are made available to employees as part of the Company Savings Scheme. They are also covered by the provisions of IFRS/uni00A02. The shares are o/ffered with a maximum discount of 30%. The plans have no vesting period, but include a five-year lock-up period. The benefit granted to employees is measured as the di/fference between the fair value of the vested shares taking into account the lock-up condition and the acquisition price paid by the employee on the subscription date multiplied by the number of shares subscribed.\n\nThe expense for the share allocation plan settled by Amundi and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. equity instruments is recognised as personnel expenses o/ffsetting an increase in 'Consolidated reserves - Group share'.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.8 Current and deferred tax assets\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A012, the income tax expense includes all income-related taxes, whether current or deferred.\n\n## Tax liability\n\nThe standard defines current tax liability as 'the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) with respect to the taxable profit (tax loss) for a financial year'. The taxable income is the profit (or loss) for a given financial year measured according to the rules set by the taxation authorities. The applicable rates and rules used to determine the current tax liability are those in e/ffect in each country in which the Group's companies are established.\n\nA tax consolidation group was set up for the French entities (from 1 January 2010) with Amundi as the head of the group.\n\nThe current tax liability includes all taxes on income, payable or recoverable, for which payment is not subordinated to the completion of future transactions, even if payment is spread over several financial years. The current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until it is paid. If the amount that has already been paid for the current year and previous financial years exceeds the amount due for these years, the surplus must be recognised under assets.\n\nMoreover, certain transactions carried out by the entity may have tax consequences that are not taken into account in measuring the current tax liability. IAS/uni00A012 defines di/fferences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base as temporary di/fferences.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nThe standard requires that deferred taxes be recognised in the following cases:\n\nA deferred tax liability must be recognised for all taxable temporary di/fferences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base, unless the deferred tax liability arises from:\n\n- /uni25A0 initial recognition of goodwill;\n- /uni25A0 initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that does not a/ffect either the accounting or the taxable profit (taxable loss) on the transaction date.\n\nA deferred tax asset must be recognised for all deductible temporary di/fferences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base, insofar as it is deemed likely that a future taxable profit will be available against which such deductible temporary di/fferences can be allocated.\n\nA deferred tax asset must also be recognised for carrying forward unused tax losses and tax credits insofar as it is probable that the Group will have access to future taxable profits against which the unused tax losses and tax credits can be allocated.\n\nThe tax rates applicable in each country are used as appropriate.\n\nDeferred taxes are not discounted in accordance with IAS/uni00A012.\n\nTaxable unrealised gains on securities (FCP - mutual funds in France) do not generate any taxable temporary di/fferences between the carrying amount of the asset and the tax base. As a result, deferred tax is not recognised on these gains.\n\nIn France, capital gains on the sale of equity investments, as defined by the French General Tax Code and coming under long-term taxation treatment, are exempt from corporation tax (except for a 12% share of capital gains taxed at the normally applicable rate). Accordingly, unrealised gains recognised at the end of the financial year generate a temporary di/fference requiring the recognition of deferred tax on this share, in so far as Amundi considers the disposal of the securities likely.\n\nAs part of IFRS/uni00A016 'Leases', a deferred tax liability is recognised on the right of use and a deferred tax asset on the lease liability for leases for which the Group is lessee.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in net income for the year, unless the tax arises from:\n\n- /uni25A0 either a transaction or event recognised directly in equity, during the same year or during another financial year, in which case it is directly debited or credited to equity;\n- /uni25A0 or by a business combination.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities o/ffset each other if, and only if:\n\n- /uni25A0 the entity has a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax assets and liabilities;\n- /uni25A0 and the deferred tax assets and liabilities concern income tax assessed by the same tax authority:\n- i.  either for the same taxable entity,\n- ii.  or for di/fferent taxable entities that intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to settle their tax assets and liabilities at the same time during each future financial year in which it is expected that substantial deferred tax assets or liabilities will be paid or recovered.\n\nTax risks relating to income tax resulting in the recognition of a receivable or a current tax liability when it is deemed to be more likely than unlikely that the assets will be received or the liabilities paid. These risks are also taken into account when assessing current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over income tax treatments applies as soon as an entity has identified one or more uncertainties over income tax treatments undertaken with regard to its taxes. It also provides details of their estimates:\n\n- /uni25A0 the analysis must be based on the risk of an identification made solely by the tax administration;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The corresponding tax charge continues to be recognised under the 'Income tax' heading in the income statement.\n\n## 1.3.9 Property, plant and equipment\n\nAmundi applies component accounting to all its property, plant and equipment. In accordance with the provisions of IAS/uni00A016, the depreciable base takes account of the potential residual value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nOperating and investment buildings, as well as equipment, are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since they were commissioned.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nFixed assets are depreciated based on their estimated useful lives. The main periods used are:\n\n- /uni25A0 fixtures and fittings\n\n5 to 10-year straight-line\n\n- /uni25A0 IT equipment\n\n3-year declining balance\n\n- /uni25A0 o/ffice equipment\n\n5-year straight-line\n\n- /uni25A0 o/ffice furniture\n\n10-year straight-line\n\n- /uni25A0 technical plant\n\n10-year straight-line\n\n- /uni25A0 buildings\n\n20-year straight-line\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recorded as expenses when incurred except in cases in which they contribute to increasing productivity or the useful life of the fixed asset.\n\nThe information which Amundi has about the value of its amortisable fixed assets has led it to conclude that impairment tests would not result in any change in the values recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n## 1.3.10 Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets include software, as well as the intangible assets resulting from the identification of contractual rights at the time of allocating the acquisition price of a business combination.\n\nPurchased software is recorded on the balance sheet at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment since the acquisition date.\n\nProprietary software is recognised at production cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since completion.\n\nAssets acquired from business combinations resulting from contractual rights (e.g. distribution agreements) are valued on the basis of corresponding future economic benefits or the potential of the expected services.\n\n## Amortisation\n\nIntangible assets are amortised as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 for software: based on their estimated useful life;\n- /uni25A0 for assets acquired in business combinations resulting from contractual rights: the contract period.\n\n## 1.3.11 Foreign currency transactions\n\nA distinction is made between cash and non-cash items, in accordance with IAS/uni00A021.\n\nOn the reporting date, foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are converted at the closing price into the Amundi functional currency. The resulting translation adjustments are recognised in profit or loss. There are two exceptions to this rule:\n\n- /uni25A0 for debt instruments at fair value through recyclable equity, the translation adjustments calculated on an amortised cost are taken to profit or loss; the balance is recorded in equity;\n- /uni25A0 exchange adjustments on items designated as cash flow hedges or forming part of a net investment in a foreign entity are recognised in equity.\n\nNon-monetary items are treated di/fferently depending on the nature of the items:\n\n- /uni25A0 items at historical cost are valued at the exchange rate on the transaction date;\n- /uni25A0 items at fair value are valued at the exchange rate on the reporting date.\n\nExchange adjustments on non-monetary items are recognised:\n\n- /uni25A0 in profit-and-loss if the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recorded in profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 in equity, if the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recorded in equity.\n\n## 1.3.12 Earnings per share\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A033, basic earnings per share is equal to net consolidated income divided by the weighted average number of shares in circulation during the financial year.\n\nThere are no dilutive instruments on Amundi's capital. The basic earnings per share is therefore identical to diluted earnings per share.\n\n## 1.3.13 Cost of risk\n\nThe cost of risk mainly consists of the cost of credit risk including provisions for guaranteed funds, provisions for litigation and other expenses related to operational risk.\n\n## 1.3.14 Leases\n\nThe Amundi Group holds lease agreements primarily as a lessee.\n\nLease transactions are recognised in the balance sheet on the date of availability of the leased assets. The lessee accounts for an asset that is representative of the right to use the leased asset in the property, plant and equipment during the estimated term of the contract and a debt owed under an obligation to pay the rents in the various liabilities over the same term.",

        "page_content": "The term of lease corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the lease adjusted by the contract extension options that the lessee is reasonably likely to exercise and the termination option that the lessee is reasonably likely not to exercise.\n\nIn France, the term used for the so-called '3/6/9' commercial leases is generally nine years with an initial non-cancellable period of three years. Amundi used a term corresponding to the earliest opportunity to terminate after five years has passed, as being the reasonably certain term of a lease. This term is applied in the majority of cases when French commercial leases are initiated. The main exception to this will be a lease in which the interim three-year exit options have been waived (for example, in return for a reduction in rent); in this case, the term used will remain nine years. This five-year term also applies leases to that can be extended automatically.\n\nThe lease liability is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the rent payments over the term of the contract. Rent payments include fixed rents, variable rents based on a rate or index, and payments that the lessee expects to make as residual value guarantees, a purchase option or as an early termination penalty.\n\nVariable rents that do not depend on an index or a rate and the non-deductible VAT on rents are excluded from the debt calculation and are recognised as general operating expenses.\n\nThe discount rate applicable for calculating the right of use and the rental liability is, by default, the lessee's marginal debt ratio over the term of the contract on the date of signature of the contract when the implicit rate cannot easily be calculated. The marginal debt ratio takes account of the rental payment structure.\n\nThe expense of the lease contracts is partly comprised of interest and partly of capital amortisation.\n\nThe right to use the asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability, plus the initial direct costs, advance payments and refurbishment costs. It is amortised over the estimated term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability and the right of use may be adjusted in the event of an amendment to the lease agreement, a reassessment of the lease term or a rent review linked to the application of indices or rates.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised on the basis of timing di/fferences between the rights to use and the lessee's rental liabilities.\n\nIn accordance with the exception set out in the standard, short-term leases (an initial term of less than twelve months) and leases where the value when new of the leased property is low are not recognised in the balance sheet; the corresponding leasing expenses are recorded on a straight-line basis in the income statement in general operating expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions set out in the standard, the Group does not apply IFRS/uni00A016 to leases for intangible assets.\n\n## 1.3.15 Non-current assets held for sale and/uni00A0discontinued operations\n\nA non-current asset (or a group held for sale) is classified as held-for-sale if, at close, its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through ongoing use.\n\nFor this to be the case, the asset (or group held for sale) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly likely.\n\nThe relevant assets and liabilities are shown separately on the balance sheet under 'Non-current assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale'.\n\nThe non-current assets (or disposal group) classified as heldfor-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less cost of sale. In the case of an unrealised loss, a write-down is recognised in profit or loss. They are no longer amortised when they are reclassified.\n\nIf the fair value of a group of assets held for sale less selling costs is less than its carrying amount after write-down of noncurrent assets, the di/fference is allocated to the other assets of the disposal group, including the financial assets, and is recognised under net income from discontinued operations.\n\nA discontinued operation is any component that the Group has either disposed of, or is classified as held-for-sale, and which is in any of the following situations:\n\n- /uni25A0 it is a major separate business line or a geographical area of operations;\n- /uni25A0 it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major business line or geographical area of operations; or,\n- /uni25A0 it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nThe following are disclosed on a separate line of the income statement:\n\n- /uni25A0 the net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal, net of tax;\n- /uni25A0 the gain or loss recognised on the disposal or on measurement at fair value less the cost of sale of the assets and liabilities constituting the discontinued operations, net of tax.\n\nAmundi did not record any transactions covered within the scope of IFRS/uni00A05 during the 2020 financial period.\n\n## 1.4 Consolidation principles and methods\n\n## 1.4.1 Consolidation scope and methods\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Amundi's financial statements and those of all companies over which, in compliance with the provisions of IFRS/uni00A010, IFRS/uni00A011 and IAS/uni00A028, Amundi exercises control, joint control or significant influence.\n\n## 1.4.1.1 Definitions of control\n\nExclusive control over an entity is deemed to exist if Amundi is exposed to or entitled to receive variable returns as a result of its involvement in the entity and if the power it holds over this entity enables it to influence the returns. Only substantive (voting or contractual) rights are examined to assess the concept of power. Rights are considered substantive if the holder of the rights can exercise them, in practice, when decisions about the entity's relevant activities are made.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Amundi is generally considered to control a subsidiary when it holds more than half of the existing or potential voting rights in an entity, whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, except when it can be clearly demonstrated that such ownership does not give it the power to direct its relevant activities. Control is also deemed to exist when Amundi holds half or less than half of the voting rights, including potential rights, in an entity but is able in practice to direct its relevant activities at its sole discretion, notably because of the existence of contractual arrangements, the relative size of its stake in the voting rights compared to those of other investors, or other facts or circumstances.\n\nControl of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of the percentage of voting rights, because by their nature these have no e/ffect on the entity's returns. When assessing control, consideration is given not only to contractual arrangements, but also to whether Amundi was involved in creating the entity and what decisions it made at the time, what agreements were made at its inception and what risks are borne by Amundi, any rights under agreements that only give the investor the power to direct relevant activities in specific circumstances and any other facts or circumstances that indicate that the investor can direct the entity's relevant activities. Where there is a management agreement, it should be established whether the manager is in practice acting as an agent (with delegated powers) or as a principal (on their own account). Accordingly, when decisions about the entity's relevant activities must be taken, the indicators used to assess whether an entity is acting as agent or principal are as follows: the extent of the decision-making powers compared to the powers over the entity delegated to the manager, the compensation provided for under the contractual agreements, but also any substantive rights held by third parties involved in the entity that may a/ffect the decision-making capacity of the decision maker and the exposure to the variable nature of the returns of other interests held in the entity.\n\nJoint control is deemed to exist when there is a contractual division of control over an economic activity. Decisions a/ffecting the entity's relevant activities require unanimous agreement of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn traditional entities, significant influence is defined as the power to influence, but not control, a company's financial and operational policies. Significant influence is assumed in cases of 20% or more ownership, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, of the voting rights in an entity.\n\n## 1.4.1.2 Control and consolidation of structured entities (special purpose entities)\n\nThe control criteria for structured entities or special purpose entities (structures created to manage an operation or a group of similar operations) are defined by IFRS/uni00A010.\n\nControl is primarily assessed based on the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 the power to manage the entity's operations;\n- /uni25A0 the receipt of variable revenue or exposure to the entity's risks;\n- /uni25A0 the ability to influence the revenue earned by the entity and the risks.\n\nThese provisions are applicable to the funds held or guaranteed by Amundi, in particular.\n\n## Funds held by Group companies\n\nWith respect to the fund units held by Group companies, Amundi's Management assesses the existence of control based on two criteria:\n\n- /uni25A0 the threshold at which the holding company can be considered to be primary:\n- /uni25A0 either in the event of a direct holding in the fund above 35%, or,\n- /uni25A0 in the event of a direct holding in the fund above 20% together with the sharing of performance fees between the management company and investors such that total Amundi revenue from the fund is greater than 35%;\n- /uni25A0 the durable nature of the investment, established in the event of a holding greater than the above thresholds for a period longer than one year.\n\nUnder this analysis, cases of control of a fund by a company within the scope are limited and only involve dedicated funds and certain fund holdings for seed money.\n\n## Funds guaranteed by Amundi\n\nAmundi provides guarantees to funds managed by the Group (see note/uni00A09.5):/uni00A0:\n\n- /uni25A0 structured funds;\n- /uni25A0 'portfolio insurance' funds.\n\nThe analysis conducted leads to the conclusion that there is no control as defined by IFRS/uni00A010 criteria so the funds are therefore not consolidated.\n\nOnce the structure of structured funds is established, they are managed passively and subject to the regulatory constraints of regulators (AMF, ESMA). This passive, directed management and the internal management rules (careful selection of exposures to credit risk, strict management of the turnover of assets held by the fund) limit Amundi's exposure to variable returns.\n\nLikewise, portfolio insurance fund structuring is closely monitored and this significantly limits the guarantor's exposure:\n\n- /uni25A0 investors who generally have immediate rights to the returns on the funds' assets: Amundi's exposure to market risk is low; it is essentially tied to dynamic assets and is further reduced by internal management rules (very prudent assessment of risk exposure, strict liquidity and diversification controls);\n- /uni25A0 exposure to credit risk which is essentially tied to monetising assets and is governed by the same restrictions as those applied to structured funds and reflects a high level of caution at issuer selection time.\n\n## 1.4.2 Consolidation methods\n\nConsolidation methods are defined in IFRS/uni00A010 and the revised IAS/uni00A028. They result from the type of control exercised by Amundi over the entities that can be consolidated, regardless of activity or whether or not they have legal entity status:\n\n- /uni25A0 full consolidation, for controlled entities;\n- /uni25A0 equity method, for entities over which Amundi exercises significant influence or joint control.",

        "page_content": "## Full consolidation\n\nFull consolidation substitutes each of the assets and liabilities carried by each subsidiary for the value of the shares.\n\n## Equity method\n\nThe equity method substitutes for the value of shares the Group's proportional share of the equity and net income of the companies in question. The change in the carrying amount of the shares includes changes in goodwill.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe equity and income attributable to non-controlling interests is presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests are as defined by IFRS/uni00A010. They incorporate instruments representing present ownership interests that give the right to a proportional share of the net assets in the event of liquidation and the other equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the Group.\n\n## 1.4.3 Restatements and eliminations within/uni00A0the/uni00A0Amundi Group\n\nThe impact of the Group's internal transactions on the consolidated balance sheet and income statement is eliminated for fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital gains or losses arising from intra-Group asset transfers are eliminated. Any potential lasting depreciation measured at the time of disposal of an internal transaction is recognised.\n\n## 1.4.4 Translation of the financial statements of/uni00A0foreign subsidiaries\n\nConsolidated financial statements are prepared in euros.\n\nThe financial statements of entities which constitute a 'foreign operation' (subsidiaries, branches, associates or joint ventures) are converted into euros in two stages:\n\n- /uni25A0 if applicable, the local currency in which the financial statements are prepared is translated into the functional currency (currency of the main business environment in which the entity operates). The translation is made as if the information had been initially recognised in the functional currency (same translation principles as for foreign currency translations);\n- /uni25A0 the functional currency is translated into euros, the currency in which the Group's consolidated financial statements are presented. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are translated at the closing rate. Equity items, such as share capital or reserves, are translated at their historical exchange rate. The income and expenses included in the income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. These translation di/fferences are recognised as net income in the event of disposal of the foreign operation (sale, repayment of capital, liquidation, discontinuation of operations) or in the event of a deconsolidation due to a loss of control (even without sale) while accounting for the income from the disposal or loss of control.\n\n## 1.4.5 Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS/uni00A03. On the date of acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity which meet IFRS/uni00A03 conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value. Notably, restructuring liabilities are only recognised as a liability of the acquired entity if, on the acquisition date, the entity is under an obligation to carry out the restructuring.\n\nEarn-out clauses are recognised at fair value even if their application is not probable. Subsequent changes in the fair value of financial liability clauses are recognised in profit or loss. Only earn-out clauses for transactions where control was obtained at the latest by 31/uni00A0December 2009 can still be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were accounted for under IFRS/uni00A03 before the revision.\n\nNon-controlling interests representing shares of current interests giving rights to a share of the net assets in the event of liquidation may be measured in one of two ways at the purchaser's choice:\n\n- /uni25A0 at fair value on the acquisition date;\n- /uni25A0 at the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company revalued at fair value.\n\nThe option may be exercised acquisition by acquisition.\n\nThe balance of non-controlling interests (equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the Group) must be recognised at fair value on the acquisition date.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A03, the initial valuation of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can be revised within a maximum of 12 months from the acquisition date.\n\nThe transferred counterparty at the time of a business combination (acquisition cost) is measured as the total of fair values transferred by the purchaser on the acquisition date in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example: cash, equity instruments).\n\nThe costs directly attributable to the business combination in question must be recognised as expenses separately from the business combination. If there is a very strong possibility that the transaction will occur, they are recognised under the heading 'Net gains or losses on other assets'; otherwise, they are recognised under 'General operating expenses'.\n\nThe di/fference between the sum of the acquisition cost and non-controlling interests and the net balance on the date of acquisition of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities taken over, valued at their fair value, is recognised and, when it is positive, on the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet under the heading 'Goodwill' when the acquired entity is fully consolidated, and under the heading 'Investments in equity-accounted entities' when the acquired company is consolidated using the equity method of accounting. Any negative change in the value of goodwill is recorded immediately in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is carried on the balance sheet at its initial amount in the currency of the acquired entity and translated at the closing rate on the reporting date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

In the event that the Amundi percentage of ownership interest in an entity that remains under its exclusive control declines, the di/fference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the share of net assets sold is also recognised under 'Consolidated reserves, Group share'. The expenses arising from these transactions are recognised in equity.\n\n## 1.4.6 Goodwill impairment\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment whenever there is objective evidence of a loss of value, and at least once a year. IAS/uni00A036 requires that impairment on goodwill be determined by reference to the recoverable value of the Cash-generating Unit (CGU) or CGU group to which it belongs.\n\nCash-generating Units are defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets and liabilities generating incoming cash independently of cash generated by other asset groups. Amundi's organisation is defined by a very high centralisation and interdisciplinary nature of the functions inherent to asset management. This centralisation and integration translate into the following organisational principles: an integrated management platform, cross-functional investment products and solutions, interlinked sales and key interdisciplinary functions. This organisation has resulted in the identification of a single CGU. Therefore, goodwill is tested at the Group level in accordance with the provisions of IAS/uni00A036.\n\nThe recoverable value of the CGU is defined as the higher of the market value and the value in use. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the CGU, as set out in medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for its management purposes.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, a corresponding impairment is recognised for the goodwill allocated to the CGU or CGU group. The impairment is irreversible.\n\n## Note 2 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, RISK EXPOSURE AND HEDGING POLICY\n\n## Capital Management and regulatory ratios\n\nAs a credit institution, Amundi is subject to French prudential regulations, which implement into French law the provisions of the EU Directive 'Access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms'. Amundi has managed its capital so as to satisfy the levels of regulatory capital defined in the EU Directive 2013/36 (CRD IV) and European Regulation 575/2013 (CRR) since 1/uni00A0January 2014 and required by the relevant authorities, the European Central Bank and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) to cover risk-weighted assets in terms of credit risks, operational risks and market risks.\n\nRegulatory capital, calculated on Amundi's scope of consolidation, breaks down into three categories: Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) and Tier 2 capital (Tier 2) consisting of equity and debt instruments, to which various adjustments are made. Regulatory capital is obtained from accounting shareholders' equity. The adjustments made (prudential filters) mostly involve deducting goodwill and intangible assets (net of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi principally holds CET1 capital, consisting of share capital and undistributed reserves. As part of the financing of the Pioneer acquisition, Amundi issued Tier 2 capital in the amount of \u20ac300/uni00A0million in 2017, maturing in 2027.\n\nAmundi met all regulatory requirements in effect as of 31 December 2020, as it did in 2019.\n\n## Note 3 CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF AMUNDI FINANCIAL ASSETS AND/uni00A0LIABILITIES\n\nThe contractual maturity of Amundi's financial assets and liabilities is as follows for the three financial years presented. The financial asset and liability balances are shown by contractual maturity date. Equities, funds and other variable-income securities do not have a contractual maturity and are shown in the 'Indefinite' column.",

The change over the financial year was mainly due to the acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management, resulting in goodwill of \u20ac335.0 million, and exchange rate fluctuations during the period.\n\nThe goodwill consists of the following other main items:\n\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac377.9 million of goodwill recognised upon the transfer by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez of its asset management business in/uni00A0December 2003;\n- /uni25A0 goodwill recognised in 2004 at the time of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s acquisition of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais for \u20ac1,732.8/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 goodwill related to the transfer of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's asset management business in/uni00A0December 2009 for \u20ac707.8/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 goodwill recognised in 2015 at the time of the acquisition of Amundi Austria for \u20ac78.4/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 the goodwill recognised in 2016 following the acquisitions of KBI Global Investors and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Immobilier Investors for a total of \u20ac159.9/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 goodwill recognised in 2017 following the acquisition of Pioneer Investments for a total of \u20ac2,537.3/uni00A0million.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment based on the Group's value in use. Determination of the value in use is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the Group as\n\nset out in the medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for management purposes.\n\nThe impairment test conducted on 31 December 2020 was carried out using results forecasts for the 2021-2023 period. The results forecasts were primarily based on the following assumptions about the economic environment:\n\n- /uni25A0 long-term rates remaining low and short-term rates remaining negative;\n- /uni25A0 average equity market levels rising steadily from 2021 to reach 2019 levels in 2023.\n\nAmundi used a perpetual growth rate of 2% for the tests as of 31 December 2020 and 2019 and a discount rate of 8.00% for the test as of 31 December 2020 (compared to 7.80% for the tests as of 31 December 2019).\n\nA change in these assumptions (+/-50 basis points in the discount rate and +/-50 basis points in the perpetual growth rate) would not change the conclusions of the impairment test as of 31 December 2020.\n\nAn impairment test was conducted on June, 30th, 2020 in the context of the health crisis. In spite of a lower market level and deteriorated economic environment at that time, the impairment test (including the +/-50 basis points shock assumptions described above) did not lead to a different conclusion.\n\n## 5.14 Provisions\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                         | 01/01/2020   | Increases   | Decr. and  reversals  not used   | Reversals  used   | Translation  di/fferences   | Other  movements   | 31/12/2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| Provisions for risk on  commitments made | 25,061       | 7,892       | -                                | (1,431)           |                             |                    | 31,522       |\n| Provisions for  operational risks        | 1,302        | 530         | (957)                            | (307)             |                             |                    | 568          |\n| Provisions for  employee expenses        | 101,998      | 15,924      | (6,277)                          | (32,005)          | (67)                        | 11,685             | 91,258       |\n| Provisions for litigation                | 7,083        | 4,020       | (940)                            | (35)              |                             |                    | 10,128       |\n| Provisions for other  risks              | 23,278       | 15,364      | (2,239)                          | (4,518)           |                             |                    | 31,885       |\n| PROVISIONS                               | 158,722      | 43,730      | (10,413)                         | (38,296)          | (67)                        | 11,685             | 165,361      |\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                         | 01/01/2019   | Increases   | Decr. and  reversals  not used   | Reversals  used   | Translation  di/fferences   | Other  movements   | 31/12/2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| Provisions for risk on  commitments made | 30,974       | 8,235       | (11,737)                         | (2,411)           |                             |                    | 25,061       |\n| Provisions for  operational risks        | 1,143        | 438         | (42)                             | (237)             |                             |                    | 1,302        |\n| Provisions for  employee expenses        | 122,836      | 8,003       | (3,652)                          | (33,232)          | 35                          | 8,007              | 101,998      |\n| Provisions for litigation                | 34,643       |             | (1,048)                          | (4,047)           |                             | (22,465)           | 7,083        |\n| Provisions for other  risks              | 19,127       | 7,876       | (8)                              | (1,679)           | 48                          | (2,086)            | 23,278       |\n| PROVISIONS                               | 208,723      | 24,552      | (16,487)                         | (41,606)          | 83                          | (16,543)           | 158,722      |\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, disputes and other risks have a foreseeable expiry of less than two years.\n\nThe provisions for employee expenses include provision for severance payments (see note/uni00A06.4).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This consists primarily of:\n\n- /uni25A0 variable-rate assets and liabilities for which interest rate changes do not have a significant impact on fair value, since the rates of return of these instruments frequently adjust themselves to market rates (loans and borrowings);\n- /uni25A0 short-term assets and liabilities where the redemption value is close to the market value.",

These funds, excluding management mandates, are considered to be structured entities to the extent that they are created for a very specific purpose, are managed via contracts signed by the stakeholders, and the rights associated with the voting rights of the shares have limited impact, where applicable.\n\nAmundi has defined criteria to identify companies which are involved as the sponsor of a structured entity:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Company is involved in the creation of the structured entity and the intervention, which is remunerated, is deemed significant for the successful completion of operations;\n- /uni25A0 the structuring occurred at the request of the Company and it is the primary user;\n- /uni25A0 the Company sold its own shares to the structured entity;\n- /uni25A0 the Company is the manager of the structured entity;\n- /uni25A0 the name of a subsidiary or the Parent company is associated with the name of the structured entity or with the financial instruments it issues.\n\nGiven this definition, all funds managed by Amundi Group companies, whether held or not, are considered to be 'sponsored' structured entities.\n\nThe Group receives management and performance fees and commissions from the funds. It can invest, provide guarantees and contract performance swaps with the funds.\n\n## 8.1 Nature and extent of Amundi's involvement/uni00A0with the non-consolidated structured/uni00A0entities\n\nThe table below shows the assets, liabilities and o/ff-balance sheet commitments of the Group in sponsored structured entities, with the exception of those that are consolidated.\n\n## 31/12/2020\n\n|                                                                                                                      | Asset management     | Asset management                | Asset management                                     | Asset management   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                                                      |                      | Maximum loss                    | Maximum loss                                         | Maximum loss       |\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                                                                                                     | Balance  sheet value | Maximum  exposure to  loss risk | Guarantees  received and  other credit  enhancements | Net  exposure      |\n| Financial assets held for trading                                                                                    | 795,851              | 795,851                         | -

It therefore has only one operating segment within the meaning of IFRS/uni00A08.\n\nThe Group's operational performance is not tracked more closely than the Group overall. Items that are reviewed at a closer level are limited to/uni00A0monthly reports on Group business volume (inflows, outstanding assets) and periodic reports on income net of commissions by client segment (retail, institutional). The Group believes that this information better corresponds to monitoring commercial activity than to\n\nmeasurement of operational performance for the purposes of decision-making for resource allocation. Operating expenses are not allocated to client segments (retail and institutional).\n\nHowever, the Group believes that it is helpful to publish the information about commercial activity which is shown below as information complementary to that required by IFRS/uni00A08:\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                              | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Retail                                        | 1,744  | 1,813  |\n| Institutional                                 | 690    | 679    |\n| Institutional, Corporate and employee savings | 537    | 533    |\n| Insurers (1)                                  | 153    | 146    |\n| NET FEES                                      | 2,434  | 2,493  |\n| Performance fees                              | 200    | 171    |\n| TOTAL NET MANAGEMENT REVENUES                 | 2,634  | 2,663  |\n| Net /financial income                         | (36)   | 43     |\n| Other net income                              | (76)   | (70)   |\n| TOTAL NET REVENUES                            | 2,521  | 2,636  |\n\nIn addition, the allocation of net income is broken down by geographical area as follows:\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| France             | 1,314  | 1,412  |\n| Abroad             | 1,208  | 1,224  |\n| TOTAL NET REVENUES | 2,521  | 2,636  |\n\nThe net revenue break-down is based on the location where the accounting information is recorded.\n\n## 9.2 Related parties\n\n## 9.2.1 Scope of related parties\n\nRelated parties are businesses which directly or indirectly control or are controlled by, or which are under joint control with the Company presenting the financial statements.\n\nAmundi's related parties are (i) the consolidated companies, including equity-accounted companies, (ii) the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group companies, that is, the Regional Banks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. No provisions for write-downs were made for these relationships.\n\nIn addition, the funds in which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has invested are not considered to be related parties.\n\nA list of the Amundi Group's consolidated companies is presented in note/uni00A09.3.1. 'Scope of consolidation'. The transactions carried out and the assets under management at the end of the period between the fully consolidated companies of the Group are entirely eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## 9.2.2 Nature of the transactions with/uni00A0related/uni00A0parties\n\nAmundi has commercial relationships with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group companies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Group is a distributor, a lender and borrower, a derivative counterparty and also a depositary and calculation agent of Amundi's financial products. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group makes certain resources available to Amundi and manages Amundi's end-of-career allowance insurance.\n\nAmundi handles asset management of certain mandates for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and also provides book-keeping services for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's employee savings plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Change in method of consolidation during the year.\n\n## 9.3.2 Significant changes in scope during/uni00A0the/uni00A0year\n\nOn 30 June 2020, Amundi announced the acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management from Banco Sabadell. The 10-year strategic partnership for the distribution of Amundi products through Banco Sabadell's network in Spain began on the same date, with the business strategy and priorities having already been determined by the two partners.\n\nOne of the objectives of this deal is to combine Banco Sabadell's powerful retail network with Amundi's full range of savings products and solutions. Amundi's intention is for the acquisition and the partnership with Banco Sabadell to significantly reinforce its position in Spain, a major European\n\nmarket for Retail investors, and to consolidate its European leadership while deploying its unique business model aimed at serving Retail networks.\n\nIn accordance with the revised IFRS 3 (business combinations), the Amundi Group has provisionally allocated the acquisition cost at closing and, consequently, the amounts allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and goodwill may be adjusted within one year (the measurement period) from the date of consolidation if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that were in existence at the acquisition date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2020\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Amundi,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the consolidated financial statements of Amundi for the year ended December 31, 2020, as attached to this report.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "Goodwill measurement\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nThe goodwill mainly arises from external growth operations and amounts to \u20ac 6 billion.\n\nAs mentioned in Note 1.4.6 to the consolidated /financial statements, goodwill is subject to impairment tests as soon as there is objective evidence of a loss of value, and at least once a year.\n\nThese tests are based on the comparison between the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) and its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the CGU is de/fined as the highest value between its market value and its value in use. The value in use is calculated on the basis of the present value of the future cash /flows generated by the CGU.\n\nAs indicated in note 5.13 to the consolidated /financial statements, these estimated future cash /flows are determined on the basis of the medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for its management purposes. They are based on assumptions concerning the growth of the Group's business and include macroeconomic parameters evolution mentioned in note 5.13.\n\nThe present value of the future cash /flows also takes into account assumptions concerning discount rates and perpetual growth rate which necessitate the exercise of Management's judgment.\n\nIn view of the materiality of the goodwill and the degree of management's judgment to determine the assumptions used to calculate an impairment loss, we considered goodwill measurement to be a key audit matter.\n\nRecording and measurement of performance fees\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Group manages a diversi/fied fund portfolio covering different asset classes. For some funds, it is planned to remunerate the performance of the fund by the payment of a commission named 'performance fee'.\n\nAs mentioned in Note 1.3.6 of the consolidated /financial statements, the performance fees pay the investment management company when speci/fied in the contract. They are computed on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the fund's actual performance and the reference index as set out in the contract.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the performance fees recorded in the income statement amounted to M\u20ac 199.9 (Note 4.1 of the consolidated /financial statements).\n\nThe diverse maturity dates, reference index and performance target entail complexity in determining the amount of the performance fees and the different recognition dates of the corresponding income as well.\n\nWe considered the measurement and recording of the performance fees to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nIn accordance with Article 222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the Company's management informed us of its decision to postpone the presentation of the consolidated financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic format as defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 to years beginning on or after January 1st, 2021. Therefore, this report does not include a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier) .\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Amundi by the annual general meeting held on November 16, 1989 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 31, 1991 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in the thirty-second year of total uninterrupted engagement and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres was in the thirty year, respectively, which is the twenty-fourth year since the Company became a public interest entity.\n\nWe analyzed the calculation process of the performance fees implemented by the Group.\n\nWe tested, for a sample, the periodic reconciliations performed with the performance fees calculated by Management and the amounts recorded in P&L, and with the fees provided by the funds' administrators.\n\nIn addition, on the basis of a sample of funds, we:\n\n- /uni25A0 reconciled the reference index used in calculation of commissions, with the one speci/fied in the contract;\n- /uni25A0 reconciled the fee amounts determined by Management with the amounts recorded\n- /uni25A0 reconciled the performance fees recorded in commissions with the fees calculated by the funds' administrators;\n- /uni25A0 assessed that the fees were recorded by the investment management company at the end of the calculation period speci/fied in the contract.\n\nWe have reviewed the methodology used by the Amundi Group to identify any indications of impairment.\n\nWe examined the calculations performed and we involved our valuation specialists to assess the assumptions used by Management to determine the discount rates and the perpetual growth rates used in the discounted cash /flow calculations,  where  necessary  by  comparing  them  with external sources.\n\nWe also examined the /financial trajectories prepared by the Group's Management in the context of the global crisis linked to Covid-19 pandemic and used in the impairment tests in order to compare them with the information presented to the Group's Board of Directors and to assess the main underlying assumptions.  The  reliability  of  these  assumptions  was assessed in particular by comparing the /financial trajectories developed in previous years with the actual performance.\n\nWe also performed sensitivity analyses on certain assumptions (perpetual growth rate, discount rate).\n\nFinally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  /financial statements on the results of these impairment tests and the level of sensitivity to the various assumptions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) , our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- /uni25A0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- /uni25A0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control.\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- /uni25A0 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- /uni25A0 Obtains su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, April 9, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors (French original signed by)\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nLaurent Tavernier             Anik Chaumartin\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nOlivier Durand             Claire Rochas",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  LEGAL AND FINANCIAL BACKGROUND - SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2020\n\n## 1.1 Legal and financial background\n\nAmundi is a French public limited company (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme) with share capital of \u20ac506,464,882.50 (i.e. 202,585,953 shares with a nominal value of \u20ac2.50 each).\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A044 of the law of 16/uni00A0July 1992 bringing legislation on insurance and credit in line with the single European market, Amundi is considered a credit institution and classified as a financial company. This law amends Article/uni00A018 of banking law 84-46 of 24/uni00A0January 1984 and abrogates Article/uni00A099.\n\nPursuant to French Financial Activity Modernisation Act no./uni00A096-597 of 2/uni00A0July 1997, Amundi opted to be categorised as a financial company, i.e. a credit institution.\n\nThe Comit\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements de cr\u00e9dit et des entreprises d'investissement (Credit Institutions and Investment Firms Committee) redefined Amundi's accreditation on 19/uni00A0February 2002. Amundi, as a financial company, is authorised to issue capital and/or performance guarantees in the field of asset management, particularly for customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group or of UCITS it manages.\n\nOwnership percentages in the Company are:\n\n- /uni25A0 69.63% by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- /uni25A0 30.03% by the public (including employees);\n- /uni25A0 0.34% held in treasury.\n\n## 1.2 Significant events in 2020\n\n## Covid-19: A crisis that confirmed the robustness of Amundi's business model\n\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic was an intense global crisis without modern precedent. This health crisis has become an economic crisis; this is reflected in the sharp drops and\n\nincreased volatility on financial markets. As far as Amundi is concerned, the main financial impact comes from the sensitivity of the managed assets to this fall in the financial markets (equity, rates, etc.), with the resultant e/ffect on their valuation and on net asset management revenues; the fall in the financial markets also had a negative impact on the financial results.\n\nDespite this, Amundi has managed to cope in the face of adversity and continue the Company's normal operations thanks to the robustness of its IT platform, e/ffectiveness of its BCP (1)1 and the rapid roll-out of teleworking, which was implemented to protect employees' health and to maintain a high level of operational e/fficiency for clients.\n\nLastly, the financial impact of the crisis was reduced by the diversification of the Group's assets by segment/asset class/ geography, by the low cost-to-income ratio and an adjusted cost base. The scale and duration of this crisis still remains di/fficult to predict.\n\n## Capital increase\n\nThe capital increase reserved for employees was finalised during the second half of 2020. It was completed under the existing legal authorisations approved by the General Meeting of May/uni00A02017.\n\nAt the end of the subscription period, this capital increase resulted in the issuance of 422,648 shares at a price of \u20ac44.02 per share (nominal value of \u20ac2.50 and share premium of \u20ac41.52). The final amount of the transaction amounts to \u20ac18.6/uni00A0million.\n\n## 1.3 Events after the 2020 financial year\n\nNo significant events took place after the financial year end, whether recognised or not.\n\n## Note 2 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND METHODS\n\nThe Amundi financial statements comply with the provisions of ANC (French accounting standards authority) regulation no./uni00A02014-07 of 26/uni00A0November 2014 which, for financial years starting from 1/uni00A0January 2015, brings together all accounting standards applicable to credit institutions under a single set of regulations on the basis of established law.\n\nThere are no changes in accounting methods and in the presentation of the financial statements compared with the previous financial year.\n\n## 2.1 Loans and receivables due from/uni00A0credit institutions and customers financing/uni00A0commitments\n\nLoans and receivables due from credit institutions, Amundi Group entities and customers are governed by Articles/uni00A02211-1 to 2251-13 (Title/uni00A02 Accounting treatment of credit risk of Book/uni00A0II Special transactions ) of ANC regulation no./uni00A02014-07 of 26/uni00A0November 2014.\n\nThey are broken down according to their remaining maturity or type:\n\n- /uni25A0 cash and term deposits for credit institutions;\n- /uni25A0 current accounts, accounts and straight loans for Amundi Group internal transactions;\n- /uni25A0 trade receivables, other loans and current accounts for customers.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory provisions, the customer section also includes transactions completed with financial customers.\n\nSubordinated loans, as well as repurchase agreements (taking the form of securities or assets), are incorporated under the various loans and receivables sections, depending on the type of counterparty (interbank, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, customer).\n\nLoans and receivables are recorded on the balance sheet at their nominal value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

Interest stops accruing as soon as the receivable becomes non-performing.\n\nClassification as a doubtful loan can be disregarded as soon as the demonstrated credit risk is permanently eliminated and when regular payments have resumed for the amounts stipulated for the original contractual due dates. In this case, the loan is once again considered unimpaired.\n\n## Write-downs for credit risk on doubtful loans\n\nAs soon as a loan becomes doubtful, Amundi accounts for the probable write-o/ff through a write-down deducted from the asset on the balance sheet. These write-downs represent the di/fference between the book value of the loan or receivable and the future estimated flows discounted at the contract rate, while taking into consideration the financial position and economic outlook of the counterparty, as well as any potential guarantees minus their cost of enforcement.\n\nPotential write-o/ffs relating to o/ff-balance sheet commitments are taken into account through provisions included in balance sheet liabilities.\n\n## Accounting treatment of write-downs\n\nAllowances and reversals for the write-down of the risk of noncollection on doubtful loans and receivables are recognised under cost of risk.\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A02231-3 of ANC regulation no. 201407, the Group has opted to record the increase in the book value associated with the reversal of the write-down due to the passage of time under cost of risk.\n\n## Writing o/ff of losses\n\nThe assessment of the time period for a write-o/ff is based on the judgement of experts. Amundi determines this with its Risk Management Department, based on its knowledge of its business.\n\nLoans and receivables that have become irrecoverable are recognised as losses and the corresponding write-downs are reversed.\n\n## 2.2 Securities portfolio\n\nRules regarding accounting for securities transactions are defined by Articles/uni00A02311-1 to 2391-1 (Title/uni00A03 Accounting of securities transactions for Book/uni00A0II Special transactions ) as well as by Articles/uni00A02211-1 to 2251-13 (Title/uni00A02 Accounting treatment of credit risk of Book/uni00A0II Special transactions ) of ANC regulation no./uni00A02014-07 of 26/uni00A0November 2014 for determining the credit risk and write-down of fixed-income securities.\n\nThe securities are presented by type in the financial statements: treasury bills (Treasury Notes and similar securities), bonds and other fixed-income securities (negotiable debt securities and interbank securities), equities and other variable-income securities.",

Revenue from dividends associated with the equities are recorded in the income statement under 'Income from variable-income securities'.\n\nRevenue from SICAVs (variable-capital investment companies) and mutual funds are recorded at the time the funds are received in the same section.\n\nShort-term investment securities are valued at the lower of the purchase price or the market value at the reporting date. Accordingly, when the book value on one line is lower than the carrying amount, a charge for write-down of unrealised losses is recognised without any o/ffset for any capital gains recorded under other types of securities. Gains generated by hedges, as defined in Article/uni00A02514-1 of ANC regulation no./uni00A02014-7 of 26/uni00A0November 2014, taking the form of purchases or sales of forward financial instruments, are taken into account in calculating write-downs. Potential capital gains are not recognised.\n\nDisposals of securities are deemed to involve the securities of the same type that were subscribed at the earliest date.\n\nWrite-down allowances and reversals, as well as any capital gains or losses from the disposal of short-term investment securities, are recognised under the heading 'Balance of transactions on marketable security investment portfolios and similar' in the income statement.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates, equity investments and other long-term investments\n\n- /uni25A0 Investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates are investments in companies that are under exclusive control and which are, or are likely to be, fully consolidated into a single group.\n- /uni25A0 Equity investments are investments (other than investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates), whose long-term ownership is deemed beneficial to the reporting entity, particularly because it allows it to exercise influence or control over the issuer.\n- /uni25A0 Other long-term equity investments consist of securities held with the intention of promoting long-term business relations by creating a special relationship with the issuer, but involve no influence on the issuer's management due to the small percentage of voting rights held.\n\nThe securities are recognised at their acquisition price, including costs.\n\nAt the reporting date, these securities are measured individually based on their value in use and are recorded on the balance sheet at the lower end of their historical cost or value in use.\n\nThe value in use may be estimated on the basis of various factors such as the issuer's profitability and profitability outlook, its equity, the economic environment or even its average share price in the preceding months or the economic value of the security.\n\nWhen value in use is lower than the historical cost, impairments are booked for these unrealised losses, without o/ffset against any unrealised gains.\n\nWrite-down allowances and reversals, as well as any capital gains or losses from the disposal of these securities, are recognised under the heading 'Balance of transactions on marketable security investment portfolios and similar' in the income statement.\n\n## Market price\n\nThe market price at which the various categories of securities are measured is determined in the following manner:\n\n- /uni25A0 securities traded on an active market are measured at their most recent price;\n- /uni25A0 if the market on which the security is traded is considered inactive or no longer active or if the security is not listed, Amundi determines the probable trading value of the security by using valuation techniques. Primarily, these techniques make reference to recent transactions completed under normal competitive conditions. When appropriate, Amundi uses valuation techniques commonly used by market participants to value these securities when it has been demonstrated that these techniques produce reliable estimates of the prices obtained in actual market trades.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

They are subjected, where applicable, to a write-down if the book value is lower than the purchase price, with the exception of transactions related to the stock option plans or subscription of shares and the free share award plans for employees pursuant to ANC regulation no./uni00A02014-03 of 5/uni00A0June 2014.\n\n## 2.3 Non-current assets\n\nAmundi applies ANC regulation no./uni00A02014-03 of 5/uni00A0June 2014 for the depreciation, amortisation and write-down of assets.\n\nAs a result, Amundi applies component accounting to all its property, plant and equipment. In accordance with the provisions of this regulation, the depreciable base takes account of the potential residual value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nANC regulation no./uni00A02015-06 amends the accounting of the technical merger loss on the balance sheet as well as its monitoring in the financial statements. The loss is no longer always and systematically recognised under 'Goodwill'; it must be recognised on the balance sheet according to the asset section to which it has been allocated under 'other property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, financial assets, etc./uni00A0'. The loss is amortised, written down and written o/ff using the same process as for the underlying asset.\n\nThe acquisition costs of non-current assets include, in addition to the purchase price, incidental expenses, meaning the expenses directly or indirectly linked to the acquisition for putting the property in proper operating condition or for its entry into inventory.\n\nBuildings and equipment are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since they were commissioned.\n\nAcquired software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since the acquisition date.\n\nProprietary software is measured at production cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since completion.\n\nIntangible assets other than software, patents and licences are not amortised.\n\nIf applicable, they may be subject to a write-down.\n\nNon-current assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe following components and depreciation periods have been adopted by Amundi following the application of component accounting for non-current assets. These depreciation periods are adjusted according to the nature of the asset and its location:\n\n| Component                             | Depreciation  Period   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Technical equipment and installations | 5 years                |\n| IT equipment                          | 3 years                |\n\n## 2.4 Amounts due to credit institutions and/uni00A0customers\n\nAmounts due to credit institutions and customers are presented in the financial statements according to their remaining maturity or the nature of the liability:\n\n- /uni25A0 demand or term debts with institutions;\n- /uni25A0 other liabilities for customers (including financial customers).\n\nAccrued interest on these debts is registered under related payables with counterparty in the income statement.\n\n## 2.5 Debt securities\n\nDebt securities are presented according to their type: short-term securities, interbank securities, negotiable debt obligations, and bonds, with the exclusion of subordinated securities, which are classified under 'Subordinated debt' in liabilities.\n\nAccrued interest not yet due on these debts is recognised under related payables with counterparty in the income statement.\n\nShare premiums or those from the redemption of bonds are depreciated over the life of the relevant borrowings, the corresponding charge is recognised in the section 'Interest and similar expenses on bonds and other fixed-income securities'.\n\n## 2.6 Provisions\n\nAmundi applies ANC regulation no./uni00A02014-03 of 5/uni00A0June 2014 to recognise and assess provisions.\n\nThese provisions include provisions relating to financing commitments, retirement and end-of-career liabilities, litigation and various risks.\n\nAll these risks are reviewed quarterly.",

The gains or losses resulting from these conversions, as well as the translation adjustments on the financial year's transactions, are recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe monetary receivables and liabilities, as well as the forward currency contracts appearing as o/ff-balance sheet commitments in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date or the market price on the nearest preceding date.\n\nWithin the context of the application of Title/uni00A07 Accounting of transactions in foreign currencies of Book/uni00A0II Special transactions of ANC regulation 2014-07 of 26/uni00A0November 2014, Amundi implemented multi-currency accounting enabling it to monitor its foreign exchange position and to assess its exposure to this risk.\n\n## 2.9 Forward and options financial instrument transactions\n\nHedging and market transactions on forward financial instruments involving interest rates, foreign exchange or equities are recognised according to the provisions of Title/uni00A05 Forward financial instruments of Book/uni00A0II Special transactions of ANC regulation 2014-07 of 26/uni00A0November 2014.\n\nO/ff-balance sheet commitments relating to these transactions record the notional capital amount of the contracts that have not yet been unwound at the reporting date. In the case of options transactions, the commitments reflect the amount of the nominal capital of the underlying instrument.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, forward financial commitments stood at \u20ac194,592/uni00A0thousand.\n\nThe results of these transactions are recognised according to the type of instrument and the strategy implemented:\n\n## Market transactions\n\nMarket transactions include:\n\n- /uni25A0 isolated open positions (category 'a' Article/uni00A02522-1 of ANC regulation 2014-07);\n- /uni25A0 the specialised management of a trading book (category 'd' Article/uni00A02522 of ANC regulation 2014-07);\n- /uni25A0 instruments traded on an organised, similar or over-thecounter market, or included in a trading book - as defined by ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\nThey are valued by reference to their market value on the reporting date.\n\nWhen the instruments are valued at their market value, this value is determined:\n\n- /uni25A0 based on available prices, if there is an active market;\n- /uni25A0 based on internal valuation methods and models, in the absence of an active market.\n\nFor instruments:\n\n- /uni25A0 in an open isolated position traded on organised or similar markets, all gains and losses (realised or unrealised) are recognised;\n- /uni25A0 in an open isolated position traded on OTC markets, only potential unrealised losses are recorded via a provision. The/uni00A0realised capital gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss at the time of settlement;\n- /uni25A0 being part of a trading book, all gains and losses (realised or unrealised) are recognised.\n\n## Hedging transactions\n\nGains or losses on allocated hedges (category 'b' Article/uni00A02522-1 of ANC regulation 2014-07) are recorded in the income statement symmetrically to the recognition of the income and expenses of the hedged item and in the same accounting section.\n\n## Counterparty risk on derivative instruments\n\nIn accordance with ANC regulation 2014-07 of 26/uni00A0November 2014, Amundi incorporates the assessment of the counterparty risk on derivative assets ( Credit Valuation Adjustment - CVA) in the market value of derivatives. Only derivatives recognised in an isolated open position and in the trading book (respectively the derivatives classified according to categories a and d of Article/uni00A02522-1 of the aforementioned regulation) are subject to a CVA calculation.\n\nCVA makes it possible to determine expected counterparty losses from Amundi's perspective.\n\nThe CVA calculation relies on an assessment of the expected losses based on the probability of default and the loss in the event of default.\n\nThe methodology used maximises the use of observable market/uni00A0data.\n\nIt is based:\n\n- /uni25A0 primarily on market data such as registered and listed credit default swaps (or single-name CDS) or CDS proxies;\n- /uni25A0 in the absence of a registered counterparty CDS, on an approximation based on a basket of single-name counterparty CDS of the same rating, operating in the same sector and located in the same region.\n\n## Complex transactions\n\nA complex transaction is defined as a synthetic combination of instruments (types, natures and methods of valuation that are identical or di/fferent) recognised as a single lot or as a transaction whose recognition does not pertain to an explicit regulation and that involves a choice of principle by the institution.\n\nIncome and expenses relating to the instruments traded as part of complex transactions, particularly the issuance of structured notes, are recognised in the income statement symmetrically to the method for recognising income and expenses on the hedged item. Accordingly, changes in the values of hedging instruments are not recognised in the balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

Agreements regarding employee profit-sharing and incentive plans have been signed in this context.\n\nProfit-sharing and incentives are shown under employee expenses.\n\nThe employees provided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. are covered by agreements signed for that entity's SEU. The estimated expense to be paid for the profit-sharing and incentive plans allocated in this context is recognised in the financial statements.\n\n## 2.12 Post-employment benefits\n\n## Retirement plans - defined contribution plans\n\nThere are several compulsory retirement plans to which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not have sufficient assets to cover all benefits corresponding to services rendered by the employees during the financial year and during prior years.\n\nConsequently, Amundi has no liabilities in this respect other than its contributions for the year ended.\n\nThe amount of the contributions made to these retirement plans is recognised under 'employee expenses'.\n\n## Commitments in terms of retirement plans, pre-retirement and end-of-career payments defined benefit plans\n\nAmundi has applied ANC (French accounting standard authority) recommendation no./uni00A02013-02 of 7/uni00A0November 2013 regarding accounting and valuation rules for retirement plans and similar benefits since 1/uni00A0January 2013. This recommendation was abrogated and incorporated into section 4 of chapter II of Title/uni00A0III of ANC regulation 2014-03 of 5/uni00A0June 2014.\n\nIn accordance with this regulation, Amundi funds its retirement plans and similar benefits falling under the category of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe sensitivity index shows that:\n\n- /uni25A0 a change of more than 50 bps in discount rates would result in a 4.72% decrease in the commitment;\n- /uni25A0 a change of less than 50 bps in discount rates would result in a 5.09% increase in the commitment.\n\nWithin the Amundi Group, Amundi AM has signed an insurance contract for an 'end-of-career allowance' (IFC) with PREDICA, and management agreements were signed between Amundi and its SEU subsidiaries. This outsourcing of the 'end-ofcareer allowance' resulted in the transfer of a portion of the liability provision from the financial statements to the PREDICA contract.\n\nThe non-outsourced balance is still recorded under the provision for liabilities.\n\n## 2.13 Share and share subscription schemes o/ffered to employees as part of the/uni00A0Company Savings Scheme\n\n## Share award scheme\n\nSome performance share plans granted to certain categories of employees have been created.\n\nThese shares, delivered at the end of a two- to four-year vesting period, are first subject to buyback.\n\nThey will be rebilled to the Group's 'employer' companies when the shares are delivered.",

It includes the e/ffects of the employer social security contributions on earnings of 3.3%.\n\nWhen tax credits on income from securities portfolios and receivables are e/ffectively used to pay the corporate income tax due for the year, they are recognised under the same section as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge continues to be recognised in the 'Income tax charge' section in the income statement.\n\nAmundi has a tax consolidation scheme in place since 2010. As of 31/uni00A0December 2019, 16 entities had signed tax consolidation agreements with Amundi. Under these agreements, each company that is part of the tax consolidation scheme recognises the tax that it would have paid in the absence of the scheme in its financial statements.\n\nFollowing the signature of a tax consolidation agreement on 15/uni00A0April 2010, Amundi heads the tax consolidation group of the following companies:\n\n- /uni25A0 CPR Asset Management;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi Finance;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi Interm\u00e9diation;\n- /uni25A0 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Gestion;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi AM;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi Immobilier;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi Private Equity Funds;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi ESR;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi Finance \u00c9missions;\n- /uni25A0 LCL \u00c9missions;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi Issuance;\n- /uni25A0 \u00c9toile Gestion;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi India Holding;\n- /uni25A0 Amundi Ventures;\n- /uni25A0 Valinter 19;\n- /uni25A0 Valinter 20.\n\nGiven that the legislative intent when introducing the tax credit for competitiveness and employment (CICE) was to reduce employee expenses, Amundi chose to recognise the CICE (Article/uni00A0244 quater C of the French General Tax Code) as a reduction in employee expenses rather than a tax deduction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

This statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to the shareholders.This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2020\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Amundi,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Amundi for the year ended December 31,2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1st, 2020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\nMeasurement of unlisted equity investments and subsidiaries\n\n## Description of risk\n\n## Our response\n\nUnlisted investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates are recorded in the balance sheet for the net amount of \u20ac 5.9 billion as at December 31, 2020 and is detailed in Note 6 of the annual /financial statements.\n\nAs stated in Note 2.2 to the /financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates are recorded at their acquisition cost and are valued at the reporting date based on their value in use and are recorded on the balance sheet at the lower end of their historical cost or value in use.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized when the value in use of the investments is lower than their acquisition cost.\n\nThe value in use may be estimated on the basis of various factors, such as the issuer's pro/fitability and pro/fitability outlooks, its equity or the economic environment.\n\nGiven the judgement involved in the choice of methods used to determine the value in use, and in the assumptions underlying these methods, we considered that the estimate of the value in use of unlisted investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates to be a key audit matter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our work consisted in:\n\n- /uni25A0 Review the procedures set up by the Company in order to value unlisted investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates;\n- /uni25A0 Performing the veri/fication of the permanence of methods used to determine the values in use of the equity holdings;\n- /uni25A0 Performing  the  veri/fication,  through  sampling,  of  the /financial aggregates used to estimate the value in use of the investments in subsidiaries and af/filiate by reconciling them with the closing balance sheets and pro/fit and loss accounts of the entities assessed;\n- /uni25A0 Comparing, where appropriate, the levels of multiples used to calculate the value in use with external benchmarks.\n\nFinally,  for  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  and  af/filiates whose estimated value in use is lower than their acquisition price, we evaluated the consistency of the impairment losses recognized with the calculation of the values in use.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) , our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- /uni25A0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- /uni25A0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control.\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the financial statements.\n- /uni25A0 Assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, April 9, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors (French original signed by)\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nLaurent Tavernier             Anik Chaumartin\n\nOlivier Durand             Claire Rochas",

Each share gives the right to one vote in these General Meetings; the double voting right set down by Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-123 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is expressly excluded.\n\nWhere a certain number of shares must be held in order to exercise any right, more particularly in the case of the exchange, conversion, consolidation or allocation of free shares, share capital decrease, merger, demerger or any other operation, a shareholding of less than the requisite number of shares grants its owner no right against the Company, and shareholders shall personally ensure that they obtain the requisite number of shares required or a multiple thereof; the provisions of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0228-6 of the French Commercial Code shall apply to fractional shares.\n\n## Section III - Management of the Company\n\n## Article/uni00A010 - The Board of Directors\n\nThe Company is managed by a Board of Directors. The minimum and maximum number of members is set down by applicable law.\n\nEach director must own at least 200 shares during his/her term of o/ffice.\n\nThe Board of Directors is renewed each year by rotation; this rotation will concern a certain number of Board members.\n\nThe Ordinary General Meeting sets the length of a director's term of office at three years, subject to legal provisions allowing for any extension, to end at the close of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders deliberating on the accounts for the previous financial year and held in the year in which the said director's term of o/ffice comes to an end.\n\nExceptionally, in order to begin or maintain the above mentioned rotation, the General Meeting may appoint one or more directors for a di/fferent term of no more than four years, in order to allow a staggered renewal of directors' terms of o/ffice. The duties of any director thus appointed for a term of no more than four years will end at the close of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders deliberating on the accounts for the previous financial year and held in the year in which the said director's term of o/ffice comes to an end.\n\nThe number of directors who are natural persons and over 70 years of age may not exceed one-third of the total number of directors at the end of the financial year. If this proportion is exceeded, the oldest Board member is deemed to have automatically resigned.\n\n## Article/uni00A011 - Director representing employees\n\nThe Board of Directors includes one director representing employees and elected by the employees of the Company or by the employees of its direct or indirect subsidiaries whose registered o/ffices are located in France, except in the event of absence of candidacy. The status and procedures for the election of the director elected by the employees are set forth in Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-27 et seq. of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe term of office of the director representing employees is three years. However, the o/ffice shall expire at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting called to rule on the financial statements of the past financial year and held in the year during which said director's term of o/ffice expires.\n\nThey may not be elected to more than four consecutive terms.\n\nIn the event that the seat of the director representing employees falls vacant as a result of his or her death, resignation, removal, termination of the employment contract or any other reason, his or her successor shall take o/ffice immediately. If there is no successor able to carry out the director's duties, a new election shall be held within three/uni00A0months.\n\nThe election of the director representing employees involves a majority vote in two rounds, in accordance with the following procedures pursuant to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-28 of the French Commercial Code and to this Article.\n\nThe list of voters, indicating their respective surnames, given names, dates and places of birth and domiciles, are prepared by the Chief Executive O/fficer, displayed and circulated by any other means as determined by the Chief Executive O/fficer at least five weeks prior to the date of the first round of the election. Within 15/uni00A0days after the lists are displayed, any voter may submit a request to the Chief Executive O/fficer either that another voter who was omitted be registered, or that another voter who was erroneously registered be removed from the list. Within the same time period, any person whose name was omitted may also submit a request for registration.\n\nApplications must be submitted no later than three weeks and one/uni00A0day before the planned date for the first round of the election.\n\nEach application must specify not only the name of the candidate, but also the name of any successor. The candidate and his/her successor must be of di/fferent gender.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer closes, displays and circulates the list of candidates by any other means he determines at least three weeks prior to the planned date for the first round of the election.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8",

Subject to powers expressly reserved for Shareholders' Meetings, and within the limits of the corporate purpose, the Board of Directors may deal with any issue concerning the smooth operation of the Company and will take decisions on matters concerning the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts all checks and inspections it deems necessary. Each director will receive all information necessary for the completion of their duties and may obtain any and all documents they consider to be of use. Any such request will be sent to the Chair of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Article/uni00A013 - Organisation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board elects a natural person as Chair from among its/uni00A0members.\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors organises and directs the work of the Board and reports on this to the General Meeting. The Chair ensures the proper functioning of the Company's management bodies and more particularly ensures that directors are able to complete their duties.\n\nThe Board may also appoint one or two natural persons as Deputy Chairmen. The duties of the Chair or Deputy Chairmen may be withdrawn at any time by the Board. The/uni00A0Chair's duties automatically end at the close of the General Meeting deliberating on the accounts for the year in which the Chair reaches 70/uni00A0years of age.\n\nThe Board also appoints a person to the position of Secretary, who need not be a Board member.\n\nThe Board may decide to set up committees responsible for investigating issues referred to them by either the Board or the Chair. The Board decides on the make-up and powers of committees, which carry out their work under its responsibility.\n\nDirectors receive a defined annual fixed amount as compensation for their work, the total amount of which as set by the General Meeting is maintained until a new decision is made.\n\n## Article/uni00A014 - Meetings of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board will meet as often as required in the interests of the Company. The meeting is convened by any means even orally, and at short notice in the case of urgency, by the Chair, a Vice-Chair or by one-third of its members, and is held either at the registered o/ffice or at any other place named in the notice of meeting.\n\nIn order for decisions to be valid, at least one half of Board members must be present, either in person or, where allowed by the law, by videoconference or other telecommunications methods set down by decree.\n\nDecisions are passed by a majority vote of members present or represented. In the case of a split vote, the Chair will have the casting vote.\n\nAs an exception to the previous paragraphs, and in accordance with paragraph three of Article L./uni00A0225-37 of the French Commercial Code, decisions within the specific powers of the Board of Directors set out in Article L./uni00A0225-24, in the second paragraph of Article L./uni00A0225-36 and in section I of Article L./uni00A0225103, as well as the decisions to transfer the registered o/ffice to the same administrative department, may be taken by way of a written consultation with the Directors. The Rules of Procedure specify the conditions under which this written consultation may be implemented.\n\n## Article/uni00A015 - General management\n\nThe General Management of the Company is carried out, under his/her responsibility, by either the Chair of the Board of Directors, or by any other natural person appointed by the Board of Directors with the title Chief Executive O/fficer (Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral).\n\nThe Board chooses between the two methods of General Management described above subject to the quorum and majority conditions set out by Article/uni00A013 of these Articles/uni00A0of Association. Shareholders and third parties are informed of this choice in accordance with the conditions set out in the regulations.\n\nThe chosen method will continue to apply until a contrary decision is made under the same conditions.\n\nAny change made to the general management of the Company will not lead to an amendment of these Articles/uni00A0of Association.\n\nA Board meeting is held in order to deliberate on any change to be made to the General Management of the Company at the initiative of either the Chair, the Chief Executive O/fficer or by one-third of Board members.\n\nWhere the Chair is responsible for the general management of the Company, the provisions of the law, regulations or these Articles/uni00A0of Association applicable to the Chief Executive O/fficer will also apply to the/uni00A0Chair, who will take the title of Chair and Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nIf the Board decides to separate the duties of Chair of the Board of Directors and the Company's General Management, the Board will appoint a Chief Executive O/fficer, set the length of the term of o/ffice and the extent of his/her powers. Board decisions limiting the powers of the Chief Executive O/fficer are not enforceable against third parties.",

To this end, the Strategic and CSR Committee will first examine the draft transactions referred to in Article/uni00A02.2 and formulate an opinion on the said drafts.\n\nIt reviews, at least annually, the actions taken by the Group with regard to CSR.\n\nThe work and opinions of the Strategic and CSR Committee are reported to the Board of Directors by the Chair of the Committee or by a member of the Committee appointed by the latter.\n\n## 8.3 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nAmundi's activities are governed by regulations specific to each country in which the Group operates, directly or through subsidiaries or partnerships. With regard to its main activity, asset management, Amundi is subject to numerous regulations, prudential supervision and authorisation requirements (for companies performing a regulated activity and for savings products). In addition, several Group entities, including the Company, are authorised as credit institutions and therefore subject to monitoring by banking supervisors.\n\nAmundi is subject to laws and regulations which frame asset management activities, including requirements in terms of internal organisation and good conduct, prudential requirements, investment and asset allocation rules, rules relating to the prevention of money laundering, rules relating to the identification and knowledge of clients (Know Your Customer, or 'KYC') and the rules relating to international sanctions, including those issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury, which are applicable to Amundi at international level.\n\nThe regulations applicable to Amundi are constantly evolving, particularly within the European Union ('EU'). These regulations could also change as a result of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union ('Brexit'). It should be noted that in the context of the publication on 5 November 2020 by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of its guidelines on performance fees for collective investment undertakings in transferable securities and certain types of alternative investment funds, which have been incorporated into the AMF's doctrine (DOC-2021-01 position of 5 January 2021), it is possible that the current method for calculating performance fees may be subject to adjustments in order to comply with ESMA recommendations.\n\nAny new regulations or changes in the implementation or application of the laws and regulations in force could, where applicable, have a significant impact on Amundi's activities and operating income.\n\n## 8.3.1 Regulations relating to asset management activities\n\n## 8.3.1.1 European Union\n\n## 8.3.1.1.1  General presentation\n\nAmundi's asset management activities can be divided into two main categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 portfolio management and investment advice, governed by the MiFID II regulations;\n- /uni25A0 the management of funds and other undertakings for collective investment, including UCITS-type funds and AIFs, governed by the UCITS V Directive and the AIFM Directive, respectively.\n\nIn addition to these main legislative texts, asset management activities are impacted by other regulations and reform projects at European level, such as the regulations applicable to derivative financial products (European Market Infrastructure Regulation, 'EMIR'), regulations aimed at providing a framework for the 'parallel banking system' or the regulations applicable to sustainable finance.\n\nAlthough laws and regulations vary from one country to another, the texts transposing the EU legislation in each\n\nMember State are substantially similar in all the countries in which Amundi operates, in particular in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Luxembourg. However, the legislative transposition of the Directives in each European country or their interpretation by local supervisory authorities may give rise to di/fferent approaches and in some cases delays.\n\n## European passport system\n\nOne of the objectives of the European regulatory framework is to facilitate the cross-border marketing of investment products in Europe. The European passport allows a management company that has been authorised by the regulator of its country of origin to conduct its activities in the EU or signatory states of the agreement on the European Economic Area ('EEA') within the scope of the free provision of services and freedom of establishment. A management company that wishes to conduct activities, for which it has been approved, in another State must inform the competent authorities of its origin Member State. In the host Member State, the management company may only conduct the activities covered by the approval granted in its origin Member State.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn terms of asset management, a passport may be granted for three types of activity: (i) UCITS management, (ii) AIF management and (iii) portfolio management for a third party. The passport may also cover other investment services such as receiving/transmitting orders and executing orders on behalf of third parties. The passport system allows Amundi entities to benefit from conducting cross-border activities in the EU.\n\n## Capital requirements\n\nIn accordance with the various regulatory regimes applicable to asset management activities, several Group entities are subject to minimum capital requirements, generally equal to the highest of the following amounts: 25% of the overheads of the previous year, or 0.02% of the assets under management (plus an additional 0.01%, as a minimum, of the value of the AIF portfolios managed for the regulated entities subject to the AIFM Directive). These capital requirements are significantly more restrictive than those applicable to Amundi under the current banking regulations. See paragraph/uni00A08.3.2 'Banking regulations applicable to Amundi'.\n\n## Regulations applicable to compensation policies\n\nThe AIFM and UCITS V Directives, as well as the CRD IV banking regulations, govern the remuneration policies of credit institutions, investment service providers and AIF managers in order to ensure that these policies are compatible with the principles of good risk management (see section/uni00A02.4 'Compensation of identified sta/ff').\n\n## 8.3.1.1.2  Regulations applicable to the provision of/uni00A0investment services\n\n## Applicable legal framework\n\nThe Group's investment service providers are obliged to comply with the MiFID II regulatory framework governing the provision of these services, including portfolio management activities, also known as discretionary management, as well as investment advice and the order receipt and transmission service.\n\nThis regulation sets out, in particular, (i) requirements in terms of internal organisation, (ii) obligations of good conduct to ensure the protection of investors through enhanced information requirements, assessments of adequacy and suitability for clients, the execution of orders under the most favourable conditions for clients and rules for handling client orders, (iii) enhanced management of the commissions paid in connection with the provision of investment advice, (iv) an increase in preand post-trading transparency requirements and their extension to additional financial instruments, and (v) an increase in the powers of the competent authorities. The applicable rules then depend on the type of client, with a high degree of protection for non-professional clients and, conversely, flexibility allowed in relations with professional investors.\n\n## Enhanced information requirements\n\nMiFID II imposes increased obligations on investment service providers in terms of client information when providing investment services, particularly investment advice. Regulated\n\nentities must provide clear and appropriate guidelines and warnings regarding the risks associated with financial instruments and, in particular, indicate to clients whether the range of instruments o/ffered to them is established or provided by entities with links and relations with the entity o/ffering the advice services. Furthermore, MiFID II introduces additional information obligations regarding the breakdown of the price of financial instruments and services. The client must be informed of the cumulative amount of costs and charges relating to investment services and ancillary services.\n\n## Regulation of commissions\n\nMiFID II reinforces the protection of investors with regard to payments that a company may receive or pay to third parties during the provision of investment services. Companies providing investment advice in an independent manner or conducting portfolio management activities are prohibited from collecting fees, commissions or monetary or non-monetary benefits from third parties. Certain minor benefits of a non-monetary nature are allowed, but the client must be clearly informed of these.\n\nIn the case of entities providing investment services other than portfolio management or independent investment advice, commissions may be received provided that these payments are intended to improve the quality of service provided to the client, are provided over time and do not impair the service provider's compliance with its obligation to act in an honest, equitable and professional manner in the interests of its clients. The client must be clearly informed of the existence, nature and amount of such commissions, in a comprehensive, precise and understandable manner, before the provision of any service.\n\nThe prohibition of commissions in respect of independent investment advice does not apply to the commissions paid to entities in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UniCredit and Banco Sabadell networks, in accordance with the distribution agreements with these networks.\n\n## 8.3.1.1.3  Regulations applicable to funds\n\n## Regulations applicable to UCITS-type funds\n\nAmundi entities that manage and market UCITS-type funds in the EU must comply with the organisational requirements and the rules of good conduct of the UCITS V Directive.\n\nIn terms of internal organisation, strict rules must be respected, including requirements relating to the management of risk and conflicts of interest, as well as the rules of good conduct, particularly in relation to information to be provided to clients and the amount of commissions. UCITS or AIF assets must be held by a depositary that is a separate entity. The activities of depositaries are governed by rules relating to entities eligible for this function, covering their tasks, responsibilities and delegation agreements.\n\nIn addition, UCITS-type funds are subject to rules relating to the allocation and diversification of assets and should not, in particular, invest more than (i) 5% of the assets in securities or money market instruments issued by the same entity or (ii) 20% of its assets in deposits with the same entity.",

        "page_content": "For each UCITS-type fund that it oversees, the management company must draw up a short document containing key information for investors (Key Investor Information Document or 'KIID'). This document must contain information on the essential elements of the UCITS-type fund concerned, in particular the identification of the UCITS-type fund, a brief description of its investment objectives and its investment policy, a presentation of past performance, associated costs and charges and the investment's risk/benefit profile. The management company must also publish a prospectus containing the information necessary for investors to be able to make an informed judgement about the investment offered to them and, in particular, the associated risks.\n\n## Regulations applicable to AIF managers\n\nAmundi's activities are impacted by the AIFM Directive which imposes strict regulatory requirements on AIF managers. AIFs are defined as entities (other than UCITS-type funds) that raise capital from a number of investors, with a view to investing this capital for the benefit of the investors in accordance with a defined investment policy. The AIFM Directive imposes additional requirements in terms of organisation, governance, information and asset allocation, and requires AIF assets to be held by depositaries that are independent of the manager and the AIF.\n\nAIF managers must draft regular reports for the competent authorities of their origin Member State on behalf of the AIFs that they manage. In particular, they must provide information on (i) the main instruments in which each AIF invests, (ii) the markets where each AIF is established or active, and the most important exposures and concentrations for each AIF. In addition, AIF managers are subject to enhanced obligations to provide investors with information. They must, for each EU AIF that they manage and for each AIF that they market in the EU, prepare an annual report no later than 6 months after the end of the financial year. Before any investment, managers must also make a list of information available to investors, including a description of the AIF investment strategy and objectives, a description of the procedures by which the AIF may change its investment strategy or policy, a description of the AIF valuation procedure and the method for fixing the price of the assets, a description of the management of the liquidity risk of the AIF and a description of all commissions, charges and expenses (including the maximum amounts of these) that are directly or indirectly borne by the investors.\n\nEuropean managers may, under certain conditions, market European or non-European AIF units or shares within the EU through the passport scheme.\n\n## Information to be provided to investors by funds incorporating a non-financial approach (France)\n\nThe Amundi Group management companies are subject to the provisions of the AMF Position - Recommendation (Doc-202003) on 'Information to be provided by collective investments incorporating non-financial approaches'. By this position, the AMF has clarified its expectations vis-\u00e0-vis management companies in terms of information provided to investors by funds incorporating non-financial approaches. This position applies to UCIs with a non-financial aspect authorised for marketing in France to a client base of non-professional investors. The information sent to investors must be proportionate to the actual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\nand measurable consideration of non-financial features. The implementation of this doctrine involves updating, if necessary, the regulatory documentation, commercial documentation and the name of the existing funds.\n\n## SFDR regulation\n\nPortfolio management companies of the Amundi Group providing a portfolio management service (undertakings for collective investment or 'UCIs', or investment mandates) or investment consultancy services are subject to the provisions of the Disclosure Regulation and, as such, must describe sustainability impacts, which more specifically consist in communicating and identifying the SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) classification applicable to financial products and complying with SFDR obligations in terms of transparency of information.\n\nThey are also required to amend, where applicable, the documentation of UCIs and mandates covered by the SFDR regulation.\n\n## Regulations applicable to money market funds\n\nMoney market funds are AIFs or UCITS-type funds investing in short-term liquid assets with the aim of offering yields comparable to those of the money market and/or preserving the value of the investment. The MMF regulation establishes uniform operating rules at European level in order to make these funds more resilient, limit the risks of financial instability and guarantee the equitable treatment of investors. This regulation applies to UCITS-type funds or AIFs for which the management and marketing are subject to approval. These new rules apply cumulatively with existing rules laid down by the UCITS and AIFM regulations, unless otherwise stipulated in the regulations.\n\nMoney market funds must obtain specific approval before being managed or marketed. The investment policy is framed by the requirements for eligible assets, concentration and diversification of asset portfolios. The fund manager must also establish a crisis simulation system as well as internal appraisal procedures to determine the credit quality of the money market instruments. Furthermore, procedures must be documented, validated, permanently applied and periodically reviewed.\n\nThe MMF regulations submit money market funds to increased transparency requirements. The assets of a money market fund must be valued at least every day, with publication of the daily valuation on the monetary fund website.\n\nMoney market funds are also subject to weekly reporting obligations relating to the composition of the portfolio, including breakdowns by maturity, credit profile, total asset value and/uni00A0net/uni00A0return.\n\n## 8.3.1.1.4  EMIR regulations\n\nAmundi activities relating to derivatives are subject to EMIR regulations on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. This regulatory framework requires (i) the centralised clearing of certain categories of standardised OTC derivatives, (ii) obligatory reporting of any derivatives transactions and (iii) the implementation of risk mitigation techniques (such as the provision of guarantees) for OTC derivatives that are not subject to centralised clearing.",

Three types of obligation have been introduced for fund managers: (i) an obligation to report securities financing transactions to trade repositories of data, (ii) an obligation to publish information on the use of securities financing transactions and swaps and (iii) a framework for the reuse of collateralised financial instruments.\n\n## Packaged investment products\n\nThe European regulations on investment products, known as PRIIPS ('Packaged Retail and Insurance-Based Investment Products') aim to standardise the pre-contractual information provided to non-professional investors (within the meaning of the MiFID II Directive) for investment products, the performance of which is based on underlying assets (such as UCITS-type funds and AIFs, structured deposits, structured bonds, unitlinked life insurance policies, etc.). The PRIIPS regulations also apply to securities or units of securitisation vehicles.\n\nThe initiator of these products must prepare a Key Information Document ('KID'), with accurate, fair and clear content, presenting the terms and conditions of the product to o/ffer the retail investor basic information and allow understanding and comparisons of the product.\n\n## 8.3.1.1.6  Sustainable finance\n\nFollowing its action plan of 8/uni00A0March 2018, the European Commission made sustainable finance one of its priorities in the implementation of the Capital Markets Union with several level 1 and 2 regulatory initiatives under discussion. The Disclosure regulation defines harmonised rules applicable to all financial market professionals, including management companies, on the subject of publishing information on sustainable investment and sustainability risks. Stakeholders are required to take ESG risks into account in their investments, and must provide information on the main negative impacts of their investment policy on these ESG factors. The regulations also provide for enhanced transparency requirements for products, highlighting ESG characteristics and so-called sustainable investments. The regulations come into effect on 10 March 2021, however the technical regulatory standards that must define the content and presentation of the information to be published by financial market professionals will only apply at a later date. The European supervisory authorities (EBA, ESMA and EIOPA) proposed in a joint statement on the application of the Disclosure regulation of 25 February 2021 to postpone the application of these technical standards to 1 January 2022.\n\nIn terms of indices, the Benchmark regulation creates two new European low-carbon indices, the EU Climate Transition Benchmark and the EU Paris-aligned Benchmark, with enhanced transparency requirements, to provide investors with improved information on the carbon footprint of companies and investment portfolios.\n\n## 8.3.1.2 France\n\nThe French regulatory framework applicable to Amundi's asset management activities mainly reflects the European framework described above.\n\n## 8.3.1.2.1  French regulatory and supervisory bodies\n\n## Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) French Prudential Supervision and/uni00A0Resolution Authority\n\nThe ACPR has a dual mission: to oversee credit institutions, investment companies (other than management companies) and insurance companies, and to ensure the protection of consumers and the stability of the financial system. In its role as a supervisory body, the ACPR grants approvals to credit institutions and investment companies and ensures compliance by these entities with the applicable laws and regulations and the conditions of their approval as well as monitoring their financial positions. The ACPR has the powers of administrative policing and sanction over the supervised entities. Certain powers of supervision and sanction with regard to credit institutions, previously entrusted to the ACPR, were transferred to the European Central Bank in/uni00A0 November 2014. See section/uni00A08.3.2.1 'The regulatory and supervisory bodies for banking'.\n\n## French Financial Markets Authority ('AMF')\n\nThe AMF is responsible for regulating and supervising the financial markets and for supervising management companies. The latter must obtain AMF approval in order to conduct their activities. The nature of this approval depends on the management activities envisaged and on the financial and organisational capacity of the applicant companies. The management companies may thus request approval for three di/fferent activities, namely: (i) UCITS management, (ii) AIF management or (iii) portfolio management for a third party. Depending on the approval granted, the management companies may also propose investment services, defined by MiFID II, such as portfolio management, investment advice or receiving and transmitting orders.\n\nWhen authorised to manage both UCITS-type funds and AIFs, management companies must comply with the regulations applicable to these two activities cumulatively, unless otherwise stipulated. The AMF monitors the compliance of management companies with the laws and regulations applicable to them and the conditions of their approval and has the power to sanction any party breaching these regulations.\n\n## 8.3.1.2.2  Provisions on the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and corruption\n\nManagement companies, investment service providers and credit institutions are required to report to an anti-money laundering unit under the authority of the French Minister of the Economy, known as Tracfin (Treatment of Information and Action Against Illicit Financial Circuits), any transaction involving sums which they know, suspect or have good reason to suspect, originate from an o/ffence punishable by a custodial sentence of more than one year or which are linked to the financing of/uni00A0terrorism.",

They are also required to implement a corruption prevention program.\n\n## 8.3.2 Banking regulations applicable to Amundi\n\n## 8.3.2.1 Regulatory and supervisory bodies for banking\n\n## The banking supervisory authorities\n\nOn 15/uni00A0October 2013, the EU adopted a regulation establishing a single supervisory mechanism for credit institutions in the euro zone and countries where there is an explicit prior consent system (opt-in) (the 'ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism'), that entrusted specific tasks to the European Central Bank (ECB) concerning the prudential supervision of credit institutions. This regulation granted the ECB, in coordination with the competent national regulators, a direct supervisory power over certain European credit institutions and banking groups, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group. As Amundi is part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, several Group entities are supervised directly by the ECB, including the Company, Amundi Finance, and the ACPR for Amundi ESR.\n\nThe ECB fully assumed its supervisory role on 4/uni00A0November 2014 as well as its responsibilities within the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism, in close coordination, in France, with the ACPR (the ACPR and the ECB thereafter, each being a 'banking supervisory authority').\n\n## Supervisory framework\n\nThe competent banking supervisory authority shall take individual decisions, instruct and issue approvals to credit institutions and investment firms and grant specific exemptions in accordance with the prevailing banking regulations. The Authority ensures observance by banks, other credit institutions and investment firms of the applicable laws and regulations and the conditions for their approval, and monitors their financial situations.\n\nThe competent banking supervisory authority may require financial institutions to comply with the applicable regulations and cease activities that may adversely a/ffect clients' interests. The competent banking supervisory authority may also require a financial institution to take necessary measures to reinforce or restore its financial position, improve its management methods and/or adjust its organisational structure and activities to achieve its objectives. If the solvency or liquidity of a financial institution or the clients' interests are, or could be, threatened, the competent banking supervisory authority may take certain provisional measures such as: submitting the establishment to specific monitoring, restricting or prohibiting the conduct of certain activities (including the collection of deposits), the settlement of certain payments, the sale of certain assets, the distribution of dividends to shareholders, and/or the payment of variable compensation. The competent banking supervisory authority may also require credit institutions to maintain their regulatory capital level and/or their liquidity ratios at a higher\n\nlevel than that required by the applicable regulations and submit them to specific liquidity requirements, including in terms of maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with the applicable regulations, the competent banking supervisory authority may impose administrative sanctions, such as warnings, fines, suspension or dismissal of directors and withdrawal of banking approval, which would lead to a winding-up procedure. The competent banking supervisory authority also has the power to appoint a provisional administrator to temporarily manage a bank that it considers to be poorly managed. Insolvency proceedings may only be opened against banks, other credit institutions or investment companies after the prior approval of the competent banking supervisory authority has been obtained.\n\n## Resolution authority\n\nIn France, the ACPR is responsible for implementing measures for the prevention and resolution of banking crises.\n\nSince 1/uni00A0January 2016, a Single Resolution Board (SRB) has been in charge of planning the preparation and resolution of decisions in such matters for cross-border credit institutions and banking groups, as well as for credit institutions and banking groups that are directly supervised by the ECB, such as the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group. The ACPR remains responsible for implementing the resolution plans in accordance with the SRB's instructions.\n\nThe 'resolution authority' refers to the ACPR, SRB and/or any other national authority authorised to exercise or participate in the exercise of internal bailout powers (including the Council of the European Union and the European Commission acting in accordance with the provisions of Article/uni00A018 of the SRM).\n\n## 8.3.2.2  Banking regulations\n\nIn France, credit institutions must comply with the financial management standards defined by the European regulations and by the Ministry of the Economy, the purpose of which is to ensure the solvency and liquidity of French credit institutions.\n\nThese banking regulations are mainly derived from the CRD IV regulations.\n\nNew banking rules amending the CRD IV regulations were adopted on 20/uni00A0May 2019: Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20/uni00A0May 2019 ('Revision of the CRD IV Directive' and, together with the CRD IV Directive, the 'CRD V Directive') and regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20/uni00A0May 2019 (the 'Revision of the CRR regulation' and, together with the CRR regulation, the 'CRR 2 regulation'; the CRR 2 Regulation and the CRD V Directive hereafter jointly referred to as the 'CRD V regulations'), both of which entered into force on 27/uni00A0June 2019.

The requirements arising from these regulations that apply to Amundi in terms of solvency and capital adequacy are described in section/uni00A05.4 'Solvency and capital adequacy' of this Universal Registration Document. In addition to these requirements, the main regulations applicable to credit institutions relate to the need to diversify the risks and liquid assets held, monetary policy, restrictions on investments in shares and the possibility of conducting other non-banking activities, reporting requirements, the implementation of an appropriate internal control system and a compensation policy compatible with sound and e/ffective risk management and the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nFinally, banking regulations impose information obligations on credit institutions. They must provide information on their objectives and policies in terms of risk management, governance procedures, compliance with capital adequacy requirements and compensation that have a significant impact on the leverage and risk profile. In addition, the French Monetary and Financial Code imposes additional information requirements on credit institutions, which must, in particular, provide information on certain financial indicators, their activities in non-cooperative States or territories, and more generally, information about their locations and activities in each State or territory.\n\nThe changes to the CRD/CRR regulation are accompanied by a new European regulatory framework specific to investment companies: the Directive and regulation of 27 November 2019, applicable from 26 June 2021. Known as IFD/IFR ('Investment Firms Directive/Regulation'), this regulation aims to establish a regulatory framework that is more in line with the size and risks of investment companies, which are often different from traditional banking risks./uni00A0The capital requirements for investment companies will therefore include business volumes and the balance sheet risk approach will be simplified. Owing to the presence of at least one credit institution, the Amundi Group remains subject to the consolidated CRD/CRR framework. However, some subsidiaries of the Amundi Group have the status of investment company and will be subject to this new scheme on an individual basis.\n\n## 8.3.2.3  Bank resolution\n\nOn 15/uni00A0May 2014, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2014/59/EU of the Parliament and of the Council, providing for the establishment of a European framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (known as 'BRRD'), transposed into French law by Order No./uni00A02015-1024 of 20/uni00A0August 2015, introducing various provisions for adapting legislation to European Union law in financial matters.\n\nThe BRRD was amended by Directive (EU) 2019/879 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20/uni00A0May 2019 amending the BRRD with regard to the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms as well as Directive 98/26/EC, (known as 'BRRD II'), which was transposed into French law by Order No. 2020-1636 of 21/uni00A0December 2020 relating to the resolution regime in the banking sector.\n\nThis regime, which includes measures for the prevention and resolution of banking crises, is designed to preserve financial stability, to ensure the continuity of the activities, services and transactions of institutions whose failure would have serious consequences for the economy, to protect depositors, and to avoid or minimise the dependency on public financial support. Accordingly, the European resolution authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, have been given extensive powers to take all necessary measures relating to the resolution of the entirety or part of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.\n\nThe resolution authorities may open a resolution procedure against a credit institution if they consider that: the failure of the institution is confirmed or likely, there is no reasonable prospect that another non-public measure would avert the institution's failure within a reasonable timeframe, a resolution measure is needed and a winding-up procedure would not accomplish the aims of the resolution described above.\n\nFollowing the opening of a resolution procedure, the resolution authorities have several tools that they may deploy with the aim of recapitalising the relevant institution or restoring its viability, under the conditions described below. They may implement the 'internal bailout' tool to reduce the nominal value of capital instruments or convert capital instruments and some of the institution's commitments into category 1 securities. The internal bailout tool is first implemented by reducing category 1 capital securities and then by reducing or converting other capital instruments followed by some of the institution's commitments.\n\nFor cooperative banking groups, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the resolution authorities favour the 'extended SPE' resolution strategy, which entails the simultaneous application of the resolution tool at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. level and that of its a/ffiliated entities. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. is the central body of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network composed of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Regional Banks and Local Banks, pursuant to Article R. 512-18 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, as well as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and BforBank as a/ffiliated members (the 'network'). In this regard and in the event of the resolution of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the entirety of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. (in its role as central body) and its a/ffiliated entities would be considered together as the extended SPE.\n\nIn the event of financial di/fficulties that may justify the initiation of a resolution procedure against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, or if the viability of the Company or group depends on it, the Company shares in circulation may be diluted by the conversion of other capital or debt instruments, whether cancelled or transferred, thus depriving shareholders of their rights.\n\nIn addition to the internal bailout tool, broader powers are conferred on the resolution authority in order to implement other resolution measures concerning defaulting institutions (or the group to which they belong), comprising in particular: the total or partial transfer of the activities of the institution to a third-party or relay institution, the separation of assets, the replacement or substitution of the institution as a debtor in respect of debt instruments, changes to the conditions of debt instruments (the maturity date and/or the amount of interest and/ or temporary suspension of payments), the removal of o/fficers from their duties, the appointment of a special administrator and the issue of new capital securities or other capital instruments.",

Group, it contributes to this ratio and is part of the monitoring and steering mechanism implemented by the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Single Resolution Fund\n\nThe Single Resolution Mechanism provides for the establishment of a single resolution fund from 1/uni00A0January 2016, which may be used by the Single Resolution Board in support of resolution plans (the 'Single Resolution Fund'). This Single Resolution Fund, financed by all banking institutions, will replace the national resolution funds implemented for major banking institutions in accordance with the BRRD. On 19/uni00A0December 2014, the Council adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/81 specifying uniform conditions of application of the regulation on the Single Resolution Mechanism with regard to ex ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund. This regulation defines the method for calculating the contributions of banks to the Single Resolution Fund, and sets out the annual contributions to be paid by banks to the latter, in proportion to the amount of their liabilities, excluding capital and deposits covered and adjusted according to risks. The Single Resolution Fund will gradually be established over an eight-year period (2016-2023) and must reach at least 1% of the amount of deposits covered by 31/uni00A0December 2023. As of July 2020, the Single Resolution Fund stood at approximately \u20ac42/uni00A0billion.\n\n8",

The main characteristics of a high-quality liquid asset are: 1) low risk and volatility; 2) ease and certainty of valuation; 3) low correlation with risky assets; and 4) listing on a developed, recognised market of a substantial size. Total high-quality liquid assets that are not already being used as collateral represent the numerator of the short-term liquidity ratio (LCR or liquidity coverage ratio, which measures 1-month liquidity in a stress situation) under the same regulations.\n\n## Account administration\n\nAccount administration or account keeping consists of entering financial instruments into an account in the name of their holder, i.e. recognising the holder's rights over those financial instruments, and keeping the corresponding assets, according to the particular arrangements for each financial instrument.\n\n## CA and SG insurers\n\nEntities belonging to the insurance companies of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale groups that have formed an agreement with Amundi for the management of their general/uni00A0assets.\n\n## Asset class\n\nAn asset class consists of financial assets that share similar characteristics. Amundi has identified the following asset classes for the monitoring of its activities: Treasury, fixed income, multiasset, equity, real, specialised and structured.\n\n## Net inflows/(outflows)\n\nOperating activities indicator not reflected in the consolidated financial statements and that corresponds to the difference between the subscription and buyback amounts of the period. Positive net inflows mean that the total amount of inflows (from client investments) is higher than the amount of outflows (from client withdrawals). Conversely, negative net inflows mean that the total amount of outflows is higher than the amount of inflows.\n\n## Net management fees\n\nNet management fees equal management fees received net of fees paid. Management fees received correspond to management fees paid by the portfolio to remunerate the management company, recognised as and when the service is rendered and generally calculated as a percentage of assets under management, along with fees paid by the funds to Amundi\n\nFinance in relation to the guarantees provided by Amundi Finance for guaranteed funds or EMTNs, turnover fees paid by the fund, and other fees of smaller amounts, such as front-end charges and securities lending and borrowing fees. Fees paid comprise commissions paid to distributors in accordance with contractual provisions, depositary and valuation fees where paid by the management company, and to a lesser extent, certain related administrative costs.\n\n## Performance fees\n\nPerformance fees are paid to the asset management company as provided by contract. They are computed on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the actual performance and the benchmark index as provided by the contract.\n\n## Upfront fees\n\nFees paid by the client that correspond to commissions paid to distributors, in accordance with contractual provisions. They are generally defined as a percentage of management fees. Upfront fees paid to distributors are capitalised and amortised over the life of the contracts.\n\n## Depositary\n\nService provider ensuring the safekeeping of securities and checking the lawfulness of management decisions taken on behalf of the UCITS-type funds./uni00A0The depositary may contractually outsource part of its functions to another establishment authorised to provide account-keeping and custody services; in particular, it may outsource the custody of assets to a 'custodian'. However, it may not outsource checks on the lawfulness of decisions taken by the management company of the UCITS-type funds.\n\n## Third-party distributors\n\nA distributor is a service provider in charge of marketing investment services and financial instruments to its client base (retail customers or institutional investors). Amundi has contracts with more than 1,000 distributors worldwide for the marketing of its products and services. The scope of Amundi's third-party distributors includes all of these distributors with the exception of partner distribution networks in France, international partner distribution networks and joint ventures.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nOperational business indicator not reflected in the Group's unaudited consolidated financial statements, corresponding to assets in portfolios marketed by the Group, whether the Group manages them, advises on them or delegates their management to an external manager. For each fund, assets under management are measured by multiplying the net asset value per unit (calculated by an external valuation agent in accordance with regulations in force) by the number of units/ shares in issue.",

        "page_content": "## ETF ( Exchange Traded Fund )\n\nETFs (exchange traded funds) or 'trackers' are stock marketlisted index funds that aim to replicate as closely as possible the performance in their benchmark index, on both the upside and downside. An ETF security trades like a normal share and can therefore be purchased or sold during market trading hours.\n\n## Formula funds\n\nType of mutual funds whose aim is to achieve, after a defined period, a value determined by the strict application of a predefined calculation formula, based on financial market indicators or financial instruments, and as the case may be to distribute income, which is determined in the same manner.\n\n## FCP mutual fund\n\nType of UCITS that issues units and has no legal personality. The investor, by buying units, becomes a joint owner of securities, but has no voting rights. The investor is not a shareholder in the fund. An FCP mutual fund is represented and managed in administrative, financial and accounting terms by a single management company, which may outsource those tasks.\n\n## Alternative investment fund (AIF)\n\nAlternative investment funds or AIFs are investment funds that are distinct from UCITS-type funds./uni00A0They raise capital from a certain number of investors to invest, in the interests of those investors, in accordance with an investment policy defined by the AIFs or their management companies.\n\n## Fund of funds\n\nA fund of funds is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS-type funds) that mainly invests in equities or units of other mutual funds.\n\nBy convention, assets held by Amundi funds invested in other funds are counted in the AuM of 'Institutional excluding CA and SG Insurers'.\n\n## Collective investment fund\n\nInvestment funds are undertakings that collectively own financial assets. In France, these funds take various legal forms that are often very specific. Most collective investments are regulated by the AMF (UCITS-type funds, AIFs, 'other AIFs' and 'other collective investments').\n\n## Multi-asset fund\n\nMulti-asset funds invest in a wide variety of securities and in various asset classes (equities, bonds, money market, etc.). Risks and returns associated with a multi-asset fund may vary greatly depending on its management objectives and the composition of its assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\n## Constant proportion portfolio insurance ('CPPI') fund\n\nType of investment fund managed using the constant proportion portfolio insurance method, which gives the fund exposure to upside in the financial markets while also providing capital protection or a capital guarantee. It is based on di/fferentiation between two types of assets in a single portfolio: dynamic assets intended to produce the returns sought, and assets providing the guarantee or protection. The breakdown of assets between these two types is reviewed regularly in order to achieve the management objective.\n\n## Open-ended fund\n\nCollective investment undertakings that may take the form of a UCITS-type fund, AIF or other, that are open to both nonprofessional and professional investors.\n\n## Sovereign fund\n\nInternational investment fund owned by a State or a State's central bank.\n\n## Structured fund\n\nType of investment fund that generally features guarantees or protection on some or all of the amounts invested, mainly comprising two large families: formula funds and constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds.\n\n## Alternative asset management\n\nInvestment strategies intended to achieve returns showing low correlation with market indices. Strategies cover various investment processes, risks and returns targets, and can be used to meet a wide range of objectives. Investors access these strategies either indirectly (via 'funds of hedge funds') or directly (via 'hedge funds').\n\n## Asset management for third parties\n\nProcess by which an investor (individual or institutional) delegates the financial management of its capital/savings to a financial intermediary, of which the management company is the most common institutional form. Asset management for third parties comprises (i) portfolio management or customised mandate-based management for individuals, companies or institutional investors, and (ii) collective management through collective investment undertakings (mutual funds).\n\n## Discretionary management\n\nInvestment service consisting of managing, on a discretionary and customised basis, portfolios that include one or more financial instruments as part of a mandate given by a third party.\n\n## Passive or index-based management\n\nInvestment strategy intended to replicate as accurately as possible the performance of a benchmark index.",

Institutional clients include sovereign funds, pension funds, insurers, other financial institutions and non-profit organisations. Amundi's 'Institutional' business also covers Corporates, Employee Savings and Retirement schemes, and CA and SG Insurers.\n\n## Seed money investments\n\nAmundi capital invested in order to launch funds before they are marketed. The intention is for this capital to be gradually replaced by capital invested by clients.\n\n## Managed account\n\nManaged accounts are covered by the AIFM Directive, and are investment funds that give investors access to alternative management in a regulated environment, while limiting the main operational risks. These alternative funds are under the control and oversight of the operator of the managed account platform, who delegates the financial management of a portfolio to a third-party manager. That manager has the task of replicating some or all of the investment strategy used in its reference fund. This operational arrangement is intended to limit exposure to the third-party manager to its performance drivers only. The aim of a managed account is to give investors greater operational security, independent risk management through greater transparency, and in general improved liquidity.\n\n## Management mandates\n\nInvestment service consisting of managing, on a discretionary and customised basis, portfolios that include one or more financial instruments as part of a mandate given by a third party.\n\n## Net fee margin\n\nThe net fee margin corresponds to net fee income for the period divided by average assets under management (excluding joint ventures) during the same period, expressed in basis points.\n\n## Structured bonds (or EMTNs)\n\nDebt securities issued by financial institutions that have similar economic characteristics to those of a formula fund (as opposed to a standard bond), since redemption and interest payments depend on a mathematical formula that may include one or more underlyings that may be very diverse in nature (equities, indices, funds, funds of funds, etc.).\n\n## OPCI (real-estate mutual fund)\n\nA real-estate mutual fund (OPCI) takes the form of either a variable-capital real-estate-focused investment company or a real-estate investment fund, and its purpose is to invest in properties intended for rental or properties that it has built exclusively in order to rent out, which it owns directly or indirectly, including buildings not yet completed, as well as to carry out all operations involved in using or reselling such properties, all types of works on these properties including operations relating to their construction, renovation and upgrading with a view to letting them out, and on an ancillary basis to manage financial instruments and deposits.\n\n## UCITS-type funds (undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities)\n\nPortfolio of securities (shares, bonds, etc.) managed by professionals (management companies) and owned collectively by individual or institutional investors. There are two types of UCITS-type funds: SICAVs (variable-capital investment companies) and FCPs (mutual funds).\n\n## Voluntary investment\n\nProprietary investments carried out by Amundi, as opposed to investments for third parties.\n\n## Basis point (BP)\n\nA basis point is equal to 0.01% or 1/10,000.\n\n## Privileged\n\nNotion qualifying Amundi's commercial relationship with certain distributors that provide specific services and implement particular efforts to promote its products. The agreements formalising these relationships do not, however, provide for any exclusivity.\n\n## Derivative\n\nFinancial instrument whose value varies as a function of the price of an underlying, which may be of a different nature (equity, index, currency, interest rate, etc.). The derivative gives its holder exposure to fluctuations in the underlying without the holder having to buy or sell it itself. Derivative contracts may take various forms (swaps, forwards, futures, options, CFDs, warrants, etc.).\n\n## Guaranteed product/fund\n\nDebt security or mutual fund where the achievement of the target capital repayment/return is guaranteed by a credit institution.",

The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's raison d'\u00eatre ('Acting in the interests of our clients and society every day') is inconsistent with a statutory concept and was formulated in the context of the Group Project and the 2022 MTP.\n\n## Retail\n\nClient segment including the following distribution channels: French Networks, International Networks, Third-party Distributors and Joint-Ventures.\n\n## Smart beta\n\nInvestment strategy involving management processes based on indices other than those that weight stocks by market capitalisation, e.g. 'anti-benchmark\u00ae' management by TOBAM.\n\n## Portfolio management company\n\nInvestment service provider whose main activity is managing assets for third parties (individually through a management mandate or collectively through a UCITS-type fund) and which is subject to AMF authorisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spread\n\nIn general, a spread is a differential between two rates. The term's precise definition varies according to the type of market in relation to which it is used.\n\n## Tracking error\n\nTracking error is an asset management risk measurement used in portfolios that track indices or are compared with a benchmark index. It is the annualised standard deviation of the di/fferences between portfolio returns and benchmark index returns.\n\n## Value at risk (VaR)\n\nValue at Risk represents an investor's maximum potential loss on a financial asset or portfolio of financial assets, which should only be reached with a given probability over a given timeframe. In other words, it is the worst loss expected over a given timeframe for a certain confidence level. VaR can be regarded as a quantile of the distribution of profits and losses associated with holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a given period.\n\n8",
