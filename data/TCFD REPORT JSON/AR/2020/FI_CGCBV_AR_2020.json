The COVID-19 pandemic affected our business especially during the /first two quarters, but we acted decisively, securing our pro/fitability whilst making good progress in our strategy execution.\n\n## Business area performances varied\n\nThe pandemic situation had a clear impact in all our business areas, and orders received decreased by 16 percent compared to the previous year. The situation improved steadily throughout the second half of the year. In fact, the orders for Hiab solutions and Kalmar mobile equipment increased year-on-year in the fourth quarter. In the uncertain environment, customers still hesitated with larger investments, which was visible in MacGregor and in Kalmar's automation and project business where we saw postponements.\n\nOur order backlog was strong as we entered 2020, which helped us cope with the pandemic crisis early on. In fact, sales increased in Kalmar's project business and in MacGregor. Sales declined in Hiab and Kalmar's mobile equipment, where the lead times are shorter. This was a result of the drop in their orders received in the /first half of the year. We enter 2021 with a healthy order backlog especially in Hiab and Kalmar's mobile equipment business.\n\nI am pleased with the robust performance of our service business, producing 31 percent of our sales. The sales of our eco portfolio increased as well, totalling 24 percent of our sales in 2020. Our target in 2021 was to double the sales growth in our eco portfolio compared to traditional products, and we achieved that ahead of schedule. It is evident that our customers are increasingly moving towards sustainable solutions, preferring our electric and hybrid solutions over internal combustion engines.\n\nRead more online\n\n6",

Nevertheless, during the pandemic crisis we have defended our pro/fitability and kept our comparable pro/fit margin at a healthy level. Supported by a successful TTS synergy and restructuring work, MacGregor returned to black numbers in the second half of the year.\n\nTo minimise the effects of the pandemic, we initiated temporary cost savings in April-August, which produced ca. EUR 10 million monthly savings. This was also a powerful demonstration of how our processes and tools allow us to quickly change our ways of working and safeguard our employees and our /financial performance. Towards the end of the year, we shifted our focus from temporary measures to more structural savings. In fact, our headcount at the end of the year was approximately 1,000 lower than one year ago.\n\nIn 2020, we initiated a strategic evaluation of the software solutions and services provider Navis to support its future development. In December, the Board of Directors decided to initiate the actual sales process of the Navis software business. During the year, we also sold our share of RainbowCargotec Industries Co., Ltd joint venture in China, completed the TTS integration with MacGregor, and - to strengthen our customer access, local presence and competitiveness in China - established a joint venture with CSSC Nanjing Luzhou Machine Co., Ltd. These actions support our strategic direction going forward.\n\n## 'Our customers are increasingly moving towards sustainable solutions'\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\n## Merger with Konecranes will create a global leader in sustainable material flow\n\nIn October, we announced the plan to combine Cargotec and Konecranes through a merger. In December, the extraordinary general meetings of both companies resolved to approve the merger, which was the unanimous recommendation of the Boards of Directors of both companies.\n\nCargotec and Konecranes are well positioned in their markets - in industries, factories, ports, terminals, road and sea-cargo handling. Together with Konecranes, a company with a similar pro/file and shared ambitions, we will have the opportunity to make an even larger impact on global material /flows.\n\nThe work to /finalise the merger continues in 2021. Completion is expected in January 2022, provided that all conditions for the completion are being ful/filled.\n\n## Progress in strategic targets\n\nWe re/fined our strategy for the period 2019-2021 with services, digitalisation and productivity as the main drivers in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic slowed our progress, but we held fast to our targets and saw robust development in digitalisation and services in particular. All in all, service and software sales accounted for 36 percent of our consolidated sales.\n\nIn 2020, we continued to increase our research and development investments (105 million euros vs. 102 million euros in 2019) and extended our service offering further towards intelligent solutions. This enables us to serve our customers on a wide scale throughout the lifespan of their solutions.\n\nWe have made good progress in developing our digital service offering. Our equipment data provides valuable insight to our customers on how their equipment is performing in the /field. This makes it possible to pinpoint and schedule service operations exactly where and when needed. The equipment data also gave us a good idea of the activity levels of cargo /flows and logistics in different segments and geographical locations. This was valuable when estimating how our industry was coping in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, for example.\n\n## The importance of sustainability and safety increases\n\nThe strategic importance of sustainability continues to increase at Cargotec. In May, we committed to the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign. We aim to reduce our CO 2 emissions from raw material sourcing and product use phase by at least 50 percent from the 2019 levels by 2030, and reach carbon neutrality in our own operations by 2030. With these actions, we strive to make the logistics industry more sustainable and enable a lower-carbon economy.\n\nWe received several orders that highlight the sustainable capabilities of our offering. MacGregor received its largest single vessel order to supply a mission-critical system on an offshore wind foundation installation vessel. In June, Kalmar got an order for eco-ef/ficient mobile equipment from Australia and, in September, an order for 20 hybrid straddle carriers from the US.\n\nWe are dedicated to safeguarding the health and safety of our personnel. Even in the midst of the pandemic crisis we paid special attention to ensuring safe working conditions both to our customers and our own employees. 1 I am glad to note that we did not have major COVID-19 outbreaks at any of our sites. We also achieved our IIFR 2 targets for 2020, bringing down the injury rate at many of our assembly sites.\n\nI would like to thank all Cargotec employees for their hard work during this extraordinary year. It delights me to see that, despite the challenges during 2020, our Compass employee satisfaction survey showed healthy improvements in many areas.\n\nI would also like to thank our shareholders for the trust they have placed in us and Cargotec's Board of Directors for its continuing support during these unprecedented times.\n\nMika Vehvil\u00e4inen\n\nCEO, CARGOTEC\n\n7",

The service business remained resilient and the share of the eco-ef/ficiency portfolio sales increased to 24 percent of the total sales.\n\nSales decreased from the previous year. However, the decline was partly offset by an increase in the share of the stable service and software business. Market uncertainty affected customers' decision making especially in the second and third quarters. Orders received decreased by 16 percent from 2019.

The following megatrends are relevant in the successful implementation of our strategy, shifting weights as we continuously adapt our business model.\n\n## Climate crisis calls for action\n\n## Customer need:\n\nThe UN considers climate change as the de/fining crisis of our time. The science shows record high temperatures and greenhouse gas concentration levels in the atmosphere. The science is warning about devastating consequences of climate change to people's health and economies. Our customers need sustainable solutions which help in the transition to a low-carbon society and meet all the regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our answer:\n\nCargotec is committed to the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Our eco portfolio includes digital and automation solutions, electric and hybrid offerings that reduce the environmental impact of our customers' operations. The demand for eco-ef/ficient products and solutions is estimated to grow in the future, creating growth opportunities for us.\n\nAn example: Electric versions of Kalmar's empty container handlers, terminal tractors, forklift trucks. MacGregor's offshore wind offering.\n\n## Population growth\n\n## Customer need:\n\nThe world's population today is about 7.7 billion and estimated to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 with, according to the United Nations, most of the growth taking place in Sub-Saharan Africa. The increasing global population drives the consumption of goods and materials. This fuels global trade which in turn increases the demand for cargo transportation.\n\n## Our answer:\n\nWith our advanced solutions, equipment, services and software all across the global cargo /flow network, we continue to seek ways to meet the increasing demand in an ef/ficient way and improve the productivity of cargo handling in all our business areas.\n\nAn example: Kalmar One (an open automation system for container terminals).\n\n## Urbanisation\n\n## Customer need:\n\nIn the coming decades, the share of the world's population living in cities will grow from 55 percent to almost 70 percent. Urbanisation requires infrastructure and housing construction in cities, with city logistics to sustain them. This creates demand for ef/ficient load handling and waste management equipment and solutions. In densely populated cities, load handling solutions must be quiet, safe and low in emissions.\n\n## Our answer:\n\nOur load handling solutions are designed to be used in urban locations and surrounding areas. Hiab's advanced on-road load handling solutions are well suited for construction, logistics and waste handling use in urban locations.\n\nAn example: Electric MOFFETT truck mounted forklifts.\n\n## GDP per capita growth / World trade growth\n\n## Customer need:\n\nGlobal GDP per capita is expected to grow by roughly /five percent annually between 2020-2025, indicating continued growth in economic productivity, economic wealth, and ultimately, consumption power. The demands of the global cargo /flow network will expand as more developing countries rise. This not only drives world trade, but also expands the global trade network across the world.\n\n## Our answer:\n\nAs cargo moves across land and sea, Cargotec's business areas are present throughout the global cargo /flow network - maritime, ports and on-road. This puts us in a prime position to truly in/fluence ef/ficient global cargo /flow with our low carbon load and cargo handling solutions.\n\nAn example: MacGregor's Cargo Boost solution, aimed at improving ship utilisation and reducing fuel consumption.\n\n## Digitalisation\n\n## Customer need:\n\nThe rapid development of digital solutions continues in all areas of the society. Customers seek intelligent cargo handling solutions that can support them in optimising their operations, improve productivity and safety and reduce inef/ficiencies and emissions.\n\n## Our answer:\n\nOur business areas are present across the cargo /flow network, enabling us to draw valuable insights across the value chain. With these insights, we are able to shape the cargo handling industry by providing value adding software, automation and intelligence solutions. These solutions seek to solve inef/ficiencies in the global cargo /flow, helping our customers succeed in their endeavours while reducing environmental impact.\n\nAn example: Kalmar Insight, MacGregor OnWatch Scout, Hiab HiConnect platform.\n\n## Read more about our strategy Read more about our strategy\n\nStrategy section on cargotec.com Strategy section on cargotec.com\n\nStrategic targets and outcomes for 2020 Strategic targets and outcomes for 2020\n\nStrategy progress in 2020 Strategy progress in 2020\n\nStrategy progress in 2020 (video) Strategy progress in 2020 (video)\n\n11",

We aim to secure pro/fitable growth by focusing on four must-win battles: customer centricity, services, digitalisation and productivity. In 2020, we expressed our climate ambition by committing to become a 1.5 degree company by 2030. This ambition will be integrated as a key cornerstone of our strategy in 2021.\n\n## We want to lead the way by being the leader in intelligent cargo\n\nhandling. Cargo traffic and load handling are essential services to sustain global trade and society. Every day, millions of items, from raw materials to consumer goods, are transported across the globe. Cargotec is in a unique position to be present in all touchpoints of global cargo and load handling - on the roads, in the ports and at sea.

Inspirational and highly skilled leaders are also indispensable if we are to fully enable our talented personnel to turn our company strategy into results-oriented reality.\n\nDuring the pandemic crisis, health and safety remained our top priority and we committed to ensuring a safe work environment for everyone at Cargotec. Our speci/fic action groups monitored the situation, made quick decisions and ensured a regular /flow of communication. We complied with local regulatory recommendations as well as the WHO guidelines and applied extra measures in our locations to avoid the spread of the virus. We applied the physical distancing policy, working-from-home policy for our of/fice personnel, and applied special procedures at our assembly units to ensure continuity in the production processes. 1\n\n## Investments in leadership development continued\n\nDuring recent years, we have invested heavily in cultivating multi-skilled and inspirational leaders. To help us achieve this, we continued to implement our group-wide leadership development programmes LEAD and GROW, /first launched in 2016 and 2017 respectively.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, some leadership trainings were postponed in 2020. Nevertheless, we continued to measure participants' performance and the impact of their leadership behaviours. The results reveal that we are steadily improving our positive leadership styles, allowing us to create a more productive performance climate for our teams. More than 2,000 leaders have now participated in these programmes.\n\nOur mentorship programme, a powerful tool to support collaboration and knowledge sharing, remained active throughout 2020. It was further virtualised and was operational both at Cargotec level and across all our strategic business units.\n\nOur talent process was /fine-tuned throughout the year as well. We have been able to make our talent acquisition process more systematic, as well as gain considerable cost savings, by recruiting internal candidates and building talent pipelines that help place our employees in critical positions.\n\n## Enhancing our virtual capabilities\n\nLEARN, our e-learning experience platform, became operational in October 2019 and was further enhanced during 2020. Amidst the COVID-19 disruption, it revealed itself to have been both a smart investment and an extremely useful learning tool. Through LEARN, we were able to successfully substitute the previously normal onsite, face-to-face training and learning. In 2020, we really started to share content, exchange insights, and further leverage the platform's powerful capabilities.\n\nConnect, our social intranet at Cargotec, is another key digital platform where we were able to effectively communicate, co-create and collaborate. The platform was a critical asset for us in helping to build a stronger culture of inclusion, dialogue and openness, providing a means to exchange information about - and a tool to help cope with - the coronavirus crisis, in particular.\n\n## An enhanced feedback culture requires agile performance management\n\nOur long-running Performance and Development Plan (PDP) process remains a fundamentally important operational cornerstone, supporting us in performance management, the setting of future targets, personal development and the promotion of a feedback-rich culture. The PDP concept has now been fully systematised and implemented throughout all Cargotec entities globally.\n\n## High performance merits rewards\n\nIncentive programmes continued to reinforce our high-performance culture and pay-per-performance philosophy during 2020. Company-wide base salaries, promotions, and recruitments were frozen throughout 2020 as a cost-saving measure to protect many thousands of jobs. However, performance-based compensation and incentives continued to be implemented in all parts of our operations and remain an integral part of our compensation philosophy. Approximately 7,300 of our employees were covered by our incentive programmes during 2020.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\n## CBS seamlessly harmonises global processes\n\nCargotec Business Services (CBS) is our internal service centre. Now operational for over three years, it harnesses all the transactional /finance, indirect procurement and HR activities from different countries, centralising them using the same IT, policy and service centre landscape. From the HR perspective, CBS served around 80 percent of our total global head count at the end of 2020, compared to 57 percent of our personnel in 2019, and 25 percent in 2018. The /final countries, mostly in APAC, will be enrolled in 2021. When fully operational, CBS will allow us to deliver a completely uni/fied way of working across the whole company.\n\nIn conjunction with our ongoing CBS implementation, our HR master data system, ZONE, is an IT platform that serves as the backbone of our operations, making it possible for us to run all our people-related processes.\n\nFinally, Compass, our employee engagement survey, revealed a 5.7 percent improvement in 2020 in comparison to 2019. The survey also found that leadership data shows behavioural measures that provide a very positive incremental year on year change. This can now be seen clearly in overall employee engagement, with the results based on data analysed from approximately 11,000 respondents in 2020.\n\nMuch of the investment we have made into platforms over recent yearsparticularly in systematising processes, tools, and policies-is now successfully paying off. This was especially true during a year of unprecedented disruption. We are proud to report that our IT platforms have come into their own during an extraordinarily challenging year and our personnel have seen numerous positive bene/fits as a result.\n\nMikko Pelkonen, Senior Vice President, Human Resources tells about the decisive actions during the COVID-19 year 2020 Mikko Pelkonen, Senior Vice President, Human Resources tells about the decisive actions during the COVID-19 year 2020\n\nRead about MacGregor's TTS integration and our HR principles related to it Read about MacGregor's TTS integration and our HR principles related to it\n\nWatch a video about MacGregor's TTS integration Watch a video about MacGregor's TTS integration\n\n1 More information about the COVID-19 effects on our performance can be found in the CEO review and Sustainability section, the GRI index, the Board of Directors' report and Note 2.7 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n13",

By being a 1.5 degree company, we strive to create value for all stakeholders. We sense the urgency of climate action and consider the transformation towards a sustainable world as a major phenomenon that will change the whole industry.\n\nWe support transformation into a fair and prosperous society. With our purpose - smarter cargo /flow for a better everyday - we drive resource ef/ficiency in our industry, in order to reach a low-carbon economy and thus turn environmental challenges into opportunities. Our climate ambition can only be achieved via inclusive cooperation with all the participants in the value chain and the COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the importance of partnerships. Making the transition just and inclusive for all ties the social and good governance aspects into our climate ambition.\n\nIn 2020, sustainability became a higher priority than ever before. We have worked intensively on our climate ambition to align our operations with the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. The consequences of climate change are not only environmental, but there are also signi/ficant /financial and social impacts. To ensure /financial stability and global wellbeing also for future generations, it is our obligation to act on climate now.\n\n## We take responsibility for the environment throughout our value chain\n\nClimate change and greenhouse gas emissions are our key focus areas within the environment theme. The logistics industry is causing a signi/ficant share of the global emissions. At Cargotec, this challenge is actually perceived as a business opportunity. Manufacturing products and technologies that enable avoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors (the logistics sector, for example) is pivotal in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Cargo handling solutions are essential in ports, on vehicles and on vessels. As the wellbeing of people is dependent on uninterrupted cargo /flows, our products and solutions are necessary to keep modern society running. Cargotec has a great potential to support its customers to reduce their emissions. Moreover, our intelligent solutions are an enabler for a wider societal change towards a more circular economy.\n\nMore information about Cargotec's approach to sustainability at cargotec.com More information about Cargotec's approach to sustainability at cargotec.com\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nCargotec's eco portfolio consists of eco-ef/ficient solutions that enhance customers' sustainability with tangible environmental bene/fits.

Safety and ethical conduct are high on our agenda. Cargotec is dedicated to protecting safety and wellbeing in all our operations and also through our products, services and solutions. Safety being our priority became evident also during the COVID-19 pandemic when all possible measures were taken to keep the employees safe. We want to operate in an ethical manner and take concerns of misconduct seriously. We promote a speak-up culture and awareness of the reporting channels, including the Speak-Up line, through a variety of means.\n\nWe are a knowledge and engineering company, and our employees are an integral part of our competitiveness. We trust our people are the key in creating customer value through innovation, experimentation, learning and adapting new skills in a complex and ever changing world. We provide employees with suitable training e.g. via the new LEARN platform.\n\n## We promote good corporate governance and respect our stakeholders\n\nWe consider good governance practices, including ef/ficient risk management processes, the foundation for conducting business. Cargotec's culture of integrity starts at the top. The spirit of our compliance work is best captured by the words integrity and transparency . Most important of all, the value of integrity- the quality of upholding strong moral principles-has become part of Cargotec's culture through strong management commitment.\n\nCargotec signed the UN Global Compact in 2007. The Global Compact is a call for companies to align their strategy and operations with 10 principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The UN Global Compact helps businesses contribute towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDGs are a set of 17 goals that target achieving prosperity for the people and the planet by 2030. Companies have an important role to play since the goals cannot be reached with the actions of the public sector alone.

As a result, Cargotec's Board of Directors set our ambition to be a 1.5 degree company and we committed to the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5 campaign, joining other leading companies in promising to pursue science-based measures to tackle climate change.\n\nIn August 2020, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated and approved our targets to be in line with the latest climate science. The target is to reduce Cargotec's greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent across all three emission scopes by 2030, from a 2019 base year. Cargotec's internal goal is to become carbon neutral in its own operations, which goes beyond the required ambition level of the Science Based Targets initiative. Moreover, since more than 95 percent of the emissions occur in Cargotec's value chain (upstream and downstream activities), setting the 50 percent absolute emission reduction target in that area is vital to tackling climate change. Offering solutions that enable a low-carbon economy and support the principles of the circular economy is a great business opportunity for us, while at the same time we are also proud and excited to contribute to the global efforts of safeguarding the environment.\n\nThe breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down our climate ambition related strategy alignment work only temporarily. The work aimed at embedding the climate target to business area and functional strategies, and also collected ideas for new business opportunities. We do not want to make empty promises, but really understand where we stand today with our carbon footprint, and how far on the emission mitigation path we can get with the currently known activities and technologies. The work clari/fied the required actions in business areas and corporate functions that would enable reaching the climate ambition by 2030. Based on the work we concluded that the current strategies remain valid - intelligent cargo handling is ultimately the solution to cutting emissions in our value chain.\n\n18\n\nRead more online",

The eco portfolio draws attention to the solutions with potential to help our customers become low-carbon in their operations. Besides electri/fication, also automation and connectivity are considered as very promising measures to improve the ef/ficiency of their operations. We have been investing in software and digital businesses as we believe digitalisation will enable making cargo handling more ef/ficient and there will be increasing demand for ef/ficient solutions in the future. It will also be a major enabler for a wider societal change towards a more circular economy. Data sharing, common platforms and collaboration act as key drivers in achieving these targets and connecting industries. Eco portfolio sales accounted for 24 percent in 2020 (2019: 21%). All solutions included in the portfolio have passed an external review process.\n\n## Own operations\n\nWith full control over our own operations, we wanted to be more ambitious and make carbon neutrality our target. About 40 percent of the emissions from our own operations are related to electricity use and we are committed to increasing the share of renewable electricity to 50 percent by 2021 and to 100 percent by 2030. At the end of 2020, the share of renewable electricity reached 44 percent in our own operations. The map on the right highlights the share of renewable electricity in our main locations. The fuel usage by our service /fleet is another big contributor to the emissions of our own operations. In order to mitigate those emissions and reach carbon neutrality, the plan is to increase remote services and use biofuels or electric vehicles. While reaching carbon neutrality may require compensation for the remaining emissions that cannot be mitigated, we focus primarily on cutting the emissions in our value chain.\n\nSee GRI index 2020 for sustainability data See GRI index 2020 for sustainability data\n\nRead more about the eco portfolio at cargotec.com Read more about the eco portfolio at cargotec.com\n\nRead why Cargotec is measuring its handprint at cargotec.com Read why Cargotec is measuring its handprint at cargotec.com\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n19",

We were able to bring the rate down at many of our assembly sites, with about 40 percent of them achieving zero incident levels. Kalmar and Hiab assembly sites have performed exceptionally well, achieving an IIFR of 1.7 and 4.6, respectively.\n\nWe have set a new IIFR target rate of <5.0 for 2021 across the whole organisation, now also including the non-assembly units.

We support diversity by ensuring equal opportunities, rights and treatment for all. Furthermore, as stipulated in the charter, we support fair and inclusive organisation, customer orientation, transparent interaction and cooperation, as well as fair management.

Empowering the local management was crucial to enable them to act according to the guidance from their national governments and local health authorities. We have also followed the WHO recommendations.\n\nThe pandemic brought additional complexity to the safety management to ensure the health and safety of our personnel. An array of preventive measures has been deployed such as limiting the access of external guests, applying work from home policies, providing additional personal protective equipment and guidance for the employees. We created special communication channels to provide updates and feedback channels for our employees. Lock-down periods and temporary working time reductions at our assembly sites have also impacted our safety activities, especially during the second\n\n## Shareholders\n\nTo safeguard /financial continuity, Cargotec had to introduce temporary saving measures. Besides the working time reductions, several other measures were also implemented. These include delay of salary reviews and promotion increases, reduced external workforce, limited new external hires, and limited travel and meetings. The cost saving measures resulted in approximately 10 MEUR savings per month during the restrictions (Q3/2020), and together with productivity improvements we managed to keep our comparable operating pro/fit margin at a reasonable level despite lower sales. In addition to cost saving measures, Cargotec prepared for the\n\n## Customers\n\nOur customers keep the whole world up and running.

The Cargotec Leadership Team decided to act rapidly when the pandemic hit and implemented measures to protect both the health of employees as well as the /financial stability of the company. More information about our COVID-19 pandemic actions is available in the Board of Directors' Report and Note 2.7 to the consolidated /financial statements and in the GRI index.\n\nquarter of the year. Overall, we were able to ensure the safety of our own employees and have not had major COVID-19 outbreaks at any of our sites.\n\nAbout 80 percent of our white-collar employees were temporarily laid off in AprilAugust. At the same time, around 200 Cargotec executives voluntarily committed to reducing their pay by 20 percent. These actions helped to limit the need for permanent cost reductions.\n\nDuring the year, Cargotec's HR team launched a regular pulse survey to gather honest feedback from employees. The results showed that, as expected, there was anxiety among the employees, but they still helped map out areas that needed special attention. Furthermore, employee engagement has gone up by over 5 percent compared to the engagement survey in 2019.\n\npotential instability in the /financial markets by drawing EUR 250 million of longterm bank loans in April.\n\nReal-time data on world trade from our connected equipment, namely Kalmar mobile equipment running hours and Hiab loader cranes' activity index, indicates economic recovery. About half of the merchant ships in the world carry our equipment, while every fourth container move is being handled by our solution. The real-time data is collected from tens of thousands of pieces of equipment that are connected and operated by our customers. This data gives us a good idea of the activity levels of cargo /flows in different segments and geographical locations.\n\nsome customers' businesses have been busier than ever. In the case of Kalmar, a number of new services were initiated to help businesses that handle cargo at ports protect the immediate health and safety of their employees. With social distancing directives, pressure for businesses to ensure continuous operations is intense and recognition of the advantages offered by connected solutions, such as remote monitoring and condition-based maintenance in preventing costly interruptions.\n\n## Investors\n\nThe global pandemic has also had an impact on our investors, and we communicated with investors and analysts primarily via digital channels. Cargotec's IR blog published a corona update on a weekly basis during the /first months of the outbreak. We have also produced more digital content and launched the concept of digital Q&A in social media to address the demand of transparent information sharing.\n\nThe pandemic has not only made the markets cautious, but also social aspects have become even more of a focus for our investors. The social aspect of the pandemic has brought the topics of mitigating safety risks even higher on the agenda. Responding effectively, not only to the /financial challenges resulting from the pandemic, but also to the health aspects has brought additional complexity for global organisations.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nOur sourcing organisations increased cooperation with suppliers in order to mitigate the potential delivery risk, which had increased as a result of the global pandemic. The teams spent an excessive amount of time and resources on monitoring our supply continuity to secure the materials supply and to provide stability to our operations.\n\nIn regard to sustainability risk assessment, a new way of working was set up to adapt to the travel restrictions. The teams established a new audit process that starts with self-sustainability assessment by the supplier and then an online review follows in order to check for the proof of evidence.\n\n21",

The Cargotec class B share is listed at Nasdaq Helsinki and the Company complies with the rules and guidelines of Helsinki Stock Exchange and the Finnish Financial Supervision Authority as well as with all the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020, published by the Securities Markets Association (www.cg/finland./fi).\n\nThe corporate governance statement has been reviewed by the Board's Audit and Risk Management Committee on 2 February 2021. It is issued as a separate report and disclosed, together with the /financial statements and Board of Directors' report, on the Company website. Up-to-date information on governance and remuneration is available on the website.\n\nCargotec's shareholders exercise the highest decision making power at the Shareholders' meeting.

The meeting adopted the /financial statements, consolidated /financial statements and the remuneration policy as well as granted discharge from liability to the CEO and the members of the Board of Directors for the /financial year 1 January-31 December 2019. The meeting approved the distribution of dividends and appointed members of the Board of Directors and the Auditor.\n\nCargotec's Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) was held on 18 December 2020. At the EGM, the shareholders resolved the merger of Konecranes Plc into Cargotec Corporation and approved the Merger plan signed by both companies' Board of Directors on 1 October 2020. Conditional on the completion of the merger, the EGM also decided on the amendment of the articles of association of Cargotec and the issuance of shares in Cargotec as merger consideration to the shareholders of Konecranes, on the establishment of the shareholders' nomination board, and on authorising the Board to decide on an issue of shares without payment in which each shareholder in Cargotec will be issued new shares in the Company without payment in proportion to their holdings (share split).

Some of these meetings were held remotely or the resolutions were recorded without convening. Attendance in the meetings is reported in the table further below. The Board agrees annually on focus areas for the coming year. The key themes on the Board's agenda are Cargotec's strategic focus areas, which in the strategy period 2019-2021 are customer centricity, services, digitalisation and productivity. Cargotec's business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor and their R&D activities were discussed in speci/fic theme meetings. The Board monitored the integration and /financial performance of companies that had joined the group as result of acquisitions. The Board handled the strategically important sustainability themes in several meetings and approved Cargotec's commitment to the United Nations Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C to mitigate climate change. The Board was informed regularly on the challenges and effects of the coronavirus pandemic to the customers, business and personnel. The Board handled the possibility to merge with Konecranes Plc and monitored the combination project, due diligence analysis and negotiations.

The Board nominates the members and the Chairmen of the committees from among its members annually in its organising meeting and con/firms the committees' written charters. The committees have no independent decision-making power, but prepare issues to be resolved by the Board.\n\n## Audit and Risk Management Committee\n\nThe committee's duty is to supervise the /financial reporting executed by the management, and to monitor the /financial statement and interim reporting process. In accordance with its charter, the committee supervises the adequacy and appropriateness of the Company's internal control, internal audit and risk management, the development of operative and strategic risks and risk management, and handles Internal Audit plans and reports. Furthermore, the committee prepares a proposal to the AGM regarding the election and fees of the external auditor, and monitors the statutory audit of /financial statements and consolidated /financial statements. The committee de/fines and monitors the non-audit services performed by the auditing /firm to ensure the auditor's independence. Cargotec's Board has con/firmed a Non-audit services policy for de/fining the permitted non-audit services purchased from the auditors. Violations against Cargotec's Code of Conduct are reported to the committee. The committee also reviews the Corporate governance statement and the Non/financial information report.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee consists of a minimum of three members of the Board of Directors. In addition, the CEO, CFO and Head of Internal Audit as well as representatives of the auditing /firm attend the meetings. The directors of Group Control, Treasury, Taxes, Legal, Risk Management and Ethics & Compliance report to the committee on a regular basis. If the matters to be dealt with so require, the committee convenes without the presence of the Company's management.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee was chaired by Teuvo Salminen and its members were Ilkka Herlin and Kaisa Olkkonen. Committee members are independent of the Company and, with the exception of Ilkka Herlin, independent of major shareholders. Committee members possess years of experience in business management duties.\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nIn 2020, the committee met ten times. The meeting attendance is reported in the above table. Along with /financial, treasury, tax, risk management and compliance issues, the committee acquainted itself with the integration of the TTS Group, acquired in 2019, sales 3rd party risk management, implementation of vendor controls in front line units and information security risk management. The committee monitored the audit tender process organised in 2020, handled the audit tenders received by the Company and prepared the proposal regarding the auditor to be presented to the AGM. The committee monitored the preparation of the Cargotec-Konecranes merger prospectus and the pro forma /figures and working capital calculations of the merging entity. The committee held an annual self-assessment discussion to review whether its performance needs to be developed.\n\n## Nomination and Compensation Committee\n\nThe committee prepares a proposal to Cargotec's AGM concerning the composition and remuneration of the Board of Directors. The committee prepares the remuneration policy and remuneration report for the Company's governing bodies, i.e. the Board, the CEO and the deputy CEO, if such is appointed. The committee discusses annually the Board's diversity principles and follows if the diversity target is met. The committee prepares a proposal to the Board regarding the appointment of the CEO and the terms of employment. The committee prepares Cargotec's long- and short-term incentive programmes and follows their outcome and functionality, and prepares the nomination and remuneration issues of other top management members as needed before Board approval.\n\nThe committee consists of a minimum of three Board members. The committee convenes as needed but at least three times a year. Ilkka Herlin acted as chairman of the committee, and the members were Tapio Hakakari, Peter Immonen, Jorma Eloranta until 27 May 2020 and Teresa KemppiVasama as of the same date. Committee members are independent of the Company. The CEO and the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, attended the committee meetings, except when they themselves were the subject of discussion.\n\nIn 2020, the committee convened eight times. The meeting attendance is presented in the above table. In accordance with the annual cycle, the committee's agenda comprised top management incentive programmes and their outcome, top management reviews and compensation as well as talent\n\nreview follow-up. The committee prepared the remuneration policy for the governing bodies presented to the AGM in 2020. The committee discussed the Board's diversity principles and saw to it that the diversity criteria were met when preparing its proposal concerning the Board composition to the AGM in 2020. Board member Jorma Eloranta informed the committee that he was not going to stand for re-election and the committee proposed that the number of members be decreased to eight and all other current members be re-elected. In the autumn the committee prepared for Board approval a new Restricted Share Unit Programme that is intended to function as a bridge programme for the transition period before the closing of the merger of Cargotec and Konecranes Plc and forming the combined company in the merger. The aim of the programme is to align the objectives of the shareholders and the key employees, to secure business continuity during the transition period, and to retain key employees at the Company.\n\n## CEO\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints Cargotec's CEO and determines the related terms of employment, de/fined in a written employment contract. The CEO is responsible for ensuring that the targets, plans, guidelines and goals set by the Board are carried out within Cargotec. According to the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act, the CEO ensures that the accounting practices of the Company comply with the law and that /financial matters are handled in a reliable manner. The Board evaluates the performance of the CEO and the achievement of the targets it has set to him. Cargotec's CEO is Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen, Master of Science (Economics).\n\n## Leadership Team\n\nSupporting the CEO in his duties, the Leadership Team is responsible for business development and the Company's operational activities in accordance with the targets set by the Board of Directors and the CEO. The Leadership Team also de/fines operative principles and procedures in accordance with the guidelines set by the Board. The Leadership Team concentrates on the strategic issues of the group and the business areas. The agenda regularly includes reports and issues concerning /financial development, governance, human resources, sustainability and development projects. The Leadership Team members report to Cargotec's CEO. The CEO's and the Leadership Team's CV details are available on the Company website. The CEO remuneration is described in the Remuneration report 2020 and the remuneration of the Leadership Team can be found on the Company website at www.cargotec.com.\n\n27",

The internal control and risk management principles, guidelines, practices and responsibilities pertaining to the Company's /financial reporting process have been designed to ensure that the /financial reports disclosed by Cargotec are reliable and meet the requirements of the law, regulations and Company principles. Instructions regarding the publication of /financial information and external communications are included in Cargotec's Disclosure policy approved by the Board of Directors. This is available on the Company intranet and website. Investor Relations together with Corporate Communications are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of and compliance with the policy.\n\nTo prevent /financial and other misconduct, Cargotec has instructions for principles and process for raising concerns. The SpeakUp line gives an opportunity to anonymously raise concerns of possible misconduct or other matters that may not be in line with Company values and policies. The reporting channel is provided by an external partner, to ensure anonymity. All reports are investigated and processed in con/fidence by the Ethics and Compliance team. Corrective and disciplinary actions are discussed and agreed in the Code of Conduct panel of Cargotec Leadership Team.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe objective of Cargotec's internal control is to ensure that its operations are ef/ficient and pro/fitable, that risk management is adequate and appropriate, and that /financial and other information produced is reliable. Cargotec's internal control is based on the Company's Code of Conduct and internal controls. With respect to the /financial reporting process, these are supported by policies and guidelines, as well as the internal /financial reporting process and communication. Cargotec's Internal control policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, speci/fies the applicable control principles, procedures and responsibilities. Similarly to other Cargotec operations, responsibility for internal control is divided into three tiers. The line management is principally responsible for internal control. This is backed by corporate support functions, which de/fine instructions applicable across the Company and\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nRead more online\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nsupervise risk management. Internal and external audits form the third tier, their task being to ensure that the /first two tiers function effectively.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe role of Cargotec Internal Audit is an independent and objective assurance and consulting activity that is guided by a philosophy of adding value and improving the operations of Cargotec and its businesses. It helps and supports the business organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. To ensure the independence of the Internal Audit function, the Head of Internal Audit reports functionally to the Audit and Risk Management Committee, and administratively to the CFO. Internal Audit develops a /flexible risk based audit plan which is approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee.\n\n## Risk management\n\nCargotec's risk management is guided by the Enterprise risk management policy, approved by the Board of Directors. It speci/fies the objectives and principles of risk management as well as the process and responsibilities involved. Risk management is to be naturally built into all business decisions and plans. The core principle is continuous, systematic and preventive action taken to identify risks, de/fine the Company's risk appetite, assess and handle risks and, if they materialise, deal with them effectively.\n\nThe Board of Directors de/fines the overall risk appetite of the Company and ensures that the organisation has suf/ficient risk management and control. The CEO and the Leadership Team are responsible for the methods, implementation and supervision of risk management. Cargotec's risk management is spread across units and corporate support functions that assign responsibility for risk management and that are in charge of identifying, managing and reporting risks. The Risk Management function is responsible for reporting any /findings to the CEO and Leadership Team, and reports quarterly to the Board's Audit and Risk Management Committee on the risk reviews, identi/fied risks and mitigation plans.\n\nFinancial risks are managed centrally by the Corporate Treasury and reported on for corporate management and the Audit and Risk Management Committee on a regular basis. Board of Directors' report includes an estimate on the Company's main risks and uncertainties and short-term risks.\n\n## Financial reporting process\n\nThe effectiveness of internal control measures related to /financial reporting is monitored by the Board of Directors, the Audit and Risk Management Committee, the CEO, the Leadership Team and business area management teams. Various control measures, such as reconciliations, logic analyses and comparative analyses are performed at different organisational levels. The purpose of these control measures is to detect, prevent and correct any errors and deviations in /financial follow-up. Cargotec's /financial reporting is based on monthly performance monitoring in a centralised reporting system. Financial reports are /first reviewed at a reporting unit level, and then at the operative management's review meetings on a division level, followed by business area level and group management level reviews. Finally, the reports are discussed at the Leadership Team's meeting. Financial information is also reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. Controllers report any deviations from the plans to the management teams, analyse the reasons for such deviations and support the management in decision-making. Monthly reviews also ensure that performance is in line with annual targets and that /financial forecasts are up to date.\n\nThe /financial reporting and planning instructions (Cargotec accounting standards and Cargotec reporting manual) are available to all employees on Cargotec's intranet. The Company's /finance function aims to harmonise the practices and procedures applied by controllers, while ensuring consistent interpretation of instructions and further improving them. Cargotec Business Services offer shared /financial, HR and indirect procurement services for Cargotec companies and target a harmonised way of working with common processes, controls and tools.\n\nA corporate-wide development programme regarding internal controls has clari/fied and reinforced the shared principles and ways of working and strengthened internal control. The programme's processes are part of the company's daily operations and help ensure compliance with Cargotec's Code of Conduct and internal policies. Multifaceted reporting tools, based on common systems, have been developed to support the /financial performance monitoring and comparability.\n\n31",

This report includes information concerning remuneration of the Board of Directors ('Board') and the CEO of Cargotec between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2020. The Report is based on the Recommendations on Corporate Governance Code 2020 in Finland as well as the provisions to the Finnish Securities Market Act and Limited Liability Companies Act.\n\nThe Report has been reviewed by the Board's Nomination and Compensation Committee ('Committee') and approved by the Board of Directors. The shareholders will make an advisory decision on the approval of the Remuneration Report at the Company's Annual General Meeting 2021.\n\n## Letter from the Chairman of the Board\n\nRemuneration of Cargotec governing bodies is based on the Remuneration Policy that was presented for an advisory decision at the Annual General Meeting held on 27th May 2020. Cargotec has followed the Remuneration Policy's decision making process and remuneration governance model in 2020. There haven't been any claw-backs made in 2020. Our Remuneration Policy and overall remuneration philosophy reinforces Cargotec's values and ethical principles, aligns remuneration with the successful delivery of our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value. The variable, performance-based incentives short- and long-term incentive programmes (STI and LTI programmes) are designed to be the largest component of remuneration, thereby strengthening the alignment between remuneration and company performance, and re/flecting our philosophy that CEO remuneration should be closely tied to the strategy aimed at long-term value creation. Performance measures for the variable pay programmes are determined annually by the Board and they re/flect our key performance indicators.\n\nThe pandemic situation had a clear impact in all Cargotec's business areas, and orders decreased by 16 percent compared to the previous year. The situation improved steadily throughout the second half of 2020. At the beginning of the year, the order backlog was strong, which helped coping with the pandemic crisis as the year progressed. Sales increased in Kalmar's project business and in MacGregor, while sales declined in Hiab and Kalmar's mobile equipment.\n\nCargotec's service business performance was resilient in 2020, establishing 31 percent of total sales. The sales of Cargotec's eco portfolio increased as well, totalling 24 percent of total sales in 2020. It is clear that Cargotec's customers are moving towards sustainable solutions, preferring electric and hybrid solutions over internal combustion engines. In 2021, Cargotec aims to achieve double eco portfolio sales growth compared to traditional products.\n\nTo minimise the pandemic effects, temporary cost savings were initiated in AprilAugust. This produced ca. EUR 10 million monthly savings during the period. Towards the end of the year, the focus was shifted towards more permanent actions to safeguard business and pro/fitability. Cargotec's comparable operating pro/fit decreased compared to the previous year. However, the comparable pro/fit margin remained at a healthy level even during this challenging year.\n\nSeveral important strategic steps were announced during the year. A strategic evaluation of the software solutions and services provider Navis was conducted to support its future development. In December, the Board of Directors decided to initiate the actual sales process of the Navis software business. Cargotec also completed the TTS integration with MacGregor and sold its share of the Rainbow-Cargotec Industries Co., Ltd joint venture in China.\n\nIn October, the plan to combine Cargotec and Konecranes through a Merger was announced. In December, the extraordinary general meetings of both companies resolved to approve the Merger. This was also the unanimous recommendation of the Boards of Directors of both Cargotec and Konecranes.\n\nThe pandemic situation and merger were taken into account in the 2020 remuneration decisions. For the 2020 Annual Bonus Programme (STI) and for the 2020-2022 Performance Share Programme (LTI), the Board decided to adjust the original performance criteria for a better steering and motivational effect of the /financial performance targets in 2020. To ensure successful execution of the Merger, Cargotec's business performance, and shareholder value creation in 2021, the Board decided to launch a retention incentive programme for the CEO. Additionally, the Board decided to launch a Restricted Share Unit Programme in which also the CEO participates.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nThe work to /finalise the merger continues in 2021. Completion is expected in January 2022, provided that all conditions for completion are being ful/filled. The Future Company will be in a better position to address the world's sustainability challenges. I personally believe this is an excellent value creation opportunity from a /financial perspective, and also for shaping global trade for the better, and making the world a cleaner, better place.\n\n## Ilkka Herlin\n\nChairman of the Board and Board's Nomination and Compensation Committee\n\n## Cargotec 2020 Remuneration in brief\n\nCargotec's Remuneration Policy's key principles were followed through 2020.

The vesting condition related to matching shares is tied to working condition so that one third of the reward is earned annually over the three year period after which the vested shares have a lock-up period of one year except for shares vested during the last year for which there is no lock-up period.\n\n## Summary of Granted, Earned and Paid Share-Based Incentives to the CEO in Connection to the Reporting Period\n\n| Programme                              | Performance Period   | Grant Date      | Payment Date                                                                                                        | Vesting Date                                                            | Performance Criteria                                                   | Awarded Shares Net pcs  maximum   | Achieved Reward as %   of maximum               | Net Shares Earned pcs        |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 2020 Restricted Share Unit  Programme  | 2020-2021            | 5 November 2020 | Within three months after the  closing date of Merger                                                               | 12-month lock-up period,  starting the day after closing  of the merger | Closing of the Merger of  Cargotec Corporation and  Konecranes Plc     | 7,521                             | n/a                                             | n/a                          |\n| 2020-2022 Performance  Share Programme | 2020-2022            | 8 April 2020    | By April 2023                                                                                                       | April 2023                                                              | 2020 comparable operating  profit; 2021 and 2022 decided  by the Board | 24,400                            | Measuring period 2020: 81%                      | Measuring period 2020: 6,552 |\n| 2019-2021 Performance  Share Programme | 2019-2020            | 10 April 2019   | By April 2021                                                                                                       | 31 December 2021                                                        | 2019 comparable operating  profit; 2020 service gross  profit          | 23,100                            | 7%                                              | 1,650                        |\n| 2019-2022 Matching Share   Programme   | 2019-2022            | 1 March 2019    | 1 st  installment paid by the  company on 31 March 2020 2nd installment by April 2021 3rd installment by April 2022 | For the 1 st  installment until 31  March 2021                          | Personal share investment  and continuous shareholding                 | 24,770                            | 1/3 of total matching shares  delivered in 2020 | 8,256                        |\n| 2018-2020 Performance  Share Programme | 2018-2019            | 8 April 2018    | 31 March 2020                                                                                                       | 31 December 2020                                                        | 2018 service gross profit;  2019 comparable operating  profit          | 15,040                            | 19.5%                                           | 2,938                        |\n\nIn addition to the earned shares, the company pays a cash portion to cover taxes and employment-related expenses.\n\nIn the Performance Share Programmes the grant value is maximum 230% of the annual base salary in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.\n\n## 2020 Restricted Share Unit Programme\n\nThe Restricted Share Unit Programme 2020 is intended to function as a bridge programme for the transition period before the completion of the Merger.

Our operating environment was affected especially by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The pandemic slowed activities in China during the beginning of the year, as factories were faced with lower capacities, and the availability of components weakened. However, the situation improved towards the end of the /first quarter. Until March, the development of the operating environment was stable, especially in Cargotec's main market areas, Europe and Americas. Since then, the coronavirus pandemic changed the situation signi/ficantly, and the general market uncertainty, government actions and, for example, regulations that closed down assembly units as well as traveling and meeting restrictions have slowed or postponed the customer decision making, orders, starting and /finalisation of projects, and weakened the availability of components. Both demand and the delivery capability of Cargotec and its supply chain started recovering towards the end of the second quarter. The recovery continued in the second half of the year, and Cargotec's delivery capability, including its supply chain, returned to a normal level during the third quarter. Also the demand for Cargotec's solutions strengthened in the second half of 2020.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) world economic outlook update published in January 2021, the world economy contracted by 3.5 percent in 2020. IMF's previous forecast from October estimated a 4.4 percent decline. In 2020, the decline would be 4.9 percent in what IMF calls an advanced economy group, which includes several key Cargotec markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, while the estimate in October was -5.8 percent. The world economy is expected to increase by 5.5 percent in 2021, according to the IMF.\n\nKalmar's demand driver, the number of containers handled at ports globally, is estimated to have decreased by 2.1 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year. Demand for smaller cargo handling equipment in industrial segments decreased from the previous year. There is demand for automation solutions, but customers postpone their decisions due to the uncertain market situation. The demand for Kalmar's services weakened slightly due to pandemic related restrictions.\n\nOxford Economics forecasts that one of Hiab's demand drivers - construction activity - would have slowed down by slightly below nine percent in Europe and by approximately six percent in the US in 2020. The demand for services remained at the previous year's level.\n\nThe demand for MacGregor's cargo handling solutions is impacted by the level of merchant ship contracting, which is prognosed to have decreased and drawn close to the historically low level of 2016. During 2020, the estimated amount of new vessel contracting was 661 (851). In 2020, the amount of offshore vessel orders increased from the comparison period but remained still on a low level. The demand for services declined slightly from the comparison period due to pandemic related restrictions and postponements in scheduled maintenance.\n\n## Orders received and order book\n\nOrders received decreased in 2020 by 16 percent from the comparison period and totalled EUR 3,121 (3,714) million. Orders received declined in all business areas. Service orders received decreased by 9 percent and totalled EUR 987 (1,079) million.\n\nThe order book declined by 13 percent from the end of 2019, and at the end of the fourth quarter it totalled EUR 1,824 (31\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nDec 2019: 2,089) million. Kalmar's order book totalled EUR 842 (1,049) million, representing 46 (50) percent, Hiab's EUR 503 (406) million or 28 (20) percent and MacGregor's EUR 480 (633) million or 26 (30) percent of the consolidated order book.\n\nIn 2020, the share of orders received was 50 (49) percent in EMEA and 32 (34) percent in Americas. Asia-Paci/fic's share of orders received was 18 (17) percent.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales in 2020 declined by 11 percent from the comparison period to EUR 3,263 (3,683) million. Sales declined in Kalmar and Hiab and increased in MacGregor. Service sales decreased by 5 percent from the comparison period and totalled EUR 1,005 (1,062) million, representing 31 (29) percent of consolidated sales. Software sales decreased by 2 percent from the comparison period and amounted to EUR 166 (168) million. Service and software sales amounted to EUR 1,171 (1,230) million, representing 36 (33) percent of consolidated sales.\n\nIn 2020, EMEA's share of consolidated sales was 49 (48) percent, Americas' 30 (34) percent and Asia-Paci/fic's 21 (18) percent.\n\n## Financial result\n\nOperating pro/fit in 2020 totalled EUR 70 (180) million. The operating pro/fit includes items affecting comparability worth EUR -133 (-84) million. EUR -55 (-7) million of the items were related to Kalmar, EUR -29 (-11) million to Hiab, EUR -44 (-55) million to MacGregor and EUR -6 (-11) million to corporate administration and support functions. More information regarding items affecting comparability is available in Note 2.4, Restructuring costs and other items affecting comparability.",

Comparable operating pro/fit decreased due to the decline in sales, partly offset by productivity improvements and cost savings.\n\nIn 2020 net interest expenses for interest-bearing debt and assets totalled EUR 23 (22) million. Net /financing expenses totalled EUR 36 (34) million. In 2020 net income totalled EUR 8 (89) million, and earnings per share EUR 0.13 (1.39). Earnings per share decreased due to lower sales, lower comparable operating pro/fit and increased restructuring costs.\n\n## Balance sheet, cash flow and financing\n\nThe consolidated balance sheet total was EUR 3,888 (31 Dec 2019: 4,227) million at the end of the year. Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent was EUR 1,299 (1,424) million, representing EUR 20.14 (22.12) per share. Property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet amounted to EUR 430 (490) million and intangible assets to EUR 1,158 (1,355) million.\n\nReturn on equity (ROE, last 12 months) was 0.6 (31 Dec 2019: 6.3) percent at the end of the year, and return on capital employed (ROCE, last 12 months) was 2.8 (7.3) percent. In 2020, ROCE was weakened by signi/ficant restructuring costs and low pro/fitability in business area MacGregor. Cargotec's /financial target is to reach 15 percent return on capital employed.\n\nCash /flow from operating activities before /financial items and taxes totalled EUR 296 (361) million during 2020. Cash /flow decreased due to lower sales and lower EBITDA, partly offset by decreased net working capital, which amounted to EUR 103 million at the end of the year compared to EUR 158 million at the end of 2019.\n\nCargotec's liquidity position is strong. The objective of liquidity management is to maintain a continuous adequate amount\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nof liquidity to fund the business operations of Cargotec at all times, taking interest and other bank costs into consideration.\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by retaining long-term liquidity reserves exceeding the level of short-term liquidity requirement. The liquidity reserves, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn EUR 300 million longterm revolving credit facility, totalled EUR 785 million on 31 December 2020 (31 Dec 2019: 720). Repayments of interestbearing liabilities due within the following 12 months totalled EUR 158 (31 Dec 2019: 271) million, which includes EUR 38 (40) million lease liabilities.\n\nIn addition, Cargotec had access to a EUR 150 million commercial paper programme, of which undrawn EUR 150 (31 Dec 2019: 150) million, as well as undrawn bank overdraft facilities, totalling EUR 116 (31 Dec 2019: 137) million.\n\nIn addition to liquidity risk management, Cargotec manages funding risk of its loan portfolio. The objective is to avoid an untenably large proportion of loans or credit facilities to mature at a time when refunding is not economically or contractually feasible. The risk is minimised by diversifying the /financing sources as well as balancing the repayment schedules of loans and credit facilities. At the end of 2020, 64 (31 Dec 2019: 77) percent of Cargotec's loan portfolio were bonds and Schuldschein loans, 36 (22) percent bilateral bank loans, and 0 (1) percent commercial papers and drawn bank overdrafts.\n\nCargotec's maturity pro/file is balanced. During 2021-2027, the annual maturities are in the range of EUR 100-380 million. The revolving credit facility of EUR 300 million matures in 2024.\n\nInterest-bearing net debt totalled EUR 682 (31 Dec 2019: 774) million at the end of 2020. Interest-bearing net debt includes EUR 174 (188) million in lease liabilities. Interest-bearing debt amounted to EUR 1,191 (1,224) million, of which EUR 158 (271) million was current and EUR 1,033 (953) million non-\n\ncurrent debt. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities, excluding on-balance sheet lease liabilities, was 1.4 (1.8) percent. Cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable, and other interest-bearing assets totalled EUR 509 (451) million.\n\nAt the end of the year, Cargotec's equity to assets ratio was 35.3 (31 Dec 2019: 36.4) percent. Gearing was 52.4 (54.2) percent.\n\nMore information on debts is available in Note 8.4 to the consolidated /financial statements, Interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nKey /figures on /financial performance, including comparison data, are shown under the section Key /figures.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and product development expenditure in 2020 totalled EUR 105 (102) million, representing 3.2 (2.8) percent of sales. Research and development investments were focused on themes supporting our climate targets such as digitalisation, electri/fication and automation as well as projects that aim to improve the competitiveness and cost ef/ficiency of products.\n\n## Kalmar\n\n2021 will mark a considerable milestone for Kalmar as its entire portfolio becomes available as electrically powered. In 2020, a containerised ChargePod solution and energysaving guarantee for electrically powered forklift trucks were introduced to the market.\n\nIn addition, Kalmar introduced a new range of G-Generation top loaders with improved hydraulics, fuel consumption and operator ergonomics.\n\nIn June, Kalmar and MacGregor announced their joint participation in AEGIS (Advanced, Ef/ficient and Green Intermodal Systems), a three-year project funded by the EU's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme.

Kalmar and MacGregor will be the technology providers for the project.\n\nNavis announced in June that it will leverage the solutions offered by two startups, i4sea and Teqplay, as part of the Navis Smart Suite offering. Both solutions provide complementary features for the Navis Berth Window Management, a cloud-based product that enables terminal operators to better plan and optimise their berth utilisation in an intuitive and easy manner.\n\nIn November, Navis announced the launch of the N4 as a Service (SaaS) offering, allowing its customers to seamlessly move terminal operations to the cloud. N4 SaaS provides customers the full feature set of a TOS with the added convenience that it is delivered as a service, helping to further strengthen partnerships between terminals and clients.\n\n## Hiab\n\nIn collaboration with VTT, a Finnish state-owned research organisation, Hiab designed and implemented a steering system for a self-driving truck that is being tested by Stora Enso, a global provider of packaging, biomaterials, wooden constructions and paper, in Finland. The truck is being used to determine how much automated transport can reduce emissions and improve safety.\n\nIn May, Hiab announced a free version of the connected service HiConnect\u2122, a web portal that lets Hiab customers with connected equipment receive insights to improve safety and utilisation as well as keeping track of service needs based on actual usage. The free version provides access to core features, such as a live map of the /fleet, upcoming maintenance dates based on actual usage, equipment operation times and used capacity. The full subscription version, now rebranded as HiConnect Premium, provides access to even more extensive data including /fleet trends\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nand operational insights, which gives the customer better control and visibility of their operations.\n\nIn the second quarter, Hiab also launched MULTILIFT Optima 15S and MULTILIFT Optima 25S hooklifts for two and four axle trucks. Optima hooklifts have a light, yet robust construction to provide better fuel ef/ficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. They offer customers great value and deliver quality, safety and reliability.\n\nIn the third quarter, Hiab announced that it had helped to develop a new truck used by JOLT Energy Group to collect and return mobile charging stations for electric vehicles. The truck body has been created with the help of Hiab's modular installation system FrameWorks and it comes equipped with a HIAB X-HiPro 232 loader crane with Hiab's automation technologies.\n\nAll new WDV railgates by Hiab's American brand WALTCO ordered from 1 September will have HiConnect\u2122 connectivity as a standard feature with one year of access already included. This enables WALTCO WDV customers to utilise real time data and noti/fications to improve safety, reduce downtime and increase productivity throughout their /fleets. WALTCO has also moved to a new location in Streetsboro, Ohio. The new facilities will provide a better environment for employees, improve productivity and serve customers' better.\n\nIn December, Hiab launched the MOFFETT E4 NX, its next generation eSeries of electric forklifts and the world's /first all electric 3-wheel drive truck mounted forklift. The forklift is powered by lithium-ion batteries and features new controllers and the new HMI (Human Machine Interface) that displays battery capacity, machine performance and service information. The new MOFFETT eSeries, currently available in four E4 NX models with more being added, is not only bene/ficial to the environment as it has zero emissions, it is also much more comfortable and safer for the operator as it is virtually silent and has less vibrations\n\nthan a diesel powered truck. The low noise means it can be operated without earplugs allowing the driver to both see and hear danger. It can also be operated at night-time and deliver the cargo inside warehouses. The MOFFETT eSeries have in-built connectivity so that owners can access Hiab's HiConnect\u2122 that monitors over 100 machine parameters.\n\n## MacGregor\n\nMacGregor is applying proven oil & gas technology and extensive operational experience to support the development of offshore wind and renewable energy, with Edda Wind and OHT contracts being good examples of this. In the second quarter, a digital technology-enabled Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) was also successfully completed on a MacGregor 3D-compensated crane to be installed on an offshore wind energy service operation vessel.\n\nAlso during the second quarter, MacGregor's test engineers based in Norway together with the remotely located shipowner (France), their client (Denmark) and the shipbuilder (Turkey) overcame COVID-19 restrictions and completed a signi/ficant key project milestone utilising digital technologies including CCTV feed from a crane's Augmented Reality Operator Station.\n\nContinuing the development of MacGregor's conditionbased monitoring and remote support capabilities, further OnWatch Scout pilot systems were successfully installed onboard a multi-purpose offshore supply vessel and a general cargo vessel during the year. This installation included the /first electric merchant cranes to be connected to the OnWatch Scout solution, and the /first installation of wireless antennas to transmit data from the cranes to the ship's of/fice room instead of hard cabling.\n\nMacGregor has made good progress with the OnWatch Scout pilot programme, with several now moving to commercial contracts and completion of the /first /five-year service agreement.",

Investments in customer /financing were EUR 26 (39) million. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment amounted to EUR 144 (134) million. The amount includes impairments worth EUR 16 (9) million, of which EUR 16 (8) million has been booked as restructuring costs.\n\n## Acquisitions and divestments in 2020\n\nNavis, a part of Cargotec, acquired the assets of Biarri Rail, a global provider of planning and scheduling optimisation software for freight railroads on 20 March 2020 at a consideration of EUR 8.2 million. The acquired businesses' results have been consolidated into business area Kalmar's /financial /figures as of 1 April 2020.\n\nOn 1 October, Cargotec Corporation and Konecranes Plc announced that their respective Boards of Directors have signed a combination agreement and a merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger. Cargotec's extraordinary general meeting held on 18 December 2020 approved the merger. The combination is subject to, among other items, the obtaining of merger control approvals. Completion is expected on 1 January 2022. The planned effective date may change, and the actual effective date may be earlier or later than the above-mentioned date. Until the completion of the merger, Cargotec and Konecranes will carry out their respective businesses as separate and independent companies.\n\nMore information regarding acquisitions and divestments is available in Note 7.1, Acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Operational restructuring\n\nIn May 2017, Cargotec announced it would target EUR 50 million savings by reducing indirect purchasing spend, streamlining processes and centralising administrative operations to Cargotec Business Services centre. The realised savings cumulatively since the beginning of the\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nprogramme amount to approximately EUR 57 million. Around EUR 16 million savings were achieved during 2020.\n\nIn May, Cargotec concluded the change of ownership structure of its joint venture Rainbow-Cargotec Industries Co., Ltd (RCI) in China. As part of the agreement, Cargotec acquired certain operations and assets from Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (RHI) and approximately 160 employees moved over to Kalmar. Additional information about the sold ownership in RCI is disclosed in note 16, Joint ventures and associated companies.\n\nIn June, Kalmar signed a letter of intent with ARX Mining and Construction Equipment Private Limited (ARX), according to which ARX would become Kalmar's contract manufacturing partner in India, responsible for the manufacturing and development of Indital branded products previously manufactured at Kalmar's current multi-assembly unit in Bangalore. As a consequence, all the activities in the unit discontinued as of 12 June 2020.\n\nIn December, Kalmar agreed to transfer part of its crane engineering in China to Etteplan, a globally operating engineering company. As a consequence, approximately 70 Kalmar engineering employees in China moved to Etteplan on 1 January 2021.\n\nRestructuring costs in the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 131 (80) million in year 2020. Approximately EUR 50 million of these costs did not have cash /flow impact. We estimate the restructuring costs of ongoing restructuring programmes to be approximately EUR 40 million in total in 2021. The estimate does not include costs related to the merger between Cargotec and Konecranes and the restructuring cost estimate is subject to change\n\nMore information on operational restructurings is available in Note 2.4 to the consolidated /financial statements, Restructuring costs and other items affecting comparability.\n\nIt is dif/ficult to estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic, and its negative effects on the economy, will develop. For that reason, Cargotec continues to actively adjust its costs to match the generally weaker economic situation. Cost saving measures have included temporary lay-offs, structural developments of the organisation, and other cost adjustments, for example.\n\n## Personnel\n\nCargotec employed 11,552 (31 Dec 2019: 12,587) people at the end of 2020. The number of personnel decreased as a result of restructuring speci/fied in the previous chapter. The average number of employees of 2020 was 12,066 (1-12/2019: 12,470).\n\nSalaries and remunerations to employees totalled EUR 617 (629) million in 2020.\n\nThe annual Compass Employee Engagement survey provides valuable information on our employees' work related feelings and thoughts. The Compass 2020 survey was renewed from the previous year. Although the results are not directly comparable, they indicate a positive trend.\n\nThe Compass 2020 survey had a completion rate of 80 (78) percent. Total favorability of all answers was 74 percent. According to the results, 83 percent of employees are highly or moderately engaged. In the 2019 survey, the closest corresponding results were 68 and 77 percent.\n\nTeam work remains clearly our stronghold. Team climate and performance received 81 percent favorability. Also Cargotec's sustainability received a high score of 79 percent favorable. Perceived stress, training and development opportunities as well as the communication of the company's future direction were identi/fied as improvement areas. In these areas, favorability scores ranged around 40 to 50 percent.",

More information about the non/financial and sustainability matters is provided in the Annual Review's sustainability section and in a separate GRI Index. Covering environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, and ethics and compliance matters, this disclosure provides an understanding of the performance, development, position and impacts of Cargotec's activities in the value chain. This disclosure is based on the materiality principle and aims to give a clear and balanced view. When preparing this disclosure, several reporting frameworks and guidelines have been consulted, including the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), CDSB Framework for reporting environmental and climate change information, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\n## Business model\n\nCargotec is one of the leading providers of cargo and load handling solutions, and its three business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor are recognised leaders in the /field around the world. Cargotec's global network is positioned close to customers, offering extensive services to ensure a continuous, reliable and sustainable performance according to our customer needs. Cargotec has operations in about 100 countries, consisting of 18 assembly sites, 118 non-assembly and 6 competence centres. Kalmar offers container handling equipment, automated terminal solutions, software and support services in ports, terminals, distribution centres and various industries. Hiab provides on-road load handling solutions with customers operating, for example, in the land transport and delivery industries. MacGregor provides maritime cargo and offshore load handling solutions, services and equipment.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nCargotec is a global provider of solutions for intelligent cargo and load handling. Cargotec's products and services are present in major cargo hubs worldwide. Cargotec aims to become a leading operator in intelligent cargo and load handling. Cargotec's solutions and services make global trade smarter, better and more sustainable. As leading players, Cargotec's business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor can optimise global cargo /flows and create sustainable customer value in ports, on roads and at sea. Cargotec supports its customers to ef/ficiently and sustainably perform their business by combining equipment, service, and software into intelligent offerings.\n\nCargotec's business model is based on an asset-light and assembly-only production footprint and supply chain expertise. We are a knowledge and engineering company and our employees are an integral part of our competitiveness. The outputs of the businesses are the products, solutions and services that make global trade smarter, better and more sustainable. Our greatest positive contribution is through the development of societal infrastructure, since cargo handling operations are essential to keep modern society running.\n\n## Governance and management of non-financial matters\n\nCargotec is committed to the principles of the UN Global Compact, OECD's guidelines for multinational enterprises, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These commitments are re/flected in the Cargotec Code of Conduct that describes the general requirements, ethical principles and de/fines our way of working. The practical implementation of the Code of Conduct is ensured through topic area-speci/fic policies, processes and trainings.\n\nCargotec's Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the non-/financial matters. The Board reviews the non/financial related issues at least once a year as a separate topic and as part of strategy review, since sustainability is an integrated part of Cargotec's business strategy.\n\nThe Board con/firms Cargotec's strategy and monitors its implementation. This means that the Board is also responsible for con/firming Cargotec's management approach to the non-/financial matters, approving the targets and monitoring progress towards these targets. As the Board Chair leads strategy discussions at Board meetings, the highest level of responsibility lies with them.\n\nCargotec Leadership Team and the business area management teams review the non-/financial matters according to speci/fic reporting schedules set for each speci/fic non-/financial theme. The central corporate functions supporting the target setting and implementation of the targets of non-/financial issues are sustainability (including environment and safety management), HR, ethics and compliance, legal, sourcing, R&D and strategy. More details on the management principles of non-/financial matters can be found in the Financial Review's Corporate Governance Statement and in the Cargotec Annual Review 2020.\n\nCargotec's Leadership Team conducts bi-annual sustainability reviews and approves corporate level sustainability targets. Cargotec's Senior Vice President, Communications is responsible for sustainability issues within the Leadership Team and reports to the CEO. The CEO, together with Cargotec's Leadership Team, are responsible for the implementation of the targets and business plans set by the Board.\n\nThe corporate sustainability team is responsible for setting Cargotec's sustainability objectives and targets and ensuring they are in line with Cargotec's international commitments. The annual objectives and targets are approved by Cargotec's Leadership Team while the key long-term sustainability targets are approved by Cargotec's Board of Directors.\n\nThe responsibility for the implementation of the key sustainability principles and practices lies with the business areas, while the corporate functions provide",

We expect all parties that we work with to apply the same principles.\n\nCargotec's Sustainability Council aligns and agrees on actions taken on the corporate and business area level regarding the development, implementation and follow-up of sustainability targets and policies. The Sustainability Council consists of the Corporate Sustainability function (SVP Communications and VP Sustainability) and the corporate strategy and business area management team members, responsible for sustainability issues in their own operations and sourcing.\n\n## Environment\n\nClimate change is considered as a material topic both from a /financial and environmental & social materiality perspective. Climate change mitigation and a transition to a low-carbon economy are seen as business opportunities for us. Cargotec operates in the logistics sector that has a big carbon footprint and many of our products are still powered with fossil fuels today. Reducing the carbon footprint of the logistics sector is a signi/ficant business opportunity for us.\n\nWe have identi/fied natural resource use as a topic of high importance, too. Our products are mainly made of materials from /finite resources, although the materials are highly recyclable. We are anticipating that the transition to a circular, low-carbon economy will lead to rethinking the material /flows and options.\n\nEnergy use in our operations is fairly limited when compared to the impacts in our value chain. Due to the nature of our own operations, water and waste are considered as not material aspects. Water is not used for manufacturing processes and the waste generation is relatively low. Moreover, steel is the most common material used in our products and it is recycled to a high extent.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nThe main focus is on climate-related topics throughout the value chain due to their potential signi/ficance.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur environmental objectives, as laid out in Cargotec's sustainability policy, are to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment and to promote resource and energy ef/ficiency throughout the value chain. We also acknowledge the need to operate within planetary boundaries, and aim to contribute to tackle global challenges, such as resource depletion, biodiversity loss and pollution.\n\nDuring the year 2020, the Board discussed climate matters three times. In February 2020, the Board decided to set a 1.5 degree climate ambition. This means Cargotec has joined the Science Based Targets initiative as well as the UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign and committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5\u00b0C warming scenario, which is the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. The climate ambition was published in the Annual General Meeting in May. In June, the Board discussed climate-related risks and opportunities and the identi/fied emission reduction opportunities. In October, the Board discussed the /findings of the business areas' gap analysis. The Board has stated that climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as targets and action plans, should be embedded into the businesses' strategies.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are considered in the strategy process. Our strategic focus areas customer centricity, services, digitalisation and productivity support eco-ef/ficient and sustainable cargo /flow throughout the value chain. Business plans, related performance objectives, annual budgets and major capital expenditures such as acquisitions and divestitures are based on the strategy. While the Board has oversight of the strategy, risk management, business plans, related performance objectives and major capital expenditures, the CEO together with Cargotec's Leadership Team are responsible for the implementation of the targets and business plans. As the\n\nstrategy covers the climate-related risks and opportunities, the CEO is responsible for assessing and managing climaterelated risks and opportunities.\n\n## Strategy\n\nCargotec strives to be a global leader in intelligent cargo handling. This vision is well aligned with the climate ambition that comprises absolute emission reduction targets for both our own operations and the value chain. Cargotec demonstrated commitment to climate actions by joining the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign in March 2020. Our CEO has signed the UN Recover Better Statement, which urges the governments to prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy, by aligning policies and recovery plans with the latest climate science.\n\nCargotec's business strategy has been in/fluenced by the identi/fied climate-related risks and opportunities. Our goal is to mitigate climate change by constantly seeking to increase the energy ef/ficiency and decrease the emissions of our products, for example by offering electric versions. The /financial planning period is three years, while the underlying megatrends are assessed with a long-term time horizon. The electri/fication roadmaps are also long-term by nature. Technology and market risks are deemed as the most material, while at the same time seen as the greatest opportunities. Transforming the industry and mitigating climate change with low-carbon solutions for customers is a great opportunity for us. High demand for certain materials can lead to increased direct cost, which can affect our electric offering that is dependent on the availability of high-capacity batteries. We expect the demand for lowcarbon products and services to increase. With planned further investments in R&D and innovation, we are seizing the opportunity to develop new products and access new and emerging markets, besides exploiting the increasing demand. However, in case of more expensive low-carbon products, the customers' demand and willingness to pay are more uncertain. It is our challenge to make the low-carbon",

We aim to ensure the customer-product /fit through R&D and supply chain expertise.\n\nIn terms of the physical consequences of climate change, business interruption is recognised as a potential risk. Our business model is based on a multi-tier supply chain that is more vulnerable in case of an extreme weather event. This could impact our production capacity and revenues.\n\nThe identi/fied climate-related opportunities relate to digitalisation, electri/fication, robotics, renewables and circular economy and have all been considered in our strategy and /financial planning already in previous years. For example, the Cargotec's eco portfolio was established already in 2017 to gather together the products and services that enhance customers' sustainability, and to disclose the share of the eco portfolio sales. Besides electri/fication, also automation and connectivity are considered as very promising measures to improve the ef/ficiency of customers' operations. We have been investing in software and digital businesses as we see digitalisation will make cargo handling more ef/ficient and there will be increasing demand for ef/ficient solutions in the future. It will also be a major enabler for a wider societal change towards a more circular economy. Data sharing, common platforms and collaboration act as key drivers in achieving these targets and connecting industries.\n\nIn our own operations, the identi/fied climate-related risks and opportunities have led to setting the target to make our own operations carbon neutral by 2030. With full control over our own operations, we wanted to be more ambitious and reach carbon neutrality well before 2050, ahead of the EU's target. We plan to study the climate-related risks and opportunities in more detail during the next strategy and /financial planning round in 2021.\n\nFollowing the target setting, Cargotec's business areas were given a task to embed the climate ambition in their business\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nstrategies. The /first step in this work was to analyse their current business plans to identify possible gaps. We have identi/fied several options to reduce the emissions related to purchased goods, products use-phase and our own operations.\n\nThe climate-related scenario analysis work was initiated in 2019 and the /first round of the scenario work resulted in high-level considerations that supported the strategy. Cargotec's scenario analysis consists of two scenarios 1) increasing emissions and high warming, and 2) low-carbon transition and low warming - both with a time horizon until 2050. Several climate change scenarios have been consulted while conducting the work. IPCC's RCP (2.6; 4.5 and 8.5) as well as IEA (2DS, CPS and Sustainable development) scenarios were considered to understand the general conditions, risks and markets. Another key input in our scenario work is a study 'The impact of climate change on Finnish business', by Deloitte for the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK). The study considered 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C pathways until 2050, as well as the direction of trade policy, either protectionism or free trade, and therefore resulted in four scenarios. This study broadened the scenarios to better cover the following aspects: policy and legal, technology, and society. We have identi/fied some certainties in all scenarios, such as digitalisation, electri/fication, renewable energy and circular economy, and those are integrated in Cargotec's strategy. This builds trust in the resilience of Cargotec's strategy regardless of the warming pathway in the upcoming years.\n\nThe scenarios, including associated risks and opportunities, have been discussed in Cargotec's Leadership Team (CLT) meeting. The results of the scenario analysis have directly in/fluenced our strategy, with our commitment to be a 1.5\u00b0C company being visible evidence.\n\n## Risk management\n\nCargotec has two processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities. First, in the general\n\ncorporate risk management process (e.g. Enterprise Risk Management, Business Continuity Planning) and second, a dedicated specialised climate-related risk management process. Due to the long time horizon of climate-related impacts and broadness of risk assessments in corporate processes, we consider the corporate process not to be fully suf/ficient to capture all material climate risks.\n\nIn the corporate risk management process, climate-related risks are assessed using the general approach of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). The ERM process includes both the assessment and management of various broad based business risks (e.g. market, competitor, /financial etc). Risks are identi/fied and discussed at the business area and corporate levels. At corporate level, risks informed by business areas are consolidated together with relevant corporate-wide risks. Cargotec also conducts Business Continuity Planning, where together with the insurer, a set of approximately 5 facilities (mainly assembly sites) are evaluated on an annual basis, based on prioritisation and risk level. Assessments include matters such as supply chain risk, property damage and natural hazards. Business areas also have integrated management systems in place, including quality, health & safety and environmental management systems. All of those include risk assessments on asset level including potential shortterm impacts of climate change at the location.\n\nThe speci/fic climate-related risk management process has been created centrally by the corporate sustainability and strategy teams to complement the general corporate risk management process. The preliminary, high-level climaterelated risks and opportunities identi/fication, assessment and response have been conducted by the corporate teams. Thereafter the business areas are responsible for validating the outcome and also  taking the process to a more detailed level as seen necessary. This speci/fic climate-related risk management process is conducted as a part of the strategy process to ensure that a long-term time horizon is properly considered and suf/ficient actions are taken in that respect.",

Cargotec considers time horizons of less than one year as shortterm, 1-3 years as medium-term and 3-30 years as longterm. Several risk types are considered in the process. Current regulation, including both own and customers operations, are always considered. Energy and emissions related regulation can in/fluence raw material availability and prices, and are therefore considered in the risk assessment. For example, our products must comply with noise and other pollution-related regulation that affects customers' operations. Emerging regulation is seen as a business driver. The transition to a low-carbon economy will come with new regulation that can have signi/ficant business impact, such as zero emission vehicles and shipping related regulation.\n\nTechnology-related risks are also seen as central since Cargotec's low-carbon solutions are developed based on new technology. Electri/fication, automation and digitalisation, which  play a key role in Cargotec's strategy, are all very dependent on technological improvements and seen as the main measure to improve ef/ficiency and reduce emissions. Market-related risks are always considered as the demand of products and services is dependent on the surrounding conditions. For example, depending on the political conditions de/fining the market situation, the driver of customer decisions can be costs or emissions. This can impact the overall demand for eco-ef/ficient low-carbon solutions. Reputation is seen to become increasingly important as customers and consumers have higher expectations towards the sustainability of the cargo handling industry. We also consider reputation important in terms of attracting talent.\n\nAcute and chronic physical risks are also deemed relevant. Extreme weather events are especially relevant for some of our suppliers that are located in high risk areas. Of the chronic risks, sea level rise and increasing temperatures set new requirements for products as they may cause the operating conditions to become more challenging. Extreme working conditions also increase the risks related to health and safety.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nTable 1: Environmental performance\n\n|                                                       | 2020      | 2019      | 2018    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Scope 1 emissions (tCO 2 e)                           | 22,700    | 22,000    | 20,100  |\n| Scope 2 emissions, market-based (tCO 2 e)             | 21,000    | 28,200    | 28,100  |\n| Scope 3 emissions (tCO 2 e)*                          | 5,654,000 | 6,466,000 | -       |\n| Total emissions (tCO 2 e)                             | 5,697,700 | 6,516,200 | -       |\n| Emissions intensity, relative to sales (tCO 2 e/MEUR) | 1,746     | 1,769     | -       |\n| Share of eco portfolio sales of total sales (%)       | 24        | 21        | 21      |\n| R&D expenditure (MEUR)                                | 105       | 102       | 89      |\n| Total energy use in own operations (MWh)              | 157,500   | 164,800   | 159,400 |\n| Share of renewable energy of total energy use (%)     | 14        | 12        | 11      |\n\nDuring acquisition and divestment cases Cargotec conducts an environmental due diligence process to ensure that potential environmental risks are accounted for.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nFollowing Cargotec's commitment to 1.5\u00b0C climate ambition we have set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the latest climate science. Our target, validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in all three emission scopes at least 50 percent by 2030 from a 2019 base year. In our own operations we strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. We have chosen a challenging, yet decisive route, by setting the absolute emission reduction target for our value chain, as this means we need to engage with our suppliers and customers in order to reduce the emissions from their operations.\n\nIn our own operations, about 40 percent of the emissions are related to electricity use and we are committed to increase the share of renewable electricity to 55 percent by 2024 and\n\n100 percent by 2030. The fuel usage by our service /fleet is another big contributor. In order to achieve carbon neutrality, the plan is to increase remote services and use biofuels or electric vehicles.\n\nOur biggest climate impact and respectively mitigation potential, lies in our value chain -  the emissions related to the use of sold products and purchased goods constitute more than 90 percent of our total emissions. Emissions from the use of sold products are high due to long lifetimes and the use of diesel engines. On the upstream side of the value chain, the manufacture of the steel structures for our equipment is the biggest single contributor. The impact of our own operations is relatively minor due to the light assembly-only operations.\n\nMany of the identi/fied climate-related risks and opportunities are related to our products and services which contribute to climate change mitigation. Moreover, the upcoming EU taxonomy regulation, considers manufacturing as a key sector in enabling emission reductions in other",

Cargotec, as a provider of lowcarbon technologies, has a great potential in helping its customers to become low-carbon in their operations. We have an eco portfolio, established already in 2017, that consists of products and services that enhance customers' sustainability with tangible environmental bene/fits. Sales of the offering amounted to 24 percent of total sales in 2020 (2019: 21%). For the strategy period 2019-2021, the portfolio target was to achieve double sales growth compared to traditional products. This target was met already in 2020. The eco portfolio has performed well during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have recorded a signi/ficant growth in the sales of the eco portfolio when comparing the 2020 sales to sales in 2018, while at the same time, the sales of traditional products have decreased. In addition, Kalmar is committed to having electric versions of its full offering available by 2021.\n\n## Social and employee matters\n\nSafety, wellbeing, working conditions, and human rights are seen as the most material topics in terms of social and employee matters. Safety covers employee, supplier and subcontractor safety as well as the safety of our products and services.\n\n## Governance\n\nCargotec is committed to full compliance with all of the applicable national and international laws and regulations. We value transparency, support business integrity and recognise that economic, environmental and social performance together form the basis for endorsing sustainability in our business operations. The main international codes Cargotec supports are: United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Global Compact, International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n\nCargotec's Employment policy, complementing the Code of Conduct, de/fines the basic employment principles and\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nworkplace practices. Complying with the Code of Conduct is expected of all Cargotec employees as it describes the mission, goals and development process speci/fic to human resources. The Employment policy applies to all Cargotec employees worldwide and its enforcement is subject to mandatory local legislation. As a global policy, it applies to all locations and conditions where Cargotec business is conducted.\n\nCargotec's Sustainability policy sets our social objectives. We respect human rights and value employee engagement, diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities. We promote high safety levels and work continuously towards zero accident level in all our operations and also through our products, services and solutions. Our employees are trained to operate in a safe manner. We promote interaction between management and staff by collaborating with personnel at Group and on a country level.\n\nEnvironment and Health & Safety (EHS) management is a basic element of sustainable operations and it ensures the commitment to minimise the risk of injury and ill health at our places of work. It also ensures protection, so far as is reasonably practicable, for persons not employed by the company who may be affected by our activities. EHS management is a set of practices with which Cargotec develops and implements its EHS practices and manages its EHS aspects and risks.\n\nCargotec supports social dialogue within the company. Cargotec respects the freedom of association of its personnel. All employees have the right to be a member of a trade union of their choice and to bargain collectively. Cargotec ensures that employee representatives are not the subject of discrimination and that they have access to their members at the workplace.\n\nAt Cargotec, cooperation with personnel is organised at Group and on a country level. Cooperation is based on the requirements of the mandatory local legislation and includes\n\nthe Cargotec Personnel Meeting (CPM) in Europe. The purpose is to promote interaction between management and staff and to furthermore enhance relations between the personnel of the different businesses.\n\nMoreover, diversity is recognised as an important factor. Diversity offers Cargotec greater productivity, innovation and /flexibility. We are committed to equal opportunity in our employment policies, procedures and practices. Furthermore, we are committed to ensure a nondiscriminatory work environment that values diversity regardless of gender, race, religion, nationality, age or physical ability or any other aspect of diversity. Harassment, in all of it forms - be it face-to-face, written, electronic or verbal, is not tolerated. We respect the freedom of association of our personnel. Cargotec does not act partially, nor does it speak out or commit to political parties and religious groups.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOccupational health and safety risks are identi/fied as a material risk for our employees, while as a knowledge and engineering company the human capital related risks are also deemed material to Cargotec.\n\nWe are dedicated to safeguard the health and safety of personnel at work. Personnel have a responsibility to protect themselves, colleagues, work site, community and environment by reporting unacceptable health or safety conditions, taking preventive measures and minimising potential damages. As a technology leader, we develop innovative systems and related services that meet the individual needs of our customers. We strive  to minimise health and safety risks related to the use of our products and services, by focusing on our product development and quality assurance methods.\n\nWe trust our people are the key in creating customer-value through innovation, experimentation, life-long learning and development, adapting new skills and competences",

Our vision, in combination with the  continuously evolving environment, suggest that skills of today may not be relevant tomorrow. The purpose of people development at Cargotec is broadly to ensure we have the necessary capabilities, skills, knowledge and attitudes to achieve both our organisational goals as well as personally develop as individuals. Hence, it is imperative that employees continuously evolve and keep developing themselves. For these purposes Cargotec has launched a Learning Experience Platform (LEARN), which is a place where employees can all develop and expand their knowledge on a multitude of topics through comprehensive learning materials.\n\nMoreover, in order to reach our targets and ful/fill our strategy, it is crucial to identify, review and develop both leader and successor pools. Cargotec's Talent Review process focuses on evaluating and developing our present leaders, ensuring succession of leaders, planning for successors' development, and identifying future leaders and planning for their development. Cargotec's Talent review process focuses on several key steps - evaluating and developing present leaders, identifying future leaders and planning their development, ensuring continuous succession of leaders and planning for the successors' development.\n\nCargotec's total reward strategy is based on a pay for performance. Regardless of the country, business or job, we believe in attracting, retaining and motivating talent by linking total rewards to business and individual performance. Our total reward strategy is characterised by /five key principles:\n\n- 1.  Align total compensation funding with our strategic and business plans\n- 2.  Reinforce a high-performing culture\n- 3.  Promote pay for performance differentiation\n- 4.  Balance shareholder and employee needs\n- 5.  Enhance our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a diverse group of talented individuals.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nIn addition to adequate and fair remuneration, suf/ficient development opportunities, and an ef/ficient talent review process, a smoothly working onboarding process can also be seen to have a positive impact on productivity, employee wellbeing, and employee retention. The success of the employee onboarding depends on the ef/ficiency of the onboarding program. The quicker employees are empowered to do their jobs, the faster they are likely to become valuable, contributing members of the organisation. We have renewed our onboarding process and practices in order to offer the new (and returning) employees a good employee experience and a positive /first impression of the company.\n\nIn these exceptional times of COVID-19 pandemic, our /first and foremost priority is the health and safety of our own employees, customers and partners. COVID-19 has brought many challenges and changed the way of working, which has required resilience and modi/fication of existing policies and practices. For example, due to the COVID-19 people have been working remotely, which has required modi/fications in the global and local remote work policies.\n\n## Risk management\n\nCargotec's risk management activities are broken into different segments with responsibilities distributed to the appropriate corporate functions. The responsibility of personal safety of employees lies within human resources. Occupational health and safety issues are developed continuously in order to secure a safe working environment for all of our employees. Health and safety programmes include, for example, various types of training, health and safety practice development and audits, as well as target follow-ups.\n\nCargotec's assembly sites have implemented safety management systems, wherein safety risks, safety compliance and related mitigation actions are de/fined.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nSafety performance is monitored primarily with the industrial injury frequency trend (IIFR,  number of injuries per million hours worked). The assembly sites' IIFR target for 2020 was 5, and the rate achieved was 3.4 (2019: 7.0), while the non-assembly site IIFR rate was at 6.2 (2019: 6.8). The Cargotec total IIFR improved to 5.2 (2019: 6.9). We have set a new IIFR target for 2021 to have a rate of 5 across the whole organisation, now also including the non-assembly units. Currently the safety /figures cover our own employees and external contractors, excluding subcontractors due to missing working hours information. We have in our longterm plans the intention to also include subcontractor and supplier safety.\n\nThrough our employee engagement survey, Compass, all our employees are encouraged to share their thoughts on a wide range of topics, ranging from work-life balance, wellbeing, and social responsibility, to leadership and team climate.  By learning what employees share about their business area, organisation, leaders and colleagues, appropriate actions can be taken to create a better working environment for everyone. This year's survey completion rate was 79%, which is 1.7% higher than in 2019. This year we had a total of 42 scaled questions and an open-ended one. The overall favorability for the organisation was 74%, which improved 5.3% from 2019. The category with the highest score was Team Climate & Performance with the favorability of 81%. The category with the lowest score was Direction with the favorability of 54%. The overall favorability for sustainability related questions was 79%.\n\nIn addition to the Compass survey, we have also launched a biweekly People Pulse survey to monitor the wellbeing of our employees and how they cope with the dif/ficult conditions in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. Such surveys give the employees a chance to anonymously tell how they are feeling and how well they are coping with the current circumstances.",

Pivotal HR dashboards and metrics are provided for HR Business Partners to support them in their decision making and planning.\n\nLastly, Cargotec was acknowledged for its efforts in building an equal leadership culture as it was included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index (GEI) 2020. The index consists of 325 companies that set an example to advance women in the workplace through measurement and transparency.\n\nTable 2: Industrial injury frequency rate and Compass results\n\n|                                                           | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Industrial injury frequency  rate, (IIFR, all operations) | 5.2    | 6.9    | 8.4    |\n| Compass results                                           |        |        |        |\n| Completion rate (%)                                       | 79     | 78     | 85     |\n| Engagement index (%)                                      | 77     | 67     | 67     |\n| Sustainability index (%)                                  | 79     | 80     | 80     |\n| Leadership index (%)                                      | 74     | 73     | 73     |\n| Team climate index (%)                                    | 81     | 77     | 77     |\n\n## Human rights\n\nDue to the global presence and nature of Cargotec's business, it is obvious that Cargotec has signi/ficant impacts on individuals and communities globally.\n\n## Governance\n\nCargotec is committed to respect human rights, which is stated publicly in our Sustainability policy. Our human rights work is based on the UN Guiding Principles of Human Rights and Business and is guided by our Code of Conduct and its associated policies and guidelines. The code of conduct lists the main international codes we support: UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Global Compact,\n\nAnnual review\n\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We require our partners to adhere to similar principles.\n\nCargotec HR manages employment principles and workplace practices within the organisation. The principles are de/fined in Cargotec's Employment policy, which states that we do not engage in, or support, child labour or forced and compulsory labour. The Supplier code of conduct requires our suppliers  to conduct their business in compliance with international human rights and environmental laws and practices.\n\nCargotec's Ethics and Compliance team reports regularly to the Cargotec Audit & Risk Committee on the subject of compliance in all areas mentioned in the Code of Conduct, including possible risks related to human rights. Human rights as a topic is coordinated by Cargotec's sustainability team. The human rights risk assessment and implementation is carried out in cooperation with the business areas and several functions like HR, Ethics and Compliance and M&A.\n\n## Strategy\n\nHuman rights is recognised as a material social sustainability topic besides occupational health & safety. Due to the complexity and global reach of our supply chain, human rights related risks are considered to be the biggest in the supply chain. Cargotec's operations are systematically managed with the relevant safety and HR policies, processes and follow-up tools that aim to mitigate the risk of noncompliance in Cargotec's own operations with regards to international human rights. Main policies and processes to support the respect for human rights in the company's sphere of interest are sourcing criteria and processes as well as agent screening processes. Code of Conduct e-learning is mandatory for all Cargotec employees, and a speci/fic human rights section is included as part of the training.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial review\n\nIn 2018, Cargotec carried out an analysis of the most important operational aspects related to human rights risks and measures to mitigate those risks. Most of the human rights risks occur in the Cargotec's sphere of interest, such as in supply chain and sales agents operations. In addition, mergers and acquisitions were identi/fied as potential areas for human rights breaches.\n\nIn 2019, the mergers and acquisition process was developed to ensure that the human rights risks can be identi/fied with better accuracy. The Human Rights risks management process will be further developed in 2021 with special focus on the supply chain. The work will be supported by an external expert.\n\n## Risk management\n\nHuman rights risks are managed as part of Cargotec's compliance risk management process. The cornerstones of effective compliance risk management are considered to be based on the prevent - detect - respond approach. The same approach is valid for the human rights compliance risks and a self-assessment was started in 2020 and will be /finalised during 2021. The compliance risks are assessed regularly in a systematic form and reported to the Cargotec Risk and Audit Committee.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nTo manage the human rights risks in the supply chain, Cargotec expects all suppliers to commit to the Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, the supplier criteria include elements to audit the supplier's compliance regarding the management of labour practices, human rights, anticorruption and the environment. 20 percent of the questions in the supplier assessment checklist are related to these topics. In 2020, 100 percent of new direct suppliers were audited against the labour practice, human rights and environmental management criteria.\n\nOur target for 2020 was to audit 50 percent of suppliers that failed the 2019 sustainability risk assessment.

However, the sourcing teams developed a self-sustainability audit and online review process. For 2021, our target is to renew the supplier sustainability risk assessment process.\n\nSpeak-up cases are discussed as part of Ethics and Compliance.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\nCargotec does business on a global scale and our industry is exposed to compliance risks for example relating to doing business in remote locations, bidding for large projects as well as the use of sales intermediaries in countries where we do not have our own sales of/fices.\n\nThe Code of Conduct is the foundation of our corporate culture and sets out high standards of integrity on how we do business everywhere in the world. The Code of Conduct supports us in handling business matters in conformance with laws, regulations, key policy requirements and principles for ethical business conduct. Ethical behaviour is the responsibility of every employee in Cargotec, and it is management's responsibility to set a clear tone from the top and implement structures to ensure that compliance risks are effectively assessed, controlled and mitigated.\n\nThe purpose of the Compliance Programme is to support Cargotec, the CEO and Board of Directors in ensuring that compliance risks are managed effectively and consistently throughout the organisation. This section describes Cargotec's Compliance Programme and its key elements and focus areas.\n\n## Governance\n\nAs of 2019, the Ethics & Compliance function in Cargotec reports directly to the CEO and the Audit and Risk Management Committee of the Cargotec Board of Directors. Cargotec Board of Directors receives an annual update from the Chief Compliance Of/ficer. In addition, the Audit and\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nRisk Management Committee of the Board receives regular updates about anti-corruption activities and other Code of Conduct matters during the year. The Cargotec Leadership Team also has a Code of Conduct panel where compliance topics are communicated and discussed.\n\nThe Cargotec Code of Conduct is the cornerstone of our compliance programme. The Code of Conduct is approved by the Cargotec Board of Directors and de/fines the ethical standards which directors, employees and partners need to follow. In addition, the Cargotec Anti- Corruption policy, Gift and Hospitality Instruction, SpeakUp and Non-Retaliation, as well as the Third Party Policy guide work against unethical or corrupt business practices. The practical implementation of these policies, as well as related instructions, is guided by the compliance programme, whose main principles include detection, prevention responding to potential misconduct. The main pillars of the compliance programme are: 1) Risk Assessment; 2) Policies and Procedures; 3) Training & Communications; 4) Concern Reporting & Resolution; 5) Monitoring; and 6) Oversight.\n\nThe Cargotec SpeakUp line is an externally hosted reporting tool for reporting possible Code of Conduct violations. It enables anonymous reporting and can be accessed by both internal and external parties. In addition, the Ethics & Compliance team receives direct reporting from managers and the line organisation. All reported cases are evaluated con/fidentially and they are investigated according to the Code of Conduct response process. The Code of Conduct panel of Cargotec's Leadership Team reviews the need for possible disciplinary and remedial measures.\n\n## Strategy and Risk Management\n\nWe continue to build and implement a robust compliance program to support Cargotec in ensuring that compliance risks are managed effectively and consistently throughout the organisation. The main focus areas in 2020 have been the implementation of the Third Party Policy, supporting and implementing the compliance programme in all\n\nbusiness areas and continuous effective handling of compliance cases.\n\nIn 2020 we conducted compliance risk assessments in our business area operations.  Examples of key risk areas are around third party engagements, con/flict of interest and internal fraud. For example, in Kalmar, the sales third parties, including commercial agents and dealers globally were identi/fied as the highest area of risk, and a new comprehensive sales third party program was launched.\n\nBased on the compliance risk assessments and Code of Conduct cases, the focus area for 2020 has continued to be Third Party management. The Third Party policy stipulates formal criteria for how to manage E&C risk relating to third parties involved in sales, supply chain, mergers and acquisitions, as well as joint ventures. The companywide implementation of more detailed instructions and a process for third party screening and risk assessments for sales intermediaries was concluded in 2020. More detailed instructions and the process regarding screening and risk assessment for vendors has started in 2020 and is planned to be fully implemented in 2021.\n\nIn 2020 the Ethics & Compliance team has focused on training and awareness efforts around areas where compliance risk has been identi/fied. In particular face to face workshops and online training sessions where key risk groups have been prioritised. The focus of the sessions has been on third party risk and risk mitigation activities together with con/flict of interest related topics. The E&C team has conducted mostly in-person training to management teams, sales teams and project services teams at locations in Europe, APAC, and the Americas. In addition, a series of online Q&A discussions with senior management were held throughout the year, allowing employees to comment and ask questions around compliance topics.\n\nCargotec detected a suspected /financial fraud in connection to MacGregor and made an investigation request to the",

In June 2019, the National Bureau of Investigation in Finland reported that it has been working on a preliminary investigation about a suspected aggravated fraud in connection to MacGregor business area. In 2020, the District Attorney pressed charges against two former employees of MacGregor. The case is now pending in the District Court. Cargotec has a zero tolerance policy for misconduct, and is fully supporting the authorities. Neither MacGregor nor Cargotec are suspected of criminal actions.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nDuring 2020, 65 reports of alleged misconduct were made to the Ethics and Compliance (E&C) team. E&C decided to open an investigation in 32 cases (2019: 40). The reports and investigation cases were referred to the monthly Code of Conduct Panel of the Cargotec Leadership Team, which is chaired by the CEO. The Code of Conduct Panel decides upon case closure, remediation and disciplinary action. During the year, 43 cases were closed and improvement actions were initiated. In 84 % of the closed cases the allegations were substantiated at least partly, and some cases resulted in disciplinary actions such as warnings and personnel dismissals. Six (2019: 3) cases during 2020 concerned HR issues and 4 (9) cases related to possible con/flict of interest. Other cases were related to unethical business conduct such as fraud, corruption or policy violations. There were no cases related to environmental grievances, health and safety or privacy matters. One report related to a potential human rights issue was received.\n\nThe Code of Conduct cases were reported to the Board of Directors' Audit and Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis, and the Chief Compliance Of/ficer provided an annual update to the full Board of Directors. As part of the investigation process, the Ethics and Compliance team agrees with relevant business area management team members on remedial actions, such as improved controls, training, disciplinary actions or termination of third party\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nrelationships. The /final decision on disciplinary actions is made by the Code of Conduct Panel.\n\nTo further understand our employees' views on the company's ethical practices, the Code of Conduct related questions were updated and amended in the annual Compass Employee Engagement 2020 survey. 80 percent of respondents consider Cargotec as an ethical company (2019: 80%).\n\nAs of 2020, the Code of Conduct e-learning is an annual mandatory training for all Cargotec employees. The e-learning consists of exercises that help employees with their day-to-day dilemmas around ethics and compliance. The Code of Conduct training has been completed by 82 percent of Cargotec employees (2019: 68%). The target group of the e-learning course includes employees with an individual company email address and access to the intranet and across that group there was a 90% completion rate. In addition, onsite training workshops have been arranged for employees without an email address or access to intranet. Due to COVID-19 restrictions the onsite training workshops will continue into 2021, with the aim of full completion of training for the employees without email or intranet access.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\nThe objective of Cargotec's internal control is to ensure that its operations are ef/ficient and pro/fitable, that risk management is adequate and appropriate, and that /financial and other information produced is reliable. Cargotec's internal control is based on the Company's Code of Conduct and internal controls. With respect to the /financial reporting process, these are supported by policies and guidelines, as well as the internal /financial reporting process and communication. Cargotec's Internal control policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, speci/fies the applicable control principles, procedures and responsibilities.\n\nSimilarly to other Cargotec operations, responsibility for internal control is divided into three tiers. The line management is principally responsible for internal control.\n\nThis is backed by corporate support functions, which de/fine instructions applicable across the Company and supervise risk management. Internal and external audits form the third tier, their task being to ensure that the /first two tiers function effectively.\n\nThe role of Cargotec Internal Audit is an independent and objective assurance and consulting activity that is guided by a philosophy of adding value and improving the operations of Cargotec and its businesses.

It speci/fies the objectives and principles of risk management as well as the process and responsibilities involved. Risk management is to be naturally built into all business decisions and plans.

The CEO and the Leadership Team are responsible for the methods, implementation and supervision of risk management. Cargotec's risk management is spread across units and corporate support functions that assign responsibility for risk management and that are in charge of identifying, managing and reporting risks.

In the January-March interim report, Cargotec announced that the evaluation had been paused due to the coronavirus pandemic. In October, Cargotec announced that it has decided to continue the strategic evaluation. As part of the evaluation of options, a preliminary call for tenders was conducted and on 3 December Cargotec announced that the amount and level of the received preliminary and indicative offers suggest that proceeding with a sale is a better possible option for Cargotec and Navis than other presented solutions. Consequently, Cargotec's Board of Directors decided to initiate the actual sales process of the Navis software business. The preliminary indicative offers are not binding and the possible sale of the Navis software business and the terms of the transaction will only be con/firmed once the actual sales process has been completed.

The performance share programme, approved by the Board of Directors in 2017, includes three performance periods, calendar years 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. Each performance period includes two measuring periods, both lasting for one calendar year. The Board of Directors will annually resolve the performance criteria for each measuring period.\n\nFor the performance period of 2019-2020, the potential reward of the measuring period 2020 will be based on the business areas' service gross pro/fit for the key employees of the business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor, and for Navis software divisions' key employees, on Navis' sales and on strategic targets of cloud business. For Cargotec Corporate key employees, the performance criterion is Cargotec's service gross pro/fit.\n\nIn February 2020, the Board of Directors also resolved to establish a new share-based incentive programme directed to the key employees of Cargotec. The aim of the programme is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and the key employees in order to increase the value of the Company in the long-term, to commit the key employees to implement Cargotec's strategy, and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on earning the Company's shares.\n\nThe performance share programme includes three performance periods, calendar years 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024. Each performance period includes one to three measuring periods. One measuring period can be three calendar years at maximum, which is the total length of one\n\nperformance period. For the measuring periods, the Board of Directors will annually resolve the length, the performance criteria and the required performance levels for each criterion.\n\nDuring the performance period 2020-2022, the programme is directed to approximately 150 key employees, including the members of Cargotec Leadership Team. The Board of Directors has resolved that the performance period's /first measuring period is one calendar year. For the key employees of the business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor, the potential reward of the programme from the measuring period 2020 will be based on the business areas' earnings per share (EPS), and for Navis software divisions' key employees, on Navis' sales and on strategic targets of cloud business. For the Cargotec Corporate key employees, the performance criteria is Cargotec's earnings per share (EPS). The rewards to be paid on the basis of the performance period 2020-2022 will amount up to an approximate maximum total of 340,000 Cargotec's class B shares. In addition, the rewards include cash proportions that are intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward to the key employees.\n\nAfter the end of the performance period, the Board of Directors will con/firm the cumulative amount of rewards earned from the measuring periods, and potential rewards from the performance period 2020-2022 will be paid partly in Cargotec's class B shares and partly in cash in 2023. As a rule, no reward will be paid, if a key employee's employment or service ends before the reward payment. The shares paid as reward may not be transferred during an approximate one-year ownership and value creation period established for the shares.\n\nIn addition, The Board of Directors of Cargotec Corporation resolved to establish a new restricted shares programme for calendar years 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024. As a part of total compensation, restricted share grants can be allocated for selected key employees for recruitment and retention purposes. For the /first programme period 2020-",

In addition, the rewards include cash proportions that are intended to cover taxes and taxrelated costs arising from the reward to the key employees.\n\nIn October 2020, The Board of Directors of Cargotec Corporation decided to establish a new share-based incentive programme for the Group key employees. The new Restricted Share Unit Programme 2020 is intended to function as a bridge programme for the transition period before the closing of the merger between Cargotec and Konecranes and forming the future company in the merger. The aim of the Programme is to align the objectives of the shareholders and the key employees, to secure business continuity during the transition period, and to retain key employees at the Company.\n\nThe reward from the programme is conditional to the closing of the transaction. In addition, the reward is based on a valid employment or service and the continuity of the employment or service during the waiting period. The reward is paid partly in shares and partly in cash, after the end of the waiting period, ending on the closing date of the transaction. Shares received as a reward in the programme may not be sold, transferred, pledged or otherwise assigned during the 12-month lock-up period. The lock-up period begins on the date following the closing date of the transaction.\n\nThe programme is intended for approximately 70 Cargotec Group's key employees, including selected Leadership Team members. The rewards to be allocated on the basis of the programme will amount up to an approximate maximum total of 100,000 Cargotec Corporation class B shares. In addition, a cash proportion is included in the reward to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward.\n\n## Market capitalisation and trading\n\nAt the end of 2020, the total market value of class B shares was EUR 1,859 (1,660) million, excluding own shares held\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nby the company. The period-end market capitalisation, in which unlisted class A shares are valued at the average price of class B shares on the last trading day of the period, was EUR 2,182 (1,950) million, excluding own shares held by the company.\n\nThe class B share closed at EUR 33.82 (30.24) on the last trading day of December on Nasdaq Helsinki. The volumeweighted average share price in 2020 was EUR 24.77 (31.09), the highest quotation being EUR 37.14 (38.48) and the lowest EUR 15.15 (24.12). During the period, a total of 55 (29) million class B shares were traded on Nasdaq Helsinki, corresponding to a turnover of EUR 1,369 (892) million. In addition, according to Fidessa, a total of 55 (40) million class B shares were traded in several alternative marketplaces, such as Cboe BXE and Cboe APA, corresponding to a turnover of EUR 1,441 (1,266) million.\n\n## Loans, liabilities and commitments to related parties\n\nCargotec has extended a retention incentive program to the CEO for the transition period prior to completion of the merger between Cargotec and Konecranes and creation of the combined company to ensure Cargotec's business performance, successful execution of the merger, and shareholder value creation in 2021. The value of the retention program is EUR 1,500,000, and the payment under the program will be paid as a one-off payment to the CEO's supplemental pension plan under the new pension agreement after the completion of the merger. The payment is subject to the following preconditions: the merger is completed, the CEO continues in the service of the company, he has not served a notice of termination prior to the completion of the merger and has performed his duties according to his contract. The capital redemption policy related to the retention incentive program has been pledged to the director as security for the pension agreement promise, creating a liability of EUR 1.5 million for Cargotec.\n\n## Board of Directors and CEO\n\nThe election of the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor and their remunerations as well as changes on the Articles of Association, are decided by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The Board of Directors elects Cargotec's CEO and determines the terms of his/her employment.\n\n## Short-term risks and uncertainties\n\nDevelopments in the global economy and cargo /flows have a direct effect on Cargotec's operating environment and customers' willingness to invest. A slowdown in global economic growth, political uncertainty and trade wars could have an impact on global /flow of goods and therefore on the demand of Cargotec's solutions.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has direct and indirect impacts on Cargotec's business, and the pandemic exposes personnel to a higher risk of illness. Closures of factories, increased safety measures and movement restrictions in accordance with government regulations may limit Cargotec's business prerequisites, and can make it dif/ficult to sell, operate and deliver Cargotec's solutions. Spread of the pandemic and related restrictions may affect the operating environment adversely. Challenges related to the availability, retention and mobility of skilled workforce impact operational performance negatively. The pandemic situation and related operating constraints may have weakened the operational capacity and /financial situation of suppliers involved in Cargotec's supply chain, which can hamper Cargotec's ability to deliver products, solutions and services to its customers.\n\nA slowdown or contraction in global economic growth may lower the container traf/fic growth rate, which affects demand and deliveries for Kalmar's cargo handling solutions. Project executions face risks related to schedule, cost and delivery guarantees. Furthermore, potential bottlenecks in the supply chain could postpone deliveries and have a negative impact on sales and results. Possible restructurings in supply chains can incur signi/ficant costs.",

Even though the cash /flows are hedged for the existing order book, the weakening of the US dollar in the longer term could weaken Hiab's results. Similarly, a stronger dollar could strengthen Hiab's results.\n\nMacGregor's market situation involves uncertainties. It is anticipated that the oversupply in the merchant ship market will take time to balance out, since capacity will continue to increase while demand is expected to grow very moderately. The tightening emission regulation for ships and related uncertainty may limit new investments in the short term. The uncertainty regarding oil price development and global decarbonisation targets have led to an intense fall in investments by the oil industry and created oversupply in the offshore market that has decreased offshore vessel investments. The concurrent deterioration in both markets has a negative impact on the /financial situation of shipyards, ship owners, and ship operators. A longer-term market downturn could result in an impairment of MacGregor's goodwill.\n\nIn the challenging market situation, customers may also try to postpone or cancel orders. Deterioration of the global economic outlook and access to /finance can lead to economic and /financial dif/ficulties among customers. In some cases their /financial position may deteriorate signi/ficantly or even lead to insolvency. Challenges and uncertainties related to deliveries may increase Cargotec's net working capital and reduce cash /flow.\n\nCargotec is involved in certain legal disputes and trials. The interpretation of international agreements and legislation may weaken the predictability of the end results of legal disputes and trials.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nRisks regarding Cargotec's acquisitions are related to, for example, the knowledge of the local markets, authority processes, customers, corporate culture, integration, costs, achieving targets as well as key employees.\n\nThere are also ethical risks related to the industries and the geographical scope where Cargotec operates in. Cargotec has increased actions to ensure compliance with its business guidelines, regulations and ethical principles. Related internal processes are constantly being developed.\n\nMore information on risks is available at www.cargotec.com, under Investors > Governance > Internal control and risk management.\n\n## Board of Directors' proposal on the distribution of profit\n\nThe parent company's distributable equity on 31 December 2020 was EUR 753,008,900.10. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting convening on 23 March 2021 that of the distributable pro/fit, a dividend of EUR 1.07 for each of the 9,526,089 class A shares and EUR 1.08 for each of the 54,957,239 outstanding class B shares be paid, totalling EUR 69,546,733.35. The remaining distributable equity, EUR 683,462,166.75 will be retained and carried forward.\n\nThe dividend shall be paid to shareholders who on the record date for dividend distribution, 25 March 2021, are registered as shareholders in the company's shareholder register. The dividend payment date proposed by the Board of Directors is 1 April 2021.\n\nNo signi/ficant changes have occurred in Cargotec's /financial position after the end of the /financial year. Liquidity is at a healthy level and the proposed distribution of dividend poses no risk on the company's /financial standing.\n\n## Events after the reporting period\n\nCargotec announced on 12 January 2021 about concluding a settlement with Nekkar ASA on TTS marine and offshore businesses' purchase price. After completing the acquisition of the marine and offshore businesses of TTS Group ASA (now Nekkar ASA) on 31 July 2019, and challenging the calculation of the purchase price, MacGregor has concluded a settlement agreement with Nekkar. The settlement agreement provides for a total payment of NOK 94 million (EUR 9.1 million) to be made by Nekkar to MacGregor in full and /final settlement of the disputed purchase price. The payment is net of NOK 8 million (EUR 0.8 million) previously withheld by MacGregor related to the ful/fillment of Nekkar tax obligations in China following completion of the acquisition. The settlement amount will have an approximately EUR 7 million positive impact on MacGregor's /first quarter 2021 operating pro/fit.\n\n## Outlook for 2021\n\nCargotec expects its comparable operating pro/fit for 2021 to improve from 2020 (EUR 228 1 million).\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2021\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of Cargotec Corporation will be held in Helsinki on Tuesday, 23 March 2021 at 1.00 p.m. EET.\n\nHelsinki, 4 February 2021\n\nCargotec Corporation\n\nBoard of Directors",

The IAS and IFRS standards as well as SIC and IFRIC interpretations valid on 31 December 2020 have been used in preparation of the /financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements include the parent company Cargotec Corporation and those subsidiaries in which the parent exercises control, as well as joint ventures and associated companies. Control is achieved when Cargotec is exposed to, or has rights to,\n\nvariable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, and control is lost when this criteria is no longer met. Subsidiaries have been listed in note 7.3, Subsidiaries. Consolidation principles related to subsidiaries, joint ventures, associated companies and acquisitions and disposals are presented in the note section 7. Group structure.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain classes of /financial instruments, cash-settled components of share-based payments, and funds invested in post-employment de/fined bene/fit plans that are measured at fair value.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and reporting currency of the parent company. Financial information is presented in millions of euros and business transactions are based on historical cost convention unless otherwise stated. All /figures presented have been rounded which may cause, for example, the sum of individual /figures to deviate from the presented sum total.\n\nCargotec describes the accounting principles in conjunction with relevant note or note section. Refer to the following table for a list of accounting principles and /financial statement note or note section in which they are presented.\n\n| Accounting principle                                       | Note or note section                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Segment reporting                                          | 2.1 Segment information                                             |\n| Revenue recognition and contract assets and  liabilities   | 2.2 Revenue recognition                                             |\n| Government grants                                          | 2.3 Other operating income and expenses                             |\n| Earnings per share                                         | 2.6 Earnings per share                                              |\n| Share-based payments                                       | 3.2 Share-based payments                                            |\n| Pension obligations                                        | 3.4 Post-employment benefits                                        |\n| Income taxes                                               | 4.

The amendment includes an updated de/finition of business, and guidance including an optional simpli/fied test to conclude if IFRS 3 is applicable in an acquisition or not. Therefore, the amendment may allow a simpler accounting method for some of the future acquisitions.\n\nAmendments to standards IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments, Disclosures (effective from 1 January 2020) include guidance for a situation in which a commonly applied benchmark interest rate is changing.\n\nAmendment to IFRS 16, COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions, the amendment allows entities to ignore certain rent concessions in their lease reporting. The relief is applicable only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and meeting the conditions set for the use of relief.\n\nThe other amendments effective from 1 January 2020 had no impact on the reported /figures.\n\n## New or amended IFRS standards and interpretations from 2021\n\nIn 2021 and afterwards, Cargotec will adopt the following new and amended standards and interpretations by the IASB. The amendments are not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on Cargotec's reporting.\n\n## Effective from 1.1.2022\n\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020: Improvement in IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, clari/fies that when assessing if a modi/fication of a /financial liability results in a modi/fication of an existing debt instrument or recognition of a new one, the entity should prepare a present value test of the cash /flows related to /financial liability before and after modi/fication including fees paid and received between the lender and borrower. The annual improvements to other standards are minor or not relevant to Cargotec.\n\nAmendments to IAS 16, Property, Plant, and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use, the amendment clari/fies how to account for sales proceeds when items are produced and while an item of property, plant, and equipment is brought to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. In accordance with the clari/fication, such proceeds should be reported as revenues and not as a reduction of costs.\n\nAmendments to IAS 37, Onerous Contracts - Cost of Ful/filling a Contract, the amendment clari/fies that the cost of ful/filling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract including incremental costs such as labor and materials, and allocation of other costs that relate directly to ful/filling the contract such depreciation charge related to property, plant, and equipment used in ful/filling the contract.\n\n## Effective from 1.1.2023\n\nAmendment to IAS 1, Classi/fication of Liabilities as Current or Non-current, the amendment clari/fies how liability should be classi/fied as current or non-current when an entity has a right to defer its settlement for at least twelve months. In accordance with the amended guidance, a liability that is due within 12 months after the reporting date should be presented as noncurrent if the entity has a right to extend it for at least 12 months after the reporting date. In this case, the liability is presented as non-current on reporting date even regardless of the probability or intention of the management to settle it within the next 12 months.",

In addition, management judgement may be required in applying the accounting principles.\n\nEstimates and assumptions requiring management judgement are based on the management's historical experience as well as best knowledge about the events and other factors, such as expectations on future events, which can be considered reasonable. The actual amounts may differ signi/ficantly from the estimates used in the /financial statements. Cargotec follows the changes in estimates, assumptions and the factors affecting them by using multiple internal and external sources of information.

The revenue recognition criteria are usually applied separately to each contract, unless multiple contracts effectively form a single transaction, and within contracts, revenue recognition is determined separately for each distinct product or service. A product or service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation if it is separable from other contractual promises to the customer, and if the customer can bene/fit from it on its own or together with other readily available resources. Therefore, a single agreement including multiple deliverable elements may include one or more distinct items of revenue. Cargotec has the main responsibility to ful/fil the performance obligations, and, therefore, mainly acts as principal in its customer contracts, also when subcontractors are used.\n\nThe transaction price allocated to distinct promised goods or services is based on the amount Cargotec expects to receive from the sale by taking into account the agreed contractual transaction price and the assessment of impact of any related variable price elements, such as performance bonuses or late delivery penalties. Although the variable price elements are commonly used in contracts, the project outcomes are mostly reliably predictable and the impact of variable price elements in the overall revenue recognition of projects is not determinant. The transaction price is allocated to distinct products and services in accordance with their relative fair values that are based either on list prices or expected production costs and margins, depending on the product or service.\n\nRevenue is recognised separately for each distinct product or service either over time or at a certain point in time, based on the ful/filment of the performance obligations and how the control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. The control is considered to be transferred over time if the bene/fit received from performance is produced and consumed simultaneously, or if the produced performance improves an asset controlled by the customer. In addition, control is considered to be transferred over time when delivering products with a highly customised design, if it is assessed that the product is not suitable as such or with minor modi/fications for another customer and if Cargotec has a contractual right to a payment regarding the produced output.

The timing of the transfer is primarily determined based on the transfer of risks and rewards. Depending on the type of product, the applied delivery method and the contract terms, the risks and rewards are considered to be transferred either in accordance with the applied delivery term, when the installation of the product is ready, or when the customer accepts the product.\n\nIf a customer contract is expected to be loss-making, the costs arising from the contract are estimated with the same principles that are applied to provisions and the expected loss is recognised immediately in the statement of income.\n\nRevenue from sales of machines and equipment that are either manufactured in large quantities or their manufacturing requires no signi/ficant amount of design work is recognised at a point in time when the signi/ficant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer and the company no longer has the authority or control over the goods. When these products are sold without delivery or installation, the revenue is recognised when the product is handed over or otherwise made available to the customer. If standard products are sold with delivery but without installation, the timing of revenue recognition is stipulated by the applied delivery clause (Incoterm). If standard products are sold together with an installation service, the timing of revenue recognition is determined based on the complexity of the installation work. Complex installation services are considered to be performance obligations closely related to the installed products, and, therefore, the revenue from both is recognised only after the installation is completed. On the contrary, the non-complex installation services that are typically of short duration and low in value do not determine the timing of the product's revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue from sales of machines and equipment, the manufacturing of which requires a signi/ficant amount of design work, is recognised over time by using the percentage of completion method if it is assessed that the product is not suitable as such or with minor modi/fications for another customer, and if Cargotec has a contractual right to a payment regarding the produced output. Due to this two-tier rule, the timing of the revenue recognition of these products is in practice determined by the payment terms of the contract. The percentage of completion is determined either by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost method) or by completion of a certain physical milestone (milestone method). If it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract, costs are recognised as incurred and revenues only to an extent the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered.\n\nRevenue from sales of ready-to-use software is recognised when the software is delivered or otherwise made available to the customer. Revenue is recognised at a point in time if the customer obtains a perpetual right to use it as it exists at the point in time at which the licence is granted. If the software sold with perpetual licence requires signi/ficant customer-speci/fic customisation, the software licence and the customisation work are considered to be a combined performance obligation, and the related revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on the amount of work performed. If it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract, costs are recognised as incurred and revenues only to an extent the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered. If a software licence is sold for a de/fined period of time, or as a service, the related revenue is recognised over the licence or service period.\n\nRevenue from sales related to service contracts is recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method when the outcome of the project can be reliably estimated. The stage of completion is determined by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost method) or by reference to the amount of service work performed from the expected total amount of service work to be performed (milestone method). The percentage of completion related to long-term and small-value service contracts is not assessed at an individual contract level based on the costs incurred or amount of work performed, but it is based on an estimate of how the costs are generally incurred and services performed over a contract period with a similar length. When the services are delivered evenly over time, such as with software maintenance and support services and extended warranties, or require an unde/fined number of acts, the revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the contract period. If the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, the project costs are recognised in the statement of income during the period in which they are incurred and the revenue only to the extent that the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered. Expected contract losses are recognised as expenses immediately. Revenue from short-term service orders is recognised when the service has been rendered.\n\nCargotec offers customer /finance services to certain customer segments and distribution channels. In these transactions, Cargotec is involved in arranging /financing to the customer or dealer either directly by itself or in cooperation with a /financing partner. It is typical that in these arrangements Cargotec continues to carry some level of residual value risk related to the sold product or credit risk related to the end customer. Depending on the type and level of risk retained, Cargotec accounts for its sales under customer /finance arrangements as normal sales, operating or /finance leases, or /financing arrangements in accordance with the true nature of the transaction.",

Unbilled receivables represent the amount of revenue recognised relating to the work performed that exceeds the sum of invoicing and recognised losses. Contract assets are recognised as other non-interest-bearing receivables on the balance sheet. Contract liabilities relate to advances received from customer contracts and represent the amount of prepayments received, or invoiced, in excess of the revenue recognised. Contract liabilities are recognised as advances received on the balance sheet. Contract asset and liability balances are determined separately for each customer contract.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue recognition requires in many parts a use of judgment and estimates. Judgment is used for example in identi/fication of separate units of revenue i.e. performance conditions when treating the deliverable products and services together or separately is not unambiguous. This is for example when the deliverable products and services alone do not form a functioning end-product. It is also customary that contracts with customers include variable price elements that require use of judgment in revenue recognition, especially in situations when there is no prior experience about the deliverable product or entirety. However, judgment is needed the most in determining the timing of revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue related to long-term service contracts and separately identi/fied construction contracts is recognised on an over time basis in accordance with the percentage of completion. Application of the percentage of completion method is allowed if the delivered machine is estimated to have no alternative use for Cargotec, and at all times during the project Cargotec has a right to payment regarding the work already performed. Revenue recognised on reporting date in accordance with the over time model is based on the cumulative costs in relation to the contract's estimated total costs, or an estimate of the construction contract's physical stage of completion. If the estimate of the /final outcome of the contract changes, the recognition of revenue and pro/fit is adjusted in the period the change has come to attention and can be estimated. The expected loss from the construction contract is expensed immediately.

Restructuring costs are based on their nature, recognised in the balance sheet as an impairment to assets, as restructuring provisions or as accruals. A part of the costs is recognised on an accrual basis in the statement of income and also paid during the /financial period.\n\nIn May 2017, Cargotec announced it would target EUR 50 million annual cost savings by reducing indirect purchasing spend, streamlining processes and centralising administrative operations to Cargotec Business Services centre. Cargotec Business Services started its activities during autumn 2017 in So/fia, Bulgaria, and expanded the operations during 20182020. Costs that relate to this on-going group wide reorganisation of support functions are reported as employment termination costs and other restructuring costs. The realised savings cumulative since the beginning of the programme amount to approximately EUR 57 million. Around EUR 16 million savings were achieved during 2020.\n\nDuring 2020 Cargotec's all businesses improved productivity by structural measures and number of employees decreased permanently with some 1000 employees.\n\nKalmar's restructuring costs in 2020 include a loss of EUR 35.6 million from the sale of the joint venture ownership in Rainbow-Cargotec Industries Co., Ltd (RCI) and integration costs from simultaneously acquired operations. Addtionally, restructuring costs include costs from discontinuing the operations of Kalmar's multi-assembly unit in India.\n\nHiab's restructuring costs in 2020 include an impairment loss of EUR 4.0 million on the joint venture ownership in Sinotruk Hiab (Shandong) Equipment Co., Ltd.\n\nMacGregor continued during 2019 and 2020 to streamline its operations to adjust to the challenging market situation. Restructuring costs booked relate mainly to the integration of the marine- and offshore businesses of TTS Group ASA, acquired in the end of July 2019, and winding down certain products in MacGregor's offshore product portfolio due to offshore market's fundamental transition from the traditional oil and gas centric business towards more renewable energy sources. From the offshore product portfolio related write downs EUR 20.7 million was booked to inventory in 2019.\n\n## Other items affecting comparability\n\nOther items affecting comparability include mainly signi/ficant gains and losses from sale of business, costs related to acquisitions, integration and disposals of business, impairments and reversals of impairments of assets, insurance bene/fits and expenses related to legal proceedings. These items are reported in the statement of income either in administration expenses, other operating income or other operating expenses.\n\n## 2\ufffd5 Financing income and expenses\n\n## Financing income\n\n| MEUR                                                           | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2020   |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Interest income on financial assets measured at amortised cost | 2.8                  |                  3.8 |\n| Other financing income                                         | 0.0                  |                  0.1 |\n| Exchange rate differences, net                                 | -                    |                  0.1 |\n| Total                                                          | 2.8                  |                  4   |\n\n## Financing expenses\n\n| MEUR                                                                   |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2020 | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Interest expenses on financial liabilities measured at amortised  cost |                 18.3 | 17.6                 |\n| Interest expenses on leases                                            |                  7.4 | 8.1                  |\n| Arrangement and commitment fees relating to interest-bearing  loans    |                  2.5 | 1.5                  |\n| Forward contracts interest component                                   |                  4.4 | 9.7                  |\n| Other financing expenses                                               |                  4   | 1.3                  |\n| Exchange rate differences, net                                         |                  2.1 | -                    |\n| Total                                                                  |                 38.7 | 38.1                 |\n\nOther /financing expenses includes EUR 2.4 (2019: 0.2) million of impairment losses related to loan receivables.\n\n## Exchange rate differences included in financing income and expenses\n\n| MEUR                                                                 |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2020 |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Exchange rate differences on interest-bearing receivables and  loans |                 16.4 |                 -2.4 |\n| Exchange rate differences on derivative instruments                  |                -18.5 |                  2.5 |\n| Total                                                                |                 -2.1 |                  0.1 |",

The group's potential dilutive ordinary shares relate to equity-settled share-based incentive schemes. The shares granted under the incentive schemes are contingently issuable, and therefore, are considered like options when calculating the diluted earnings per share. Shares and share options are dilutive when their subscription price, including the value of the employee's yet undelivered service, is lower than the average share price during the reporting period. Dilutive effect is the difference between the number of shares to be issued and the number of shares that would have been issued at the average share price of the reporting period.\n\n|                                                                    | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2020   | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Net income attributable to the equity holders of the parent, MEUR  | 8.1                  | 89.4                 |\n| Weighted average number of shares during financial period, ('000)* | 64,408               | 64,358               |\n| Earnings per share, EUR                                            | 0.13                 | 1.39                 |\n\n|                                                                            | Note   | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2020   | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Net income attributable to the equity holders of the  parent, MEUR         |        | 8.1                  | 89.4                 |\n| Weighted average number of shares during financial  period, ('000)*        |        | 64,408               | 64,358               |\n| Effect of share-based incentive programmes, ('000)                         | 3.2    | 101                  | 120                  |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares during  financial period, ('000) |        | 64,508               | 64,477               |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                                            |        | 0.13                 | 1.39                 |\n\nAnnual review\n\nFinancial review\n\n## 2\ufffd7 Information about the impact of COVID-19 in the financial reporting\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020. The pandemic has had a huge impact on societies, /financial markets and businesses around the world and it has treated countries and industries very differently. The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has had a signi/ficant impact on Cargotec also and it is expected that in many aspects the effects of the crisis will only become apparent with a delay. As the full impact of the crisis is not yet visible and there are several possible development paths from the current situation, it is still dif/ficult to assess the overall impact of the crisis.\n\nDuring the /first quarter of 2020, the pandemic situation led to the closure of Cargotec's assembly units in Spain, Ireland, Italy and Malaysia. The crisis had similar effects on Cargotec's subcontractors and suppliers. During the /first quarter, Cargotec initiated adjustment measures to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on earnings, which resulted in monthly cost savings of approximately EUR 10 million. Travel restrictions and delivery dif/ficulties hampered business in the /first quarter, but the impacts did not yet signi/ficantly affect the reported /figures.\n\nIn the second quarter, the effects of the pandemic were re/flected in both demand and Cargotec's delivery capability. Orders received improved every month after a weak April. Cargotec's assembly units could be restarted by June, and also challenges related to supply chains decreased. With the decrease in sales, the amount of customer receivables decreased, and at the same time the relative share of overdue trade receivables increased due to the economic situation.\n\nIn the third quarter, the situation did not change signi/ficantly. The pandemic showed signs of acceleration in many countries after the summer, but this did not have the same negative impact on business as in the spring. However, business volumes remained lower, re/flecting the prevailing economic uncertainty, the slowdown in global economic growth and other indirect effects. At the same time, Cargotec shifted the focus of cost savings from temporary to more permanent savings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the pandemic situation remained dif/ficult in many countries, but coronavirus vaccines have been launched and vaccinations are underway. Business volumes started to improve, with order intake in the fourth quarter at the level of the comparison period. Recorded sales revenues also developed in a positive direction, although they remained signi/ficantly below the level of the comparison period.",

The share of overdue trade receivables decreased compared to the previous quarter, and there was no signi/ficant change in realized credit losses. Inventories decreased signi/ficantly during the /financial year. The total amount of obsolescence of inventories also started to decrease in the fourth quarter and was EUR 105 (December 31, 2019: 98) million at the end of the year.\n\nCargotec prepared for a possible /financial market imbalance by raising a total of EUR 250 million in loans from its partner banks during the second quarter. The loans have a term of two to three years and include a /financing condition limiting the company's capital structure, according to which Cargotec's gearing in accordance with IFRS 16 may not exceed 125 percent. Additional information on the liquidity position is presented in Note 8.1, Financial risk management.\n\nFor the near future, the immediate /financial impact of the crisis on Cargotec's business will depend above all on the success of pandemic management in different countries. If the current situation persists, the indirect economic effects of the crisis are expected to intensify.\n\nIn the prevailing operating environment, Cargotec seeks to prepare for the identi/fied and probable effects of the crisis. These effects have also been taken into account in the reported /figures based on actual or forecasts, and the forecasts used in the current situation are signi/ficantly based on management's estimates.\n\nDue to the current uncertainty related to the /financial operating environment, Cargotec reported the key results of its annual goodwill impairment testing in connection with the /financial reporting for the third quarter of 2020 and for MacGregor, the impairment test has been renewed on December 31, 2020.\n\n## MacGregor goodwill impairment testing\n\nMacGregor's goodwill has been tested for impairment in 2020 on a quarterly basis. In the /first quarter of the year the value of the recoverable amount exceeding the carrying value of assets was at its lowest at EUR 7 million after which it increased to EUR 127 million by the end of the year. The value is very sensitive to changes in WACC as well as forecasts, so the risk for impairment is still signi/ficant although it has decreased.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the MacGregor segment was determined based on value in use and the test showed a slight improvement over third quarter testing. The improvement was mainly due to lower WACC and changes in the balance sheet. The used WACC before taxes was 9.2% (December 31, 2019: 7.4% after taxes).\n\nBased on the performed impairment tests, no impairment loss has been recognised. MacGregor's recoverable amount is still on a low level in comparison to the assets being tested. MacGregor segment's goodwill on the reporting date was EUR 481.9 (31 Dec 2019: 493.6) million.\n\nAs part of MacGregor's impairment testing, sensitivity analyses have been performed for the key assumptions based on three different scenarios. The changes tested in the analyses are a 2 percentage point increase in the discount rate in the /first scenario, 10 percent decrease in turnover and 2 percentage point decrease in operating pro/fit margin throughout the estimation period in the second scenario, and the combined effect of the previous scenarios in the third scenario. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the table below.\n\n## MacGregor goodwill sensitivity analysis\n\n|             |                                                               | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results Scenario 1 Scenario 2   | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results Scenario 1 Scenario 2   | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results Scenario 1 Scenario 2                                      |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|             | Recoverable amount  in excess of book  value of assets,  MEUR | WACC +2  percentage points                                         | Sales -10 percent  and operating profit  -2 percentage points      | Scenario 3 Sales -10 percent,  operating profit -2  percentage points  and WACC +2  percentage points |\n| 31 Dec 2020 | 127.0                                                         | Impairment*                                                        | Impairment**                                                       | Impairment                                                                                            |\n| 31 Dec 2019 | 170.0                                                         | Impairment*                                                        | Impairment**                                                       | Impairment                                                                                            |\n\nDue to the current minor excess value of MacGregor's recoverable amount compared to the book value of assets, the amount to be written off would be signi/ficant if the scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis realize; EUR 51 (31 Dec 2019: 29) million in the /first scenario, EUR 168 (133) million in the second, and EUR 282 (274) million in the third.\n\n## Goodwill impairment testing of Kalmar and Hiab\n\nAs part of the annual goodwill impairment testing that was performed in the third quarter, the recoverable amounts of the Kalmar and Hiab segments were determined based on value in use. The pre-tax WACC used in the testing was 9.9% (2019: 10.4%) for Kalmar and 9.3% (9.6%) for Hiab. Based on the testing, no impairment was recorded in the goodwill of either segment, nor did any of the sensitivity analyses indicate an impairment. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on the same principles as the sensitivity analyses performed for MacGregor described above.",

The bene/fits granted in accordance with the incentive plan are measured at fair value at the grant date and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the equity-settled incentives is based on the market price of the share at the grant date. Equity-settled incentives include bene/fits paid in shares and the portion of share bene/fits that is used to pay income taxes if Cargotec has an obligation to withhold them. The share-based payments settled with equity instruments are not revalued subsequently, and cost from these arrangements is recognised as an increase in equity. The cash-settled share-based incentives are valued at fair value at each closing until the settlement date and recognised as a liability.\n\nAnnual review\n\nFinancial review\n\nThe expensed amount of the bene/fits is based on the group's estimate of the amount of bene/fits to be paid in accordance with the ful/filment of service and performance-based vesting conditions at the end of the vesting period. Market conditions and non-vesting conditions are considered in determining the fair value of the bene/fit. Instead, the nonmarket criteria, like pro/fitability or increase in sales, are not considered in measuring the fair value of the bene/fit but are taken into account when estimating the /final amount of bene/fits. The estimate is updated at each closing date and changes in estimates are recorded through the statement of income.\n\n## Share-based incentive programme 2020-2024\n\nIncentive programme for the years 2020-2024 is targeted to the members of the executive board and other key persons. The programme consists of three annually granted incentive programme periods in which rewards are conditional on the ful/filment of a three-year service condition and performance conditions tied to /financial targets that are separately set for each year. The reward is granted and settled in Cargotec class B shares on top of which Cargotec pays taxes and tax-related expenses. The reward is paid after each three-year incentive programme period based on ful/fillment of the vesting criteria.\n\n2020\n\n| First year earnings criteria                                                                                 | Comparable operating  profit, Navis' sales, cloud  transformation   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Range of reward per participant based on the level of participation and  fulfilment of the earnings criteria | 0-24.400 shares and a cash  portion for taxes                       |\n| Expected total cost of the programme on grant date, MEUR                                                     | 5,4                                                                 |\n| Initial number of participants                                                                               | 151                                                                 |\n| Participants fullfilling the minimum earnings criteria on 31 Dec 2020                                        | 147                                                                 |\n| Number of class B shares granted                                                                             | 359,590                                                             |\n| Number of class B shares forfeited in 2020                                                                   | 7,980                                                               |\n| Number of class B shares subject to vesting conditions on 31 Dec 2020                                        | 351,610                                                             |",

Persons participating in the program make an investment to Cargotec shares at the inception of the program and receive an equivalent amount of shares in accordance with the matching share programme.  The reward is granted and settled in Cargotec class B shares on top of which Cargotec pays taxes and tax-related expenses.

The value of the retention program is EUR 1.5 million, and the payment under the program will be paid as a one-off payment to the CEO's supplemental pension plan under the new pension agreement after the completion of the merger. The payment is subject to the following preconditions: the merger is completed, the CEO continues in the service of the company, he has not served a notice of termination prior to the completion of the merger and has performed his duties according to his contract. The capital redemption policy related to the retention incentive program has been pledged to the director as security for the pension agreement promise, creating a liability of EUR 1.5 million for Cargotec.\n\nThe CEO is entitled to a supplemental de/fined contribution pension bene/fit. According to the renewed pension agreement in 2020, the CEO is entitled to retire at the age of 65. If the CEO's service ends before the retirement age of 65 determined in the pension agreement, the CEO is entitled to begin taking the supplemental pension at the age of 62. No supplemental pension contributions have been paid in 2020 or 2019. Additionally, the CEO is entitled to a statutory pension, for which a pension cost of EUR 0.2 (2019: 0.1) million was recorded in year 2020.

The plans are classi/fied either as de/fined contribution plans or de/fined bene/fit plans.\n\nA de/fined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays /fixed contributions into a separate entity with no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold suf/ficient assets to pay all employees the bene/fits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to the de/fined contribution plans are charged directly to the statement of income in the year to which these contributions relate.\n\nA de/fined bene/fit plan is a pension plan under which the group itself has the obligation to pay retirement bene/fits and bears the risk of change in the value of plan liability and assets. The liability recognised on the balance sheet in respect of de/fined bene/fit pension plans is the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the end of reporting period less fair value of plan assets. The de/fined bene/fit obligation regarding each signi/ficant plan is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the",

The present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out/flows using interest rates of high-quality corporate or government bonds with approximating terms to maturity and that are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits are expected to be paid. The applied discount rates are determined in each country by an external actuary. If an asset is recognised on the balance sheet based on the calculation, the recognition is limited to the present value of economic bene/fits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nActuarial gains and losses related to remeasurements of a de/fined bene/fit plan and the effect of the asset ceiling, if any, are recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income. Interest and all other expenses related to de/fined bene/fit plans are recognised directly in the statement of income.\n\nIf a plan is amended or curtailed, the portion of the changed bene/fit related to past service by the employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised directly in the statement of income when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe present value of pension obligations depends on a number of factors determined on an actuarial basis by using a number of /financial and demographic assumptions, and changes in these assumptions impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The key /financial assumption used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions is the discount rate. The appropriate discount rate is determined at the end of each year and is used in calculating the present value of estimated cash out/flows to settle the pension obligation. In determining the appropriate discount rate, Cargotec considers the yields of high-quality corporate or government bonds, depending on the country, that are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. These bonds are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits will be paid and have maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Other key assumptions related to pension obligations include /financial assumptions such as estimated increases in salaries and pensions, and demographic assumptions such as mortality rates.\n\nCargotec has various post-employment bene/fit plans throughout the world. Pension arrangements are made in accordance with local regulations and practices in line with the de/fined contribution pension plans or de/fined bene/fit pension plans.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit arrangements determine the amount of pension to be paid and the bene/fits to be paid for disability and at termination of employment. The bene/fits in these arrangements are usually based on the length of employment and the level of /final salary.\n\nThe main countries having de/fined bene/fit plans are Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway. The most signi/ficant plans are in Sweden. The de/fined bene/fit pension plans are funded by the relevant group companies to satisfy local statutory funding requirements.\n\n## Summary of the impact of post-employment benefits in the financial statements\n\n| MEUR                                                                           |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Present value of unfunded obligations                                          |  108.4 |  100.2 |\n| Present value of funded obligations                                            |   40   |   42   |\n| Fair value of benefit plan assets                                              |   38.1 |   36.1 |\n| Net liability                                                                  |  110.4 |  106   |\n| Net liability on balance sheet                                                 |  115.5 |  110.4 |\n| Net asset on balance sheet                                                     |    5.2 |    4.4 |\n| Expense related to defined contribution plans                                  |   51.5 |   51   |\n| Expense related to defined benefit plans and other   post-employment benefits  |    8.1 |    7   |\n| Expense in the statement of income                                             |   59.6 |   58   |\n| Remeasurement of defined pension benefits and other   post-employment benefits |   -1.2 |  -13.9 |\n| Remeasurement in the statement of comprehensive income                         |   -1.2 |  -13.9 |\n\nExpected contributions to de/fined bene/fit plan assets during the next reporting period is EUR 4.8 (31 Dec 2019: EUR 2.0) million.

The discount rate in Sweden is based on Swedish housing market bonds, the discount rate in the United Kingdom is based on iBoxx quoted for sterling corporate bonds and the discount rate in Norway is based on Norwegian covered bond yields.

The sensitivity analysis has been prepared for one variable at a time while holding all other variables constant. Regardless of the actual volatility of the given variable, for presentation purposes the analysis has been prepared by assuming a /fixed change in the key variable as indicated in table. Consequently, the purpose of the analysis is not to quantify possible or expected change in the de/fined bene/fit obligation but to illustrate the sensitivity of the value of obligation to these variables, the /fluctuation of which may deviate from the /figures presented in practice. The sensitivity analysis covers 89 (31 Dec 2019: 88) percent of the net de/fined bene/fit liability recognised on the balance sheet.\n\nThe analysis above assesses only the pension liability's sensitivity to given variables without considering the plan assets. Although the changes in the discount rate create the most signi/ficant risk to plan based on the sensitivity analysis, in practice, the interest rate sensitivity is partly offset by the plan assets that include investments in bonds. The plan assets also include instruments such as equities and funds that in the near term may be volatile, but on the long run are expected to outperform corporate bond yields. The risks related to asset performance are signi/ficant both due to the absolute size of plan assets and due to their relative size compared to plan liability. This risk is mitigated by suitable asset allocation and balancing between risk and return. The de/fined bene/fit obligation is determined based on the current best estimate of the life expectancy. If the assumed life expectancy proves to be underestimated, also the recognised plan liability will be insuf/ficient. Uncertainty regarding the reliability of this estimate is also a risk to the plan.",

INCOME TAXES\n\n## Accounting principle\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes in the statement of income include group companies' taxes based on the taxable income, changes in deferred taxes and adjustments to taxes for previous periods. Income taxes based on the taxable income are calculated by using the local tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Tax is recognised in the statement of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is presented in the statement of other comprehensive income. Deferred taxes are calculated on the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated /financial statements and on the unutilised tax losses. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unutilised tax losses can be utilised. Deferred taxes are measured with the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or liability settled. When there is uncertainty over an income tax treatment, Cargotec considers uncertain tax positions either separately or together as a group based on the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. Recognised income taxes are adjusted where it is considered probable that a tax authority or competent court will not accept an uncertain tax treatment applied by Cargotec in an income tax /filing. Income taxes are in that case adjusted either based on an estimate of the most likely amount or the expected weighted average value of the /final tax amount, taking into account the tax authorities' expected acceptance of the chosen tax treatment.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe determination of taxes based on taxable income, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised on the balance sheet, requires management judgement.\n\nCargotec is subject to income tax in several jurisdictions where there may be uncertainty over an income tax treatment and the interpretation of tax legislation requires management judgment. Cargotec assesses regularly uncertainties related to income tax treatments and where required, adjusts the recognised taxes either to an estimate of the most likely amount or the expected weighted average value of the /final tax amount taking into account the tax authorities' expected acceptance of the chosen tax treatment.",

Where there is a recent history of loss, Cargotec assesses if that loss arises from factors which are likely to recur. The recognition of deferred tax assets is supported by an offsetting deferred tax liabilites and where applicable an assessment of earnings history and pro/fit projections in the relevant jurisdictions.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, Cargotec had EUR 339.9 (31 Dec 2019: 316.5) million of tax losses and credits carried forward for which no deferred tax assets were recognised because the realisation of the tax bene/fit is not probable. Tax losses and credits of EUR 12.5 (31 Dec 2019: 19.0) million will expire during the next /five years and EUR 327.5 (31 Dec 2019: 297.4) million have no expiry date or will expire after /five years. Unrecognised tax losses and credits relate mainly to Norway and Germany.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, Cargotec had reduced income tax assets recorded by net amount of EUR 15.4 (31 Dec 2019: 15.9) million to re/flect uncertainty related to income taxes. The matter mainly relates to the non-acceptance of tax deductions for which Cargotec may appeal and claim a tax refund.\n\nA deferred tax liability on undistributed pro/fits of subsidiaries located in countries where distribution generates tax consequences is recognised when it is likely that the earnings will be distributed in the foreseeable future. On 31 December 2020, Cargotec had EUR 165.4 (31 Dec 2019: 450.1) million of undistributed pro/fits for which no deferred tax liability was recognised.",

Cost is primarily determined using the weighted average method. The cost of inventory includes purchase cost as well as transportation and processing costs. The cost of selfmanufactured /finished goods and work in progress includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and a proportion of indirect costs related to manufacturing, and overheads. The value of inventory includes impairment related to excess and obsolete items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Inventories\n\nCargotec recognises an allowance for obsolete inventory items at the end of the reporting period based on the best knowledge. The estimate is based on a systematic and continuous monitoring of the inventory. The nature, state, age structure and volumes based on estimated need are taken into consideration when estimating the amount of obsolescence.\n\n| MEUR                                  |   31 Dec 2020 |   31 Dec 2019 |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Raw materials and supplies            |         219.2 |         265.8 |\n| Work in progress                      |         165.9 |         205.8 |\n| Finished goods                        |         166.2 |         196.7 |\n| Advance payments paid for inventories |          28.3 |          44.8 |\n| Total                                 |         579.7 |         713   |\n\nThe value of inventories has been reduced to the net realizable value by an obsolescence provision of EUR 105.5 (31 Dec 2019: 97.9) million at the end of period.\n\nImpairment of inventories included in restructuring costs is presented in note 2.4, Restructuring costs and other items affecting comparability.",

Expected credit losses include two components. The /first component is calculated mechanically by using a provision matrix in which the impairment is determined based on risk weights derived from the historical credit losses and the ageing analysis of customer receivables. The second credit loss component is derived by a forward-looking analysis based on which additional impairment exceeding the /first credit loss component can be recognised for a receivable or group of receivables. Impairments and allowances are recognised in the statement of income under cost of goods sold. Bad debts are written off upon an of/ficial announcement of liquidation or bankruptcy con/firming that the receivable will not be collected.\n\n| MEUR

Provisions are accounted for using the best estimate for the costs required to settle the obligation on the balance sheet date. In case the time value of money is signi/ficant, the provision is stated at present value.\n\nProvisions for warranties cover the estimated costs to repair or replace products that are still under warranty on the balance sheet date. Provision for warranty is calculated based on historical experience of levels of repairs and replacements.\n\nProvisions for product claims consist of expected costs arising from settling customer claims for which the value, probability and realisation can be estimated.\n\nA provision is recognised for an onerous contract when the unavoidable costs required to ful/fil the commitment exceed the gain to be received from the contract.\n\nA restructuring provision is recognised when Cargotec has prepared a detailed restructuring plan and started the implementation of the plan or communicated the plan. A restructuring plan shall include the following information: business which is affected, the main units and personnel affected by the restructuring, as well as the costs to be incurred and the timetable of the plan. A restructuring provision and other restructuring related expenses are booked to the function costs to which they by nature belong. However, in case of a signi/ficant restructuring programme of Cargotec or its business area, restructuring costs are presented separately in the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions\n\nThe amount of provision to be recorded is the best estimate of the cost required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. The estimate of the /financial impact of the past event requires management judgement, which is based on similar events occurred in the past, and where applicable, external experts' opinion. Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis, and adjusted to re/flect the current best estimate when necessary. The actual costs may differ from the estimated costs.\n\n| 2020  MEUR                   |   Product  warranties |   Claims | Restruc- turing   |   Onerous  contracts | Others   |   Total |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|---------|\n| Provisions 1 Jan             |                  74.6 |      7.9 | 20.4              |                 14   | 4.4      |   121.3 |\n| Translation differences      |                  -0.8 |     -0.3 | -0.7              |                 -0.4 | -0.1     |    -2.2 |\n| Increases                    |                  18.6 |      2.2 | 29.3              |                  3.7 | 0.9      |    54.6 |\n| Companies acquired and  sold |                  -2.2 |     -0.7 | -                 |                  0   | -        |    -2.8 |\n| Provisions used              |                 -12.7 |     -1.2 | -25.1             |                 -8.2 | -1.4     |   -48.5 |\n| Reversals of provisions      |                  -1.2 |     -1.5 | -0.9              |                 -4.1 | -1.5     |    -9.2 |\n| Provisions 31 Dec            |                  76.3 |      6.4 | 23.0              |                  4.9 | 2.4      |   113.1 |\n\n| 2019  MEUR                   |   Product  warranties |   Claims | Restruc- turing   |   Onerous  contracts |   Others |   Total |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|---------|\n| Provisions 1 Jan             |                  70.9 |      3.7 | 10.9              |                  9.9 |      2   |    97.4 |\n| Translation differences      |                   0.2 |      0.1 | 0.0               |                  0   |      0   |     0.3 |\n| Increases                    |                  22.9 |      3.2 | 19.8              |                  2.9 |      4   |    52.8 |\n| Companies acquired and  sold |                  10   |      3.9 | -                 |                 10.6 |      1.1 |    25.6 |\n| Provisions used              |                 -18.6 |     -0.7 | -10.0             |                 -7.9 |     -2.1 |   -39.3 |\n| Reversals of provisions      |                 -10.8 |     -2.3 | -0.4              |                 -1.5 |     -0.6 |   -15.6 |\n| Provisions 31 Dec            |                  74.6 |      7.9 | 20.4              |                 14   |      4.4 |   121.3 |",

The expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

INTANGIBLE AND TANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n## 6\ufffd1 Goodwill\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the fair value of previously owned interest and the fair value of noncontrolling interest over the fair value of the net identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of income. Goodwill is measured at cost less impairment. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of income. Goodwill is derecognised when subsidiaries are disposed of. The amount of disposed goodwill is determined in relation to the change in the value of the related reporting segment before and after the disposal, based on the value-in-use analysis, or alternatively, based on fair value less cost to sell.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment when any indication of impairment exists, or at least annually. Impairment testing is performed on the level of the CGU. Goodwill is allocated to those units or groups of units, identi/fied in accordance with the operating segments, that are expected to bene/fit from the business combination. The testing of other intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives is either performed as part of a CGU, or on an individual asset level if it is possible to determine independent cash /flows for it. The determined recoverable amount of a CGU is based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use is determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future net cash /flows of the tested CGU. The discount rate applied is the weighted average pre-tax cost of capital that re/flects the current market view of the time value of money and risks related to the tested unit.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the statement of income when the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment loss is /first allocated to goodwill and then to other assets on a pro rata basis.",

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill and intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives are allocated to cash-generating units. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on calculations that require management to make estimates and assumptions in determining both future cash /flows and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to discount them.\n\n| MEUR                    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Book value 1 Jan        | 1,058.5 | 970.9   |\n| Translation differences | -21.1   | 2.5     |\n| Companies acquired      | 8.0     | 85.1    |\n| Companies sold          | -       | -       |\n| Assets held for sale*   | -73.6   | -       |\n| Other changes           | 0.0     | -       |\n| Book value 31 Dec       | 971.9   | 1,058.5 |\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill\n\n| MEUR      |   31 Dec 2020 | 31 Dec 2019   |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|\n| Kalmar    |         267.6 | 338.0         |\n| Hiab      |         222.4 | 226.9         |\n| MacGregor |         481.9 | 493.6         |\n| Total     |         971.9 | 1,058.5       |\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for potential impairment whenever there is an indication that the current value may be impaired, or at least annually. Impairment testing of goodwill is carried out by allocating goodwill to the lowest cash generating unit level (CGU) which generates independent cash /flows. These levels have been identi/fied according to the operative business organisation to be the reported operating segments. Due to the way the operating segments are managed and organised, it is not possible to de/fine independent cash /flows for lower level product divisions.\n\nFinancial review\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (CGU) are determined in 2020 based on the value-in-use calculations. In 2019, the value-in-use calculation of MacGregor indicated impairment of goodwill, and, therefore, the recoverable amount of MacGregor was additionally determined based on the fair value less costs to sell. In both models, the recoverable amount is determined from future cash /flow projections that are based on the strategic plans approved by the top management and the Board of Directors and taking into account the prevailing risks and uncertainties in the market environment. The main difference between the models is that the fair value model re/flects assumptions that market participants would apply in pricing the asset, and, therefore, for example the planned ef/ficiency improvements can be taken into account at an earlier phase than in the model based on value-in-use to the extent it can be assumed that similar bene/fits from ef/ficiency improvements would be available to a market participant. In addition, the value-in-use model is based on pre-tax cash /flows whereas the fair value less cost to sell model is based on post-tax cash /flows. Cash /flow forecasts cover /five years, of which the ending year is used to derive the terminal value. The value of the ending year of the forecast period is determined by extrapolating it based on the average development over the past years and the esimated development over the forecasted period, by taking into account the cyclical nature of the CGU's business. Cash /flows beyond the forecast horizon have been projected using a growth rate that is based on an estimate of the long-term growth rate of the industries, taking into account the OECD long-term growth projections but capped by the level of risk-free rate used in the calculations. Long-term growth rates have been 1.4 (2019: 1.8) percent for Kalmar, 0.5 (0.8) percent for Hiab, and 1.4 (1.6) percent for MacGregor.\n\nThe key assumptions made by the management in the projections relate to market and pro/fitability outlooks. Future growth estimates are based on information available by external market research institutions on market development and timing of business cycles. Additionally, market share and growth potential in both new equipment and service markets have been taken into account when estimating future sales growth. Key factors affecting pro/fitability are sales volume, competitiveness and cost ef/ficiency. The relative share of service business from total revenue has also signi/ficance in the cash /flow projections due to its lower cyclicity and better than average pro/fitability. Additionally, in Kalmar and Hiab segments the utilisation rate of factories and assembly units and their cost competitiveness have a signi/ficant impact on pro/fitability. The ef/ficiency improvements over the past years in Kalmar and Hiab have affected positively in /financial performance, and the ongoing pro/fit improvement programmes are expected to further improve the pro/fitability in the coming years. MacGregor has continued streamlining its operations in adapting to the dif/ficult market conditions. Additionally, the synergy bene/fits resulting from the acquisition of TTS are signi/ficant. Cash /flow projections in the analyses re/flect typical working capital build-up in upturns and release during downturns in the Kalmar and Hiab segments. MacGregor's business model ties little working capital, but the estimated timing of orders and related advances received have been taken into account in cash /flow estimates.",

Components of WACC are a risk-free interest rate based on average of government bond yields weighted by the sales of cash generating unit in respective countries, market risk premium, comparable peer industry beta, gearing and credit spread. In the impairment testing based on value-in-use, the WACC is determined on a pre-tax basis whereas and in the impairment testing based on fair value less cost to sell, the WACC is determined on a post-tax basis. The discount rate used in the impairment testing has been determined in the same way as last year. The discount rate (WACC) used for Kalmar was 9.9 (2019: 10.4) percent, for Hiab 9.3 (9.6) percent and for MacGregor 9.2 (7.4) percent. The discount rates determined for Kalmar and Hiab have declined from previous year mainly because of the decrease in the government bond yields. The discount rate for MacGregor was determined in 2020 before taxes and in 2019 after taxes because of the different models applied in determining the recoverable amount, as described above.\n\nAs a result of the impairment tests performed no impairment loss has been recognised in 2020 nor 2019.\n\nSensitivity analyses of the key assumptions have been prepared as part of the impairment testing process for each CGU based on three different scenarios. The tested change in the /first scenario is an increase of 2 percentage points in the discount rate, in the second scenario a 10 percent decrease in sales together with a decrease of 2 percentage points in operating pro/fit margin, and in the third scenario the combined effect of the previous scenarios. The sensitivity analyses performed in 2020 and 2019 indicated no risk of impairment for the Hiab and Kalmar segments. The results of MacGregor segment's sensitivity analysis are presented in the table below.\n\n## MacGregor goodwill sensitivity analysis\n\n|            |                                                               | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results   | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results                    | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results                                                 |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|            | Recoverable amount  in excess of book  value of assets,  MEUR | WACC +2  percentage points                   | Sales -10 percent  and operating profit  -2 percentage points | Sales -10 percent,  operating profit -2  percetage points  and WACC + 2  percentage points |\n| 31.12.2020 | 127.0                                                         | Impairment*                                  | Impairment**                                                  | Impairment                                                                                 |\n| 31.12.2019 | 170.0                                                         | Impairment*                                  | Impairment**                                                  | Impairment                                                                                 |\n\nDue to the current minor excess value of MacGregor's recoverable amount compared to the book value of assets, the amount to be written off would be signi/ficant if the scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis realize; EUR 51 (31 Dec 2019: 29) million in the /first scenario, EUR 168 (31 Dec 2019: 133) million in the second, and EUR 282 (31 Dec 2019: 274) million in the third./uni00A0\n\nMacGregor's goodwill has been tested for impairment in 2020 on a quarterly basis. In the /first quarter of the year the value of the recoverable amount exceeding the carrying value of assets was at its lowest at EUR 7 million after which it increased to EUR 127 million by the end of the year. The value is very sensitive to changes in WACC as well as forecasts, so the risk for impairment is still signi/ficant although it has decreased.",

However, development costs are capitalised when certain criteria related to economic and technical feasibility are met, and it is expected that the product will generate future economic bene/fits. Capitalised development costs include mainly materials, supplies and direct labour costs. The development costs that are once expensed are not subsequently capitalised.

Gains and losses on sales of property, plant and equipment are included in the operating pro/fit.\n\n|                                                | Owned assets       | Owned assets             | Owned assets                | Owned assets   | Right-of-use assets   | Right-of-use assets      |        |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| 2020  MEUR                                     | Land and buildings | Machinery and  equipment | Equipment leased to  others | Others*        | Land and buildings    | Machinery and  equipment | Total  |\n| Acquisition cost 1 Jan                         | 217.6              | 331.3                    | 191.5                       | 4.3            | 170.1                 | 51.7                     | 966.5  |\n| Translation differences                        | -8.8               | -8.9                     | -1.9                        | -0.2           | -4.4                  | -1.9                     | -26.1  |\n| Additions                                      | 4.2                | 9.1                      | 26.4                        | 5.0            | 26.7                  | 12.3                     | 83.7   |\n| Disposals                                      | -7.4               | -51.8                    | -41.0                       | -0.1           | -8.8                  | -5.0                     | -114.1 |\n| Reclassifications                              | 3.3                | 3.5                      | 8.7                         | -6.2           | 0.3                   | -1.6                     | 8.0    |\n| Companies acquired and sold                    | -0.1               | 0.3                      | -                           | -              | 0.5                   | -0.4                     | 0.2    |\n| Assets held for sale**                         | -1.0               | -8.4                     | -                           | -              | -8.2                  | -                        | -17.6  |\n| Acquisition cost 31 Dec                        | 207.8              | 275.2                    | 183.6                       | 2.9            | 176.1                 | 55.0                     | 900.6  |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment 1 Jan  | -94.5              | -261.5                   | -68.0                       | 0.0            | -32.0                 | -20.8                    | -476.7 |\n| Translation differences                        | 3.2                | 6.5                      | 0.9                         | 0.0            | 1.2                   | 0.9                      | 12.7   |\n| Depreciation during the financial period       | -6.4               | -20.8                    | -22.9                       | -              | -28.3                 | -15.0                    | -93.5  |\n| Impairment charges                             | -7.0               | 0.0                      | -                           | -              | -4.5                  | -                        | -11.5  |\n| Disposals                                      | 2.9                | 50.8                     | 23.3                        | -              | 4.1                   | 3.5                      | 84.7   |\n| Reclassifications                              | 0.0                | -0.6                     | 2.6                         | -              | -0.3                  | 1.6                      | 3.3    |\n| Companies acquired and sold                    | 0.1                | -                        | -                           | -              | -                     | -                        | 0.1    |\n| Assets held for sale**                         | 0.7                | 6.6                      | -                           | -              | 2.6                   | -                        | 10.0   |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment 31 Dec | -100.9             | -219.1                   | -64.0                       | 0.0            | -57.1                 | -29.8                    | -470.9 |\n| Book value 31 Dec                              | 106.9              | 56.1                     | 119.6                       | 2.9            | 119.0                 | 25.2                     | 429.7  |\n\n- * Includes EUR 2.7 million of assets under construction and EUR 0.2 million of advance payments.\n- ** Additional information on assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale is disclosed in note 7.4 Assets held for sale.",

Should any indication arise, the asset is tested for impairment. Impairment testing determines the recoverable amount of an asset. The recoverable amount of items of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill is the fair value less costs to sell, or, if higher than that, the cash /flow-based value in use. If the recoverable amount of a single asset cannot be reliably determined, the need for impairment is assessed on the lowest level of the cash generating unit (CGU) that is mainly independent of the other units, and whose cash /flows are separately identi/fiable from the cash /flows of the other units.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the statement of income when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a signi/ficant change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The impairment loss can only be reversed to the extent that the carrying value of an asset is returned to a level where it would have been without the recognised impairment loss. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment every time there is any indication of impairment. In assessing impairment, both external and internal sources of information are considered. External sources include a signi/ficant decline in market value that is not the result of the passage of time, normal use of the assets or increase in interest rate. Internal sources of information include evidence of obsolescence of, or physical damage to, an asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the amount that is recoverable from its use or sale, an impairment loss is recognized immediately so that the carrying amount corresponds to the recoverable amount.\n\n## Depreciation, amortisation and impairment by function\n\n| MEUR                     |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2020 |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2019 |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Cost of goods sold       |                 62.5 |                 64.4 |\n| Sales and marketing      |                 19.4 |                 17.7 |\n| Research and development |                 14   |                 10.5 |\n| Administration           |                 30.2 |                 32.9 |\n| Restructuring            |                 17.9 |                  8.1 |\n| Other                    |                  0   |                  0.2 |\n| Total                    |                144   |                133.8 |\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment charges by asset type are disclosed in notes 6.1, Goodwill, 6.2, Other intangible assets, and 6.3, Property, plant and equipment.",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Consolidation principles\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interest issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. If contingent consideration is classi/fied as a /financial liability, it is measured at fair value on each reporting date, and the changes in the fair value are recognised in the statement of income. Contingent consideration classi/fied as equity is not revalued.\n\nIdenti/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their acquisition date fair values. The share of non-controlling interest in the acquiree is recognised on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets. The difference, if any, between the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets obtained is recognised as goodwill. Subsidiaries acquired during the /financial period are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date the control is obtained, and divested subsidiaries until the date the control is lost. When control is lost, all assets and liabilities related to the disposed subsidiary are derecognised. Additionally, if relevant, the hedging result recognised in other comprehensive income by the disposed subsidiary and the translation differences related to the disposed subsidiary are reclassi/fied to statement of income.\n\nIf a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is revalued at fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from remeasurement are recognised in the statement of income. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are treated as equity transactions. In acquiring noncontrolling interests' shares in subsidiaries, the difference between any consideration paid and the share of net assets acquired in the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains and losses realised on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. Distribution of net income for the period to the equity holders of the parent company and to non-controlling interests is presented in the statement of income. Equity attributable to non-controlling interest is disclosed as a separate item on the balance sheet.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nAll intercompany transactions, receivables, liabilities, unrealised pro/fits and distribution of pro/fits within Cargotec are eliminated in the consolidated /financial statements. The accounting principles of the subsidiaries have been changed, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the principles adopted by Cargotec Corporation.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures in which Cargotec exercises joint control and has a right to net assets purely based on the ownership interest held, and associated companies over which Cargotec exercises signi/ficant in/fluence, but has no control, are accounted for in the consolidated /financial statements under the equity method. Investments in joint ventures and associated companies are initially recognised on the balance sheet at the acquisition cost, which includes goodwill and intangible assets identi/fied on acquisition as well as the costs for acquiring or establishing the joint venture or associated company. Subsequently, the value of investment is adjusted in accordance with changes in the net assets of the investee in proportion to Cargotec's ownership, and in accordance with the amortizations of the intangible assets identi/fied in the acquisition. Investment in a joint venture, or an associated company is derecognised when Cargotec no longer has a joint control, or signi/ficant in/fluence over the investee.\n\nCargotec's share of the joint venture's or associated company's pro/fit for the /financial period is presented as a separate item before the operating result in the consolidated statement of income. The results of joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for with equity method based on their most recent /financial statements. The carrying amount of investments in joint ventures and associated companies is reviewed on a regular basis and if any impairment in value has occurred, it is written down in the period in which these circumstances are identi/fied. If Cargotec's share of the joint venture's or associated company's losses exceeds its interest in the company, the carrying amount is written down to zero. After this, losses are reported only if Cargotec is committed to ful/filling the obligations of the joint venture or associated company.\n\nBusiness transactions between the group and the joint ventures or associated companies are recognised in the group's /financial statements only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest in the joint venture or associated company. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred assets. The accounting principles of the joint ventures and associated companies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the principles adopted by Cargotec Corporation.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Open foreign currency-denominated monetary receivables",

Foreign exchange gains and losses related to normal business operations are treated as adjustments to sales or costs. Exchange rate differences on other hedges relating to business operations are recorded in other operating income and expenses.\n\nExchange rate gains and losses related to foreign currency hedges designated as hedges of sales and purchases under hedge accounting are /first recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, and /finally in the statement of income as adjustments to sales and purchases simultaneously with the related transactions. Exchange rate differences on other hedges relating to business operations are recorded in other operating income and expenses. Foreign exchange gains and losses associated with /financing are included in /financial income and expenses.\n\n## Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe stand-alone /financial statements of subsidiaries are reported using the currency that best re/flects the operational environment of that subsidiary ('the functional currency'). In the consolidated /financial statements, the statement of income and the cash /flows of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the euro are translated into euros using the average exchange rate of the /financial period, and the assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are translated into euros at the balance sheet date exchange rate. Translation differences caused by different exchange rates are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the cumulative translation differences in equity. Intercompany loan agreements may form a part of net investment if their settlement is neither planned nor probable in the foreseeable future, and thus the exchange rate gains and losses of these contracts are also recognised as translation differences in equity. When applying hedge accounting for a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, exchange rate differences on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of income.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Translation differences arising are recognised in equity.\n\nTranslation differences from acquisition cost eliminations and post-acquisition pro/fits and losses of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures outside the euro\n\narea are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. When a foreign entity or part of it is disposed, accumulated translation differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassi/fied to the statement of income as a part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classi/fied as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction instead of normal use and a sale is considered highly probable. Non-current assets held for sale are measured immediately before reclassi/fication in accordance with the normal measurement principles after which they are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses or gains are recognised in the statement of income. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Business combination\n\nNet assets acquired through business combinations are measured at fair value. The consideration exceeding the value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill according to the accounting principles. The measurement of fair value of the acquired net assets is based on market value of similar assets (property, plant and equipment), or an estimate of expected cash /flows and returns (intangible assets). The valuation, which is based on prevailing repurchase value, expected cash /flows or estimated sales price, requires management judgement and assumptions. The management trusts that the applied estimates and assumptions are suf/ficiently reliable for determining fair values. More information on the measurement of fair value of the assets acquired through business combinations is presented in note 7.1, Acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Assessment of control, joint control and significant influence\n\nCargotec applies judgement in determining an appropriate method to account for its ownership in the investees. The investees consolidated as subsidiaries with less than 50 percent of the voting rights are listed in note 7.3, Subsidiaries. In these investments, it has been assessed that Cargotec has de facto control based on shareholder agreements. Note 7.2, Joint ventures and associated companies, presents Cargotec's investments that are accounted for as joint ventures and as associated companies. Cargotec's investments in joint arrangements are classi/fied as joint ventures based on shared control, rights to net assets of the arrangement, and other relevant",

Cargotec's investments in associated companies include investments, in which Cargotec's voting rights are normally less than 20 percent. Accounting for the investment as an associated company is based on Cargotec's signi/ficant in/fluence in the investee. In addition to the voting rights, the determination of the in/fluence is affected by, for example, the ownership structure of the investee and Cargotec's representation in the board of directors, as well as Cargotec's signi/ficance as a customer.\n\n## 7\ufffd1 Acquisitions and disposals\n\n## Acquisitions in 2020\n\nOn 26th of May Cargotec sold its 49% joint venture ownership in the Rainbow-Cargotec Industries Co., Ltd (RCI) to the joint venture counterparty Rainbow Heavy Industries Co.,Ltd (RHI). Simultaneously, certain operations and assets were acquired from the disposed joint venture, and approximately 160 RCI employees transferred from RCI to Kalmar. Via restructuring, Cargotec aims to simplify its operations related to global supply chains. Acquired operations and assets together with the transferring/uni00A0employees meet the de/finition of business and are accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition price paid on closing was EUR 3.9 million and an additional EUR 0.7 million will fall due within the next two years. The /final balance sheet value of the acquired assets and deferred tax asset is EUR 1.5 million and the difference is recorded as goodwill, which is not tax deductible.

Cargotec has consolidated the net result of these companies from 1 August 2019.\n\nOn 26th of May 2020 Cargotec sold its 49 % joint venture ownership in the Rainbow-Cargotec Industries Co., Ltd (RCI) to the joint venture counterparty Rainbow Heavy Industries Co.,Ltd (RHI). Cargotec recognized a loss of EUR 35.6 million as a restructuring cost on disposal of the joint venture by derecognizing the joint venture ownership and recognizing a non-interestbearing receivable of EUR 6.5 million as a consideration that is due after two years from the closing date. The gross value of the receivable is EUR 11.9 million and its carrying value on balance sheet includes an adjustment for both interest and expected credit loss. Certain functions and assets were acquired from the company sold in connection with the transaction, and approximately 160 RCI employees were transferred to Kalmar. Additional information about the acquired assets is presented in note 7.1 Acquisitions and disposals.\n\nIn connection with the RCI restructuring, Cargotec also reassessed the classi/fication of its ownership in Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (RHI) and concluded that the preconditions for the associated company classi/fication were no longer met. As a result, the RHI ownership was reclassi/fied as a share investment accounted for as a /financial asset. On reclassi/fication, the associated company ownership on the balance sheet was derecognised and the new /financial asset was recognised at fair value resulting in a pro/fit of EUR 6.7 million which was booked in the income statement as other operating income affecting comparability. Due to the value of the RHI ownership and market volatility of the RHI share, Cargotec has elected to apply the possibility to recognise the subsequent fair value changes related to RHI ownership directly in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn April 2020, Hiab performed an impairment assessment for its holding in the Sinotruk Hiab (Shandong) Equipment Co., Ltd. joint venture. Due to the company's business outlook and /financial situation, the joint venture ownership was fully written down, resulting in a loss of EUR 4.0 million. Cargotec has issued guarantees on behalf of Sinotruk in the amount of EUR 3.7 (December 31, 2019: 3.8) million, of which EUR 2.5 million has been recognized as a liability at the time of reporting. Hiab is evaluating options for discontinuing the joint venture.\n\nMacGregor owns a joint venture CSSC Nanjing Luzhou MacGregor Machinery Co., Ltd. together with Nanjing Luzhou Machine Co., Ltd. (LMC), owned by China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). LMC owns 51 percent and MacGregor 49 percent of the joint venture specialised in marine air compressor technology.\n\nAs part of the acquistion of TTS on 31 July 2019 (additional information in note 7.1 Acquisitions and disposals), Cargotec obtained 50 percent ownership in entities: TTS Hua Hai Ships Equipment (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., TTS Bohai Machinery (Dalian) Co., Ltd., and TTS SCM Marine and Offshore Machinery Co., Ltd. The companies manufacture hatch covers, winches and cranes for merchant and offshore use - mainly for the Chinese market. Cargotec consolidates the ownerships as joint ventures based on the joint control and right to proportionate share of net assets in these companies in accordance with the ownership. As a precondition for the TTS acquisition, Chinese competition authorities set temporary remedies between Cargotec and the acquired joint ventures that relate to cooperation and",

The remedies have an impact on the economic bene/fit obtained from the companies but not on the use of joint control in them. Acquired joint ventures have been measured at fair value at the time of acquisition and based on the valuation of EUR 21.7 million, customer relationships of EUR 5.4 million and goodwill of EUR 5.1 million were subsumed in the fair value.\n\nCargotec owns together with JCE Invest AB the company Bruks Siwertell Group to which Cargotec sold the share capital of Siwertell AB that belonged to Kalmar segment, and JCE Invest transferred its subsidiary Bruks Holding AB. Both companies are specialised in bulk cargo handling equipment. Cargotec obtained 48 percent ownership in Bruks Siwertell Group that is classi/fied as an associated company based on Cargotec's signi/ficant in/fluence in the company. In addition, Cargotec recognised as part of the transaction, an interest-bearing loan receivable of EUR 33 million with a maximum term of ten years that the associated company repays annually based on its result. Additional information about this loan is given in the note 8.2 Financial instruments by measurement category.\n\nInvestments in the entity Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (until April 2020), Rainbow-Cargotec Industries Co., Ltd (until April 2020), and Bruks Siwertell Group AB are classi/fied as material investments due to their size.",

Navis software solutions for terminal operators, carriers, and ship owners are used to optimize global container /flows, and the main product of Navis, the N4 terminal operating system is used by 340 customers in more than 80 countries. The strategic evaluation process was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, but resumed in October. On 3 December the company announced that, based on the number of preliminary indicative bids and price levels received as part of the evaluation process, Navis sales were considered a better option than the other solutions presented. Cargotec's Board of Directors thus decided to start the actual sales process of the Navis software business. The preliminary indicative offers received are not binding and the possible sale of the Navis business as well as the terms of the transaction will only become clear once the sale procedure is completed. Cargotec's goal is to complete the sales process in the /first half of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial review\n\nAs a result, Cargotec has classi/fied Navis as a disposal group held for sale, according to which the balance sheet items related to Navis are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a disposal group on a separate line but in the statement of income, Navis is not separated. The table below provides additional information on the assets held for sale and related liabilities. The reclassi/fication had no effect on the reported values of balance sheet items.\n\n## Assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale\n\n| MEUR                                                       | Note          | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| ASSETS                                                     |               |               |               |\n| Non-current assets                                         |               |               |               |\n| Goodwill**                                                 | 6.1           | 73.6          | -             |\n| Other intangible assets                                    | 6.2           | 65.2          | -             |\n| Property, plant and equipment                              | 6.3           | 7.6           | -             |\n| Loans receivable and other interest-bearing assets*        | 8.2           | 0.4           | -             |\n| Deferred tax assets                                        | 4.2           | 2.1           | -             |\n| Other non-interest-bearing assets                          | 5.3, 8.2      | 0.7           | -             |\n| Total non-current assets                                   |               | 149.7         | 0.0           |\n| Current assets                                             |               |               |               |\n| Loans receivable and other interest-bearing assets*        | 8.2           | 0.2           | -             |\n| Income tax receivables                                     |               | 0.7           | -             |\n| Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing  assets | 2.2, 5.3, 8.2 | 34.7          | -             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents*                                 | 8.2, 8.3      | 0.4           | -             |\n| Total current assets                                       |               | 36.0          | 0.0           |\n| Assets held for sale                                       |               | 185.7         | 0.0           |\n\n- * Included in interest-bearing net debt.\n- ** The amount of goodwill allocated as held for sale is based on an estimate on reporting date.",

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classi/fied in accordance with the applied measurement principle as /financial assets at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through pro/fit or loss. Financial assets are classi/fied at the initial recognition in accordance with the features and planned use of the asset. Financial assets are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost if there is no intention to sell the asset and the expected contractual cash /flow from it is based on interest and repayment of the principal amount. The loans and receivables measured at amortised cost mostly consist of accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents. Loan receivables are measured initially at fair value plus transaction costs and less expected credit losses, and subsequently at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Changes in the amount of expected credit loss are re/flected in the expected cash /flows included in amortised cost.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if the asset can be sold before it matures and the contractual cash /flow from it is based on interest and repayment of principal. The /financial assets included in the class are measured initially at fair value plus transaction costs and less expected credit losses, and subsequently at fair value less expected credit losses. Equity instruments can be irrevocably classi/fied into this category on initial recognition after which all subsequent fair value changes are recognised in other comprehensive income except dividends that are recognised in the income statement.  In addition, the effective portion of fair value changes related to derivatives under hedge accounting is measured in accordance with this category throughout the hedge relationship.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are those /financial assets that do not belong to the previous classes, including equity investments, derivative instruments to which no hedge accounting is applied, and /financial assets held for trading, or from which the expected contractual cash /flows on initial recognition are not solely based on interest and repayment of principal.

Bank overdrafts are included in other current liabilities. In the statement of cash /flows, bank overdrafts are deducted from cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/fied as /financial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss and as /financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year.\n\nFinancial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss include derivative instruments unless hedge accounting is applied. The transaction costs and subsequent fair value changes of /financial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss are recognised directly in the statement of income. Fair value changes related to derivatives under hedge accounting are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and, subsequently, recycled to the statement of income when hedge accounting is ceased.\n\nFinancial liabilities recognised at amortised cost include mainly interest-bearing liabilities and accounts payable. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently, at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nBought and sold derivative instruments are recognised on the trade date while transactions with the other /financial liabilities are recognised on the settlement date.\n\nA /financial liability is derecognised when the related obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing /financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are\n\nsubstantially modi/fied, such an exchange or modi/fication is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of income.\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nCargotec uses mainly currency forwards, and cross-currency and interest rate swaps to hedge from the identi/fied signi/ficant market risks. Derivative instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which equals the fair value, and are subsequently measured at fair value on each balance sheet date. Derivatives are classi/fied at the inception either as hedges of binding agreements and future cash /flows, in which case cash /flow hedge accounting is applied to them, or as derivatives at fair value through pro/fit or loss, when the preconditions for hedge accounting are not fully met.\n\nFair values of foreign currency forward contracts are based on quoted market rates on the balance sheet date. The fair values of cross-currency and interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash /flows. Derivative instruments are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year.\n\nCash /flow hedge accounting is mainly applied to hedges of operative cash /flows. In addition, hedge accounting is applied to hedges of certain foreign currency denominated borrowings. To qualify for hedge accounting, the company documents the hedge relationship of the derivative instruments and the underlying items, group's risk management targets and the strategy of applying hedge accounting. When starting hedge accounting and at least in every interim and annual closing, the company documents and estimates the effectiveness of the hedge by measuring the ability of the hedging instrument to offset changes in fair value of the underlying cash /flow. Because the critical terms of the hedging instrument are set to match with the hedged item as closely as possible, there is typically no inef/ficiency.\n\nFair value changes of hedging instruments under effective cash /flow hedge relationship are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the fair value reserve of equity, and under effective net investment hedges through the statement of comprehensive income in the translation differences of equity.

Cumulative gain or loss on the hedge recognized through the statement of comprehensive income in fair value reserve or translation differences is recognised in the statement of income simultaneously with the hedged item. The effective portion of foreign currency forwards hedging sales and purchases is recognised in sales and cost of goods sold, respectively. If the hedged cash /flow is no longer expected to materialise, the deferred gain or loss is immediately recognised in the statement of income. If the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is revoked or exercised, or the relation of the hedging instrument and the underlying item is revoked, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument remains to be recognised in the fair value reserve and is recycled to the statement of income when the underlying operative item materialises. If effectiveness testing results in ineffectiveness, the ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised immediately in the statement of income.\n\nChanges in the fair values of hedges, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are recognised in the statement of income, either in other operating income and expenses, or /financial income and expenses depending on the underlying exposure.\n\n## Profit distribution\n\nPro/fit distribution includes dividends and donations decided by the Shareholders' Meeting. The distribution of pro/fits proposed by the Board of Directors is not recognised in the /financial statements until approved by Cargotec Corporation's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nWhen the parent company or its subsidiaries purchase shares of Cargotec Corporation, the consideration paid and directly attributable costs are recognised as a deduction in equity. When such shares are sold, the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs and income tax effect, is included in equity.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe fair values of /financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation techniques. The fair value of the over-the-counter derivatives used for hedging is determined by using commonly applied valuation techniques, and by maximising the use of available market prices. In applying these techniques, judgement is used to select the applied method, and where appropriate, to make assumptions that are mainly based on existing market conditions at the reporting date.\n\nCargotec recognises impairments on customer receivables at the end of the reporting period based on the expected credit losses. Expected credit loss is estimated based on systematic and continuous follow-up as part of the credit risk control that is based on both historical and forward-looking credit loss assessment. Additional information regarding the impairment of accounts receivable is disclosed in note 5.3, Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing receivables.\n\n## 8\ufffd1 Financial risk management\n\n## Organisation of finance function and financial risk management\n\nCargotec's /finance function and /financial risk management are conducted according to the Treasury Policy, approved by the Board of Directors. Organisation, responsibilities and principles of /financial risk management, monitoring and reporting are de/fined in the Treasury Policy. Treasury Committee, appointed by the Board, is responsible for Treasury Policy compliance and for organising and monitoring the treasury function. Detailed guidelines for /financing functions in accordance with Treasury Policy are de/fined in Treasury Instructions, approved by the Treasury Committee.\n\nThe objectives of the treasury function are to secure suf/ficient funding for business operations, avoiding /financial constraint at all times, to provide business units with /financial services, to minimise the costs of /financing, to manage /financial risks (currency, interest rate, liquidity and funding, credit, counterparty and operational risks) and to regularly provide management with information on the /financial position and risk exposures of Cargotec and its business units.\n\nCargotec Treasury is responsible for funding at corporate level, for managing liquidity and /financial risks, for providing ef/ficient set up of /financing operations and for monitoring business unit /financial positions.

A signi/ficant proportion of Cargotec sales and costs are generated in foreign currencies, mostly in US dollars and Swedish krona.\n\nThe objective of the currency risk management is to hedge operations against exchange rate /fluctuations, thus allowing time for the business units to react and adapt to changes in exchange rates. Foreign currency positions, which include contractual cash /flows, related to sales, purchases and /financing, are fully hedged. Other highly probable cash /flows may be hedged, if deemed necessary by Cargotec Treasury and the business unit. The business units report their risk exposures to Cargotec Treasury and hedge the positions via intercompany forward contracts. In countries where hedging is restricted, foreign currency denominated loans and deposits may be used as hedging instruments.\n\nCash /flow hedge accounting is generally applied to qualifying foreign currency hedges. Under the Cargotec hedge accounting model, the portion of the fair value change related to a change in the spot rate is recognised in the fair value reserve within equity until the cumulative pro/fit or loss is recycled to the statement of income simultaneously with the hedged item. The portion of the fair value change related to interest rate is excluded from hedge accounting and recognised directly in pro/fit or loss. Hedge accounting is started when a qualifying risk exposure is identi/fied and Cargotec enters into a hedge, and terminated when the hedged item impacts pro/fit or loss. Hedge accounting is not applied in cases where its impact on the consolidated statement of income is deemed insigni/ficant by Cargotec Treasury.\n\nCargotec is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from both on- and off-balance sheet items. The net balance sheet exposure in the table below represents the foreign currency risk arising from the on-balance sheet /financial items, and the net exposure illustrates the total outstanding foreign currency risk as de/fined and monitored by Cargotec Treasury.\n\n| 31 Dec 2020 MEUR          |   EUR |    USD |   SEK |   PLN |   NOK |   CNY |   Others |\n|---------------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|\n| Balance sheet items       | -31.2 |   32.6 |  -9.4 |  22   | -14.5 |  -7.1 |      0.1 |\n| Hedges                    | 103.9 | -290.6 |  76   |  25.9 |  47.7 |  66.9 |     -0.4 |\n| Balance sheet  exposure   |  72.6 | -258.1 |  66.6 |  47.9 |  33.2 |  59.8 |     -0.3 |\n| Order book and  purchases | -91.1 |  304.2 | -64.5 | -64.6 | -43   | -62.6 |      0   |\n| Net exposure              | -18.5 |   46.2 |   2   | -16.7 |  -9.7 |  -2.8 |     -0.3 |\n\n| 31 Dec 2019  MEUR         |   EUR |    USD |    SEK |   PLN |   NOK |   CNY |   Others |\n|---------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|----------|\n| Balance sheet items       | -50.6 |   46.7 |  -13   |  22   |  -9.9 |  -3.1 |      7.5 |\n| Hedges                    | 110.7 | -366.2 |  122.8 |  12.9 |  53.2 |  68.4 |     -0.2 |\n| Balance sheet  exposure   |  60.1 | -319.5 |  109.8 |  35   |  43.3 |  65.2 |      7.3 |\n| Order book and  purchases | -46.5 |  352   | -122.1 | -63.4 | -40.2 | -63.9 |    -17.1 |\n| Net exposure              |  13.6 |   32.5 |  -12.3 | -28.4 |   3.2 |   1.3 |     -9.8 |\n\nThe foreign currency exposures in the table above include the most important operational currencies of Cargotec's business units. In this table, amounts are presented on a gross basis including foreign currency amounts and counter values in local currencies.\n\nCargotec's subsidiaries constantly monitor their foreign currency exposures and report them on a monthly basis to Cargotec Treasury which is responsible for monitoring the overall exposure and arranging hedges for identi/fied exposures. Cargotec Treasury also monitors the translation risk arising from different currencies and, where deemed signi/ficant, translation risk positions are hedged and net investment hedge accounting is applied.\n\nForeign exchange rate /fluctuations have an effect on the consolidated income and equity. The effect in the statement of income arises from foreign currency denominated /financial assets and liabilities in the subsidiaries' balance sheets, including derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied. The effect in equity arises from derivatives under hedge accounting from which the fair value /fluctuations related to changes in exchange rates are recognised in the fair value reserve of the other comprehensive income. Foreign exchange rate impact in the fair value reserve is expected to be offset by the corresponding opposite impact in the value of the hedged item when recognised in the statement of income. The majority of the hedges mature and the hedged cash /flows realise within the next year. Cargotec has recognized the following currency pairs to be the most signi/ficant and estimated their impact on income before taxes and on other comprehensive income through sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis assumes that cash is held at subsidiaries functional currency.\n\n|                                      |   Income before taxes |   Income before taxes |   Other comprehensive  income |   Other comprehensive  income |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| MEUR                                 |                2020   |                2019   |                        2020   |                        2019   |\n| USD appreciates 10% against the euro |                  -1.7 |                   2.6 |                         -16.4 |                         -23.5 |\n| SEK appreciates 10% against the euro |                   4.6 |                   0.6 |                           0.2 |                           7.5 |\n| USD depreciates 10% against the euro |                   1.7 |                  -2.6 |                          16.4 |                          23.5 |\n| SEK depreciates 10% against the euro |                  -4.6 |                  -0.6 |                          -0.2 |                          -7.5 |",

Translation risk is mitigated by managing the capital structure so that the effect of foreign exchange rate /fluctuations on debt and equity are in balance. Cargotec Treasury regularly monitors the translation exposure and evaluates the materiality of the risk position. The impact of the translation risk from currencies to Cargotec's gearing is evaluated to be not signi/ficant and hedging the translation risk has not been considered necessary.\n\n| 31 Dec 2020  MEUR    | USD     | PLN   | NOK   | SGD   | SEK   |\n|----------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Translation exposure | 295.6   | 189.8 | 288.4 | 87.0  | 42.5  |\n| Translation risk     | 295.6   | 189.8 | 288.4 | 87.0  | 42.5  |\n| 31 Dec 2019  MEUR    | USD     | PLN   | NOK   | SGD   | SEK   |\n| Translation exposure | 330.6*  | 186.0 | 227.4 | 87.1  | 90.1  |\n| Translation risk     | 330.6 * | 186.0 | 227.4 | 87.1  | 90.1  |\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nFluctuations in market interest rates have an effect on consolidated interest out/flows and the fair values of interest-bearing loans, receivables and derivative instruments. The objective of interest rate risk management is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the statement of income, balance sheet and cash /flow. To manage interest rate risk, the duration of the /financial portfolio is maintained within the limits set by the Treasury Committee, by balancing between /fixed and /floating rate debt and by using derivative instruments.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, Cargotec's consolidated interest-bearing debt totalled EUR 1,190.7 (31 Dec 2019: 1,224.3) million, of which EUR 497.9 (647.3) million were /fixed rate corporate bonds, and EUR 173.9 (187.8) million were /finance lease liabilities. The rest, EUR 519.0 (389.1) million, consisted of /fixed and /floating rate loans, short term loans, bank overdrafts and other interest-bearing liabilities. On 31 December 2020, the average interest duration of interestbearing debt, was 25 (27) months. Interest-bearing liability /figures presented above include EUR 7.7 million of lease liabilities, which are classi/fied as associated liabilities for assets held for sale.\n\nThe EUR 508,5 (31 Dec 2019: 450.7) million investment portfolio consisted mainly of shortterm deposits and bank account balances. Interest-bearing loan receivables totalled EUR 21.1 (29.0) million and customer /finance related /finance lease receivables EUR 2.2 (1.5) million. The average interest duration of the interest bearing assets was less than than one month (less than one month). Investment portfolio /figures presented above include EUR 0.4 million cash and EUR 0.6 million /finance lease receivables, which are classi/fied as assets held for sale.\n\nBased on the sensitivity analysis, a one percentage point increase/decrease in the interest rates would have decreased/ increased net interest cost by EUR 0.7 (31 Dec 2019: decreased/ increased by 0.6) million. The sensitivity in the statement of income is affected by variable rate loans, short term loans, loans receivable, deposits, bank accounts and bank overdrafts. The sensitivity is calculated as an annual effect assuming that the group's balance sheet structure remains unchanged.\n\nWith respect to all currency forward contracts, the fair value changes related to /fluctuations in interest rates are recognised directly in /financial income and expenses, and, hence, the changes in short-term market rates may affect /financial result also via currency hedging contracts. If the interest rate difference between the euro and the US dollar had widened/ narrowed one percentage point, /financial net cost would have increased/decreased by EUR 2.4 (31 Dec 2019: increased/decreased by EUR 3.5) million. Effects from other currency pairs are deemed insigni/ficant assuming that the current currency position remains the same and there is a similar change in all currency pairs.\n\n## Interest fixing periods\n\n| 31 Dec 2020  MEUR                                                                | 0-6  mths   | 6-12  mths   | 12-24  mths   | 24-36  mths   | Later   |   Total |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------|---------|\n| Loans receivable and  other interest-bearing  assets*                            | 507.5       | -            | -             | -             | -       |   507.5 |\n| Non-current loans  from financial  institutions                                  | -337.0      | -            | -             | -37.4         | -24.9   |  -399.4 |\n| Corporate bonds                                                                  | -           | -            | -149.8        | -             | -348.1  |  -497.9 |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                | -18.0       | -18.0        | -27.8         | -20.6         | -81.7   |  -166.2 |\n| Current interest- bearing liabilities and  other interest-bearing  liabilities** | -119.5      | -            | -             | -             | -       |  -119.5 |\n| Net in balance sheet                                                             | 32.9        | -18.0        | -177.6        | -58.0         | -454.7  |  -675.5 |\n| Assets held for sale  and associated  liabilities held for  sale***              | -0.1        | -1.1         | -2.3          | -1.7          | -1.5    |    -6.7 |\n| Net                                                                              | 32.8        | -19.1        | -179.9        | -59.7         | -456.2  |  -682.2 |",

The business units are responsible for identifying these risks and determining the required hedging measures. These risks are managed by thorough supplier selection process and long-term relationship with strategic suppliers.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risks\n\nThe objective of liquidity management is to maintain an optimal amount of liquidity to fund the business operations of Cargotec at all times while minimising interest and bank costs and avoiding /financial distress (liquidity risk).\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by retaining long-term liquidity reserves exceeding the level of shortterm liquidity requirement. On 31 December 2020, the liquidity reserves, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term undrawn credit facilities, totalled EUR 785.2 (31 Dec 2019: 720.2) million. Short-term liquidity requirement covers the repayments of short- and long-term debt within the next 12 months, as well as the strategic liquidity requirement, as determined by the Treasury Committee, which covers the operative funding demand within the following 12 months. On 31 December 2020, repayments of short- and long-term interest-bearing liabilities due within the following 12 months totalled EUR 157.8 (271.0) million, of which EUR 38.3 (40.1) million are leasing liabilities. Above /figures include EUR 2.2 million Interest-bearing liabilities and EUR 0.4 million cash and cash equivalents, which are classi/fied as assets held for sale or associated liabilities for assets held for sale.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, Cargotec held undrawn EUR 300.0 (31 Dec 2019: 300.0) million long-term revolving credit facility, which will mature in June 2024. According to the facility agreement, Cargo-\n\ntec has a right to withdraw funds on three business days' notice on agreed terms. Additionally, to ful/fil short-term cash management requirements, Cargotec holds available short-term bank overdraft facilities of EUR 115.6 (137.3) million and a EUR 150.0 (150.0) million domestic Commercial Paper facility which on 31 December 2020 was unused (unused). Cargotec's total liquidity position includes EUR 80.9 (76.1) million of cash and cash equivalents in different currencies subject to currency-related or other regulatory restrictions, and, therefore, these balances may not be utilised outside these countries within a short period of time. Nevertheless, these restricted balances are typically available for immediate use locally in these countries and therefore these balances are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n| MEUR                                                             |   31 Dec 2020 | 31 Dec 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                        |         484.8 | 420.2         |\n| Committed long-term undrawn revolving credit facilities          |         300   | 300.0         |\n| Repayments of interest-bearing liabilities during next 12 months |        -155.6 | -271.0        |\n| Total liquidity in balance sheet                                 |         629.2 | 449.2         |\n| Assets held for sale and associated liabilities held for sale*   |          -1.8 | -             |\n| Total  liquidity                                                 |         627.4 | 449.2         |\n\n- * Additional information on assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale is disclosed in note 7.4 Assets held for sale.\n\nThe objective of funding risk management is to avoid an untenably large proportion of loans or credit facilities maturing at a time when refunding is not economically or contractually feasible. The risk is minimised by balancing the repayment schedules of loans and credit facilities, as well as retaining /flexible credit facility agreements. Cargotec's bilateral bank loan agreements and syndicated revolving credit facility include a covenant restricting the corporate capital structure. According to the covenant, the relation between net debt and equity (gearing) must be retained below 125 percent. In the loan agreements, which are made prior to 1.1.2019, gearing in the covenant restricting the capital structure is based on calculation methodology, which was applied prior to IFRS 16. According to management assessment, Cargotec is in good position regarding liquidity and there are no signi/ficant concentrations of risks relating to refunding.\n\nIn connection with the Cargotec and Konecranes announced merger, companies obtained necessary /financial commitments for the /financing of completion of the merger. On 31 December 2020, Cargotec held undrawn term loan facility with total amount of EUR 300 million. The EUR 300 million facility for Cargotec is available starting from the effective date of the merger until two business days thereof and has a maturity date falling two years from the earlier of 30 June 2022 or the effective date of the merger subject to the extension option of twelve months, provided that certain customary conditions precedent have been ful/filled.\n\nThe following tables represent the maturity analysis of the company's /financial liabilities and derivatives.

Because of the diverse and global clientele, Cargotec is not exposed to signi/ficant credit risk concentrations. Credit risk related to sales contracts is mitigated by using payment terms that are based on advance payments, bank guarantees or other guarantees, and by monitoring the creditworthiness of customers. Credit risks related to large contracts are shared with /financial institutions, insurance companies or export guarantee institutions, when feasible. More information on accounts receivable is presented in note 5.3, Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing receivables.\n\nThe Treasury Committee sets /financial counterparty limits based on their solvency and creditworthiness. Cargotec Treasury actively reviews counterparty risks and, if needed, may reject a counterparty with immediate effect. Only large /financial institutions with a high credit rating are accepted as counterparties. Deposits of liquidity reserves and trading in /financial instruments are only accepted with counterparties con/firmed by the Treasury Committee.\n\nCargotec's total credit risk exposure on 31 December 2020 including credit risk related to both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items amounted to EUR 1,291.5 (31 Dec 2019: 1,374.9) million. From the total exposure, EUR 9.0 (1.6) million relates to /financial assets measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. Credit risk exposure includes EUR 33.1 million, which is classi/fied as assets held for sale.\n\n| 2020                                                         |      | Credit risk High Total   | Credit risk High Total   | Credit risk High Total   | Credit risk High Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| MEUR                                                         | Note | Low                      | Increased                |                          |                          |\n| On-balance sheet credit risk from  customer contracts        |      |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Accounts receivable                                          | 5.3  | 499.1                    | 26.8                     | 9.1                      | 535.0                    |\n| Unbilled receivables                                         | 5.3  | 93.9                     | -                        | -                        | 93.9                     |\n| Total                                                        |      | 593.0                    | 26.8                     | 9.1                      | 628.9                    |\n| On-balance sheet credit risk from other  financial assets    |      |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Loans receivable and other interest- bearing assets          | 8.2  | 20.1                     | 2.6                      | -                        | 22.7                     |\n| Derivative assets (risk after ISDA  netting)                 | 8.5  | 2.2                      | -                        | -                        | 2.2                      |\n| Other non-interest-bearing receivables                       | 5.3  | 10.5                     | -                        | 6.9                      | 17.3                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                    | 8.3  | 484.8                    | -                        | -                        | 484.8                    |\n| Total                                                        |      | 517.5                    | 2.6                      | 6.9                      | 527.0                    |\n| Off-balance sheet credit risk from  contracts with customers |      |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Customer financing                                           | 9.2  | 18.1                     | -                        | -                        | 18.1                     |\n| Operating lease receivables                                  | 9.1  | 84.3                     | -                        | -                        | 84.3                     |\n| Total                                                        |      | 102.4                    | -                        | -                        | 102.4                    |\n| Total credit risk exposure in balance sheet                  |      | 1,213.0                  | 29.4                     | 16.0                     | 1,258.4                  |\n| Assets held for sale*                                        | 7.4  | 27.0                     | 5.3                      | 0.7                      | 33.1                     |\n| Total credit risk exposure                                   |      | 1,240.0                  | 34.8                     | 16.7                     | 1,291.5                  |",

Cargotec has derivative positions with several banks, and related transactions are effected under the ISDA agreement that allows for settling on a net basis all outstanding items within the scope of the agreement, such as in the event of bankruptcy. At the reporting date, the remaining counterparty risk after net settlement, as allowed by ISDA, was EUR 2.2 (31 Dec 2019: 1.6) million for Cargotec and EUR 8.2 (4.9) million for the counterparties.\n\nThe maximum credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents corresponds to their carrying amount. According to management assessment, no signi/ficant credit losses are anticipated on the investments of liquidity reserves. The off-balance sheet customer /finance and operating lease receivables are collateralised, and, therefore, the related credit risk is considered to be low.\n\n## Operational risks of the treasury function\n\nThe management of operational risks aims to eliminate losses or increased risk levels due to errors in procedures or insuf/ficient monitoring. The risks are minimised by maintaining a high level of pro/ficiency, identifying and documenting routine procedures and organising responsibilities.\n\nRisks relating to transactions are minimised by conducting regular general assessments and monitoring trading limits, market valuations and daily trade con/firmations.\n\n## Capital structure management\n\nThe goal of Cargotec's capital structure management is to secure operational preconditions at all times and to maintain the optimum capital cost structure. The target capital structure is determined by shareholders and it is regularly monitored by the Board of Directors.",

Gearing, calculated as the ratio of net debt to equity, is the key /figure monitored in capital structure management. Interestbearing net debt is calculated as net of interest-bearing liabilities and assets, including cash and cash equivalents. Cargotec's target is to retain gearing below 50 percent. The elements of gearing are presented in the table below.\n\n| MEUR                                                                        | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Interest-bearing liabilities                                                | 1,183.1       | 1224.3        |\n| Lease liabilities included in interest-bearing liabilities                  | 166.2         | 187.8         |\n| Loans receivable and other interest-bearing assets                          | -22.7         | -30.5         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                   | -484.8        | -420.2        |\n| Interest-bearing net debt in balance sheet                                  | 675.5         | 773.6         |\n| Interest-bearing net debt of assets and related liabilities held for  sale* | 6.7           | -

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through  other comprehensive income include forward exchange contracts subject to hedge accounting and an equity investment in Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy Industries Co., Ltd (RHI), which is separately classi/fied in this category. Fair value changes related to derivatives for which hedge accounting is applied are accumulated in other comprehensive income during hedge accounting and recycled to statement of income when hedge accounting related to sales transaction ceases, and to value of inventory when hedge accounting related to purchase transaction ceases. The recurring measurement of derivative instruments at fair value is based on commonly applied valuation methods and uses observable market-based variables based on which these measurements are categorised in the fair value hierarchy as level 2 fair values. RHI's share is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China, as a result of which the valuation presented is classi/fied as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of other instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are partly based on non-market based variables, and, therefore, these measurements are categorised in the fair value hierarchy as level 3 fair values. Other items are recognised on balance sheet at amortised cost and information about their fair values is presented under each respective note to the extent that the difference between the book value and fair value is signi/ficant.\n\nLoans receivable and other interest-bearing assets mainly consist of receivables from sales of businesses. The largest of these receivables is a EUR 19.6 million vendor loan related to the sale of Siwertell AB in 2018. The loan accrues annual 3.75% interest until the end of 2020, and 4.25% as a minimum afterwards. Loan repayments are tied to the annual result of Bruks Siwertell Group, and its maximum length is 10 years. The carrying value of the Loans receivable and other interest-bearing asset includes credit loss-related write-downs of EUR 0.7 (31 Dec 2019: 0.9) million.\n\n## 8\ufffd3 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n| MEUR                                                           | Note   |   31 Dec 2020 | 31 Dec 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|---------------|\n| Cash at bank and on hand                                       |        |         473.6 | 408.1         |\n| Short-term deposits                                            |        |          11.2 | 12.1          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet                 |        |         484.8 | 420.2         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents classified as assets held  for sale* | 7.4    |           0.4 | -             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents in total                             |        |         485.2 | 420.2         |\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows\n\n| MEUR                                                      |   31 Dec 2020 |   31 Dec 2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                 |         484.8 |         420.2 |\n| Bank overdrafts used                                      |          -2.5 |         -10.4 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of  cash flows |         482.3 |         409.8 |",

Share premium account includes the amount exceeding the accounting par value of shares received by the company in connection with share subscriptions if the stock options had been decided on under the old Limited Liability Companies Act (29 Sep 1978/734). Translation differences includes translation differences caused by translation of foreign subsidiaries' /financial statements into euro, exchange rate gains and losses from the intercompany loan agreements that form part of a net investment. Fair value reserve includes hedge accounted component of fair value changes of derivatives under hedge accounting. Reserve for invested non-restricted equity includes transactions with treasury shares and share subscriptions with stock options. Retained earnings include net income for the period and previous periods. Paid dividends and donations approved by the Annual General Meeting are deducted from retained earnings. Additionally, retained earnings include actuarial gains and losses from de/fined bene/fit plans, gains and losses on designated share investments measured at fair value, and the cost of equity-settled share-based payments.\n\n## Shares and share capital\n\nAccording to Cargotec's Articles of Association, the company's share capital is divided into class A and class B shares, both without nominal value. Cargotec Corporation's class B shares are quoted on Nasdaq Helsinki. Cargotec's share capital is fully paid up.\n\nIn the Shareholders' Meeting, each class A share carries one vote, as does each set of ten class B shares, with the provision that each shareholder is entitled to at least one vote. According to the Articles of Association, class B shares earn a higher dividend in dividend distribution than class A shares. The difference between dividends paid on the two classes of shares is a minimum of one (1) cent and a maximum of two and a half (2.5) cents.\n\n| Number of shares                         | Class A  shares   | Class B  shares   | Total      |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| Number of shares 1 Jan 2020              | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Number of shares 31 Dec 2020             | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Treasury shares 31 Dec 2020              | -                 | -224,840          | -224,840   |\n| Number of shares outstanding 31 Dec 2020 | 9,526,089         | 54,957,239        | 64,483,328 |\n| Number of shares 1 Jan 2019              | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Number of shares 31 Dec 2019             | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Treasury shares 31 Dec 2019              | -                 | -304,328          | -304,328   |\n| Number of shares outstanding 31 Dec 2019 | 9,526,089         | 54,877,751        | 64,403,840 |\n\n## Dividend distribution\n\nAfter 31 December 2020, the following dividends were proposed by the Board of Directors to be paid: EUR 1.07 per each class A share and EUR 1.08 per outstanding class B share, a total of EUR 69,546,733.35.",

OTHER NOTES\n\n## 9\ufffd1 Leases\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Leases, Cargotec as lessee\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nLease modi/fications are accounted for either as new lease contracts or as changes in the existing lease contracts depending on the type of the modi/fication. Modi/fications accounted for as changes in the existing leases, and changes in the estimates applied in lease accounting, such as those related to the use of an option to prolong a lease or to purchase a leased asset, trigger a remeasurement of the lease liability and the rightof-use asset at an updated discount rate. Contractual rent changes tied to indexes also trigger a remeasurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset but without a change in the applied discount rate.\n\nCargotec leases property, plant and equipment in most of the countries it operates in under contracts that meet the de/finition of a lease. Short-term lease agreements, with contractual and expected lease periods not exceeding 12 months, are accounted for as off-balance sheet leases if there is no purchase option. Also long-term lease agreements in which the underlying leased asset is of low value are accounted for as off-balance sheet leases. Expenses related to these leases are recognised in the statement of income as incurred over the lease period.\n\nLease agreements which do not qualify for the short-term or low-value exemption are recognised on the balance sheet as lease liabilities and right-of-use assets at the commencement of the lease period. Lease liabilities are initially measured at present value by determining the expected reasonably certain lease payments and discounting them with an incremental borrowing rate that is determined separately for the main lease types in each relevant currency. Rent components not directly related to the leased asset are excluded from the lease value on the balance sheet. If a lease has no maturity date, the lease liability is determined based on the enforceable lease period considering the termination rights of both contractual parties. Lease payments are allocated to repayments of lease liabilities and /finance charges so that a constant interest rate on the outstanding balance is obtained. Lease liability is included in the interest-bearing liabilities on the statement of /financial position, and is measured at amortised cost. Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted by lease advances paid or incentives received, initial direct costs, and estimated dismantling, removal and restoration costs at the end of the lease period, if relevant. Right-of-use assets are included in the property, plant and equipment on the statement of /financial position, and they are depreciated over the lease period on a straight-line basis unless the asset is expected to be fully consumed before the end of the lease term or purchased, in which case the depreciation period is determined based on the expected useful life of the asset. An off-balance sheet lease commitment becoming onerous leads to a recognition of a separate loss provision, whereas an onbalance sheet lease becoming onerous leads to an impairment of the related right-ofuse asset.\n\n## Leases, Cargotec as lessor\n\nCargotec rents out equipment under contracts that meet the de/finition of a lease, and are accounted for either as operating or /finance leases. In an operating lease the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset remain with the lessor. The leased asset is recognised on the balance sheet according to the nature of the asset. Income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation of the leased asset is determined by considering the normal depreciation policy of similar assets in own use and the planned use after the lease period.\n\nIn a /finance lease the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee. The sales pro/fit is recognised similarly to pro/fit from an outright sale. Finance lease receivables are recognised on the balance sheet at present value. The /financial income relating to the /finance lease contract is recognised in the statement of income over the lease term so as to achieve a constant interest rate on outstanding balance.",

If a lease contract includes an option to prolong or purchase the leased asset, the decision to include or exclude the option in the value of the capitalized lease liability and right-of-use asset is based on an estimate of the likelihood to exercise the option. In practice, the probability to exercise an option is estimated from the needs of the business as part of the real estate management process and taking into account the contractual conditions, leasehold improvements made or needed, and the local market situation. Additional information about the right-of-use assets related to leases is disclosed in notes 6.3, Property, plant and equipment.\n\nCargotec leases property and equipment in most of the countries where it operates. Leased properties include land and buildings mainly for use as of/fices, manufacturing facilities, workshops, and warehouses. The average length of Cargotec's property leases on reporting date is 9.3 (31 December 2019: 9.7) years and contracts typically include an option or options to prolong, or an option to early terminate the lease. Optional lease periods are re/flected in the capitalised value of the leases based on the real estate management process in which the remaining reasonably certain lease period is reassessed on a regular basis, and typically the capitalisation threshold is met, depending on the location and use of the property, from a few months to a couple of years before the end of the ongoing lease period. Leased equipment include mainly vehicles and machines with /fixed rents and lease terms. The average length of Cargotec's equipment leases on reporting date is 2.6 (31 December 2019: 3.1) years. Cargotec lease agreements typically do not include variable rent elements except for the rent escalation clauses tied to in/flation-related indexes. The weighted average discount rate applied to determine the present value of lease liability on reporting date is 4.2 (31 December 2019: 4.2) percent.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review",

When the level of retained risk is low and, therefore, not re/flected on the balance sheet, it is reported in full as a contingent liability under commitments. No signi/ficant liabilities are expected to arise from the commitments related to customer /financing.\n\n## Guarantees and contingent liabilities\n\nCargotec grants and receives guarantees as part of its normal business and /financing arrangements. The guarantees are normally granted on behalf of Cargotec companies and, therefore, do not give rise to additional credit risk. If and when guarantees are granted on behalf of external parties, the level of credit risk is estimated and recognised as a /financial liability at fair value. The received external guarantees are hedging the credit risk related to Cargotec's projects. Received guarantees typically hedge the credit risk related to Cargotec's contractual right to receive a payment regarding the work performed. Therefore, guarantees received in the beginning of a project are typically not recognised initially as /financial assets and, subsequently, if a default occurs, only to the extent that Cargotec has a right to reimbursement for an amount higher than the related assets on the balance sheet.\n\nA contingent liability is disclosed in Cargotec's notes when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence is con/firmed by one or more doubtful future events. A Contingent liability is also disclosed in notes as in present obligation which is not recognised as a provision or liability in the balance sheet, since it is not probable that payment will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably.\n\n| MEUR                                                                   |   31 Dec 2020 |   31 Dec 2019 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Guarantees given on behalf of associated companies and joint  ventures |           1.3 |          41.8 |\n| Guarantees given on behalf of others                                   |           0.4 |           0.4 |\n| Customer financing                                                     |          18.1 |          23.3 |\n| Off-balance sheet leases                                               |           0.7 |           2.4 |\n| Other contingent liabilities                                           |           2.5 |           4.9 |\n| Total                                                                  |          23   |          72.8 |\n\nCargotec Corporation has guaranteed obligations of Cargotec companies arising from ordinary course of business. The total amount of these guarantees on 31 December 2020 was EUR 398.8 (31 Dec 2019: 512.5) million.\n\nOff-balance sheet leases include from 1 Jan 2019 the lease commitments related to shortterm leases, low-value leases, and leases that have not yet commenced. The aggregate off-balance sheet lease expenses totalled EUR 1.8 (2019: 2.9) million. Information regarding leases is disclosed in note 9.1, Leases.\n\nIn addition, Cargotec has commitments related to its investments in joint ventures. These commitments are disclosed in note 7.2, Joint ventures and associated companies.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nCargotec received in October 2016 a USD 13 million verdict in a local jury trial in Hempstead, USA. The verdict was related to business acquisition negotiations Cargotec USA had in 2010 and 2011. The negotiations were closed without results. The claim was based on Cargotec having breached con/fidentiality obligations related to the negotiations. In December 2018, Cargotec won its appeal to dispute the verdict of damages, which the opponent appealed to the Supreme Court of Texas. On 9 October 2020, Cargotec announced that on 2 October, the Supreme Court of Texas denied Cargotec's opponent's Petition for Review, hence the judicial process has been completed. The decision has no impact on Cargotec's /financials.\n\nThere are also certain other legal claims and disputes based on various grounds pending against Cargotec around the world. The management believes that the outcome of these disputes will not have a material effect on Cargotec's /financial position.\n\n## 9\ufffd3 Related-party transactions\n\nCargotec's related parties include the parent company Cargotec Corporation and its subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures. Related parties include also the members of the Board of Directors, the CEO and other members of the Leadership Team, their close family members and entities controlled directly or indirectly by them. In addition, major shareholders with more than 20 percent ownership of shares or of the total voting rights in the company, are included in related parties.",

The implementation of the merger still requires, among other things, obtaining the necessary approvals from the competition authorities. The planned implementation date of the merger is January 1, 2022. The planned implementation date may change, and the actual date may be earlier or later than the above. Until the completion of the merger, both companies will continue their business as before as separate and independent companies.\n\nThe proposed merger will create a global leader in sustainable material /flows with a number of valuable customer-centric brands and complementary offerings in industry, factories, ports, terminals, road transport and sea freight handling.\n\nUpon completion, the combination will be carried out as an absorption-type merger in which Konecranes shareholders receive as a merger consideration 2.0834 new Cargotec class B shares and 0.3611 new Cargotec class A shares for each Konecranes share held upon completion of the merger and after the share split described below. To enable the consideration of the merger, Cargotec will carry out a free share issue (share splitting) in which",

For each existing Cargotec A class share, two new Cargotec class A shares will be issued and for each Cargotec class B share, two new Cargotec class B shares will be issued. As a result of the transaction, the shareholders of Cargotec and Konecranes will each own about half of the new company.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS, the merger will be accounted for as a business combination in which Cargotec is the acquirer into which Konecranes will merge. The assets and liabilities of Konecranes on the merger date will be measured at fair value in the purchase price allocation and consolidated into Cargotec from then on.\n\nThe value of the acquisition depends on the market price of Cargotec's class A and B shares at the time of the merger. At the reporting date, 31 December 2020, the value of the shares to be paid to Konecranes shareholders in the merger based on the market price of Cargotec's class B share and the outstanding shares of Konecranes amounted to approximately EUR 2,180.8 million.\n\n## 9\ufffd5 Events after the balance sheet date\n\nCargotec announced on 12 January 2021 about concluding a settlement with Nekkar ASA on TTS marine and offshore businesses' purchase price.\n\nAfter completing the acquisition of the marine and offshore businesses of TTS Group ASA (now Nekkar ASA) on 31 July 2019, and challenging the calculation of the purchase price, MacGregor has concluded a settlement agreement with Nekkar. The settlement agreement provides for a total payment of NOK 94 million (EUR 9.1 million) to be made by Nekkar to MacGregor in full and /final settlement of the disputed purchase price. The payment is net of NOK 8 million (EUR 0.8 million) previously withheld by MacGregor related to the ful/fillment of Nekkar tax obligations in China following completion of the acquisition. The settlement amount will have an approximately EUR 7 million positive impact on MacGregor's /first quarter 2021 operating pro/fit.",

Foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables outstanding at the end of the /financial period are revaluated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange rate gains/losses relating to operations are treated as adjustments to sales and costs. Exchange rate gains/losses associated with /financial instruments are included in /financing income and expenses.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nSales primarily include internal service charges. Revenue from the service sales is recognised when the services have been rendered.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the /financial statements and taxation are calculated using the future period's enacted tax rate at the closing date. Total deferred tax liability is included on the balance sheet in full and deferred tax asset at the estimated probable asset value.\n\nIncome taxes include a tax expense calculated from the taxable income of the period in accordance with the Finnish tax legislation.\n\n## Intangible and tangible assets, amortisation and depreciation\n\nIntangible and tangible assets are stated at original acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and depreciation, and impairment. Amortisation and depreciation are recognised on a straight-line basis in accordance with a predetermined plan based on the estimated useful economic life of assets. The amortisation and depreciation periods based on expected useful economic lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Intangible assets 3-10 years\n- \u00b7  Other capitalised expenditure 5-10 years\n- \u00b7  Machinery and equipment 3-5 years\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in the group companies and joint ventures are measured at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment. Other investments, for which fair value cannot be measured reliably due to non-existent public markets or reliable valuation methods, are also mainly measured at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment.\n\n## Loans receivable\n\nLoans receivable include mainly loans to group companies. Loans receivable are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairments in accordance with the effective interest method. Interest income from loans receivable is recognised as /financial income based on the effective interest rate.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, short-term bank deposits and other shortterm liquid investments with maturities up to three months.\n\n## Loans payable\n\nLoans payable are initially recognised as a liability on the balance sheet at an amount received less transaction costs. Subsequently, loans payable are measured at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs and interests are recognised as /finance expense in the income statement by applying the effective interest rate.\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nDerivative instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which equals their fair value, and subsequently they are measured at fair value on each balance sheet date in accordance with the principles of IFRS, as allowed by FAS, and the fair value changes are recognised in the income statement unless hedge accounting is applied. Fair values of currency forward contracts and cross-currency and interest rate swaps are determined by using commonly applied valuation methods and the valuations are based on observable market data for interest rates and currencies. Derivative instruments maturing after 12 months from the balance sheet date are included in the non-current assets and liabilities. Other derivative instruments are included in the current assets and liabilities.\n\nParent company applies hedge accounting only to hedges of cash /flows associated with foreign currency-denominated loans, in which interest rate swap is used as a hedging instrument. To qualify for hedge accounting, the parent company documents the hedge relationship of the derivative instrument and the related hedged item, the company's risk management targets and the hedging strategy. When starting hedge accounting and at least in every interim and annual closing, the company documents and estimates the effectiveness of",

Ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Cumulative gain or loss on the hedge deferred to equity is recognised in the income statement as an adjustment to the hedged item during the same period when the hedged item is recognised. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments relating to operative items that no longer are expected to materialise are recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating income/ expenses. If the hedging instrument matures, is sold, the contract is revoked or exercised or the relation of the hedging instrument and the underlying item is revoked, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the underlying operative item materialises.\n\nChanges in the fair values of hedges, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are recognised in the income statement, either in operative income and expenses or /financial income and expenses, depending on the hedged item. Changes in all forward contract fair values due to interest rate changes are always directly recognised in /financial income and expenses.\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity consists of share capital, share premium account, fair value reserves, reserve for invested non-restricted equity and retained earnings, deducted with dividends paid and donations approved at the Annual General Meeting. The amount exceeding the accounting par value of shares received by the company in connection with share subscriptions was recorded in share premium account under the old Limited Liability Companies Act (29 Sep 1978/734). Fair value reserves include the cumulative spot-component of the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments de/fined as cash /flow hedges. Under the new (1 Sep 2006) Limited Liability Companies Act (21 Jul 2006/624), when stock options are exercised, the amount received is recorded in reserve for invested non-restricted equity. Changes in treasury shares are recorded in reserve for invested non-restricted equity. The net pro/fit/loss for the period is recorded in retained earnings.\n\n## Statutory provisions\n\nStatutory provisions are expenses to which the parent company is committed and that are not likely to generate the corresponding revenue, or losses, which are regarded as evident.\n\n## 2\ufffd Financial risk management\n\nThe parent company manages the /financial risks of the group and operates under the same policies and instructions as the group.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe parent company's treasury function operates as an internal bank for the group's subsidiaries. The parent company's currency exposure originates mainly from foreign currency funding given to subsidiaries and foreign currency loans taken by the parent company. In addition, the currency position includes internal forward agreements with the subsidiaries and external forward agreements. Foreign exchange differences arising from these transactions are booked in the statement of income in the /financial items. Furthermore, the parent company invoices the group companies for the services provided. Foreign exchange differences from these invoices are booked in the parent company's operational pro/fit.\n\nThe parent company's open currency exposure on 31 December 2020 was, in absolute terms, EUR 10.7 (31 Dec 2019: 12.0) million.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe parent company's interest rate risk originates from external loans and internal loans and deposits. The pricing of intercompany transactions is based on transfer pricing rules, and internal interest income and expenses are eliminated on group level. As a result, interest rate risk is not measured separately on parent company level, and the information presented in the consolidated /financial statements regarding interest risk and its management is the same for the parent company.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nThe majority of the group's derivatives, loans and cash equivalents belong to the parent company. The maturity structure of these /financial liabilities is not separately followed on parent company level, because the information presented in the consolidated /financial statements provides a fair view of the liquidity and funding risk. Only account payables and account receivables vary signi/ficantly between the parent company and the group.\n\n## Credit and counterparty risk\n\nThe parent company's accounts receivable and loan receivables originate mainly from the other group companies, and the parent company is therefore not exposed to a counterparty risk.\n\nExternal loan receivables on 31 December 2020 were EUR 0.2 (31 Dec 2019: 0.4) million, and cash and equivalents EUR 361.8 (31 Dec 2019: 287.3) million. The parent company's cash and equivalents are held in banks that have a solid credit rating and are approved by the Treasury",

The CEO is entitled to a supplemental de/fined contribution pension bene/fit. According to the renewed pension agreement in 2020, the CEO is entitled to retire at the age of 65.

The /financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7  the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash /flows and notes to the consolidated /financial statements, including a summary of signi/ficant accounting policies\n- \u00b7  the parent company balance sheet, parent company income statement, parent company cash /flow statement and notes to the parent company /financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 2.3 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## Our Audit Approach\n\nOverview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7  We have applied an overall group materiality of \u20ac 12 million (previous year \u20ac 14 million).\n\n## Group scoping\n\n- \u00b7  The group audit scope includes all signi/ficant operating companies, as well as a large number of smaller companies, covering the vast majority of the group's revenue, assets and liabilities.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7  Over time revenue recognition\n- \u00b7  Valuation of goodwill\n- \u00b7  Accounting for restructuring provisions and costs\n- \u00b7  Valuation of inventory\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the /financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of signi/ficant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.",

An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the /financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the /financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated /financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the /financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 12 million (previous year \u20ac 14 million)                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | Net sales                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Rationale for the materiality  benchmark applied | We chose net sales as the benchmark because, in our view, it  is the appropriate benchmark, which the users of the financial  statements regularly use to evaluate the performance of the  group. |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nThe group audit scope was tailored to take into account the structure of the Group and the size, complexity and risk of individual subsidiaries. Using these criteria we selected companies and accounts into our audit scope and at the same time ensured that we get suf/ficient coverage to our audit, in order to issue an audit opinion for the Group.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTER IN THE AUDIT OF THE GROUP\n\n## HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\nOver time revenue recognition Refer to note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe group has significant long-term construction contracts in Kalmar and MacGregor segments. These long-term construction contracts are recognised on an over time basis in accordance with the percentage of completion if the delivered machine or solution is estimated to have no alternative use for the company and at all times during the project the company has a right to payment regarding the work already performed.\n\nPercentage of completion is determined either by reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total costs of the project or by completion of a certain physical milestone. Over time revenue recognition includes management judgment in a form of estimates, which are subject to management experience and expectations of future events. The most important judgment relates to the estimated total costs of the project, which is influenced by various factors, related to both material and labour as well as specific contract related risks.\n\nOver time revenue recognition is a key audit matter in the audit due to the level of management judgement included in the estimates.\n\nOur revenue testing included both testing of the company's controls, as well as substantive audit procedures for selected projects.\n\nOur testing of the company's controls, focused on the IT systems used by the group, as well as process level controls covering project forecasting and revenue recognition.\n\nOur substantive testing focused particularly on estimates applied by management in the accounting. Our procedures for the selected projects included, among other things, the following:\n\n- \u00b7  We ensured that the revenue recognition method applied was appropriate based on the terms of the arrangement;\n- \u00b7  We agreed the total project revenue estimates to sales agreements, including amendments as appropriate;\n- \u00b7  We tested the accuracy of the cost estimate by taking a sample of cost components and traced those to supporting documentation; and\n- \u00b7  We recalculated the completion stage of the projects to ensure that the amount of revenue being recognised is correct by comparing actual costs per the company's accounting records to the estimated total costs of the projects. When physical milestone method was used, we obtained appropriate evidence based on the circumstances to support the stage of completion.",

Due to the current uncertainty related to the financial operating environment,  MacGregor's goodwill has been tested for impairment in 2020 on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of are determined using value in use model. These calculations are subject to significant management judgement in a form of estimates of future cash flows and discount rates.\n\nValuation of goodwill is a key audit matter in the audit due to the significant size of the goodwill balance and the high level of management judgement involved.\n\nOur audit focused on assessing the appropriateness of management's judgment and estimates used in the goodwill impairment analysis through the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7  We tested the methodology applied in the value in use calculations by comparing them to the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, and we tested the mathematical accuracy of calculation;\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the process by which the future cash flow forecasts were drawn up, including comparing them to strategic plans approved by the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7  We tested the key underlying assumptions, including sales and profitability forecasts, discount rates used and the implied growth rates beyond the forecasted period;\n- \u00b7  We compared the current year actual results to the forecasts included in the prior year impairment model to consider whether the forecasts included assumptions that, with hindsight, had been optimistic;\n- \u00b7  We assessed the appropriateness of the sensitivity analysis performed by the management; and\n- \u00b7  The discount rates applied within the impairment analysis were assessed by PwC business valuation specialist, including comparison of the components of the discount rate used by the company to generally accepted external sources of information as appropriate.\n- \u00b7  We also considered the appropriateness of the related disclosures provided in note 6.1 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTER IN THE AUDIT OF THE GROUP\n\n## HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\n## Accounting for restructuring provisions and costs\n\nRefer to notes 2.4 and 5.5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nRestructuring provision amounts to \u20ac 23,0 million at 2020 year-end, with an annual restructuring costs of \u20ac 131,0 million recognised in the profit and loss statement.\n\nThe accounting for restructuring provisions and costs requires judgement to estimate the value and timing of net economic outflows and the extent to which the company is committed at the balance sheet date. The presentation in the financial statements also requires consideration of whether the amounts included in the charge are fair.\n\nAccounting for restructuring provisions and costs is a key audit matter in the audit due to level of management judgement included in the estimates.\n\nOur audit procedures were designed to test that the costs incurred were accurately recorded, capturing both amounts paid during the financial year and amounts estimated and accrued.\n\nOur audit focused specifically on the following:\n\n- \u00b7  We assessed whether the restructurings costs have been recognised in the correct financial period, in accordance with IFRS;\n- \u00b7  We assessed the appropriateness of the provisions and the assumptions relating to asset impairments; and\n- \u00b7  We assessed whether the costs incurred were sufficiently distinct to warrant inclusion in the restructuring costs and in line with the group accounting policies.",

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Inventory provision is recorded to adjust the inventory to its net realisable value. When estimating the level of provision, management takes into account the nature, state, age structure and estimated demand for the inventory, as appropriate.\n\nWe focused on inventories due to its size and the nature of the judgements made by management when assessing the level of provision required.\n\nOur audit consisted testing of company's controls both for valuation and existence of inventories as well as substantive audit procedures.\n\nOur substantive procedures were focused on the following:\n\n- \u00b7  We participated in the physical inventory countings of the group companies selected in our audit scope to obtain audit evidence regarding existence and condition of the inventory. During the inventory counting we assessed the appropriateness of the counting procedures and performed independent test counts. Where inventory was held in the custody of third parties, we obtained appropriate confirmations and reconciled these to the inventory accounting;\n- \u00b7  We tested a sample of items from the inventory system to third party purchase invoices. We also obtained and tested management's calculations on the absorption of direct and indirect costs to make sure that those have been appropriately accounted for;\n- \u00b7  Where the provision was based on the aging structure of the inventory, we performed recalculations and ensured that the provision is in line with the Group's accounting policies. Where judgement was used by management, we ensured that it was reasonable and reflected the circumstances; and\n- \u00b7  Where provision was based on estimated demand of the inventory, we tested the supporting documentation and ensured that the provision is in line with Group's accounting policies. Where judgement was used by management, we ensured that it was reasonable and reflected the circumstances.\n\nWe have no key audit matters to report with respect to our audit of the parent company /financial statements.\n\nThere are no signi/ficant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated /financial statements or the parent company /financial statements.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated /financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of /financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of /financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The /financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.",

Investor Relations is responsible for planning and executing /financial and investor communications at Cargotec, and all investor requests are processed centrally through Cargotec's Investor Relations.\n\nThe investor relations function prepares Cargotec's /financial statements and quarterly reviews, develops the investor website and writes stock exchange releases. It also organises roadshows, investor meetings and events, seminars, news conferences of result publications, as well as site visits, and it participates in annual general meeting arrangements.\n\nInvestor relations prepares content on current topics, such as videos, blogs and podcasts about interim reports or speci/fic events. Both videos and podcasts can be found from Cargotec website's Investor section, videos from the IR video gallery in particular. Investor Relations leads the Capital Markets Day and other IR events arrangements for investors and analysts and gathers and analyses market information and investor feedback to be used by Cargotec's management and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Silent period\n\nCargotec follows a three-week silent period prior to publication of an interim report or /financial statements. During this time, Cargotec spokespersons do not comment on the company's /financial situation, market, or future outlook, hold any meetings with investors or analysts or attend any investor conferences.\n\n## Investor relations in 2020\n\nEarly in 2020, Cargotec's Investor Relations managed still to meet investors and analysts faceto-face. The IR team held roadshows in London, UK and in Oslo, Norway. In Copenhagen, Denmark the team participated in an investor conference, and it also held several investor calls and organised sell-side breakfasts in Helsinki, Finland and in London.\n\nIn February, Stefan Lampa , the head of Kalmar Mobile Solutions, met the investor community in Helsinki, Finland. In his presentation, Stefan talked about the market development and how he saw electri/fication, the robotics and automation to boost the business forward. The IR team prepared a video interview with Stefan, which has gathered hundreds of views in Cargotec's Youtube channel.\n\nAnnual review\n\nSustainability\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial review\n\nCoronavirus pandemic affected everyone globally during 2020. Safety and health of our employees, customers and partners remained the /first priority in all Cargotec activities, and also Cargotec's Investor Relations adjusted its actions accordingly.\n\nFrom early March onward, the IR team moved into using virtual meeting methods in all its investor and analyst meetings. Since then, the meeting participants have convened online and material has been shared virtually. While the coronavirus situation prevails, the IR team continues with high safety standards, following the regulatory travel and social restrictions.\n\nAll in all, the IR team held tens of virtual meetings in 2020. Meetings were hosted by IR team members and, on many of those meetings, also Cargotec's CEO Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen or CFO Mikko Puolakka participated, presenting their insights to the audience about Cargotec as an investment opportunity.\n\nThe IR team produced 13 videos during 2020. The videos presented Cargotec's activities from many angles - from quarterly report presentations to business area introductions and strategy development insights. In total, the videos have collected about 6,000 views on Cargotec's Youtube channel (end-January 2021 situation).\n\nThe IR team also wrote 16 blog texts in 2020, which were published on company website www.cargotec.com. The blog topics ranged from interim report Q&A to coronavirus status updates and business area and strategy developments.\n\nThe IR section on the company website was in many ways the main hub of IR activities during 2020. All 2020-related material was collected there (not forgetting the vast material that covers the earlier years). This includes, among others, the IR presentation (updated monthly), quarterly report material (videos, webcasts, transcripts, presentations, reports, podcasts), AGM materials for which the team also created a vast majority of materials.\n\nTo further enrich the connection with the IR audience, the IR team initiated several web development activities during 2020. For the investor/analyst meeting participant it is now possible to send instant meeting feedback via a speci/fic quick-to-/fill web form and, for longer messages, a speci/fic IR feedback form was also created. The solution enables Cargotec's IR to monitor the market sentiment and gather anonymous investor feedback.",
