The metrics relate to growing the A.P. Moller - Maersk logistics business and improve earnings in infrastructure and logistics, while generating free cash flow to ensure a strong balance sheet and to create value for the shareholders of A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk significantly improved the free cash flow and generated a cash return on invested capital of 16.6% (10.0%), based on stronger cash flow from operations, lower gross CAPEX and slightly lower invested capital.\n\nInfrastructure and logistics revenue (excl. freight forwarding) increased to USD 9.4bn (USD 9.2bn), mainly due to increased revenue in logistics from warehousing and distribution, due to acquisitions, and supply chain management despite headwinds from gateway terminals, given impacts from COVID-19.\n\nA.P.

The underlying return on invested capital increased to 9.6% (3.2%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNew acquisitions Performance Team KGH Customs Services\n\n/four.tf/seven.tf/zero.tfm Logistics & Services EBITDA, USD (excl. freight forwarding)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant improvement in profitability\n\nRevenue increased to USD 39.7bn (USD 38.9bn) and the continued focus on a tight cost control, profitability and stronger rates led to a 44% increase in EBITDA to USD 8.2bn and a margin of 20.7% (14.7%). The strong improvement was mainly driven by strong cost savings in Ocean focusing on agile capacity deployment, lower bunker costs and an increase in short-term freight rates. Logistics & Services improved EBITDA 110%, supported by margin optimisation in intermodal and increased profitability in warehousing and distribution facilities in North America, mainly driven by acquisitions. Gateway terminals reported an 8.3% improvement in EBITDA despite of a 3.6% decline in volume, as a result of lower costs.\n\nEBIT improved to USD 4.2bn (USD 1.7bn) reflecting an improvement in the margin to 10.5% (4.4%), while underlying profit was USD 3.0bn (USD 546m).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Guidance for 2021\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the range of USD 8.5-10.5bn, before restructuring and integration costs and free cash flow above USD 3.5bn.\n\nThe outlook for 2021 is subject to uncertainties related to COVID-19, bunker fuel prices and freight rates given the uncertain macroeconomic conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Free cash flow improved due to significantly higher earnings and reduced CAPEX\n\nFollowing the strong earnings development and a cash conversion ratio of 95% (104%), cash flow from operating activities was USD 7.8bn (USD 5.9bn). CAPEX was USD 1.3bn (USD 2.0m), and free cash flow was USD 4.6bn (USD 2.3bn).\n\nCAPEX discipline remains a key focus area, reflected in the accumulated CAPEX guidance of USD 4.5-5.5bn for 2021-2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital momentum\n\n2020 has been a year that has reinforced the customer interest for A.P. Moller - Maersk's digital offerings. Maersk Spot continued to gain significant traction during the year and the use of the Maersk App increased by 300%. Twill has increased weekly volumes which was 13 times larger compared to the same period the previous year and new digital solutions such as Maersk Flow, NeoNav and the Transformation Management System platform in the logistics business were launched to further enhance customer experience and engagement.",

Moller - Maersk from a diversified conglomerate to a focused and integrated global logistics company is well under way.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk today offers a broad and global portfolio of logistics products from ocean and air transport to inland transportation, warehousing and distribution - including cold storage, customs services and lead logistics products, such as supply chain management services and e-com fulfilment, as well as container port services  and  towage.\n\nOur strategy is built on three core elements: Firstly, we offer our customers end-to-end digitally enabled transport and logistics services that help them manage their supply chains, sell their products globally, and source from the most competitive suppliers worldwide. For us to deliver superior value to our customers, we have built our land-based logistics and service offerings in a way that seamlessly integrates with our strong, leading and sustainable Ocean business. This enables us to leverage the commercial synergies inherent in selling land-based logistics services to our 70,000 customers in our Ocean business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJim Hagemann Snabe\n\nChairman of A.P.

        "page_content": "Secondly, we are leveraging the financial and operational synergies between our Ocean business and our Terminals business for lower cost as well as higher productivity and asset utilisation. Owning and operating container ports enables us to control our global transhipment hubs that are crucial for the reliability and cost effectiveness of our Ocean network.\n\nAnd thirdly, we are building competitive advantage through technology. We are digitising the interaction with our customers while offering unique digital products and leveraging Maersk.com, which is one of the biggest B2B transaction platforms in the world. We are standardising, automating and digitising our core processes as well as our assets, such as ships, containers, warehouses and ports, to manage fuel cost and improve visibility in supply chains, while lowering the overall cost base.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' We  have  improved our financial performance while we transformed our business.'\n\n## Disciplined execution enables us to perform and transform\n\nSince we embarked on our transformation to become the global integrator of container logistics, we have executed the strategy consistently and with discipline. Despite a backdrop of weak trade growth, ongoing trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty and a pandemic in 2020, we have improved our financial performance while we transformed our business.\n\nWe achieved good results in a year with extraordinary demand fluctuations due to COVID-19, which led from a sharp oversupply of capacity in Q1 to a shortage of vessels and equipment in the second half as demand rebounded, leading to a significant increase in short-term freight rates. We leave 2020 with a strong balance sheet which enable us to both increase payouts to our shareholders and fund the transformation that will enable the longterm growth of the company.\n\nThe work we have done over the past five years to improve the performance of our Ocean business delivered solid results in 2020. Our acquisition of Hamburg S\u00fcd in 2017, our focus on cost, and our disciplined approach to CAPEX were all contributing factors to the delivery of excellent results and strong cash flow in 2020. In parallel, we developed new, unique products such as Maersk Spot, which offers loading guarantee, easy online booking and a fixed price for our short-term customers.\n\nOur Logistics & Services business delivered excellent margin growth in 2020 and good revenue growth, mainly through acquisitions. We restructured further to reduce cost and develop endto-end products. We began the implementation of new technology platforms and recruited new leadership and logistics experts globally. Our\n\n' Since we embarked on our transformation to become the global integrator of container logistics, we have executed the strategy consistently and with discipline.'\n\nLogistics & Services business grew revenue to almost USD 7bn with competitive margins and a sound foundation to accelerate growth in the coming years.\n\nIn Terminals, we have executed a turnaround since 2016 and the business has shifted its focus from developing new terminals to becoming a worldclass terminal operator. Results and cash generation have steadily improved, also in 2020, despite lower volumes. Due to strong cost performance across all segments, we now have an infrastructure business with resilient returns.\n\n## Continuing the transformation\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2020, we announced three metrics to track progress on our strategic transformation. During 2020, we progressed well despite challenging market conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash return on invested capital (CROIC), last twelve months, increased to 16.6% (10.0%), due to stronger cash flow from operations, lower gross CAPEX, and lower invested capital.\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure and Logistics revenue (excl. freight forwarding) increased to USD 9.4bn (USD 9.2bn), mainly due to the acquisition of Performance Team, a leading US-based warehousing and distribution company, only partly offset by lower revenue in gateway terminals because of the impacts from COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Logistics & Services EBITDA (excl. freight forwarding) improved to USD 470m (USD 221m) as a result of margin optimisation in intermodal and supported by the acquisition of Performance Team.\n\nROIC, which is the overall return ambition of A.P. Moller - Maersk increased to 9.4% compared to 3.1%, driven by significantly improved earnings.\n\n## Strategic milestones strengthen integrated offering\n\nIn 2020, we finished the restructuring of our Ocean and Logistics & Services businesses into one, integrated and simplified organisation to enable further improvements in the customer experience and end-to-end service delivery.",

        "page_content": "The Safmarine brand and Damco's Air and LCL (Less than Container Load) offerings were integrated into the Maersk brand to enhance customer access to the global offering, while Damco's ocean freight forwarding business has closed from 1 January 2021.\n\nIn April 2020, we acquired Performance Team, and in September, we closed the deal on KGH Customs Services, a leading specialist in trade and customs services management in Europe. Both companies are logistics experts within their fields, customer feedback is positive, and we have added important capabilities and immensely strengthened our logistics offering and geographical footprint.\n\nOn the digital side, we have benefited from our early investments in digitisation and seen a huge uptake on Maersk.com and the Maersk App, as customers have embraced the digital space even more this year on the back of the pandemic.\n\nOur customers also appreciate the predictability, reliability and ease that Maersk Spot offers. The online booking solution has grown exponentially from 20% of short-term volume in the last four weeks of 2019 to 51% in the same period of 2020 under the Maersk brand. Twill, an online service for small and medium-sized businesses, has also experienced immense growth this year. In 2020, more than 2,500 new customers booked on Twill with volumes exceeding 100,000 FFE, representing a 13 fold year-over-year growth.\n\nIn the terminal space, our Pier 400 terminal in Los Angeles is progressing on a multi-year automation programme and has carried out the first commercial, fully automated moves in the third quarter. Digitising our assets enables speed, operational ease, safer operations and lower cost.\n\n## Building competitive advantage from technology\n\nTechnology and digitisation of our industry are key to the transformation at A.P. Moller - Maersk. Through technology, we are offering new products, connecting and simplifying the customer experience and enabling more efficient operations and utilisation of assets. We want to build sustainable, competitive advantage through the following focus areas:\n\nFirstly, we are building new digital platforms, which enable integrated offerings, standardisation and automation. In particular, TradeLens, which is an open and neutral supply chain platform jointly developed with IBM, continues to gain momentum as new customers, partners, and suppliers onboard. The tenants of this platform are already benefiting from increased visibility of events in their supply chains and reduced costs from having access to a digital bill of lading.\n\nSecondly, we are strengthening our investment in Internet of Things (IoT) and automation of our terminals to drive better management of our physical assets and efficiencies in our operations. In particular, we are building a roadmap to harness near real-time data from devices in our vessels, containers and terminals and drive intelligent decision making in our operations and for our customers.\n\nThirdly, we are committed to leveraging data as a discrete and differentiating asset that will offer data products, such as visibility, and democratise access to data to serve our customers better.\n\nOur technology roadmap is enabled through a common and scalable enterprise architecture, a cloud-first strategy, and continued investment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' Technology and digitisation of our industry are key to the transformation at A.P. Moller - Maersk.'\n\nin digital cyber security. This is made possible through focused efforts to insource high-value IT-capabilities to develop one of the leading IT organisations in the industry.\n\n## Our response to a global emergency\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the world. As a global company and industry leader, we have remained focused on protecting our employees, supporting our customers and contributing to the societies we are part of by keeping goods flowing throughout the pandemic - ensuring essential food, protective equipment and medical supplies.\n\nOur colleagues at sea, in our ports and at our warehouses have been in the eye of the storm. They have kept the world's goods moving by showing up to work every day. In particular, our colleagues at sea have contributed by taking longer shifts on board than anyone would have imagined. Our single biggest challenge has been to relieve our seafarers after their tour has ended,\n\ndue to travel restrictions, closed borders and the constant change of local regulations and requirements. By the end of the year, we had succeeded in relieving due crew members from our vessels and bringing them home to their families and friends.\n\nOn shore, we have taken extraordinary measures to protect our workers at ports, warehouses and other frontline locations. Our office-based colleagues have shown their resilience by adapting to working from home to the extent possible, and we have done our outmost to support this change, mentally and physically.\n\nAmid a pandemic that has large impacts on supply chains, customers need flexible and robust solutions. With our integrated approach, we are supporting their end-to-end logistics needs, while controlling the most central assets and offering alternative solutions as borders close, air traffic stops and roads are blocked.",

Our customers are supporting the ambition and demanding responsible transportation of their goods so they can limit their own footprint, and this expectation is also reflected among our investors.\n\nIn 2020, we updated our sustainability priorities. Our key focus areas reached a level of maturity where they are now fully integrated into our business practices.\n\nDecarbonising logistics is the one commitment where we can make the greatest contribution to climate action. In June 2020, the A.P.

M\u00f8ller Foundation for making this possible thereby demonstrating the essence of our shared values and strong leadership in the efforts towards reducing the industry's carbon emissions to zero by 2050.\n\nIn addition, we remain committed to our broader sustainability agenda, including our role in multiplying the benefits of trade, contributing to halving food loss and improving the ship recycling industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are proud of the progress made so far and remain committed to all our stakeholders to be an innovative and responsible global integrator of container logistics.\n\n## 2021 - continuing to perform while we complete the transformation\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to focus on growing our landside logistics, expanding our product portfolio to all relevant markets and increasing cross-selling and upselling to our customers to deliver profitable, organic growth. In addition, we expect to continue to acquire capabilities and growth platforms, particularly within warehousing and distribution, air freight as well as customs services to further strengthen our integrated product offerings.\n\nIn Ocean, our focus will be on developing our existing products further as well as adding new and unique products to our portfolio. We will remain focused on optimising our network and cost structure to ensure we stabilise earnings and deliver good, sustainable returns in our largest business.\n\n' We are fully committed to our ambition of reducing CO/uni2082 emissions as we continue to work towards carbon neutrality in 2050.'\n\nIn Terminals, our focus continues to be on improving the operating performance of our portfolio of ports, financially and operationally. We will drive further synergies with our Ocean business, complete our automation project in Los Angeles and our construction project for a new terminal in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and mature plans for future growth in our portfolio, including automation.\n\n## Thank you for your continued support\n\nOn May 1, we welcomed our new CFO and member of the Executive Board, Patrick Jany. Patrick brings solid financial experience and a proven record of managing cost discipline and profitable growth through M&As and innovation. We are also happy to welcome Blythe S. J. Masters to the Board of Directors. Blythe has added critical capabilities to the Board with her international outlook and experience within financial services and technology, having extensive knowledge in start-ups, platforms and blockchain.\n\nWe would like to thank our 80,000 colleagues deeply for their truly extraordinary efforts to keep trade moving under such challenging conditions.\n\nIn times of increased uncertainty, open supply chains and free global trade is more relevant than ever.

Moller - Maersk reported an EBITDA of USD 8.2bn, and USD 8.3bn excluding restructuring and integration costs, compared to the original guidance of around USD 5.5bn given in February 2020, and in line with the upgraded EBITDA expectations announced in November 2020. The increase in EBITDA of USD 2.5bn was mainly driven by improved earnings in Ocean, led by lower cost from agile capacity deployment and lower bunker cost, as well as increased freight rates. Logistics & Services more than doubled its EBITDA, while Terminals & Towage proved their resilience by maintaining profitability despite a strong impact from the pandemic. Free cash flow increased significantly supported by strong cash flow from operations and continued capital discipline, and as a result, net interest-bearing debt has been significantly reduced and a second share buy-back launched.\n\n## Highlights for the year\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC), last twelve months, increased to 9.4% (3.1%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| USD million                                                                   | Revenue                                             | Revenue                                              | EBITDA                                   | EBITDA                                    | CAPEX/uni00B9                           | CAPEX/uni00B9                             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                               | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                      | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf           | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf            | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf          | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf            |\n| Ocean                                                                         | /two.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/five.tf    | /two.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf/two.tf   | /six.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/four.tf/five.tf | /four.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /six.tf/five.tf/three.tf                | /one.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/two.tf   |\n| Logistics & Services                                                          | /six.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/six.tf/three.tf            | /six.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/three.tf/one.tf            | /four.tf/five.tf/four.tf                 | /two.tf/one.tf/six.tf                     | /one.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf                 | /one.tf/two.tf/six.tf                     |\n| Terminals & Towage                                                            | /three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf        | /three.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/eight.tf          | /one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/five.tf  | /one.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/one.tf/eight.tf   | /four.tf/five.tf/seven.tf               | /five.tf/three.tf/two.tf                  |\n| Manufacturing & Others                                                        | /one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/five.tf/four.tf             | /one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/seven.tf/six.tf            | /one.tf/six.tf/five.tf                   | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf                   | /three.tf/three.tf                      | /two.tf/zero.tf/four.tf                   |\n| Unallocated activities/comma.tf eliminations/comma.tf etc/period.tf           | -/one.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/five.tf/nine.tf           | -/one.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/four.tf/seven.tf           | -/one.tf/four.tf/three.tf                | -/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf                  | /seven.tf/zero.tf                       | /one.tf                                   |\n| A/period.tfP/period.tf Moller - Maersk consolidated   - continuing operations | /three.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/zero.tf | /three.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf | /eight.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/two.tf/six.tf  | /five.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/one.tf/two.tf  | /one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/two.tf/two.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/five.tf |\n\n1  See definition on page 148.\n\n## Financial and operational performance\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk reported a revenue of USD 39.7bn (USD 38.9bn) with an increase in Ocean of USD 393m with negative effects from COVID-19 on loaded volumes predominantly in Q2 offset by higher short-term rates and a strong rebound in volumes Q4. In Logistics & Services revenue increased by USD 632m, driven by warehousing and distribution including Performance Team acquired in April 2020, and air freight forwarding. Terminals & Towage and Manufacturing & Others reported a decrease in revenue of USD 141m and USD 122m, respectively, negatively impacted by COVID-19.\n\nEBITDA increased by 44% to USD 8.2bn (USD 5.7bn)\n\nwith increases in all segments, primarily in Ocean by USD 2.1bn, driven by higher revenue and a lower cost base mainly due to agile capacity deployment combined with a lower bunker price and consumption. This was also supported by the exceptional situation with demand surge leading to bottlenecks in the supply chain and equipment shortage experienced in the second half of 2020. Logistics & Services delivered a strong increase of 110% or USD 238m, driven by acquisitions and profitability increases in intermodal, air freight and warehousing and distribution. The impact from foreign exchange rates was negligible.\n\nEBIT was USD 4.2bn (USD 1.7bn), positively impacted by the improved EBITDA, and the net result from the sale of containers, vessels and facilities, partly  offset by impairments du to the market environment in 2020.\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC), last twelve months, increased to 9.4% (3.1%), as earnings improved significantly and invested capital was slightly reduced.\n\nFinancial expenses, net, amounted to USD 879m (USD 758m), positively impacted by lower gross debt, more than offset by negative foreign",

The effective tax rate decreased as a larger proportion of profit before tax was earned in the Ocean segment, subject to tonnage taxation.\n\nNet profit was USD 2.9bn (loss of USD 44m) due to significant improvement in operating earnings, while the result for discontinued operations in 2019 negatively impacted the net loss of USD 553m due to a fair value adjustment with Maersk Drilling being demerged on 2 April 2019.\n\nThe underlying net profit after financial items and tax was USD 3.0bn (USD 546m), due to the improved operational performance.\n\nCash flow from operating activities was USD 7.8bn (USD 5.9bn), positively impacted by an increase in EBITDA of USD 2.5bn, a decrease in tax paid of USD 77m, offset by negative change in net working capital of USD 239m (positive USD 476m), leading to a cash conversion of 95% (104%).\n\nGross capital expenditure (CAPEX) was USD 1.3bn (USD 2.0bn), and lower than guidance of USD 1.5bn due to lower investments in all segments.\n\nFree cash flow was USD 4.6bn (USD 2.3bn), positively impacted by higher cash flow from operating activities and lower gross CAPEX, but partly offset by higher increased lease payments.\n\nCash flow from borrowings was negative USD 1.9bn (negative USD 1.5bn), due to repayments of USD 3.2bn, partly offset by USD 1.3bn of new funding, which was driven by precautions taken due to COVID-19 in Q2.\n\nContractual capital commitments totalled USD 1.7bn (USD 1.7bn), of which USD 1.3bn is related to commitments towards terminal concession grantors. Strong commitment to capital discipline and free cash flow generation continue to be a key strategic focus.\n\n## Capital structure, issue of bonds and credit rating\n\nNet interest-bearing debt decreased to USD 9.2bn (USD 11.7bn), as free cash flow of USD 4.6bn was partly offset by share buy-back of USD 806m, dividends of USD 520m including dividend to non-controlling interest, acquisitions of USD 425m, and a net increase in lease liabilities of USD 170m. Net interest-bearing debt excluding lease liabilities decreased to USD 485m (USD 3.1bn).\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk remains investment grade-rated and holds a Baa3 (positive) rating from Moody's and a BBB (positive) rating from Standard & Poor's.\n\nTotal equity was USD 30.9bn (USD 28.8bn), mainly due to a net profit of USD 2.9bn and addition of non-controlling interest of USD 288m partly offset by dividends of USD 520m and share buy-back of USD 806m, resulting in an equity ratio of 55.0% (52.1%).\n\nThe liquidity reserve of USD 11.0bn (USD 10.5bn), composed of liquid funds of USD 4.8bn excluding restricted cash (USD 3.8bn) and undrawn revolving credit facilities of USD 6.2bn (USD 6.6bn).\n\nThe ordinary dividend of DKK 150 per A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S share of nominally DKK 1,000 (in total equal to USD 430m) declared at the Annual General Meeting on 23 March 2020 was paid on 26 March 2020. Of the DKK 150, DKK 75 was related to the underlying profit of the financial year 2019, and DKK 75 was related to gain from the sale of Total S.A. shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFROM OUR BUSINESS MODEL\n\n## We have a strong balance sheet and are committed to remaining investment grade-rated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend to the shareholders of DKK 330 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 150 per share of DKK 1,000) corresponding to 35% of underlying net result as per the company's dividend policy of distributing between 30-50% of the underlying net result to shareholders in dividend.\n\nThe proposed dividend payment represents an ordinary dividend yield of 2.4% (1.6%), based on the Maersk B share's closing price of DKK 13,595 as of 30 December 2020. Payment is expected to take place on 26 March 2021.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nThe share buy-back programme initiated in Q2 2019 was concluded on 24 July 2020 and A.P. Moller - Maersk has repurchased USD 1.5bn worth of shares.\n\nOn 1 June 2020, the cancellation of 156,977 A shares and 627,938 B shares was completed\n\ncorresponding to 3.77% of the total share capital in A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\nIn November 2020, the Board of Directors decided to initiate a new share buy-back programme of DKK 10bn (around USD 1.6bn) and the programme will run from December 2020 over a period of up to 15 months.\n\nThis will conclude the distribution associated with the sale of Maersk Oil and any further distribution to shareholders will come from the continuing business activities.\n\nDuring Q4, A.P. Moller - Maersk bought back 10,306 A shares and 41,232 B shares worth DKK 673m (around USD 110m).\n\nAt 31 December 2020, A.P. Moller - Maersk owns a total of 119,176 A-shares and 505,281 B-shares as treasury shares, corresponding to 3.47% of the share capital.",

Moller - Maersk expects for the full-year 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Underlying EBITDA in the range of USD 8.5-10.5bn compared to USD 8.3bn in 2020\n- \u00b7 Underlying EBIT in the range of USD 4.3-6.3bn compared to USD 4.2bn in 2020\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow (FCF) above USD 3.5bn compared to USD 4.6bn in 2020.\n\nAs part of the full-year guidance for 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk expects the current exceptional situation with the demand surge leading to bottlenecks in the supply chain and equipment shortage, which contributed by approximately USD 1.5bn to EBIT in 2020, to continue in Q1 and normalise thereafter. Consequently, A.P. Moller - Maersk expects profitability in Q1 2021 to be above Q4 2020.\n\nOcean is expected to grow in line with the global container demand at an expected 3-5% in 2021, with the highest growth seen in the first half-year.\n\nFor the years 2021-2022, the accumulated CAPEX is still expected to be USD 4.5-5.5bn.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation adjusted for restructuring and integration costs.\n\nUnderlying EBIT is operating profit before interest and taxes adjusted for restructuring and integration costs, net gains/losses from sale of non-current assets and net impairment losses.\n\n## Sensitivity guidance\n\nFinancial performance for A.P. Moller - Maersk for the full year 2021 depends on several factors and is subject to uncertainties related to COVID-19, bunker fuel prices and freight rates given the uncertain macroeconomic conditions.\n\nAll else being equal, the sensitivities for the full year 2021 for four key assumptions are listed in the table below:\n\n| Factors                                     | Change                                                           | Effect on EBIT (midpoint of guidance) (Full year /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Container freight rate                      | +/- /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf USD/FFE                              | +/- USD /one.tf/period.tf/three.tfbn                                              |\n| Container freight volume                    | +/- /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf FFE | +/- USD /zero.tf/period.tf/one.tfbn                                               |\n| Bunker price (net of expected BAF coverage) | +/- /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf USD/tonne                            | +/- USD /zero.tf/period.tf/four.tfbn                                              |\n| Rate of exchange (net of hedges)            | +/- /one.tf/zero.tf% change in USD                               | +/- USD /zero.tf/period.tf/two.tfbn                                               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Market update\n\nThe global economy sharply deteriorated in the spring and early summer of 2020 as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 led country lockdowns. Since then, a moderate recovery occurred as countries partially reopened and households and businesses were supported by fiscal transfers. However, the pandemic entered a second wave towards the end of 2020, which adds to the downside risk in early 2021. Social distancing and country lockdowns weighed more heavily on consumptions of services than on goods consumption, which supported a faster recovery of container trade compared to the broader economy, and at the end of 2020, global container volumes were higher than at the end of 2019. Dynamics in economic activity, trade and demand patterns will be highly dependent on the further development of the COVID-19 pandemic also in 2021 with the roll-out of a vaccine during the year.\n\n## Goods demand recovered quickly during country lockdowns\n\nAs a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, household salary income declined in 2020. While a substantial part of the income loss was compensated by extensive supporting fiscal programmes and monetary policy in many countries, total consumption demand suffered, some parts of consumption more than others (chart 1). The country lockdowns in H1 and the subsequent social distancing and travel restrictions led to a collapse in services consumption. At the same time, consumers spent a larger part of their income on physical goods such as electronics and furniture on the back of the protected disposable income and pent-up demand. This pattern coincided with a surge in e-commerce. Consequently, the fall in goods demand became much less pronounced than in services demand.\n\nThis development was most noticeable in the US. Despite the ongoing partial lockdown, US personal disposable income rose by 6.3% in 2020, due to fiscal support through the CARES Act to tackle economic implications of COVID-19. The act included recovery rebates and extra unemployment insurance benefits. However, a good part of the higher incomes was set aside as extra savings, and total US consumption decreased by around 4.6% in 2020. The consumption decline was entirely driven by services down by 7.3%, while goods consumption increased by 3.8%. The increase in US goods consumption drove up container demand in H2. In fact, North American container imports were 24% higher at the end of 2020, compared to the end of 2019. A similar division of growth between goods and services consumption\n\nwas recorded in Europe, although European COVID-19 restrictions were tougher and the increase in goods demand was more muted.\n\nGoing forward, it is highly uncertain if goods consumption will continue to drive up container demand. The support from higher household income may diminish as unemployment has remained high and consumer confidence is well below pre-COVID-19 levels. Moreover, a continuation of the massive fiscal support is uncertain in the near-term, particularly in the US, if political gridlock prolongs decision making. Finally, households' appetite for services, such as travelling, could initially take up a larger share of the wallet than usual if a vaccine becomes widely available and countries reopen later in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Growth improved to around 5% in Q4 2020, but the sharp contraction in Q2 led to a full-year negative growth of 2%, considerably weaker than in 2019. The 2020 slowdown reflected the broad-based crisis across all the main economies, although the H2 2020 recovery was faster than projections made during spring. The second wave of COVID-19 weighs on the early part of 2021, while the roll-out of an effective vaccine could have a positive impact on H2 2021.\n\nEffective supply growth was contained during the year, as the industry adjusted fleet capacity to the deteriorating demand, and market fundamentals were broadly balanced. However, a significant demand rebound in the US and partially in Europe\n\n## Chart 2\n\nGlobal container demand and nominal supply growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntogether with extensive equipment shortages drove up freight rates in H2, and freight rates increased by 18% compared to 2019.\n\n## COVID-19 and container demand\n\nContainer trade growth on the East-West trades declined by 2% in 2020 (table 1). European import growth from Asia was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in H1 and declined by 13%, first by lockdowns in China and later by lockdowns in Europe. The subsequent recovery in H2 was not strong enough to offset the initial decline. North American container imports from Asia also declined in H1 by 9.5%, but inventory restocking and a significant spike in US goods consumption fuelled by a housing boom and fiscal stimulus lifted full year import growth to around 4% in 2020. Asian imports from the US and Europe (East-West backhaul) showed a moderate decline during most quarters\n\nGlobal  container\n\ndemand\n\nNominal  supply\n\nEffective  supply\n\nSource: Demand and effective supply is internal Maersk and nominal supply is Alphaliner.\n\n## Chart 1\n\n## US consumption and North American container imports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDec Nov Oct Sep Aug Jul Jun May Apr Mar Feb Jan\n\nCCFI 2020\n\nCCFI 2019\n\nCCFI 2018\n\nSource: Thomson/Reuters.

North-South container trade dropped sharply in 2020. Latin American imports decreased by 9%, reflecting strong negative impact from COVID-19 in all major economies in the region. African imports decreased by 5%. Finally, intra- regional trades recorded a milder downturn, as mainly Intra-Asia with around 0% growth in 2020 proved fairly resistant to the global crisis.\n\nAs a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available during 2021, there is reason to believe that container demand will grow, possibly by 3-5% in 2021.",

        "page_content": "Particularly Q2 2021 will likely be high compared to Q2 2020 when country lockdowns were at their peak. However, there is substantial uncertainty about the container demand outlook in 2021. The strong goods demand that supported container volumes in 2020 could partially reverse if spending on services makes up for lost ground in 2021. Moreover, the continuation of adequate fiscal transfers in 2021 is uncertain. Finally, labour markets remain under pressure, and unemployment rates are still significantly higher than before the pandemic broke out. Upside potential mainly stems from further inventory restocking and a very fast and effective broadly distributed COVID-19 vaccine that stimulates broad-based recovery in labour markets, incomes, and business investment.\n\n## Container fleet supply\n\nThe global container fleet stood at 24m TEU at the end of 2020, 3% higher than at the end of 2019. Deliveries amounted to 856k TEU (135 vessels) and mainly entered the fleet in H2. 205k TEU were scrapped, with most deletions occurring in Q2 when container demand declined sharply. Idling totalled 1% (311 TEU) of the fleet at the end of 2020. The idle fleet had increased extensively in the beginning of the year as the container industry adjusted the active fleet to the very weak demand (chart 2). As demand recovered in Q3, the idle fleet was swiftly reactivated. Effective capacity declined 3% in 2020 (chart 2). 1,148 TEU were ordered in 2020, corresponding to orderbook-to-fleet ratio of 11% at the end of the year. According to Alphaliner, the nominal global container fleet will grow by 4% in 2021.\n\n## Ocean container market, annual growth(%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market demand growth\n\nTable 1\n\n| Growth % (Y/Y)     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Global market      | -/two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf       | /one.tf/period.tf/five.tf        |\n| East-West          | -/two.tf/period.tf/three.tf      | /one.tf/period.tf/three.tf       |\n| - Headhaul         | -/one.tf/period.tf/seven.tf      | /zero.tf/period.tf/six.tf        |\n| Asia-Europe        | -/four.tf/period.tf/two.tf       | /two.tf/period.tf/nine.tf        |\n| Asia-North America | /four.tf/period.tf/four.tf       | -/two.tf/period.tf/one.tf        |\n| - Backhaul         | -/three.tf/period.tf/six.tf      | /two.tf/period.tf/seven.tf       |\n| North-South        | -/four.tf/period.tf/one.tf       | /one.tf/period.tf/two.tf         |\n| Intra-regional     | -/zero.tf/period.tf/two.tf       | /two.tf/period.tf/one.tf         |\n\n## Key numbers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market demand\n\ngrowth The COVID-19 led contraction in Q2 was followed by strong recovery in H2\n\n## Freight rates\n\nConsumption pick-up and vessel and equipment shortages pushed freight rates higher\n\n## Container fleet supply\n\nWhile the nominal container fleet increased, adjustments to idling and blanked sailings led to a decline in the effective supply\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-/two.tf%\n\n+/one.tf/eight.tf%\n\n+/three.tf%",

        "page_content": "## Freight rates\n\nFreight rates, as measured by the China Composite Freight Index (CCFI), were on average 18% higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (chart 3). While global supply and demand was broadly balanced, the unprecedented demand pick-up on key headhaul trades such as Asia-US in H2 2020 together with vessel and equipment shortages and bottlenecks across the entire supply chain supported freight rates. Asia to US West Coast freight rates increased by 28%, and Asia to US East Coast rose by 18%. Freight rates also increased on the Asia to North Europe trades, albeit at a more moderate pace of 13%, but strengthened by 23% from Asia to Mediterranean Europe. Uncertainties relating to the strength of container demand continue to pose a risk to the developments of freight rates in 2021, including the normalisation of the situation with\n\nChart 4\n\nvessel and equipment shortages and bottlenecks across the entire supply chain experienced in the last part of 2020.\n\n## Bunker prices\n\nTowards the end of 2019, the industry's switch to 0.5% sulphur fuel oils amid a tight and nervous market pushed low sulphur fuel oil prices higher. High sulphur fuel oil prices in Singapore and Rotterdam hence declined by 33% and 29% from 2019 to 2020, respectively, as market supply and demand dynamics calmed and the pandemic spread worldwide, averaging USD 273/ tonne and USD 248/tonne in 2020. Similarly, low sulphur fuel oil prices fell by 34% and 37% in Singapore and Rotterdam from 2019 to 2020, averaging USD 371/tonne and USD 329/tonne, respectively. Lower sulphur 0.1%S marine gasoil prices\n\n2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfollowed the downwards trend as it dived 35% to USD 390/tonne in Singapore and 35% to USD 367/tonne in Rotterdam in 2020 over 2019. Fuel oil prices have not fallen as drastically as the rest of the refined oil products in light of the demand destruction from the global pandemic and are supported by the strong and robust container shipping industry.\n\nSingapore strengthened its position as the world's largest bunker port, with its total bunker sales increasing by an impressive 5% in 2020 amid a global pandemic and economic downturn. Bunker prices have experienced an extremely volatile period last year at the crux of the COVID-19-induced pandemic. The difference between the low sulphur 0.5% fuel oil and high sulphur 3.5% fuel oil spread, also known as the hi5, plunged drastically since the start of the year, but there are signs that the spread may pick up in 2021 with Singapore continuing to be the more active pricing centre followed by Rotterdam. A.P. Moller - Maersk expects further volatility in the fuel prices in major trading regions through mid-2021 during this uncertain period.\n\n## Terminals and Logistics & Services market update\n\nThe other transport and logistics markets were in broad terms impacted by the dynamics and market drivers that steered the ocean industry, above all the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Drewry, port throughput volumes decreased by 2.1% in 2020, with ports in most regions recording negative growth rates. In line with projections for ocean trade, global port throughput growth is expected to grow significantly in 2021. The container port industry continues to combat structural\n\n## North American container imports were 24% higher at the end of 2020, compared to the end of 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nchallenges stemming from the cascading of large container vessels, reinforced carrier alliances and capacity increases in many ports.\n\nThe large shifts in global trade volumes in 2020 also impacted the broader logistics segment. While the deterioration of trade and country lockdowns in H1 led to a volume decline in most segments, the subsequent recovery, above all in the US, supported volume activity in the freight forwarding market. The air forwarding market additionally gained from increased e-commerce trading during the lockdowns.",

Moller - Maersk's transformation from a conglomerate to the global integrator of container logistics.\n\n## pillars in the vision of becoming the global integrator of container logistics\n\n- 1 Creating a portfolio of end-to-end products/services\n- 2 Seamless customer engagement\n- 3 Superior delivery network end-to-end\n\nDespite the subversive effects of COVID-19 on the lives and business of A.P. Moller - Maersk employees and customers alike, the disciplined and consistent strategy execution continued and delivered tangible results through the year. Financial performance improved markedly, and previous year's efforts to improve customer service in general and digitisation in particu lar paid off. Through outstanding efforts from its front line per sonnel, not least from its seafarers, A.P. Moller - Maersk took pride in being able to sustain its global operation and keep global supply chains moving throughout the pandemic.\n\n3\n\n1\n\n## Creating a portfolio of end-to-end products/services\n\nAn important element of the global integrator strategy is to strengthen the logistics product portfolio, notably on the landside by improving and innovating existing products, as well as acquiring capabilities and product offerings through acquisitions. In 2020, A.P. Moller - Maersk strengthened its product offering to customers along the endto-end value chain.\n\nOn 1 April, A.P. Moller - Maersk closed the acquisition of Performance Team, a US-based warehousing and distribution company, which, combined with the 2019 acquisition of Vandegrift, a US-based customs services company, has meant a significant strengthening of the land-based logistics services to US customers. On 2 September, A.P. Moller - Maersk closed the acquisition of KGH Customs Services, a Sweden-based pan-European customs services provider, hereby enhancing the end-to-end offering to customers with European imports and exports. These acquisitions were part of a general upgrade and improvement of A.P. Moller - Maersk's Logistics & Services business, which through the year grew EBITDA to USD 470m or more than twice the size of 2019.\n\nThe Ocean product offering was also strengthened through 2020 as the Maersk Spot product, launched in Q2 2019, was rolled out globally and with its superior offering of transparent price and equipment guarantee, it saw strong uptake with customers. By the end of 2020, the Spot product made up 51% of the total loaded short-term, volumes under Maersk brand (excl. Sealand and Hamburg S\u00fcd), and is well under way to becoming A.P. Moller - Maersk's primary offering in the short-term market.",

Moller - Maersk is now offering a digital supply chain management tool for mid-size customers to improve their supply chain performance through better visibility and control of their shippers, carriers and shipments. This marked the entry into a customer segment A.P. Moller - Maersk has earlier struggled to serve well and which was extra challenged by the supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMaersk NeoNav, launched in December 2020, have significantly upgraded A.P. Moller - Maersk's capabilities in the supply chain planning and orchestration areas. With Maersk NeoNav, A.P. Moller - Maersk is among others able to connect customers' demand data with data on inventories and cargo flows and thus optimise these parts of the supply chain in near real time, leading to very significant value realisation. This innovative new product has been well received by customers with large, global supply chains and is currently in the implementation phase with two very large customers.\n\n## Twill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TradeLens\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n120 Ports and terminals\n\n## 50%\n\nOf the global Ocean market is covered by TradeLens\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore weekly volumes than the same period the previous year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2 Seamless customer engagement\n\nAdding more products is fundamental towards becoming the global integrator of container logistics, but equally important is the ability to combine these products into tailored customer value propositions, and more effectively serve the customers' needs, notably through digital solutions. The COVID-19 situation accelerated A.P. Moller - Maersk's customers' need for digital engagement and services, and A.P. Moller - Maersk benefited from previous investments into its technology stack, including maersk.com and other online offerings.\n\nTwill, a solution dedicated for small and mediumsized Ocean customers, ended the year with weekly bookings in excess of 6,000 FFE, which was more than 13 times the weekly volumes compared to the same period the previous year. In July, a new digital offering, Maersk Flow, was introduced for small and medium-sized customers and partners to take control of their supply chain from factory to market. In October, a new cloud-based supply chain management platform was launched, aimed at larger customers with complex supply chains. The new platform will replace A.P. Moller - Maersk's existing offering and provide more integrated services and solutions, high levels of automation, self-service opportunity, as well as improved analytical functionalities.\n\nAnother important platform and enabler of digitisation is TradeLens, the open and neutral supply chain platform underpinned by blockchain technology, which A.P. Moller - Maersk is developing jointly with IBM. In October, the world's second and third largest container carriers, MSC and CMA-CGM, announced that they were integrated onto TradeLens. This means that TradeLens now covers more than 50% of the global Ocean market. The other parts of the TradeLens ecosystem also grew in 2020 and now covers more than 120 ports/terminals, 24 customs authorities, and a growing inland presence.\n\nFrom an organisational perspective,\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk simplified its organisation in Ocean and Logistics further by streamlining the frontline organisation and integrating and closing down the Safmarine and Damco brands. Furthermore, A.P. Moller - Maersk initiated a re-organisation of the headquarter technology and commercial functions into a number of platforms, each delivering dedicated business and customer outcomes. This reorganisation marked a further integration of digital technology into the A.P. Moller - Maersk organisation and enables faster and more agile development of new products and services, as well as a quicker and more effective modernisation of legacy technology.\n\nCustomer satisfaction was impacted by the disruptive effects of COVID-19, but is now again increasing and has remained strong with key customers throughout the year.",

Moller - Maersk is a superior delivery network end-to-end, which delivers on fundamental needs for getting goods to the right place, at the right time, at the right price, with minimum environmental impact.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic stressed the global supply chains to a degree never experienced before. A.P. Moller - Maersk takes pride in being able to continue to serve its customers' global transportation needs and supply chains throughout the year under very difficult circumstances. A.P. Moller - Maersk was never closed for business.\n\n## CASE: PERFORMANCE TEAM\n\nOn 1 April 2020, A.P. Moller - Maersk closed the acquisition of Performance Team, which has further strengthened the capabilities of A.P.

A.P. Moller - Maersk was able to leverage its operational control of vessels, warehouses, and terminals and co-developed new innovative solutions and products with customers in response to the disruptions. The main customer problems typically related to speed and/or flexibility of the supply chain, and examples of new solutions were storage in transit, dedicated air charters, and seaborne e-commerce solutions.\n\na revenue of USD 398m and an EBITDA of USD 59m.

Interview with Jan Peacock, International Sales Manager at Isaac H. Grainger & Son Ltd.\n\nBy Jesper Toft Madsen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Can you tell me a bit about your business?\n\n\u00bb Isaac H. Grainger & Son Ltd. is a 150-year-old manufacturing company based outside Birmingham in the UK. We manufacture metal products for Raised Access Flooring, which is the type of floor you're standing on in your office so that you can plug your computers into the floor or install air conditioning rather than cables coming down the wall. We manufacture this product in the UK and in India, and it's used around Europe.\n\n## What are your biggest pain points when it comes to transport and logistics?\n\n- \u00bb To manufacture the full flooring system, we need to ship products from the UK to Spain and\n\nfrom India to the UK and Spain. That's where seamless, door-to-door shipping becomes very important.\n\n\u00bb We're not a huge customer that ships thousands of containers and has a fixed contract. We order containers as we need them, and the biggest issue for us has been reliability as we operate with a door-to-door policy. This means that if a customer wants a container, we need to tell them the cost of the product, the transportation cost and the arrival date. The biggest problem has been to get a price as this could take as long as two weeks via an agent or freight forwarder. The delivery was also very hard to track and manage when it wasn't on a vessel. Twill solved these problems.\n\n' Our specialty is manufacturing steel products and that's where I want to spend my time.'\n\nJan Peacock, International Sales Manager at Isaac H. Grainger & Son Ltd.\n\n## What you need to know about Twill\n\n- \u00b7 Twill is a tailor-made, endto-end customer experience built to serve small and medium-sized businesses\n- \u00b7 The current solution includes ocean, intermodal, customs house brokerage and value protect (insurance), and all can be booked and managed online\n- \u00b7 Twill is live in 154 countries\n\nIn 2020, more than 2,500 new customers booked on Twill with volumes exceeding 100,000 FFE, representing a 13 fold year-overyear growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The customers don't care if we manufacture in the UK or in India, they just want their product delivered to the construction site on time.\n\n## How far can platforms such as Twill take you in overcoming these challenges?\n\n\u00bb The platform is very useful. If I log into Twill today, I should be able to, let's say ship a container in ten days' time from India to our factory outside Madrid, Spain, by checking the available ships and the price.\n\n- \u00bb If our factory manager in India says we're able to ship a bit earlier, I can do this via the platform rather than having to call someone and wait for confirmation. This flexibility is very important to us because we save time and hassle. Shipping should be like Amazon, that's the standard these days. Twill knows who you are, you make your booking, get confirmation and my guys in India can log in and talk to their Twill contact locally - it's a smooth system.\n- \u00bb Our specialty is not logistics. In the past, we spent 10-15% of our time chasing logistics. Our specialty is manufacturing steel products and that's where I want to spend my time. That's why I'm enthusiastic about Twill as there wasn't anything like it when it came. It's like Amazon for shipping.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nIn an unprecedented year of pandemic, sustainability remained at the top of the agenda of A.P. Moller - Maersk and core to the its values. Efforts on decarbonisation are being intensified while integrating sustainability even further into business strategy.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's sustainability efforts have matured over the last decade with increasing ambitions matching the maturity of the field and the expectations of leading customers. A.P. Moller - Maersk wants to take responsibility in line with the company's values and commitments, and to assume a leadership position on global issues where the competencies and leverage are sufficient to make a real difference.\n\nIn 2020, this approach led to a review of the sustainability strategy, customer expectations, climate scenarios and transition pathways. As a result, ambitions on sustainability are being intensified with decarbonisation as the single-most important strategic sustainability imperative, and further integrating sustainability priorities in A.P. Moller - Maersk's global integrator strategy.\n\nContinued acceleration of expectations from key stakeholders for companies to manage their impact on sustainability was seen in 2020. The financial community is asking companies to demonstrate credible decarbonisation plans that align with the Paris Agreement's 1.5 target\n\nacross the full supply chain, considering the physical effects of climate change and securing a viable business for the future.\n\nThis is true not only for A.P. Moller - Maersk, but for customers as well, as they convert the financial sector demands on their business, and the opportunities they see for carbon-neutral products in the consumer market, into requirements for A.P. Moller - Maersk to deliver a decarbonised supply chain solution. Today, 90 of the 200 most important customers have set or are in the process of setting ambitious science-based or zero carbon targets covering their supply chain.\n\nFurthermore, lawmakers - particularly the EU are moving rapidly on legislation related to sustainability, also on issues beyond climate change and decarbonisation. For example, the EU is enacting the taxonomy on sustainable activities, which through demands on the financial community will push requirements for transparency and reliable data on to other sectors, and it is expected to introduce mandatory requirements for companies to conduct social and environmental due diligence in their supply chains.\n\n## Our commitments on decarbonisation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/two.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/zero.tf Net-zero CO/uni2082 emissions from ocean operations by 2050\n\n- 1 Relative  CO/uni2082 reduction is measured using EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator) as defined by IMO in MEPC.1/Circ.684 and calculated as g CO/uni2082/(tonne x NM).

Moller - Maersk and this landscape of expectations were driving forces behind the decision to fully integrate sustainability into business activities, which was announced at the end of 2019. To fully deliver on sustainability as a strategic imperative, responsibilities must be embedded in the business and owned by business leaders. Governance and organisational structures that correspond with this decision have been established, including a dedicated decarbonisation function.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe aim to connect 50% of global containerised trade to digital solutions that reduce supply chain barriers.\n\n## Enabling sustainable trade\n\nSustainability priorities for the global integrator\n\n## Decarbonising logistics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability in our end-to-end offerings\n\nResponsible business practices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decarbonising logistics\n\nAs an industry leader and with the resources available at hand, A.P. Moller - Maersk has an obligation to do what it can to get to a carbon-neutral fleet as fast as possible, and to help customers decarbonise global supply chains end-to-end.\n\nVessel decarbonisation is beyond comparison the area with the greatest direct impact. The majority of efforts and investments in the near future will be on decarbonising ocean activities, as this holds the potential for the greatest impact and market leadership that enables setting the direction for an entire industry. However, expanding customer offerings in line with being the global integrator also makes it necessary to identify how the endto-end supply chain can be decarbonised.\n\nThe decarbonisation strategy spans across three complementary pathways:\n\n## Building a market for carbon-neutral shipping\n\nBuilding on customers' increasing momentum, integration of a new commercial strategy on sustainability began, aiming to respond to and aid customers on their decarbonisation journey.\n\nOne key feature in this is the Maersk ECO Delivery product. Launched in 2019, it remains one of only a few options for carbon-neutral shipping on the global market so far. Read more about the product on page 40.\n\nSustainability priorities for the global integrator strategy were defined in 2020: Enabling sustainable trade by decarbonising logistics, sustainability in our end-to-end offerings and responsible business practices. Taking leadership on decarbonisation of logistics is the single-most important strategic sustainability priority for A.P. Moller - Maersk, as decarbonisation of the fleet is the area beyond comparison with the greatest potential for impact. Furthermore, A.P. Moller - Maersk aims to increase focus on sustainability in end-to-end offerings in response to the increased responsibility and opportunity to manage supply chain risks for customers as part of its global integrator business strategy. Commitments on inclusive trade, food loss and ship recycling are now fully owned and driven in the line of business. Responsible business practices continue to form the strong foundation including solid governance structures, accountability and transparency on policies, commitments and performance across sustainability issues.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's business activities  enable open, inclusive and sustainable global trade, and the company continues to actively engage in the global debate through advocacy, projects and partnerships. Even more importantly still more elements are being added to the products and services offered that can ease the access of SMEs to participate in and benefit from global trade. A.P. Moller - Maersk's work on helping to halve food loss during transportation is run as an integrated part of the Cold Chain Logistics business of A.P. Moller - Maersk, focusing on developing and scaling solutions to connect and integrate customers' cold chains. This area now covers several hundred customers across nearly 50 countries. Investments made by the company's venture arm, Maersk Growth, also contribute to the overall sustainable development goal of reducing food loss.",

Driven by the end-consumers' increased willingness to pay for sustainability, and growing climate urgency, this represents a solid contribution to the development of a business model for decarbonised logistics and transport. A multi-tier value proposition has been developed, as a way to respond to relevant customer needs aligned with their maturity and ambition level for carbon reductions, and building stronger ties and partnerships with the group of customers who also have ambitious decarbonisation strategies.\n\n## Technology: The future of fuels\n\nIn the past two years extensive analyses of the available technology and fuel options for netzero operations have been conducted. Based on this work, four primary pathways are being pursued, as seen in the table.\n\nIn response to the increased urgency of delivering on decarbonisation, A.P. Moller - Maersk's position is that the right thing to do is to leapfrog to pure net-zero vessel technology without any transitional technologies.\n\nFuel transformation involves the entire supply chain, and part of the work consists of overcoming barriers to progress, including scaling fuel production and associated technology, lack of fuel infrastructure and safety related issues, while managing the impact on company profitability.\n\n## Policies: The need for broad-based action\n\nThe final piece of the decarbonisation strategy relates to the policy frameworks established to further this process. Policies must not only secure that lowest performers are held accountable, but also that first movers are rewarded for the risks taken on behalf of the whole industry.\n\nWith very few exceptions the political and thus legislative debate is currently not moving fast enough to fulfil its role. A.P. Moller - Maersk advocate for more ambitious targets in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and for lawmakers to build incentive structures that reward first movers and remove a share of the financial risk related to decarbonisation. There is a risk that regulators are out of sync with the progress and development pushed by industry, which would be to no one's benefit.\n\nAt regional level, there is no doubt that shipping will be part of the EU Emissions Trading System within a few years. However, this needs to be done with the objective of actually lowering shipping emissions and with a view to supporting an international greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction agreement, while still supporting modal shift of cargo to sea, which will remain the most sustainable way of transporting large quantities of cargo.\n\n## Frontline heroes stuck at sea\n\nEnabling global trade has been A.P. Moller - Maersk's finest task for decades. In extraordinary circumstan ces, due to the COVID-19\n\npandemic, A.P. Moller - Maersk employees across the world have gone to extraordinary lengths during 2020 to keep goods moving freely from the start of the pandemic.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's executive leadership established that the company's focus during the COVID-19 crisis would be on three priorities: Protecting our people, supporting our customers, and helping society get through the crisis.\n\nEveryone's safety was sought to be ensured by enabling employees to work from home wherever possible, providing personal protection equipment, and changing procedures to allow for adequate disinfection of equipment in for example port terminals. The greatest challenge has been for seafarers.\n\nNormally, a crew member stays on a vessel from two to six months. The Maritime Labour Convention states that crews can spend a maximum of 11 months on board. These norms were broken in 2020, as crew changes were made impossible by restrictions on entry to countries and travel restrictions. At its highest point, more than 2,500 out of 6,000 colleagues could not be relieved of their duties.\n\nThe challenge was brought to the highest levels at the UN and IMO as well as to legislators and NGOs, and agreements with governments, airlines, airport operators, hotels and port authorities were established to enable crews to have essential worker status and safely travel to and from major port hubs with major international airports, including special A.P. Moller - Maersk charter flights. Company quarantine safe centres were created in strategic locations as well as hubs for local quarantine in high volume areas. These measures helped seafarers reach their destination and by the end of the year overdue crew members were relieved.",

        "page_content": "To help society in the fight against the pandemic, the capabilities and partnerships of A.P. Moller - Maersk, including the Logistics Emergency Team, were put to use to support communities, countries and regions. The company also endorsed a World Economic Forum charter in support of safe and sustainable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally. A.P. Moller - Maersk is heavily involved in developing a global plan for distribution of vaccines, with planning for large-scale distribution beginning in the summer of 2020, including the establishment of a global logistics partnership with COVAXX to distribute up to a billion doses of the COVAXX vaccine worldwide in 2021.\n\n## Safety differently\n\nIntegrating the updated approach to safety across the company continued with positive examples of progress and true mitigation of risks to human health through new processes of collaboration and deliberation.\n\nIn 2020, the safety organisation was reorganised to reinforce that A.P. Moller - Maersk has one and only one safety strategy, which is implemented and enforced equally across the company. The new central Safety and Resilience team creates a strong pool of resources and tools, including\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimplementation support available at all levels across the company. In this way, the integrated company that A.P. Moller - Maersk is becoming is being matched and mirrored, assuring customers that when they leave their supply chain obligations in the hands of A.P. Moller - Maersk, the capacity for safe operations is in place.\n\nDeeply regrettable, one person lost his life while performing tasks under A.P. Moller - Maersk management, when a roofer working for a contractor fell as scaffolding collapsed after being hit by a crane that tipped. This tragic event reinforces the company's commitment to working more with suppliers on safety and sustainability issues.\n\n## Commitment to responsible ship recycling\n\nFour years after the first A.P. Moller - Maersk vessel landed in a ship recycling yard in Alang, India, an impact study clearly demonstrated very significant improvements in safety, environment, workers' conditions and access to health in the wider community. The ambition is to create responsible ship recycling opportunities that are also commercially viable for the ship owners and changing the ship recycling industry at the same time.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk worked towards three key priorities during the COVID-19 crisis: Protecting our people, supporting our customers, and helping society to get through the crisis.\n\nThe prospect of broad, sustained change is, however, challenged. No yards from the Alang area - despite collaboration with the EU Commission and investments over the past two years - have yet been included in the EU List of yards outside the OECD that can be legally used for recycling of ships registered in EU countries. In addition, a new legislative barrier has arisen, because legislation has come into force that prohibits exporting of hazardous waste from a list of OECD countries to developing (non-OECD) countries, which some, including the EU Commission, are applying to vessels for recycling. This has currently stalled the Alang yard applications and now awaits an internationally negotiated resolution of this regulatory challenge.\n\nThis situation is highly detrimental to the developments in Alang, as well as to ship owners. A.P. Moller - Maersk's position, based on thorough legislative analysis, is that there are legal options available to the EU, and the company is engaging with a multitude of stakeholders to find both a short and long-term solution to this gridlock.\n\nA further challenge is that within the next few years, even larger vessels than today will be nearing end of life and ready for recycling, but these vessels will be too large for many of the yards offering financially viable solutions.\n\nBecause the work in Alang documents that responsible ship recycling is possible outside yards in OECD countries, A.P. Moller - Maersk's ambition for the work on ship recycling has changed from radically changing the industry, starting in Alang, to creating opportunities for responsible ship recycling globally.\n\n## IMO 2020 conversion successful\n\nFrom January 2020, the IMO's 0.5% global cap on the content of sulphur in fuels came into effect. The enforcement mechanism for this legislation is a ban on carrying non-compliant fuels on vessels, except for vessels where scrubbers are installed to clean exhaust gasses.\n\nThe main concern in the years leading up to the cap taking effect was uneven enforcement. While the level of control is not as stringent as A.P. Moller - Maersk would prefer, there is no indication that compliance is lacking. Oil market shares are a useful proxy for this, and it appears that the low-sulphur fuel uptake is at the expected level.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has installed open-loop scrubbers on a share of the vessels as a risk management measure, as the price gap between heavy fuel oil and low-sulphur fuel was expected to be significant. The use of scrubbers remains a discussion point and no independent, global survey of the effects of scrubbers has yet been produced to support global legislation. Increasingly, legislation is being implemented regionally, for example in the EU and in some US states and Australia, requiring vessels to shut off the scrubber system when entering near-coastal waters and switch to low-sulphur fuel.\n\nThe A.P. Moller - Maersk 2020 Sustainability Report provides more information about the work and progress on sustainability priorities. For an overview of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance data including Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Task force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) indices, please see the 2020 ESG data overview on A.P.

Moller - Maersk's strategy to become a global integrator of container logistics hinges on the ability to deliver a superior service level to customers. A.P. Moller - Maersk needs to deliver operationally on the service level promised to customers in order to build long-term trust and brand reliability.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's growth strategy is dependent on its ability to transform its digital foundation. If there is serious delay or failure to modernise  tech nology,  execute  the  Tech nology roadmap, and standardise core business processes, there is a risk that Maersk is unable to orchestrate value and stable revenue streams via its technology platforms.\n\nAs A.P. Moller - Maersk becomes increasingly digitalised, more devices and control systems are connected online resulting in a wider technology surface across the Information Technology and Operational Technology infrastructure, which could be compromised. Should a successful cyber attack materialise, operational disruption and/ or data breaches may occur.\n\nThe delivery promise introduced as part of the integrator strategy is key to building customer trust and thereby retaining strong brand reputation of A.P. Moller - Maersk. Not being able to deliver operationally can weaken the foundation of the A.P. Moller - Maersk global integrator strategy.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is permanently improving its business processes and systems to deliver on the new delivery promises. In addition, the service levels are continuously monitored for swift actions to mitigate adverse developments, and business continuity strategies are designed and rolled out to withstand operational disruptions.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has prioritised technology modernisation, standardisation of core business processes and development of data as a differentiating asset. To achieve the right customer and business outcomes, A.P. Moller - Maersk is transforming the engagement model between Technology and business platform owners to drive greater cross functional collaboration and accountability.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has made progress on its technology roadmap and standardisation of its core business processes. However, since A.P. Moller - Maersk is expanding into new business areas, the business processes and workflows are complex, and the current IT landscape is fragmented, it is likely that A.P. Moller - Maersk will see some delays, as it progresses the road map.\n\nFollowing the cyberattack in 2017 several measures to improve cyber security have been implemented. However, as the external threat continues to develop, a cyberattack could still occur leading to financial losses, loss of customer confidence, reputational damage, regulatory sanctions for data breaches, and/or operational accidents.\n\nAnother downturn of the Ocean industry over the coming years could become a distraction to A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy execution and hamper its ability to invest. If the risk materialises, A.P. Moller - Maersk may be forced to focus on improving its short-term financial performance.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has over the years continued to have accidents, some of which have unfortunately had very serious and even fatal outcomes. This not only causes business disruption and affects A.P. Moller - Maersk's name and reputation, but more importantly brings into focus the duty of care towards people.\n\nCurrent mitigation includes a cyber security programme, business continuity plans, and cyber-risk insurance. The initial three-year cyber security program was completed in 2020. The next phase to further mitigate the threat associated with the enhanced digital interface with customers is already underway.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has limited levers to impact the overall demand for container shipping. However, multiple mitigation strategies exist, such as closely monitoring supply and demand, de-commoditising products and services, focus on cost leadership, and growing Logistics & Services to reduce the exposure to Ocean volatility.\n\nA new Safety & Resilience function has been established to combine knowledge and expertise in this area, have a unified strategy around the topic, embed the strategy through a leader-led approach across the organisation and through management of critical risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTechnology roadmap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCyber-attack\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOcean  industry collapse\n\nAlthough there have been signs of structural improvements in the Ocean segment, there is still a non-negligible risk that the Ocean industry could again become financially challenged in another downturn cycle.\n\nThe business of A.P. Moller - Maersk requires many of the employees and other external contractors to work in high-risk locations both in terms of frontline operations as well as in terms of working in geographical areas with elevated risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople  safety and security",

Acquiring new capabilities is a prerequisite to serve customers endto-end, and A.P. Moller - Maersk will need to make acquisitions in the coming years.\n\nSome of the acquisitions may be substantial, and if A.P. Moller - Maersk fails to integrate one or more of these, it will create a risk to successfully executing the A.P. Moller - Maersk inte grator strategy.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has made a commitment of carbon neutrality by 2050. With increasing demand from customers and investors, A.P. Moller - Maersk needs to further innovate sustainable supply chain solutions and accelerate its decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk made good progress in acquiring new and diverse capabilities and skills, especially for Logistics & Services and Technology. Still, the strategy execution could be hampered if the right balance of capabilities and skills are not maintained at all levels of the organisation.\n\nA post-merger integration office has been established to develop and manage integration processes and embed learnings. Integration capabilities have been upskilled through external sourcing. Further actions are planned to develop seamless transition between acquisition and integration activities, with clear accountabilities and business ownership.\n\nIn 2020, a strategic review of climate scenarios and transition pathways was conducted with the conclusion that climate action is a strategic imperative for A.P. Moller - Maersk. Consequently, a new Decarbonisation function has been launched in 2021 to further embed and accelerate the decarbonisation agenda, including coordinating the efforts to reduce the climate impact of operations and developing relevant customer offerings.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk Capability Framework was established to define key organisational capabilities to support strategic goals. Further actions are in progress to build/buy competencies through functional and leadership programmes and targeted recruitment campaigns.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has a robust compliance programme for anti-corruption, competition law and economic sanctions, and export controls designed to fulfil the global requirements and many initiatives are in place to improve focus and emphasis on compliance awareness and training.\n\nActions were launched to assess and address employee engagement levels on a more frequent basis. Further initiatives will be launched to further strengthen the A.P. Moller - Maersk behaviours and elevate the company culture.\n\nOrganisational capabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDecarbonisation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDecarbonisation is becoming a business necessity and a license to operate. It is critical for A.P. Moller - Maersk to decarbonise the end-to-end supply chain at a speed that meets customers' and investors' expectations. Primary focus is the decarbonisation of own emissions.\n\nDelivering a digitally transformed business model as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's global inte grator strategy requires right balance of capabilities and skills at all levels in the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is imperative for A.P. Moller - Maersk to conduct its business in compliance with legislation and regulatory standards. The regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly complex, and A.P. Moller - Maersk could be hit by a major compliance case in respect of violations of anti-corruption laws, antitrust regulations, and/or international sanctions.\n\nThe A.P. Moller - Maersk culture is strong with many elements that must be retained. These strong cultural elements were critical in getting through the cyberattack in 2017 and most recently in the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is a need to change and adapt parts of this culture and to further enhance employee engagement to support the transformed business model.\n\nIn respect of corruption, A.P. Moller - Maersk operates in highrisk geographies and high-risk sectors (e.g. the terminals and logistics services sectors). A.P. Moller - Maersk is the largest container carrier and in an industry with many industry cooperation agreements. A.P. Moller - Maersk thereby naturally has the attention of com petition authorities globally.\n\nMost notably, customer centricity is a cultural attribute, which must be honed to a different level than today. Another element that must be further cultivated is the ability to work across functions with shared ownership and accountability for outcomes.\n\nCompany  culture and engagement",

EBITDA increased to USD 6.5bn (USD 4.4bn), yielding an EBITDA margin of 22.4% (15.4%). Profitability improved in 2020 as a result of higher rates, lower costs and timely responses to changing market conditions where agile capacity deployment was executed to meet both mid-year global demand downturn and demand surges towards the end of the year. The average loaded freight rate increased by 7.9% due to short-term rate increases, and total operating costs decreased by 5.8% from improved cost management, higher utilisation and lower bunker cost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOcean has actively deployed capacity to accommodate the significant demand fluctuations by withdrawing in H1 and increasing in H2, which helped mitigate the worsened schedule reliability caused by the global supply chain disruptions to service Ocean customers best possible.\n\nMaersk Spot gained significant momentum in 2020 and, measured on the last four weeks in 2020, accounted for 51% (20%) of total loaded short-term volume under the Maersk brand.\n\nLogistics & Services reported a revenue of USD 7.0bn (USD 6.3bn), driven by increasing revenue in warehousing and distribution including Performance Team, air freight forwarding and supply chain management, offset by decrease in intermodal and sea freight forwarding. Gross profit grew to USD 1.6bn (USD 1.2bn) reflecting a gross profit margin of 23% (20%) with margins improving throughout the year. The improvement was supported by margin optimisation in especially intermodal and warehousing and distribution and effects from the acquisition of Performance Team, partially offset by lower margins in supply chain management. EBITDA increased to USD 454m (USD 216m).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir freight forwarding and less container load (LCL) products was integrated into Maersk logistics and services to complement the end-to-end offering effective as of October.

In gateway terminals, revenue decreased with lower volumes due to COVID-19. EBITDA increased to USD 989m (USD 913m), mainly driven by consolidation of Pipavav, India, and cost savings partly offset by lower volumes. The decrease in volumes of 3.6% was driven by lower volume of 1.2% from the Ocean segment and 4.9% from external customers. Towage reported a revenue of USD 681m (USD 695m), with an EBITDA of USD 216m (USD 205m), mainly due to lower costs, aligned to the strategic growth initiatives launched in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll terminals remained operational through out the COVID-19 pandemic. The new terminal in Vado, Italy, began operations in Q1 and the terminal in Tema, Ghana, ramped up during 2020.\n\nTowage signed new contracts and negotiated extensions to existing contracts. Operations were updated with new locations and planned exit of others.\n\nManufacturing & Others revenue decreased to USD 1.3bn (USD 1.4bn) while EBITDA increased to USD 165m (USD 136m). Maersk Container Industry EBITDA increased to USD 77m (USD 29m), which was the strongest financial year of its core marine reefer business. Maersk Supply Service EBITDA decreased to USD 21m (USD 28m), reflecting lower activity offset by cost reductions. For other businesses, revenue was USD 415m (USD 484m), and EBITDA was USD 66m (USD 80m).\n\nMaersk Container Industry saw higher Star Cool Unit sales compensating for lost Star Cool Integrated production in Q1 due to COVID-19 and achieved the highest ever third-party unit bookings total.\n\nMaersk Supply Service was awarded several contracts in the North Sea and Africa for its integrated solution service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLogistics & Services\n\nTerminals & Towage\n\n## Manufacturing & Others\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Volumes were 5.0% lower at 12,634k FFE (13,296k FFE) due to COVID-19, predominantly in Q2, mainly due to decreases in East-West and North-South trades. The decrease in East-West was driven by Europe and Middle East trades, while North America saw higher volumes in H2 2020. The decrease in North-South was driven by the weak demand across Latin America, Africa and Oceania trades. Total headhaul decreased by 4.3%, mainly for Latin America, Europe and Middle East, while total backhaul decreased by 6.3%.\n\nThe average loaded freight rate increased by 7.9% to 2,000 USD/FFE (1,853 USD/FFE), driven by an increase of 14.1% on East-West supported by strong demand, vessel and equipment shortages and bottlenecks across the entire supply chain. On North-South the average freight rates increased by 7.8%, driven by headhaul increase in Latin America and Africa combined with higher backhaul rates in Oceania. The rate increases on East-West and North-South trades were partly offset by lower rates on intra- regional trades driven by a 7.0% decrease in intra-Americas rates. The average loaded freight rate was positively impacted by mix effects from relatively higher headhaul volumes especially in North America and negatively affected by developments in foreign exchange rate and the bunker price change. The average loaded freight rate at fixed bunker increased by 9.8%.\n\nFreight revenue was USD 24.9bn (USD 24.5bn), while other revenue was flat at USD 4.3bn (USD 4.3bn). Adjusted for the foreign exchange rate effects, the freight revenue increased by 2.4%.\n\n## Loaded volumes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| FFE ('/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf)   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                  | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                  | Change                     | Change %                    |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| East-West                         | /five.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/eight.tf      | /six.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf         | -/two.tf/four.tf/six.tf    | -/four.tf/period.tf/zero.tf |\n| North-South                       | /three.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf      | /four.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/six.tf/eight.tf        | -/three.tf/six.tf/eight.tf | -/eight.tf/period.tf/six.tf |\n| Intra-regional                    | /two.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf/six.tf       | /two.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/three.tf/four.tf      | -/four.tf/eight.tf         | -/one.tf/period.tf/seven.tf |\n| Total                             | /one.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/nine.tf/six.tf | -/six.tf/six.tf/two.tf     | -/five.tf/period.tf/zero.tf |\n\n## Average freight rates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| USD/FFE        | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf            | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf             | Change                   | Change %                         |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| East-West      | /two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/six.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/four.tf/eight.tf | /one.tf/four.tf/period.tf/one.tf |\n| North-South    | /two.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/two.tf/nine.tf   | /two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/four.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf/eight.tf/two.tf  | /seven.tf/period.tf/eight.tf     |\n| Intra-regional | /one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/four.tf/five.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/six.tf/six.tf    | -/two.tf/one.tf          | -/one.tf/period.tf/five.tf       |\n| Total          | /two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf  | /one.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/five.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/four.tf/seven.tf | /seven.tf/period.tf/nine.tf      |\n\n## Unit cost at EBIT level (based on a fixed bunker price)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cost split % EBITDA level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnit cost fixed at 450 USD/tonne\n\nUnit cost at fixed bunker price was 1.0% above 2019, despite a reduction in total operating costs.

In 2019, A.P. Moller - Maersk was the first to launch a carbon-neutral solution for ocean transport, Maersk ECO Delivery, based on sustainable biofuel from waste sources such as used cooking oil. It provides direct carbon savings, not carbon offsets, by ensuring that for any Maersk ECO Delivery container transport, enough sustainable biofuel will be purchased and used in the A.P. Moller - Maersk network to neutralise the carbon emissions that would have occurred using standard fuel. These CO/uni2082 savings are allocated to the customer and verified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials.\n\nIn 2020, customer uptake of Maersk ECO Delivery exceeded expectations. So far, around ten major customers have chosen to purchase this carbon-neutral emissions transport solution, and this number is expected to increase. Conversations with customers on the possibility of converting all their shipments to the Maersk ECO delivery product are ongoing. While this is very promising, it represents a small share of the total amount of containers transported by A.P. Moller - Maersk, and we need much more customer demand to scale net-zero emissions offerings and enable a transition to full decarbonisation.\n\nCustomer uptake of Maersk ECO Delivery exceeded expectations in 2020\n\nshare of total costs, while network costs, excluding bunker increased slightly.\n\nTotal unit cost decreased by 0.7% to 1,909 USD/ FFE (1,922 USD/FFE), driven by a decrease in fuel cost caused by a 6.9% lower consumption and a decreased average bunker price of 9.7%, equal\n\nto 40 USD/tonne. The combined effect of lower average prices and lower consumption resulted in a total bunker cost decrease of 16% to USD 3.8bn (USD 4.6bn). Out of the total decrease, USD 0.5bn was due to the lower average bunker price, with the remaining decrease due to lower consumption partly, given a 0.8% improvement in bunker\n\n<!-- image -->",

Q2 saw a significant decrease in volumes and major changes to the fleet were applied to adjust capacity to the impact of global lockdown of economies. From Q3, unexpected pick-up in demand on some routes resulted in strong pricing dynamics, with bottlenecks and space access combined with vessel and equipment shortages becoming a challenge for most customers. Additional flexibility was provided, focusing on long-term customers to cater for additional demand, despite the strong short-term freight rate market, while adding extra capacity to accommodate volumes.\n\nIn H2, strategic changes were announced in order to further enhance the customer experience and end-to-end service delivery. Safmarine will no longer be marketed as a separate brand, as A.P. Moller - Maersk and Safmarine have converged, both focusing on building a customer-centric culture with digital interactions. While continuing to meet customers as two separate brands with a differentiated service model, the front offices of A.P. Moller - Maersk and Hamburg S\u00fcd will come closer together into more customer- centric teams.\n\nMaersk Spot, launched in Q2 2019 offering transparent prices and loading guarantee, gained significant momentum in 2020, growing its share of loaded short-term volumes consistently. On a four-week average basis, Maersk Spot volumes at year-end were 51% of the total loaded short-term volumes under A.P. Moller - Maersk brand (excl. Sealand and Hamburg S\u00fcd).",

Volumes in air freight forwarding declined by 13% to 138k tonnes (158k tonnes) and declined by 16% in sea freight forwarding to 401k TEU (475k TEU), impacted by COVID-19 and the discontinuation of the Damco brand.\n\n## Logistics & Services highlights\n\n| USD million                                                                                                 | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                                                                                                     | /six.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/six.tf/three.tf                   | /six.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/three.tf/one.tf                 |\n| Direct cost                                                                                                 | /five.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                 | /five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf/one.tf                  |\n| Gross profit                                                                                                | /one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/three.tf/five.tf                   | /one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/four.tf/zero.tf                   |\n| Selling/comma.tf General & Administration (SG&A) and other costs/comma.tf etc/period.tf                     | /one.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/eight.tf/one.tf                    | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/four.tf                   |\n| Profit/loss before depreciation/comma.tf amortisation and impairment losses/comma.tf etc/period.tf (EBITDA) | /four.tf/five.tf/four.tf                                   | /two.tf/one.tf/six.tf                                     |\n| EBITDA margin                                                                                               | /six.tf/period.tf/five.tf%                                 | /three.tf/period.tf/four.tf%                              |\n| Gross capital expenditure/comma.tf excl/period.tf acquisitions and divestments (CAPEX)                      | /one.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf                                    | /one.tf/two.tf/six.tf                                     |\n| Operational and /financial metrics                                                                          |                                                            |                                                           |\n| EBIT conversion (EBIT/gross profit - %)                                                                     | /one.tf/six.tf/period.tf/one.tf%                           | /one.tf/period.tf/five.tf%                                |\n| Supply chain management volumes ('/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf cbm)                                             | /seven.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf        | /seven.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/six.tf/four.tf           |\n| Intermodal volumes (kFFE)                                                                                   | /three.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/four.tf/zero.tf                  | /three.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf              |\n| Sea freight volumes (TEU)                                                                                   | /four.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/six.tf/nine.tf   | /four.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/one.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Air freight volumes (tonne)                                                                                 | /one.tf/three.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/six.tf | /one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/zero.tf/five.tf |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRevenue\n\nUSD /six.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/six.tf/three.tfm USD /six.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/three.tf/one.tfm\n\nEBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCAPEX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLogistics & Services is the core growth element of A.P.

Profitability improved in intermodal, driven by the ongoing margin optimisation and better corridor mix with an increase in gross profit of 75% to USD 296m (USD 169m). The operational efficiencies are mainly achieved by focus on higher margin corridors and lower cost from less imbalance between import and export in North America, West Central Asia and Europe.\n\nIn air freight forwarding, revenue was up 61% to USD 780m (USD 485m) and gross profit was up 66% to USD 88m (USD 53m). Profitability increased despite a volume decrease, driven by the continued high rates in Asia Pacific, where urgent air freight solutions were developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOther services revenue and gross profit increased, driven by positive contribution from warehousing and distribution including the activity from Performance Team in North America with a revenue of USD 398m and an EBITDA of USD 59m. This is a result of a significant turnaround of the US based sites during 2020. While increased handling volume was a positive contributing factor, the combined effect of automation investment in sorters and the deployment of operation excellence expertise acquired via Per formance Team heavily contributed to strong profitability in the core US facilities, notably Santa Fe, Southgate, and Sumner.

Further, 2019 was impacted by impairment, reducing the EBIT for Logistics & Services in December.\n\n## Revenue and gross profit\n\n|                         | Revenue                                   | Revenue                                  | Gross profit /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | Gross profit /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf            | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf           | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                |                                               |\n| Intermodal              | /two.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/two.tf | /two.tf/nine.tf/six.tf                        | /one.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                        |\n| Supply chain management | /nine.tf/six.tf/one.tf                    | /eight.tf/six.tf/one.tf                  | /three.tf/five.tf/zero.tf                     | /three.tf/four.tf/zero.tf                     |\n| Inland services         | /five.tf/two.tf/seven.tf                  | /five.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                  | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf                        | /two.tf/one.tf/zero.tf                        |\n| Sea freight forwarding  | /four.tf/six.tf/zero.tf                   | /five.tf/four.tf/six.tf                  | /six.tf/two.tf                                | /eight.tf/six.tf                              |\n| Air freight forwarding  | /seven.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf                | /four.tf/eight.tf/five.tf                | /eight.tf/eight.tf                            | /five.tf/three.tf                             |\n| Other services          | /one.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf  | /nine.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf               | /six.tf/three.tf/eight.tf                     | /three.tf/eight.tf/two.tf                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key initiatives 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFreight forwarding integration\n\nPerformance Team and KGH Customs Services\n\nEnd-to-end offerings\n\nThe integration of Damco's air freight and less container load (LCL) products into the Maersk logistics and services products to complement the end-to-end offering was effective as of 1 October.

The acquisition more than doubles the combined warehousing and distribution presence in the North America region, bringing enhanced scale and expertise for the combined customers.\n\nKGH Customs Services was acquired in September. The acquisition increases the combined number of clearances by five times in the Europe region, allowing for a larger footprint and enhanced ability to service customers end-to-end.\n\nThe product offering has expanded by adding Maersk Cargo Insurance to the portfolio, a product that protects customers' goods against physical loss or damage. Further, in support of the global integrator vision, a new product called Maersk Flow was launched in July. It is a digital solution which provides small and medium sized customers and their partners with everything they need to take control of their supply chain from factory to market.\n\nWork has progressed on the new supply chain management platform and the new Transportation Management System platform for intermodal, to enhance the scope, quality and efficiency of the services offered to customers, thereby contributing to an end-to-end integrated offering.",

EBITDA increased by 8.3% to USD 989m (USD 913m), reflecting an increase in the EBITDA margin to 31% (28%), driven by higher revenue per move and cost reductions in several terminals.

To sustain leader ship on decarbonisation and to match customer needs and stakeholder demands, A.P. Moller - Maersk is working to identify ways in which emissions across all scopes - directly from operations, emissions related to the purchase of energy, and emissions in the value chain - can be tackled as part of the company's decarbonisation efforts. Decarbonisation of port terminals will be one of the elements contributing to achieve this goal.\n\nIn January 2020, the Green Gateway Gothenburg was launched as a showcase for decarbonisation of existing terminals. Switching to\n\nrenewable electricity to power the cranes and offices, biogas for heating, and using biodiesel made from recycled waste vegetable oils in mobile equipment, the Gothenburg terminal reduced its CO/uni2082 emissions by 88%.\n\nWays to eliminate the last 12% of emissions are being pursued with terminal customers to provide a fully CO/uni2082 neutral container handling service.\n\nOther paths to decarbonisation of the energy supply for ports are being tested as well, with solar projects in Pipavav, India, and Aqaba, Jordan, grid optimisation trial projects in two further sites, and further switches to renewable electricity in the European and US terminals in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAPM Terminals Gothenburg switched to renewable energy in 2020.\n\n## Regional EBITDA margin, Terminals /uni00B9\n\n| Percentage                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| North America                          | /two.tf/four.tf                  | /two.tf/zero.tf                  |\n| Latin America                          | /four.tf/two.tf                  | /three.tf/four.tf                |\n| Europe/comma.tf Russia and the Baltics | /two.tf/eight.tf                 | /two.tf/eight.tf                 |\n| Asia                                   | /three.tf/one.tf                 | /one.tf/nine.tf                  |\n| Africa and Middle East                 | /three.tf/three.tf               | /four.tf/five.tf                 |\n| Total                                  | /three.tf/one.tf                 | /two.tf/eight.tf                 |\n\n- 1  Financially consolidated.\n\nmore than compensated for the lower utilisation.

At the Annual General Meeting in 2019, Bernard L. Bot and Marc Engel were elected members of the Board of Directors bringing competencies within global transport and logistics. At the Annual General Meeting in 2020, Blythe S. J. Masters was elected, bringing competencies within financial services, technology, startups and blockchain.\n\n## Diversity\n\nWhen assessing the composition of the Board, the Nomination Committee also considers diversity and setting of the target for the underrepresented gender on the Board of Directors in accordance with the Danish Company's Act \u00a7 139c. In 2019, the Board of Directors re-adopted the target for the underrepresented gender on the Board of Directors: Three female Board members elected by the general meeting if the Board consists of less than 12 members and four female Board members elected by the general meeting if the Board consists of 12 or more members. The target has to be met by end 2023. As the Board consists of ten members of which three are female the target is currently met. The Board will continuously assess whether the target set in 2019 is still ambitious. The company keeps focus on driving diversity both on managerial levels and on the Board.\n\nFurther information on diversity can be found in the company's Sustainability Report.\n\n## Disclosure regarding change of control\n\nThe EU Takeover Bids Directive, as partially implemented by the Danish Financial Statements Act, requires listed companies to disclose information that may be of interest to the market and potential take-over bidders, in particular in relation to disclosure of change-of-control provisions.\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S discloses that the group in the ordinary course of business has agreements with business partners which could be terminated in case of a change of control. However, given the ownership structure of A.P. Moller - Maersk, the risk is considered to be very remote.\n\n## Recommendations for corporate governance\n\nAs a Danish listed company, A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S must comply with or explain deviations from the 'Recommendations for Corporate Governance' implemented by Nasdaq Copenhagen in the Rules for issuers of shares and Section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nThe Board of Directors has prepared a statement on corporate governance for the financial year 2020.

The policies, manuals, and procedures are updated on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Risk assessment and management\n\nAt least once a year, as part of the risk assessment, the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee and the Executive Board undertake a general identification and assessment of risks in connection with the financial reporting, including the risk of fraud, and consider measures to be implemented to reduce or eliminate such risks.\n\nDecisions on measures to reduce or eliminate risks are based on an assessment of materiality and probability of errors and omissions.\n\n## Control activities\n\nSpecific control activities have been defined for each significant brand and business unit.\n\nThe performance of such control activities is mon i tored on brand and business unit level as well as on a corporate level. This monitoring includes controller reports with follow-up on findings and recommendations as well as an annual statement of rep re sen tation from management of the most significant brands and business units.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nThe Board of Directors is overall responsible for the company having information and reporting systems in place to ensure that its financial reporting is in conformity with rules and regulations. For this purpose, the company has set out detailed requirements in policies, manuals, and procedures and a global consolidation system with related reporting instructions has been implemented.

The remuneration of the Executive Board members for the financial year 2020 reflects a solid year with strong financial results and a satisfying progress towards the strategic transformation, whilst the remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors remains unchanged from the previous year.\n\nThe following sections set out key elements of the Remuneration Policy ('Policy'), and the total remuneration awarded to the members of Board of Directors and the Executive Board for 2020.\n\n## Remuneration policy at a glance\n\nThe Policy supports the business needs by enabling an appropriate total remuneration package that has a clear link to business strategy and aligns with shareholder interests.\n\nThe objectives of the Policy are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure appropriate total remuneration : The remuneration design and decisions are guided by market practice in Europe, reflected in the remuneration components offered and the total remuneration value provided.\n- \u00b7 Link to business strategy : The Policy supports the business plan and the need for executive leaders to focus on delivering an on-going progress to achieve the company's strategic goals, reflected in a combination of short and long-term incentive components.\n- \u00b7 Align with shareholder interest : The Policy is designed to support the delivery of strong financial and operational results over time, which ultimately grow shareholder value.\n\n## 2016-2020 Remuneration\n\n| Remuneration awarded (USD million)                                                              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/seven.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/six.tf   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors                                                                              |                                  |                                  |                                   |                                   |                                 |\n| Fixed annual fee                                                                                | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                         | /three.tf                         | /three.tf                       |\n| Total                                                                                           | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                         | /three.tf                         | /three.tf                       |\n| Executive Board                                                                                 |                                  |                                  |                                   |                                   |                                 |\n| Fixed base salary                                                                               | /eight.tf                        | /one.tf/zero.tf                  | /one.tf/zero.tf                   | /eight.tf                         | /one.tf/three.tf                |\n| Short-term cash incentive                                                                       | /six.tf                          | /five.tf                         | /five.tf                          | /two.tf                           | /two.tf                         |\n| Long-term share-based incentives                                                                | /two.tf                          | /one.tf                          | /one.tf                           | /one.tf                           | -/two.tf                        |\n| Remuneration in connection with redundancy/comma.tf  resignations and release from duty to work | -

This does not apply to the Chairman where the fixed annual fee is all inclusive.\n\n## Executive Board\n\nThe remuneration of the Executive Board members consists of a fixed base salary, which is inclusive of company pension contribution and car, short-term incentive as well as the long-term incentive components.\n\nThe remuneration structure is intended to drive a 'reward for performance' culture by aligning individual reward to company performance and shareholder value creation. The individual remuneration level is set and reviewed based on peer companies of similar size and complexity to ensure they remain comparable and fit for the business.\n\n## Total remuneration 2020\n\nThe table shows the total remuneration awarded to members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board in aggregate from 2016 to 2020, as set out in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFurther information regarding the share-based payments is detailed in note 11 of the consolidated financial statements as calculated under IFRS2.

        "page_content": "## Shareholder information\n\nAfter an extraordinary year with great volatility in the share price, the share price ended the year 41% higher than last year, implying a total shareholder return of 45% for 2020. The Board of Directors in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S proposes an ordinary dividend of DKK 330 per share corresponding to a dividend payout of 35%.\n\n## Share price development\n\nThe Maersk B share price increased by 41% to DKK 13,595 from its closing price at the end of 2019 of DKK 9,608. By comparison, the benchmark indices MSCI World Transportation and OMXC25 increased by 5% and 34%, respectively. The Maersk B share price reached its highest price of DKK 14,115 on 18 December 2020, and its lowest price of DKK 5,034 on 19 March 2020. The total market value of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S was USD 43bn at the end of 2020. The positive development of the share price was driven by a very strong financial performance in the second half of the year, as demand picked up faster than anticipated after the first lockdown related to the pandemic outbreak in the early days of 2020. The sudden uptick in demand led to a significant increase in freight rates during the third quarter. The continued focus on the cost base and agile capacity deployment, coupled with the higher freight rates lead to improved financial performance and a total of three earnings upgrades after having suspended the guidance in March 2020.\n\n## Share capital\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and are divided into two classes: A shares with voting rights and B shares without voting rights. Each DKK 1,000 A share entitles the holder to two votes.\n\nThe A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S share capital amounts to nominally DKK 20,031,947,000, divided between 10,599,401 A shares of nominally DKK 1,000 and 9,432,546 B shares of nominally DKK 1,000.\n\n## Ownership\n\nThe total number of registered shareholders increased by 3,000 to around 76,000 during 2020. Shareholders with more than 5% of share capital or votes held 53% of the share capital, while the 20 largest institutional shareholders together owned around 16% of the total share capital and 37% adjusted for the free-float. Danish retail investors decreased their ownership slightly from 11% to 10% of the total share capital since the end of 2019.\n\n## Own shares\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk holding of own shares comprised 3.12% of the share capital at the end of 2020, cf. note 11 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend policy is an annual pay-out ratio of 30-50% of underlying net result, adjusted for gains, impairments and restructurings, to be implemented from the financial year 2020.\n\nIn the medium-term and during the strategic phase of transforming the company to become a global integrator of container logistics, the annual pay-out ratio should be expected at the low to midpoint of the range.\n\nDistribution to shareholders will take place through dividends potentially combined with share buy-backs, and the annual pay-out ratio and distribution will be decided from an evaluation\n\nShare price development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOMXC25\n\nMaersk B\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMSCI  World\n\nTransportation\n\nSource: Bloomberg; data rebased from the Maersk B share price at the end of December 2019.",

Moller - Maersk's focus is on long-term debt in order to minimise the ongoing refinancing risk and secure a solid capital structure over the business cycle. Similarly, the aim is to avoid high concentrations of debt maturing within the same year. We aim at having a diversified debt portfolio, based on funding from debt capital markets, commercial bank debt, export credit agencies, ship financing institutions, and from multilateral agencies.\n\nof the outlook, cash flow, capital expenditures for organic use and merger and acquisition transactions and investment grade rating.\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend to the shareholders of DKK 330 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 150 per share of DKK 1,000). The proposed dividend payment represents an ordinary dividend yield of 2.4% (1.6%) and 35% of the net underlying profit, based on the Maersk B share's closing price of DKK 13,595 as of 30 December 2020.

        "page_content": "The decision to initiate a new share buy-back programme is supported by the strong earnings and free cash flow generation seen in 2020, which has led to further deleveraging of the company and improved credit metrics in line with investment grade rating.\n\nThe new programme is in alignment with previously announced intention to distribute a material part of the value of shares received in Total S.A. (value USD 4.5bn) as part of the sale of Maersk Oil, subject to maintaining investment grade rating. With the announced new share buy-back programme the total distribution from the sale of the shares in Total S.A. will be around USD 3.4bn or around 75% of the initial value of the shares received.\n\nThe share buy-back is carried out with the purpose to adjust the capital structure of A.P. Moller - Maersk. Shares which are not used for hedging purposes for the long-term incen tive programmes will be proposed cancelled at the Annual General Meetings in 2021 and 2022.\n\nNo shares may be bought back at a price exceeding the higher of i) share price of latest independent trade, and ii) the highest current independent bid at Nasdaq Copenhagen at the time of trading.\n\nThe maximum number of A and B shares that may be purchased on each trading day may not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of A and B shares, respectively, on Nasdaq Copenhagen or other regulated markets, on which the purchase is carried out over the last 20 trading days prior to the date of purchase.\n\nA and B shares will be acquired in a 20/80 split reflecting the current trading volumes of the two share classes.\n\n## Shareholders with more than 5% of share capital or votes\n\n| Shareholders according to section /five.tf/five.tf of the Danish Companies Act are                                    | Share capital                              | Votes                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| A/period.tfP/period.tf M\u00f8ller Holding A/S/comma.tf Copenhagen/comma.tf Denmark                                        | /four.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/two.tf/nine.tf% | /five.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf% |\n| A/period.tfP/period.tf M\u00f8ller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney M\u00f8llers Familiefond/comma.tf   Copenhagen/comma.tf Denmark | /nine.tf/period.tf/one.tf/eight.tf%        | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/three.tf/one.tf%   |\n| Den A/period.tfP/period.tf M\u00f8llerske St\u00f8ttefond/comma.tf Copenhagen/comma.tf Denmark                                  | /three.tf/period.tf/two.tf/three.tf%       | /six.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf%           |\n\n## Investor Relations\n\nTo keep investors and analysts updated on the company's strategic development, market outlook and financial performance, A.P.

The value in use is calculated using certain key assumptions for the expected future cash flows and applied discount factor.\n\nThe cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and business plans approved by management. In nature, these projections are subject to judgement and estimates that are uncertain, though based on experience and external sources where available. The discount rates applied reflect the time value of money as well as the specific risks related to the underlying cash flows, i.e. project and/ or country-specific risk premium. Further, any uncertainties reflecting past performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.\n\n## Goodwill impairment test\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segments and cash-generating units based on the management structure.\n\nThe most significant goodwill amount relates to the Logistics & Services segment, where the impairment test is based on the estimated value in use from five-year business plans where the volume and margin growth assumptions reflect current market expectations for the relevant period. A discount rate of 7.2% (8.7%) has been applied.\n\nThe impairment test for the Ocean segment is based on the estimated value in use from five-year business plans and a calculated terminal value with growth equal to the expected economic growth of 2% p.a. in both 2020 and 2019. A discount rate of 7.0 (7.7%) has been applied.\n\nThe key assumptions for Terminals & Towage's value calculations are container moves, revenue and cost per move and discount rate. The cash flow projections cover the concession period and extension options where deemed likely that they will be exercised. The growth rates assumed reflect current market expectations for the relevant period.",

In some cases, the leasing agreements comprise purchase options exercisable by the Group and options for extending the lease term. The Group also enters into arrangements that provide the right-to-use some existing infrastructure or land as required to carry out the terminal business.\n\nTo optimise lease costs during the contract period, the Group sometimes provides residual value guarantees in relation to equipment leases. At the end of 2020, the expected residual values were reviewed to determine if these reflect the actual residual values achieved on comparable assets and expectations about future prices. At 31 December 2020, USD 354m (USD 489m) is expected to be payable and is included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nLeases to which A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed but for which lease term has not yet commenced have an undiscounted value of USD 557m (USD 481m). They comprise of approx. 64 contracts commencing in 2021 and 2022.\n\nCertain terminal concession agreements contain variable payment terms that are linked to future performance, i.e. number of containers handled, or depend on an index, or a combination hereof. Such payments are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nLease liabilities are disclosed in note 13 and note 16.",

The results of the discontinued operations are presented in one separate line in the 2019 income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements in 2019, the results for Maersk Drilling are classified under discontinued operations with a net loss of USD 553m in 2019. Total cash flow from the discontinued operations was USD 0m (positive USD 372m).\n\nAssets held for sale in 2020 largely relate to two terminals reported as held for sale within Terminals & Towage and one terminal within Ocean.\n\nThe terminal in Ocean was transferred to assets held for sale in 2019, and an impairment of USD 62m has been made against the asset in 2020, being the difference between carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Maersk Drilling activity\n\nOn 2 April 2019, Maersk Drilling was demerged and listed separately.\n\n## Period ended 2 April 2019\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk recognised a loss of USD 553m for the Maersk Drilling activity, mainly due to a negative fair value adjustment of USD 628m. The cash flow from the demerger is summarised in Table 10.3.\n\nThe fair value of the new listed company of USD 3.4bn resulted in a negative fair value adjustment of USD 628m being recognised in Q1 2019. Measurement of the fair value of the disposal Group was categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as measurement was based on observable market data.",

B shares have no voting rights.\n\nAdoption of resolutions regarding changes to the company's Articles of Association or increase or write-down of the share capital requires that at least two-thirds of the A share capital at the General Meeting shall be represented by persons entitled to vote and that at least two-thirds of the votes cast shall be cast in favour of the adoption of the resolution.\n\nApart from a resolution for the dissolution of the company, other resolutions at the General Meetings are passed by simple majority, as long as legislation does not require particular voting majority. Reference is made to the company's Articles of Association. In the event of an increase of the company's share capital, the shareholders in the given share class shall have a pre-emptive right to subscribe for a proportionate share of the capital increase.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S on 23 March 2020, the shareholders decided on the cancellation of treasury shares, whereby the share capital was decreased. On June 2, 2020, the company's share capital was reduced from nominally DKK 20,816,862,000 with nominally DKK 784,915,000 in total, divided into 156,977 A shares and 627,938 B shares of DKK 1,000 to nominally DKK 20,031,947,000 by cancellation of own shares.\n\nThe capital decrease took place at a premium at a price of DKK 761.57 and DKK 809.51 for A and B shares, respectively, cf. section 188(2) of the Danish Companies Act, corresponding to the average price at which the shares have been repurchased. The amount from the capital decrease has been paid out to the company as owner of the shares as the amount was transferred from the company's capital reserves to the free reserves.\n\nThe DKK 10bn share buy-back programme announced on 24 May 2019 was thereby concluded on 24 July 2020.\n\nOn 18 November 2020, A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S decided to initiate a share buy-back programme of up to DKK 10bn\n\n(around USD 1.6bn) and a maximum of 1.79 million shares to be acquired over a period of up to 15 months.\n\nThe share buy-back programme is initiated pursuant to the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting in 2019, which entitled the company to acquire treasury shares at a nominal value not exceeding 15% of the share capital at the market price applicable at the time of acquisition with a deviation of up to 10%.\n\nThe first phase of the programme will run from 1 December 2020 up to 29 April 2021. The shares to be acquired will be limited to a total market value of DKK 3.3bn. A maximum of 158,586 A shares and 620,270 B shares can be acquired in the first phase of the buy-back programme.\n\nThe share buy-back is carried out with the purpose to adjust the capital structure of A.P. Moller - Maersk. Shares which are not used for hedging purposes for the longterm incentive programmes will be proposed cancelled at the Annual General Meetings in 2021 and 2022.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has appointed Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken ('SEB') as lead manager. SEB will execute the purchase of shares on behalf of A.P. Moller - Maersk within the announced limits and will make all share purchase decisions independently and without the involvement of A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\nNo shares may be bought back at a price exceeding the higher of i) share price of latest independent trade and ii) the highest current independent bid at Nasdaq Copenhagen at the time of trading.\n\nThe maximum number of A and B shares that may be purchased on each business day may not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of A and B shares, respectively, on Nasdaq Copenhagen or other regulated markets, on which the purchase is carried out, over last 20 trading days prior to the date of purchase.\n\nDisposals of own shares are related to the Share Option Plans and the Restricted Shares Plan.",

Beginning in 2018, grants have also been awarded to members of the Executive Board.\n\nThe transfer of restricted shares is contingent upon the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. For members of the Executive Board the vesting period is five years.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in connection with the restricted shares plan.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nAt 31 December 2020, there is dilution effect on earnings per share of the 66,971 (0) issued share options while there is no dilution effect on earnings per share of the 21,459 (67,825) issued shares options. The issued share options correspond to 0.33% (0%) and 0.11% (0.33%) of the total average number of shares in the Group respectively.\n\nAll the restricted shares of 17,691 have dilution effect. The issued restricted shares correspond to 0.09% of the total average number of shares in the Group.\n\nThe fair value of restricted shares (A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S B shares) granted to 96 (92) employees and five (five) members of the Executive Board was USD 7m (USD 7m) at the time of grant.\n\nThe fair value per restricted share at the time of grant is DKK 5,975 (DKK 8,668), which is equal to the volume weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 1 April 2020.\n\nThe payroll expense related to the restricted shares plan is USD 6m (USD 5m).\n\nOn 1 April 2020, the restricted shares originally granted in 2017 were settled with the employees. The weighted average share price at that date was DKK 5,975.\n\nThe average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2020 is 1.8 years (1.7 years).\n\n- 1  At the time of grant.",

Moller - Maersk has share option plans for members of the Executive Board and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nThe share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent upon the option holder still being employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the time of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.\n\nThe share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plans.\n\nThe fair value of awards granted to five (five) members of the Executive Board and 89 (75) employees was USD 4m (USD 9m) at the time of grant.\n\nThe payroll expense related to the share option plan is USD 5m (USD 5m).\n\nThe weighted average share price at the dates of exercise of share options was DKK 12,389. No share options were exercised during 2019.\n\nThe average remaining contractual life as per 31 December 2020 is 5.1 years (5.2 years) and the exercise price for outstanding share options is DKK 8,670 (DKK 9,057).\n\n- 1  Average exercise prices were reduced following the demerger of Maersk Drilling.\n\nThe fair value per option granted to members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 625 (DKK 1,782) at the time of grant, based on Black & Scholes' option pricing model. The fair value per option granted to employees not members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 697 (DKK 1,914) at the time of grant based on the same option pricing model.",

Generally, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.\n\nPension and medical plans which, as part of collective bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other enterprises, known as multi-employer plans, are treated as other pension plans. Such defined benefit plans are treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient information for calculating the individual enterprises' share of the obligation is not available.\n\nIn 2021, the Group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 16m to funded defined benefit plans, USD 27m in 2020.\n\nThe majority of the Group's defined benefit liabilities are 78% in the UK and 12% the US. All of the plans in the UK and the majority of the plans in the US are funded. Although all of the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans.\n\nOverall, the plans have an average duration of 15 years and approximately 56% of the obligation is in respect of pensioner members.\n\nAs well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the Group is also subject to the risk of higher than expected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation, although some minimum and maximum limits apply.",

life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality investigations, and in line with market practice an allowance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. The Group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections of 1.25% for all UK plans.\n\n## Table 14.4\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the Group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19.\n\nThe Group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a Trustee Board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis, and if the plan is in deficit, the Trustees agree with the Group or the sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.\n\nIn 2020, the Trustees of one of the UK plans, Maersk Retirement Benefit Scheme (MRBS), entered into an insurance contract to provide further security for all future benefit payments and annual increases to which members are entitled under the scheme. Following this MRBS buy-in transaction, over 70% of the UK liabilities are now covered by insurance policies. Therefore, movement in the liabilities due to change in assumptions would equally impact the assets value related to the buy-in policies, resulting in a reduced movement in the overall balance sheet position.\n\nThe expected contributions to the UK plans for 2021 are USD 11m (USD 23m in 2020) of which USD 9m (USD 20m in 2020) is deficit recovery contributions. In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the Group. However, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF), and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) contributions paid by the Group are not refundable in any circumstance and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the Group's assumptions. In 2020 an adjustment of USD 3m (USD 2m) was applied in this respect.\n\nOther than the insurance contracts and a small proportion of other holdings, the plan assets held by the Group are quoted investments.",

In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.\n\nFor the defined benefit pension plans, the Group has joint and several liabilities to fund total obligations. While the welfare/medical plans are by nature contribution plans funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. In 2020, the Group's contributions to the pension and welfare/medical plans are estimated at USD 91m (USD 83m) and USD 277m (USD 295m), respectively. The contributions to be paid in 2021 are estimated at USD 92m for the pension plans and USD 279m for the welfare/medical plans.\n\nNo reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. For the pension plans where the Group has an interest and there is a deficit, the net obligations for all employers amounts to USD 0.3bn (USD 0.7bn). This net obligation is based on the most recent available financial data from the plan's trustees, calculated in accordance with the rules for such actuarial calculation in US GAAP. The deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Welfare/medical plans are 'pay as you go', and form a part of the Group's US collective bargain agreements. They cover a limited part of employees' medical costs as occurred.",

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nRisk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's entities.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the currency risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2020. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses in table 16.5 show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nHedges comprise primarily currency derivatives, interest rate derivatives and oil price hedges, which are further described in the following sections.",

As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including Terminals & Towage, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.\n\nThe main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.\n\nCurrency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments/divestments, and are recognised when the hedged exposure occurs in the income statement or the cost of property, plant and equipment, respectively.\n\nThere is not any proxy hedging for the currency risk hedging, and therefore the economic relationship between the hedged exposure and the hedge is high. Effectiveness is measured with critical terms match approach according to IFRS 9.\n\nHedges of future revenue and operating costs matures within a year. There are no hedges of investments at the end of 2020 (2019: Mature within a year).\n\nFor hedges related to operating cash flows and investments, a gain of USD 95m in 2020 (gain of USD 48m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to a gain of USD 109m at 31 December (gain of USD 14m). For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the forward points are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to USD 0m (USD 0m). Ineffectiveness related to hedge of acquisition amounts to a gain of USD 3m (USD 0m).\n\n## Table 16.4\n\nBesides the designated cash flow hedges in table 16.3, the Group enters into derivatives to hedge currency exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's sensitivity to an increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Group is exposed is estimated to have the following impact in table 16.5.\n\nThe sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date and are thus not an expression of the Group's total currency risk.",

The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained using interest rate swaps. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio is 2.1 years (2.2 years) excluding IFRS 16 leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 39m and positively by approx. USD 30m, respectively, (positively by approx. USD 11m and negatively by approx. USD 14m, respectively).\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging, and cash flow hedging.\n\nDue to buy-back of issued bonds in 2020, ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is recognised in the income statement with a loss of USD 12m (loss of USD 4m).\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0. If the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 6m (gain of USD 6m).\n\n- 1  Currency element of the cross-currency swaps is not designated into the hedge relationship and is recognised in financial items.",

The oil price risk arising from these oil price exposures is mitigated by entering into commodity derivative agreements. The overall risk limit is set in the Group's risk policy, defining a maximum net open position for the Group. The sensitivity of the consolidated net open position is calculated daily on a one day Value-at-Risk (VaR) with a confidence level of 95% and 255 days of historical observations. The Group VaR limit is USD 6m, and position as of 31 December 2020 of USD 3m (USD 3m). Due to the use of portfolio hedging, the Group does not use hedge accounting for these hedges. All gains and losses regarding these hedges are recognised in other income or other cost on a net basis, due to the nature of the hedging model.",

To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions. Adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, not due trade receivables have also been impaired.\n\nApproximately 89% (67%) of the provision for bad debt is related to trade receivables overdue by more than one year.\n\n## Other /financial assets at amortised cost\n\nOther financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, finance lease receivables and other receivables. These financial assets are considered to have low credit risk, and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have a low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group's objective is to maintain a liquidity profile in line with an investment grade credit rating. Capital is managed for the Group. The equity share of total equity and liabilities was 55.0% at the end of 2020 (52.0% end of 2019).\n\nFor information about cash and bank balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions, see text to the consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nBased on the liquidity reserve, loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory.\n\nThe average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about five years (about five years at 31 December 2019).\n\nFurther information about capital structure and funding strategy can be found on pages 60-62.\n\n- 1  Liquidity reserve is defined as undrawn committed revolving facilities with more than one year to expiry, securities, term deposits and cash and bank balances, excluding securities and balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions.",

Non-listed shares and other securities are within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives is mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period. A minor amount of crude oil price derivatives is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Group's profit or equity significantly.\n\n## Financial instruments carried at amortised cost\n\nFair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.\n\nFair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.",

The Group does not expect these to have a material impact on the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nTax may crystallise on repatriation of dividends.

Moller - Maersk among North America's leading warehouse and distribution providers with 56 warehouses for customers and accelerates the company's regional logistics and services model.\n\nThe total enterprise value of USD 622m consisted of a total purchase price of USD 317m on a cash and debt-free basis and acquired lease liabilities of around USD 305m. The purchase price mainly relates to fixed assets and customer list. The lease liabilities have been adjusted in accordance with IFRS 16 from the last communication.\n\nThe goodwill of USD 95m is attributable to workforce and commercial/operational synergies between Performance Team and A.P. Moller - Maersk and is deductible for tax purposes.\n\nFrom the acquisition date to 31 December 2020, Performance Team LLC contributed with a revenue of USD 398m and a minor contribution to net profit.\n\nIf the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2020, the impact on the Group's revenue would have been USD 512m. The net profit contributed to the Group would have been minor.\n\nThe accounting for the business combination is considered provisional at 31 December 2020 due to certain contingencies, indemnities etc.",

On 9 June 2020, the Group obtained the majority of seats on the Board of Directors of GPPL, thereby obtaining control of the entity.\n\nThe acquisition consists of net assets of USD 540m at fair value of which USD 240m is terminal rights and non-controlling interest of USD 308m, offset by the derecognition of associate company of USD 182m. A gain of USD 45m was recognised for disposing GPPL as an associate, and the cumulative translation reserve loss of USD 61m related to the associate was also recycled to profit/loss. Liquid funds acquired amounted to USD 92m. On the date of acquisition, the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the listed share price, therefore, the transaction has been reported as the bargain purchase. The gain from bargain purchase has been reported at USD 46m.\n\nFrom the acquisition date to 31 December 2020, Pipavav terminal contributed positively to the results with a revenue of USD 59m. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2020, the impact on the Group's revenue would have been USD 95m.\n\nThe accounting for the business combination is considered provisional at 31 December 2020.\n\nDovana Holdings AB (KGH Customs Service Group) On 1 September 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Dovana Holding AB, KGH Customs Services, a leading Sweden-based specialist in trade and customs services management in Europe, further enhancing its\n\ncapabilities as an integrated container logistics company, offering end-to-end supply chain solutions to its global customers.\n\nThe total enterprise value of USD 294m consisted of a total purchase price of USD 288m on a cash and debt-free basis and acquired lease liabilities of around USD 6m.\n\nOut of the purchase price of USD 288m, debt of USD 100m has been deducted, and discounted maximum earnout of USD 45m has been added to arrive at the USD 233m in aggregate purchase consideration as reported.\n\nThe goodwill of USD 172m is mainly attributable to the synergies between KGH Customs Services and A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\nFrom the acquisition date to 31 December 2020, KGH Customs Services contributed positively to the results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2020, the impact on the Group's revenue would have been USD 91m.\n\nThe accounting for the business combination is considered provisional at 31 December 2020 due to certain contingencies, indemnities, etc.\n\nIn addition to the above acquisitions, there has been a small acquisition in Terminals & Towage and therefore the total of all acquisitions sums up to USD 425m.\n\nFor the year 2020, total acquisition cost for the acquisitions recognised in the income statement amounted to USD 8m.\n\n## Acquisitions during 2019\n\nNo acquisitions of subsidiaries or activities, to an extent of significance to the Group, were completed in 2019.\n\n## Sales during 2020\n\nNo material external sales were performed during 2020.\n\n## Sales during 2019\n\nNo material external sales were performed during 2019.",

M\u00f8ller Holding A/S in 2018 regarding the use of commonly used trademarks which historically have benefited both A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S and A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S. A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S is the controlling shareholder of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S, and is wholly owned by A.P. M\u00f8ller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney M\u00f8llers Fond til almene Formaal. The joint usage agreement establishes a framework and a branding strategy for the commonly used trademarks and a joint brand board, where the parties can cooperate regarding the use of these trademarks.\n\nA.P.

        "page_content": "## Note 23  Significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for 2020 for A.P. Moller - Maersk have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The consolidated financial statements are also in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of A.P. Moller - Maersk are included in the consolidated financial statements of A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2019, except for the changes to the accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2020 and were endorsed by the EU.\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nFrom 2020, A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S is required to file the annual report in the new European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) and the annual report in 2020 is therefore prepared in the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements in the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n\nThe annual report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named APMM-2020-12-31.zip.\n\n## Change to reportable segments\n\nAs part of the refinement of A.P. Moller - Maersk's segment structure to further align with internal management structure and demarcation between the reportable segment activities, a number of changes have been made.\n\nThe main changes involve moving the Maersk Oil Trading activity to the Ocean segment from Manufacturing & Others, and the intermodal activity in Hamburg S\u00fcd to Logistics & Services from Ocean.\n\nComparison figures for note 1 have been restated as if the changes had been implemented in 2019. The reportable segments are disclosed below.\n\nA number of changes to accounting standards are effective from 1 January 2020 and endorsed by the EU:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3: Business Combinations.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk follows the guidelines in the above amendments, and the implementation did not change the accounting policies.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.\n\n## Subsidiaries are entities controlled by\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that connection, relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control.\n\nJoint arrangements are entities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk, according to contractual agreements with one or more other parties, has joint control. The arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nEntities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered associ-\n\nated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.\n\nConsolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, including the proportionate share of joint operations, part-owned vessels and pool arrangements, which have been prepared in accordance with A.P. Moller - Maersk's accounting policies. Intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, unless they indicate impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of profit/loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates, and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from such translations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.\n\nThe functional currency varies from business area to business area. For A.P. Moller - Maersk's principal shipping activities, the functional currency is typically USD. This means, among other things, that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based container activities, the functional currency\n\nis generally the local currency of the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate.\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.\n\n## Segment information\n\nThe allocation of business activities into segments reflects A.P. Moller - Maersk's character as an integrated container logistics business and is in line with the internal management reporting. The reportable segments are as follows:\n\n| Ocean                   | Global container shipping activities   including strategic transhipment hubs  and sale of bunker oil                   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Logistics   & Services  | Freight forwarding/comma.tf supply chain   management/comma.tf inland haulage and   other logistics services           |\n| Terminals   & Towage    | Gateway terminal activities/comma.tf towage   and related marine activities                                            |\n| Manufacturing  & Others | Production of reefer and dry containers/comma.tf  providing off-shore supply service and  trading and other businesses |\n\nOperating segments have not been aggregated.\n\nThe reportable segments comprise:\n\n## Ocean\n\nOcean activities\n\nActivities under Maersk Line, Safmarine, Sealand - A Maersk company, and Hamburg S\u00fcd brands with Ocean container freight being the main revenue stream. Ocean container freight is defined as the cost-per-weight measure of transporting goods on board a container vessel across the ocean, including demurrage and detention, terminal handling, documentation services, container services as well as container storage.",

The respective terminals are included under the Ocean segment, as the primary purpose of those ports is to provide transhipment services to A.P. Moller - Maersk's Ocean business, whereas third-party volumes sold in those locations are considered secondary.\n\n## Maersk Oil Trading\n\nSourcing marine fuels and lubricants for A.P. Moller - Maersk's fleet in addition to refinery activities and sales to external parties, including Maersk Tankers.\n\n## Logistics & Services\n\nSupply chain management\n\nActivities within supply chain management and 4PL\n\nservices.\n\n## Intermodal\n\nOperating activities with the main stream of revenue deriving from the transportation of containers from vendors (shippers) to the port of shipment, and from discharge port to the point of stripping (consignee) by truck and/or rail.\n\n## Inland services\n\nOperating activities in inland activities facilities fully or partially controlled by APM Terminals, with the main revenue stream being inland services such as full container storage, bonded warehousing, empty depot, local transportation, etc.\n\n## Freight forwarding\n\nOperating activities within sea and air freight forwarding services.\n\n## Other services\n\nOperating activities within warehousing and distribution, trade finance with export finance solutions, post-shipment and import finance solutions, and Star Air, operating cargo aircrafts on behalf of UPS.\n\n## Terminals & Towage\n\nTerminals activities\n\nActivities in ports fully or partially controlled by the APM Terminals brand, with the main revenue stream being port activities not considered a hub activity as described above.\n\n## Towage activities\n\nActivities under the Svitzer brand, a provider of offshore towage and salvage services.\n\n## Manufacturing & Others\n\nMaersk Container Industry Manufacturer that produces dry containers and reefer\n\ncontainers.\n\n## Maersk Supply Service\n\nProvides marine services and integrated solutions to the energy sector worldwide with a large fleet of anchor handling tug supply vessels and subsea support vessels.\n\n## Hamburg S\u00fcd tramp activity\n\nBulk and tanker activity acquired as part of the Hamburg S\u00fcd acquisition.\n\n## Other businesses\n\nConsists of Maersk Training, a provider of training services to the maritime, oil and gas, offshore wind and crane industries.\n\nThe reportable segments do not comprise costs in A.P. Moller - Maersk's corporate functions. These functions are reported as unallocated items.\n\nRevenue between segments is limited, except for the Terminals & Towage segment, where a large part of the services is delivered to the Ocean segment as well as the sale of containers from Maersk Container Industry to the Ocean segment. Sales of products and services between segments are based on market terms.\n\n## Income statement\n\nRevenue for all businesses is recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which happens upon the transfer of control to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the\n\nGroup expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services.\n\nRevenue from shipping activities is recognised over time as the performance obligation is satisfied, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Number of days of a voyage, as a percentage of the total number of days a voyage is estimated to last, is considered as a close approximation of percentage of completion. Detention and demurrage fees are recognised over time up until the time of the customer's late return or pick-up of containers. Retrospective volume rebates provided to certain customers which give rise to variable consideration are based on the expected value method and allocated to Ocean freight revenue.\n\nRevenue from terminal operations and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is recognised as revenue during the construction.\n\nRevenue from most freight forwarding activities is recognised over time.\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of control to the buyer.\n\nShare of pro/fit/loss in associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments and their reversal.\n\nTax comprises an estimate of current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous years of those. Income tax is tax on taxable profits, and consists of corporation tax, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent\n\nthat it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax on gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.\n\n## Earnings per share are calculated as the\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' share of the profit/loss for the year divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding A.P. Moller - Maersk's holding of own shares. Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilution effect of share-based compensation issued by the parent company.\n\n## Statement of comprehensive income\n\nOther comprehensive income consists of gains and losses not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustments of other equity investments (at FVOCI), cash flow hedges, forward points and currency basis spread as well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, etc. A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.\n\nOn disposal or discontinuation of an entity, A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a non-USD functional currency is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of equity instruments classified as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income will remain in equity upon disposal.\n\nOther comprehensive income includes current and deferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nIntangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets regarding acquired customer relationships and brand names are amortised over a useful life of 15 and 20 years, respectively. IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.",

The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of a grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:\n\n| Ships/comma.tf etc/period.tf                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/five.tf years                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Containers/comma.tf etc/period.tf                                  | /one.tf/two.tf years                                                               |\n| Buildings                                                          | /one.tf/zero.tf-/five.tf/zero.tf years                                             |\n| Terminal infrastructure                                            | /one.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf years or   concession period/comma.tf   if shorter |\n| Plant and machinery/comma.tf cranes   and other terminal equipment | /five.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf years                                                     |\n| Other operating equipment,   fixtures, etc.                        | /three.tf-/seven.tf years                                                          |\n\nEstimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.\n\nThe cost of an asset is divided into separate components, which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the individual components differ. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.\n\nThe cost of assets constructed by A.P. Moller - Maersk includes directly attributable expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of removal and restoration.\n\nRight-of-use assets : The Group mainly leases vessels, containers, concessions arrangements and real estate property. Lease contracts for vessels and containers are typically made for fixed periods of about five years but may have extension options as described below. Concession arrangements and real estate contracts are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions.\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding leases liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nIntercompany leases will continue to be presented according to IFRS 8 - Segment Reporting, as operating leases in accordance with the old lease standard, IAS 17.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units on acquisition and impaired before other assets.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use.\n\nAssets are held for sale , when the carrying amount of an individual non-current asset, or disposal groups, will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Assets are classified as held for sale when activities to carry out a sale have been initiated, when the activities are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and when the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities.\n\nAssets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held\n\nfor sale and fair value less costs to sell, and impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for sale. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale. Measurement of deferred tax and financial assets and liabilities is unchanged.\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised as A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.\n\nEquity instruments, etc. , including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value, and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for non-listed securities. Fair value adjustments from equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) remain in equity upon disposal. Dividends are recognised in the income statement.\n\nInventories mainly consist of bunker, containers (manufacturing), spare parts not qualifying for property, plant and equipment, and other consumables. Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.\n\nLoans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For loans and other receivables, write-down is made for anticipated losses based on specific individual or group assessments. For trade receivables, the loss allowance is measured in accordance with IFRS 9 applying a provision matrix to calculate the minimum impairment. The provision matrix includes an impairment for non-due receivables.\n\nEquity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit/loss for the year and other com-\n\nprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity.\n\nThe translation reserve comprises A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising on translation from functional currency into presentation currency. The reserve for other equity investments comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of equity investments (at FVOCI), net of tax. Reserve for hedges includes the accumulated fair value of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, net of tax, as well as forward points and currency basis spread.\n\nEquity-settled restricted shares and share options allocated to the executive employees of A.P. Moller - Maersk as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at estimated fair value at the grant date and a corresponding adjustment in equity. Cash-settled performance awards allocated to employees below executive levels as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period and a corresponding adjustment in other payables.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, A.P. Moller - Maersk revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. Any impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity and other payables.\n\nProvisions are recognised when A.P. Moller - Maersk has a present legal or constructive obligation from past events. The item includes, among other things, legal disputes, provisions for onerous contracts, unfavourable contracts acquired as part of a business combination, as well as provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the US. Provisions are recognised based on best estimates, and are discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settlement is reasonably determinable.\n\nPension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for",

Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement of gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated with the same rates as used for discounting the obligations. Actuarial gains/losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nPension plans where A.P. Moller - Maersk, as part of collective bargaining agreements, participates together with other enterprises - so called multi-employer plans - are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. Defined benefit multi-employer plans, where sufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting is not available, are treated as defined contribution plans.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, where at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a business combination. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when A.P. Moller - Maersk controls the timing of dividends, and no taxable dividends are currently expected. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans subject to fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged interest component. Liabilities in respect of leases are measured at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable\n\nto determine, or else at A.P. Moller - Maersk's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe following lease payments are included in the net present value:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit/loss.\n\nExtension and termination options in lease contracts are included in contracts, where A.P. Moller - Maersk will probably exercise the options. These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or not terminated. Most of the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by A.P. Moller - Maersk and not by the respective lessor. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment, and which is within the control of the lessee. Where A.P. Moller - Maersk will probably exercise specific purchase options, those options are included in the measurement of the lease liability with corresponding right-of-use asset depreciated over the asset's useful life rather than lease term.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the implicit interest rate, to the extent this can be determined, otherwise discounted using incremental borrowing rates (IBRs). A.P. Moller - Maersk's IBR reflects the Group's credit risk, leased amount and contract duration, as well as the nature and quality of the asset's security and economic environment in which the leased assets operate. To determine the IBR, where possible, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, with adjustments to reflect changes in financing conditions since that financing was received. Where such financing is not available, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted by credit risk and specific risks faced by the lessee such as asset type, geographical risks, etc.\n\nSubsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost with each lease payment allocated between the repayment of the liability and financing cost. The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period using the IBR that was used to discount the lease payments.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge highly probable future transactions is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised. At that time, the accumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised. The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that can be attributed to the hedging relationship. Currency basis spread and forward points are considered a cost of hedging and deferred in equity.\n\nThe ineffective portion of hedge transactions and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for interest and currency-based instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.\n\n## Cash flow statement\n\nCash flow from operating activities includes all cash transactions other than cash flows arising from investments and divestments, received dividends, principal payments of loans, instalments on lease liabilities, paid and received financial items and equity transactions. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is considered as a noncash item, and the actual payments of these borrowing costs are included in cash flow from financing.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities form an integral part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's cash management.\n\n## Business combinations and disposal of subsidiaries\n\nUpon acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date when control was achieved using the acquisition method. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can other wise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and any subsequent changes to contingent consideration are recognised as other income or other costs in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nWhen A.P. Moller - Maersk ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is re-measured at fair value, and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as a gain/loss on the sale of non-current assets. The difference between sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the subsidiary is recognised in the income statement including fair value of",

Contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.\n\n## Discontinued operations and assets held for sale\n\nDiscontinued operations represent a separate major line of businesses disposed of or in preparation for sale.\n\nThe results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement with restatement of comparative figures.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet with no restatement of comparative figures. Elimination between continuing and discontinued operations is presented to reflect continuing operations as\n\n## Note 24  Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management, on an ongoing basis, to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its judgements and estimates based on historical experience, independent advice and external data points, as well as on in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nIn certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute those plans or to settle claims that are raised against A.P. Moller - Maersk, is highly uncertain. Therefore, assumptions may change, or the outcome may differ in the coming years, which could require a material upward or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. This note includes the areas in which A.P. Moller - Maersk is particularly exposed to a material adjustment of the carrying amounts as at the end of 2020.\n\n## Significant accounting judgements\n\n## Determination of cash-generating units\n\nJudgement is applied in the definition of cash-generating units and in the selection of methodologies and assumptions for impairment tests.\n\nThe determination of cash-generating units differs for the various business areas. Ocean operates its fleet of\n\ncontainer vessels and hub terminals in an integrated network. Consequently, the Ocean activities are tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit. In addition, the intermodal activities reported under Logistics & Services are included in the Ocean cash-generating unit for impairment testing to apply consistency between the asset base and related cash flows. In Logistics & Services, apart from intermodal, each main product is defined as a cash-generating unit. In gateway terminals, each terminal is considered individually in impairment tests, except when the capacity is managed as a portfolio. Towage groups vessels according to type, size, etc. in accordance with the structure governing management's ongoing follow-up. Projected cash flow models are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair value is deemed lower than value in use. External data is used to the extent possible, and centralised processes, involving corporate functions, ensure that indices or data sources are selected consistently while observing differences in risks and other circumstances. Current market values for vessels, etc. are estimated using acknowledged brokers.\n\nOperations in countries with limited access to repatriating surplus cash\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk operates worldwide, and in this respect, has operations in countries where access to repatriating surplus cash is limited. In these coun-\n\npost-separation, which entails the elimination of interest, borrowing, dividends and capital increases.\n\nAssets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale, except financial assets, etc., are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less cost to sell, and impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for sale. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated.\n\ntries, management makes judgements as to whether these cash positions can be recognised as cash or cash equivalents.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nAspects of uncertainty\n\nIn its assumption setting, management deals with different aspects of uncertainty. One aspect of uncertainty is whether an asset or liability exists, where the assessment forms the basis for recognition or derecognition decisions, including assessment of control. Another aspect is the measurement uncertainty, where management makes assumptions about the value of recognised assets and liabilities. These assumptions concern the timing and amount of future cash flows, and the risks inherent in these.\n\n## Impairment tests\n\nThe outcome of impairment tests is subject to estimates of the development of freight rates, volumes, bunker prices and discount rates.\n\nThe future development in freight rates is an uncertain and significant factor impacting especially the Ocean segment, whose financial results are directly affected by fluctuations in container freight rates. Freight rates are influenced by both regional and global economic environment and trade patterns, as well as by industry-specific\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has not yet adopted the following accounting standards/requirements:\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance contracts IFRS 17: An analysis of the impact is being assessed and is expected to be concluded in due course ahead of the implementation date.\n\nOther changes to IFRS are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.\n\ntrends in respect of capacity supply and demand. The longterm economic consequences of COVID-19 are still unknown and could cause a shift in freight rates or volumes.\n\nThe future development in the oil price is an uncertain and significant factor impacting accounting estimates across A.P. Moller - Maersk, either directly or indirectly. The Ocean segment is directly impacted by the price of bunker oil, where the competitive landscape determines the extent to which the development is reflected in the freight rates charged to the customer. APM Terminals is indirectly impacted by the oil price as terminals located in oil-producing countries, e.g. Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Russia and Brazil, are indirectly impacted by the development in oil prices and the consequences on the countries' economies, which not only affect volume handled in the terminals, but also exchange rates.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk carries goodwill of USD 968m (USD 637m).\n\nIn Ocean, the cash flow projection is based on forecasts as per Q3 2020, covering plans for 2021-2025. Management has applied an assumption of growth in volumes, pressure on freight rates and continued cost efficiency. The impairment test continues to show headroom from value in use to the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable.",

        "page_content": "## Note 24  Significant accounting estimates and judgements - continued\n\nIn Terminals & Towage, management assesses impairment triggers and based on these, estimates recoverable amounts on the individual terminals. For APM Terminals' interest in Global Port Investments, being the share of equity and significant intangible assets acquired, management assesses the recoverable amount of its interest on an ongoing basis. Uncertain variables in the estimate are the economic outlook, local competition, effect on volumes, operating expenses and discount rate. The carrying amount of the investment may not be sustainable in the next few years if markets develop significantly adversely compared to current expectations. Estimates of recoverable amounts were also prepared for other terminals where decreasing volumes triggered impairment tests. Key sensitivities are expected volumes, local port rates, concession right extensions as well as discount rate. The impairment tests showed headroom from fair value less cost of disposal and value in use calculations compared to carrying amount for all terminals in continued use. Therefore, no impairment was recognised in 2020 (USD 0m in 2019) related to terminals in markets with challenging commercial conditions. For assets held for sale, USD 62m was recognised in impairments. Continued economic deterioration and a lack of cash repatriation opportunities in certain oil-producing countries can potentially put pressure on carrying amounts of individual terminals.\n\nReference is made to notes 6 and 7 for information about impairment losses, recoverable amounts and discount rates.\n\n## Amortisation, depreciation and residual values\n\nUseful lives are estimated based on experience. Management decides from time to time to revise the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development and environmental requirements. Please refer to note 23 for the useful lives typically used for new assets.\n\nResidual values are difficult to estimate given the long lives of vessels, the uncertainty as to future economic conditions and the future price of steel, which is considered the main determinant of the residual price. Generally, the residual values of vessels are initially estimated at 10% of\n\nthe purchase price excluding dry-docking costs. The longterm view is prioritised to disregard, to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations, which may be significant.\n\nProvisions for pension and other employee bene/fits For defined benefit schemes, management makes assumptions about future remuneration and pension changes, employee attrition rates, life expectancy, inflation and discount rates. When setting these assumptions, management takes advice from the actuaries performing the valuation. The inflation and discount rates are determined centrally for the major plans on a country-by-country basis. All other assumptions are determined on a plan-by- plan basis. Refer to note 14 for information about key assumptions and the sensitivity of the liability to changes in these assumptions.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value by fund administrators.\n\nProvision for legal cases, disputes, uncertain tax positions etc. Management's estimate of the provisions regarding legal cases and disputes, including disputes on taxes and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. The resolution of legal disputes, through either negotiations or litigation, can take several years to complete and the outcome is subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of varying scope. Appropriate provisions and recognition of uncertain tax positions have been made where the probability of the tax position being upheld in individual cases is considered less than 50%. Claims, for which the probability of A.P. Moller - Maersk's tax position being upheld is assessed by management to be at least 50%, are not provided for. Such risks are instead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area, and country risk provisions and uncertain tax liabilities are recognised where the aggregated probability of the tax position being upheld is considered less than 50%.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nJudgement has been applied in the measurement of deferred tax assets with respect to A.P. Moller - Maersk's\n\nability to utilise the assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets recognised in entities having suffered an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 87m (USD 98m) for continuing operations, excluding entities participating in joint taxation schemes. These assets mainly relate to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated during the construction of terminals, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or are expected within a foreseeable future.\n\n## Vessel-sharing agreements\n\n## (Cost-sharing arrangements)\n\nVessel-sharing agreements in shipping require that some vessels are committed towards specific service routes. The committed vessel's capacity is then shared with one or more container shipping providers in proportion to each party's contribution to the joint service service on multi-year agreements. In practice, it is not always possible to provide tonnage precisely as agreed in the sharing arrangements, therefore financial settlement often takes place on the basis of relative capacity over/under utilised on a mutually agreed cycle. At A.P. Moller - Maersk, these capacity adjustments are settled as close to actual costs incurred as possible based on market rates applicable at that time.",

Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements provides more information about the share buy-back programme. Disposal of own shares relates to the share option plan and the restricted shares plan.\n\n## Restricted shares plan\n\nThe restricted shares plan was introduced in 2013 and grants have been awarded to employees on a yearly basis since 2013. Beginning in 2018, grants have also been awarded to members of the Executive Board.\n\nThe transfer of restricted shares is contingent upon the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. For members of the Executive Board the vesting period is five years.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in connection with the restricted shares plan.\n\nThe fair value of restricted shares (A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S B shares) granted to 96 (92) employees and five (five) members of the Executive Board was USD 7m (USD 7m) at the time of grant.\n\nThe fair value per restricted share at the time of grant is DKK 5,975 (DKK 8,668), which is equal to the volume weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 1 April 2020.\n\nThe payroll expense related to the restricted shares plan is USD 1m (USD 1m).\n\nOn 1 April 2020, the restricted shares originally granted in 2017 were settled with the employees. The weighted average share price at that date was DKK 5,975.\n\nThe average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2020 is 1.8 years (1.7 years).\n\n- 1   At the time of grant.",

has share options plans for members of the Executive Board and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nThe share options were granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent on the option holder still being employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the time of granting. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.\n\nThe share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plans.\n\nThe fair value of awards granted to five (five) members of the Executive Board and 89 (75) employees was USD 4m (USD 9m) at the time of grant.\n\nThe payroll expense related to the share options plan is USD 1m (USD 1m).\n\nThe weighted average share price at the dates of exercise of share options was DKK 12,389. No share options were exercised during 2019.\n\nThe average remaining contractual life as per 31 December 2020 is 5.1 years (5.2 years) and the exercise price for outstanding share options is DKK 8,670 (DKK 9,057).\n\n- 1  At the time of grant.\n- 2  Average exercise prices were reduced following the demerger of Maersk Drilling in 2019.\n\nThe fair value per option granted to members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 625 (DKK 1,782) at the time of grant based on Black & Scholes' option pricing model. The fair value per option granted to employees not members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 697 (DKK 1,914) at the time of grant based on the same option pricing model.",

The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nRisk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the company's entities.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the currency risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2020. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nHedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives, which are further described in the following sections.",

These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAn increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the company is exposed is presented in the table.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe company's currency risk arises primarily from its treasury activities where financing is obtained and provided in a wide range of currencies other than USD such as EUR, GBP and NOK.\n\nThe main purpose of hedging the company's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the company's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the company's profit. The company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.",

The company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained using interest rate swaps. The duration of the company's debt portfolio is 2.1 years (2.2 years) excluding IFRS 16 leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 151m and positively by approx. USD 96m, respectively (positively by approx. USD 192m and positively by approx. USD 127m, respectively).\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\nDue to buy-back of issued bonds in 2020, ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is recognised in the income statement with a loss of USD 12m (loss of USD 4m).\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0.",

As of 31 December 2020, the loans amount to USD 17.2bn (USD 20.7bn) and are considered to have a low credit risk, thus the impairment provision to be recognised during the period is limited to 12 months of expected losses. The credit risk has not increased significantly since the initial recognition and is considered low based on the investment grade credit rating for the Group and consequently the financial strength of the major subsidiaries within the Group. Prior years' loan write-down balance on Maersk Supply Service A/S loan receivables remains recognised in 2020, while Maersk Container Industry A/S loan is settled.\n\n## Table 12.7 Liquidity risk\n\nIt is of great importance for the company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things by focusing on the release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.\n\nIf the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 6m (gain of USD 6m).\n\nThe borrowing interest levels is specified in table 12.6\n\nThe company has substantial exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, lease receivables, and other receivables. These are all considered to have low credit risk and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S applies the simple approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, also non-due trade receivables have been impaired.",

A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the company's profit or equity significantly.\n\n## Financial instruments carried at amortised cost\n\nFair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.\n\nFair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted interests and instalments.\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels:\n\n- Level 1  -  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2 -  Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)\n- Level 3 -  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\nFair value of listed shares falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable market data as of the end of the reporting period.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The consolidated financial statements are also in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe accounting policies of the company are consistent with those applied in the financial statements for 2019, apart from the fact that the company in December 2019 elected to early adopt the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 included in IASB's project 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform'.\n\nThe accounting policies are furthermore consistent with the accounting policies for the Group's financial statements (note 23 in the consolidated financial statements) with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are measured at cost or a lower recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 Dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as income at the time of declaration unless considered a return of capital in subsidiary\n- \u00b7 No segment information is disclosed\n- \u00b7 Value of granted share options, restricted shares and performance shares to employees in subsidiaries is expensed directly in the relevant subsidiary. At the time of the grant, the subsidiary settles the amount with A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S and the counter posting is made in equity. At the time of exercising, the proceeds are included in the company's equity.\n\n## Note 20  Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nWhen preparing the financial statements of the company, management undertakes a number of accounting estimates and judgements to recognise, measure and classify the company's assets and liabilities.\n\nEstimates that are material to the company's financial reporting are made on the basis of, inter alia, determination of impairment of financial non-current assets including subsidiaries and associated companies (including assets held for sale) and recognition and measurements of provisions. Reference is made to notes 4, 6 and 11.\n\nManagement assesses impairment indicators for investments in subsidiaries and associated companies and determines recoverable amount generally consistent with the assumptions described in notes 6, 7 and 24 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accounting estimates and judgements are described in further detail in note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nThe company has not yet adopted the following accounting standards/requirements:\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance contracts IFRS 17: An analysis of the impact is being assessed and is expected to be concluded in due course ahead of the implementation date.\n\nOther changes to IFRS are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,\n\n- intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the parent company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor's Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the\n\ndirection, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our Auditor's Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 with the filename APMM-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:\n\n- \u00b7 The preparing of the annual report in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7 The selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the consolidated financial statements presented in human-readable format; and\n- \u00b7 For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- \u00b7 Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 with the file name APMM-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\n## Copenhagen, 10 February 2021\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR no. 33 77 12 31\n\n## Mogens N\u00f8rgaard Mogensen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne21404\n\n## Lars Baungaard\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne23331",
