        "page_content": "## Letter from our CEO\n\n' In the midst of a global pandemic, we have focused on supporting our customers and have taken the first steps to transform Aegon into a more enduring, high-performance company.'\n\nLard Friese CEO Aegon\n\nThe past year was particularly challenging for everyone in terms of how we work and live. When I joined Aegon in March I was deeply impressed by how quickly our employees adapted to the new situation and maintained high levels of service to our customers and engagement with our business partners.\n\nWe took proactive steps to guide and support our customers during the difficulties they faced. For instance, we introduced the 'Blue Heart' program in the Netherlands that enabled people facing financial difficulties to postpone their payments. In China, we included COVID-19 coverage as part of our critical illness product range. Following the introduction of the CARES Act in the US, Transamerica helped customers navigate the complex regulations to access retirement savings in a penalty-free manner.\n\nOur employees' commitment was further illustrated by our US colleagues in Cedar Rapids, Iowa when a devastating storm hit the state in August. Everyone worked tirelessly to ensure uninterrupted service to customers, while supporting each other and their local communities during this extraordinarily difficult time.\n\nPrior to 2020, the idea of an international organization of over 22,000 people working from home was difficult to imagine. Yet, faced with the pandemic and a host of other challenges, our colleagues across the Group adapted swiftly to a different way of working, stayed focused and began executing on our plans to transform Aegon.\n\nOur employees still face challenges, ranging from working from home while caring for children, to being isolated from older family members, to coping with the mental strain of the drawnout pandemic. Aside from providing the IT tools and equipment needed to create a safe home-working environment, we have developed the 'Working from Home' framework, which sets vitality and engagement as priorities to support employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy delivering on our key aims of keeping fit, connected, and motivated, we have been able to improve our overall engagement as shown by the results of the 2020 Global Employee Survey.\n\n## New strategy\n\nAfter my appointment as CEO, we launched a detailed review of the Group. Aegon has not been performing up to its full potential for some time, and we are determined to take action to address this. The review established that we needed to sharpen our strategic focus, improve the way we allocate capital, build a true, high-performance culture, improve our operating discipline, and reduce our risk profile - all against the backdrop of a low interest rate environment and an uncertain economic outlook.\n\nWe announced Aegon's new strategy at our Capital Markets Day on December 10, 2020. Going forward, we are focusing on three core markets, three growth markets and one global asset manager. Our three core markets - the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom - are among the largest investment, protection, and retirement markets in the world. Our ambition is to play a leading role in each of them. In markets where we have sub-scale or niche positions, we will manage capital tightly and have a bias to exit. Additionally, we have decided to separate our businesses in our core markets into Financial Assets and Strategic Assets. Financial Assets are blocks of business which we have closed for new sales. They are capital intensive with relatively low returns on capital employed. Strategic Assets are businesses with a greater potential for an attractive return on capital, and where we are well-positioned for growth. We aim to release capital from Financial Assets over time and reallocate capital to Strategic Assets and growth markets.\n\n## Growth markets\n\nWe aim to increase market share in attractive growth markets through our successful partnerships in Spain, China, and Brazil.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nTogether with our partners, we will develop these businesses and capture the growth potential they provide by leveraging our global expertise and capabilities.\n\nSuccess in all our businesses will be underpinned by a global asset manager that has strong investment capabilities, thereby allowing our customers to make attractive returns on their investments. Similarly, our asset manager benefits from the links with our other businesses. For instance, the retirement platforms we operate in our core markets provide an opportunity to offer asset management solutions. Where appropriate we aim to increase the penetration of our own competitive, proprietary investment solutions across our retirement platforms over time.\n\n## Delivering on our plans\n\nIn the second half of 2020, we took the first concrete steps to deliver on our plans. We announced the divestments of Stonebridge and our operations in Central & Eastern Europe, restructured our businesses in India, Hong Kong, and Singapore and decided to cease funding of GoBear.\n\nMeasures taken to strengthen our balance sheet ensured that the capital ratios of our three main business units ended 2020 above their respective operating levels. Examples of the measures taken include the reinsurance of disability risk in our Dutch nonlife business and the sale of the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco. We also took the first steps towards our deleveraging target by repaying USD 500 million of senior debt.\n\nThe aim of rebasing the dividend - announced at the first halfyear results - is that dividend payments will be sustainable and well covered by the Free Cash Flows that we generate, even in reasonable stress scenarios. Our aim is to grow the dividend per share in line with recurring Free Cash Flows to around EUR 0.25 per share over 2023.\n\n## Granular operating plan\n\nTo ensure we deliver on our objectives, we have developed a rigorous and granular operating plan. The plan draws on input by over 1,500 employees to develop 1,100 initiatives aimed at reducing costs, expanding margins, and growing profitably. It includes an expense savings program targeting a EUR 400 million reduction in addressable expenses by 2023, representing a 13% savings over the addressable expense base of 2019. In 2020, we delivered on 260 initiatives, which puts us on track to deliver half of our expense savings 2023 target by the end of 2021. Of these savings, we intend to re-invest EUR 150 million in initiatives designed to deliver future growth in earnings.\n\nThere is still a lot of work ahead of us. We are building a high-performance culture within Aegon, investing in talent development, and focusing on delivery. We will operate with discipline and maintain an intense organizational rhythm to deliver on the transformation.\n\n## Responsible business\n\nWe believe that a solid environmental, social and governance (ESG) foundation is essential to long-term value creation. Further integration of ESG objectives into the overall strategy is a priority for Aegon. On January 1, 2020, we implemented a revised Group-wide Responsible Investment Policy and expanded the measurement of the carbon emissions associated with our investments. We are committed to strengthening Aegon's vision on sustainability and integrating it into our new business strategy. To drive this forward, I have appointed a Global Head of Corporate Sustainability, reporting directly to me, starting on January 1, 2021.\n\nWe are also making progress on inclusion and diversity across the Group. Aegon's 2020 Global Employee Survey shows that 79% of employees believe they can be their authentic selves at work and have equal opportunity to succeed. We also met our objective to have at least 30% women in senior management positions across Aegon by the end of 2020.\n\nWe see our progress on inclusion and diversity as steps along our pathway to create a workplace that reflects the diversity of the customers we serve and where the views and perceptions of our people encourages diversity of thought and innovation.\n\nWhile we are not there yet, we have a strong foundation to build upon. We are now including a gender diversity target into the remuneration for all Executive Board and Management Board members.\n\n## Aegon and the future\n\nOur purpose is to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security. We are making progress to become a leader in investment, protection, and retirement solutions, with trusted brands and leading retirement platforms in attractive markets. In our core markets, the shift away from defined benefit pension plans, together with low interest rates, mean our customers need to save more, not less. In addition, traditional government-based retirement systems are increasingly strained, and customers in our markets must take on greater individual responsibility for retirement planning. Aegon will draw on its long years of experience and extensive distribution reach to support them with the right solutions. By serving our customers' evolving needs in a changing world, Aegon creates long-term value that is shared with all its stakeholders.\n\n## Thank you\n\nLooking back on a challenging year, I am pleased that we have supported our customers and taken the first steps to transform Aegon into a more enduring, high-performance company. I am very grateful to everyone who has contributed to this and I look forward to continuing with you on this exciting journey.\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands, March 17, 2021\n\n## Lard Friese\n\nCEO of Aegon\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## COVID-19\n\nSince the first outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, Aegon has been directly affected by the pandemic. We recognize it has had a significant impact and created challenges for our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. Throughout the pandemic, we have taken proactive steps to support our stakeholders as/uni00A0we navigate through this challenging period together.\n\n## Impact on Aegon's financial performance Earnings and capital\n\nIn terms of underlying earnings before tax, the greatest impact of the pandemic has been on Aegon Americas' life insurance business. In 2020, higher mortality led to higher life insurance claims, adversely impacting earnings. In the second half of the year, increased mortality claims were offset by stronger performance of certain product groups. In particular, claims activity within Aegon's long-term care/uni00A0(LTC)/uni00A0insurance business fell, leading to favorable morbidity experience as a result of the/uni00A0pandemic. Lower interest rates - resulting from more muted economic growth expectations and central bank stimulus - also had a negative impact on Aegon's earnings in the Americas. The/uni00A0earnings repercussions for Aegon's other major country units have been limited, although the Netherlands experienced a/uni00A0rise in travel and disability insurance claims when the pandemic first struck.\n\nOn the basis of the first half 2020 results - which reflected the impact of COVID-19 and lower interest rates - and in light of the uncertain economic outlook, Aegon withdrew its 20192021 financial targets in August 2020. Throughout the year, we took steps to strengthen our balance sheet and improve the Company's risk profile. In this context, we decided to retain the final dividend for 2019 and rebase the interim dividend from a level of 15 cents per share for 2019 to 6 cents per common share for 2020. Rebasing of the dividend ensures that it is sustainable and well-covered by the free cash flows that we generate, even in reasonable stress scenarios. Furthermore, several actions were taken to increase the capital position of Aegon and its main units. As a result, the capital positions of the main units ended the year above their respective operating levels.\n\n## Expenses and sales\n\nA series of lockdown measures and travel restrictions in Aegon's key operating markets throughout 2020 caused disruption to our normal ways of engaging with our customers and one another. This significantly reduced our expenses, in part due to restrictions on employee travel, as well as the scaling back of sales and marketing activities. While generating savings, the pandemic also triggered additional expenditures, such as information technology (IT) costs associated with switching to a working-from-home set-up. Some of these savings will dissipate as normal business practices resume. However, others will become permanent, as Aegon has taken the lessons learned from working from home into account when developing a program to reduce addressable expenses by EUR 400 million by 2023.\n\nAegon's sales teams have been resourceful in adapting to this new landscape, though restrictions on our sales and marketing activities have had a negative impact on sales in certain cases. In Spain and Portugal, sales of property and casualty insurance products fell in 2020 due to the temporary closure of retail banks, which provide an essential distribution channel. Meanwhile, a challenging economic and employment environment, coupled with government measures to combat the pandemic, has dampened customer demand, and hence sales, within specific product lines. US sales of retirement plan products fell during 2020, while travel restrictions and challenging market conditions severely affected sales within Transamerica Life Bermuda (Aegon's high-net-worth business operating in Hong/uni00A0Kong, Singapore, and Bermuda).",

Since the very start of the pandemic, we have taken proactive measures to help our colleagues and other partners navigate this intensely challenging period.\n\n## A stable environment for our employees\n\nIn early 2020, our first priority was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees around the world. Swift, decisive action by our IT staff allowed our teams to transition smoothly to homebased working. As well as IT tools and hardware, we also provided colleagues with desk furniture to make the switch as practical and comfortable as possible. Alongside this, we have worked hard to give our employees the tools and day-to-day support they need to feel happy and motivated while working outside the office. To formalize this approach, we introduced a 'Working from Home' framework to help staff sustain good levels of wellbeing, engagement, and productivity during lockdown.\n\n## Guiding our customers and partners through the pandemic\n\nWe are acutely aware of the difficulties and disruption that the pandemic has caused for our customers, suppliers, and other partners. Our smooth transition to working from home and fast adoption of virtual conferencing tools such as Microsoft Teams, have enabled us to maintain an uninterrupted service for Aegon customers worldwide. We have also gone one step further, by exploring innovative ways to remain closely connected to our customers and provide additional support during this challenging time. As a result, Aegon's customer-facing teams in the Netherlands recorded their best-ever relational NPS (rNPS) scores during the pandemic. rNPS is an important gauge of customer satisfaction. New digital solutions have played an important role: in Spain, we have launched a new tele-health service for local customers, providing free medical advice on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, we have remained sensitive to our customers' evolving concerns. Aegon the Netherlands, for instance, has launched the 'Blue Heart' campaign to provide customers with flexibility around their insurance, pension, and mortgage payments. In China, we have included COVID-19 coverage as part of our critical illness product range to help give people peace of mind.\n\nJust as we have gone the extra mile for our customers, we have also reached out to our suppliers to provide additional support during the pandemic. In early 2020, Aegon worked with its outsourced IT teams in India to help them transition to working from home and ensure continuity of critical IT services.\n\n## Supporting Aegon's communities\n\nAs a company that strives to be a good corporate citizen, we recognize the importance of offering immediate COVID-19related support to the communities in which we operate. In 2020, our initial focus was on providing direct relief to local charities and supporting key workers on the front lines. In the United States, Aegon worked with its partners to provide personal protective equipment/uni00A0(PPE) to healthcare professionals. Our teams in Asia donated money to World Vision, a Hong Kong-based relief and development organization, for the purchase of face masks, as well as health education programs. Aegon the Netherlands also contributed EUR 250,000 for healthcare workers' insurance through the Dutch Insurance Association.\n\nAway from the frontlines, Aegon donated food and medical supplies to elderly people across Europe who have been affected by the pandemic. In the Netherlands, we gave our support to educational charities that are helping disadvantaged children with home-schooling by providing free laptops.\n\nAround the world, Aegon employees have been closely involved in fundraising efforts to boost our community support initiatives. Many have also donated their time and expertise in other ways. Aegon the Netherlands, helped to spearhead a program led by Nibud (the Dutch National Institute for Family Finance Information) to train financial services workers to offer support and advice to people on managing their personal finances during the pandemic. Aegon employees have responded enthusiastically to this initiative, which aligns with our purpose of helping people achieve a lifetime of financial security.\n\nFinancial information",

The five reporting segments are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Americas\n- \u25a0 Aegon the Netherlands\n- \u25a0 Aegon UK\n- \u25a0 Aegon International\n- \u25a0 Aegon Asset Management (AAM)\n\nAs a global financial services group, Aegon is well equipped to share capital, talent, knowledge, processes, and technologies across geographies and business lines. In our three core markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), our three growth markets (Spain and Portugal, Brazil, and China) and AAM, we take a systematic approach to allocating capital toward profitable opportunities. Full details on our strategy can be found on page 19.\n\n## Ownership\n\nAegon N.V. is a Dutch public limited liability company. Our shares are listed on both Amsterdam (Euronext) and New York (NYSE) stock exchanges. Approximately three-quarters of our shareholders are from our three core markets: the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Shareholders meet at least once per year at our Annual General Meeting (AGM). In 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions, the AGM was held virtually.\n\n## Sources of revenues and earnings\n\nAegon derives revenues and earnings from insurance premiums, investment returns, fees, and commissions received. We are welldiversified across these sources, which is important for our ability to pay attractive dividends and to invest in future growth.\n\n## Capital position\n\nWe carefully manage our capital position to protect Aegon and our customers against fluctuations in global financial markets and changing business conditions. At the end of 2020, our Solvency II ratio - measuring our capital strength - stood at 196%. The capital ratios of our three main units ended 2020 above their respective operating levels. We hold significant capital buffers, both within the operating entities and at group level, to safeguard the interests of our policyholders, pay attractive dividends to shareholders, and take advantage of future business opportunities.\n\n## Diversified distribution channels\n\nAegon offers both direct and intermediary-assisted access to our products and services throughout all our divisions. In this way, we bring our customers the very best of the solutions offered by Aegon and our partners.\n\nWe offer simple solutions as well as more sophisticated ones. For simpler types of solutions, we are growing our direct distribution capabilities so we can engage with customers directly - for example, via our Dutch digital bank, Knab.\n\nFor more complex services and products, we use our network of business partners, including brokers, agents, banks, employee benefit consultants, and independent financial advisors. Our multichannel approach to intermediary distribution serves a diverse array of customers, allowing us to provide tailored advice and advanced solutions.\n\nSome of our distribution channels are owned by Aegon. For example, we serve customers through Origen Financial Services in the United Kingdom and through World Financial Group in the United States and Canada. We also develop e-commerce partnerships, for example in China.\n\n## Where our earnings come from\n\n(underlying earnings before tax, in EUR millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Total number includes Holding and others (not shown in chart).",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Our business environment\n\nAegon operates in a complex environment. Our business is potentially sensitive to a wide range of social, economic, and environmental factors, all of which are constantly changing and we are continuously adapting our business to this evolving environment. We capture these in our 'Business Environment Scan' process.\n\n## A challenging macroeconomic environment\n\nFollowing relatively strong growth in 2019, global economic output in our markets contracted sharply during the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Full or partial lockdowns in many countries and regions played a significant part in curtailing economic activity. The subsequent easing of lockdown restrictions saw growth rebound in the second half of the year. However, the reintroduction of tougher measures to prevent the virus from spreading later in 2020 means that economic uncertainty - in many regions - will continue to persist into 2021.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic is being felt across the global economy. Public deficits and debt have been pushed up; meanwhile, temporary business closures and a disrupted value chain have created a range of challenges for parts of the private sector, with unemployment increasing accordingly. We also expect to see a rise in bankruptcies and non-performing loans; though, this threat has so far been mitigated by the proactive response of governments and central banks. These challenges are likely to persist, at least until vaccination programs against COVID-19 become widespread.\n\nThe overall economic fall-out will be far-reaching, and many forecasters expect the economic impact of the virus to be felt for several years to come. COVID-19-related government stimulus packages, on top of already relaxed monetary policies, could lead to delayed inflation. However, at the present time, low nominal interest rates make savings fundamentally less attractive and represent a major headwind to our businesses, particularly in the United States and Europe. While there is a risk of higher inflation in the longer term, we expect a 'lower for longer' interest rate environment to continue to shape our business strategies in the medium term.\n\nThe pandemic has aggravated other underlying economic trends, with disruptions to global supply chains forcing businesses\n\nto revert to more localized ways of working. Meanwhile, we see a trend from globalization toward greater regionalization, as illustrated by strained China-US relations, as well as growing protectionist sentiment in Europe and other major economies.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 on our customers\n\nThe past year has seen sharp increases in mortality rates worldwide, driven largely by COVID-19. Victims are mostly elderly or individuals who have underlying health conditions, including those in nursing homes. While governments worldwide have introduced measures to protect the most vulnerable, infections and deaths have remained consistently high in many regions. That/uni00A0said, COVID-19 induced mortality was lower amongst the insured population than in the wider population.\n\nAnother impact from COVID-19 on our Long-Term Care customers in the United States has been the concern with respect to nursing care. Transamerica has seen a reduction in the number of new Long-Term Care claims, which may be driven by hesitation of entering care facilities due to the higher presence of COVID-19.\n\nBeside their physical health, people are also being impacted by the pandemic in other ways, with many individuals dealing with stress and poor mental health. Employment concerns are often part of this: 58% of US workers recently surveyed by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies\u00ae said COVID-19 has had an impact on their employment situation.\n\nGovernments have acted decisively to alleviate the pandemic's impact on individuals. In many cases, and particularly in the United Kingdom and United States, measures have included allowing individuals to access their pension savings. While these actions reduce short-term financial stress for individuals, they leave people at an increased risk of poverty in old age.\n\nAt a time when many people are facing severe financial difficulties, there is an increased need for personalized solutions",

At Aegon, our focus throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has been on moving closer to our customers and finding new ways to meet their needs. This includes financial protection products that address the new challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\n## Increased pressure on retirement systems\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, retirement systems around the world had been undergoing severe financial strain as a result of increased longevity, population aging, and the prolonged lowinterest rate environment. Government benefits, such as social security, have been facing severe funding shortages, and reforms are urgently needed. The traditional pension plans offered by employers have been replaced with employee-funded defined contribution plans, which may or may not be supplemented by employer contributions. Individuals are increasingly being expected to self-fund a greater portion of their retirement income, though relatively few are equipped to do so.\n\nAlthough its long-term effects are still unclear, the pandemic has further exposed the fragility of retirement systems. Indeed, nearly one-quarter of US workers surveyed by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies\u00ae about the impact of the pandemic felt less confident about being able to retire comfortably.\n\nThere is an opportunity for social partners to resolve these pressing issues. Private retirement solutions have an increasingly important part to play, both in raising awareness and in educating the public on the need to save for retirement.\n\nEmployers play a vital role in helping workers successfully prepare for retirement; a role that has become even more crucial and precarious amid the pandemic. They can support their employees by offering an employer-sponsored retirement plan and by encouraging workers to engage in retirement planning. However, employers must also be supported by public policy. The world's response to COVID-19 illustrates the extent to which we - and our economic, health, and social security systems - are dependent on each other.\n\n## Retirement readiness\n\nAccording to the results of Aegon's Retirement Readiness Survey 2020, only one-quarter of workers feel they are on course to achieve the income they will need during their retirement (globally, this is an average of 67% of a worker's current income). Around 44% of respondents say they are not on track, and the final onethird do not know whether they are on track. 1\n\nWith individuals taking on increasing responsibility for funding their retirement, these responses demonstrate that more must be done to help people feel confident about the future. At Aegon, we endeavor to meet this need, which aligns with our purpose to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Yes, I am on course to achieve my retirement income\n- No, I am on course to achieve around three-quarters (75%) of my retirement income\n- No, I am on course to achieve half of my retirement income\n- No, I am on course to achieve around one-quarter (25%) of my retirement income\n- I don't know if I am on course to achieve my retirement income\n- 1 Percentages are shown to zero decimal places.

A joint study by the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), published in June 2020, highlighted the exposure of Dutch financial institutions to risks linked to biodiversity loss. According to the study, Dutch financial institutions worldwide have more than EUR 510 billion invested in companies with a high or very high dependency on one or more ecosystems, which represents 36% of the researched portfolio.\n\nClimate-related risks may feature more heavily in future insurance regulations. In October 2020, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published\n\na consultation on the use of climate change risk scenarios\n\nin Own Risk and Solvency Assessments (ORSAs) that stressed the need for forward-looking management of climate changerelated risks. In a previous publication, DNB set out a series of best practices for integrating climate-related risks in ORSAs. There are also reputational risks to consider. Increased societal awareness around climate change has brought the perceived role of the insurance and wider financial services industry into sharp focus. Organizations that fail to address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in their communications and actions may face long-term reputational consequences.\n\nAt the same time, with ESG and sustainability investments now accounting for more than one-quarter of assets under management worldwide, companies increasingly view sustainability as a key value driver. Asset managers, in particular, can support investors in developing their sustainable investment ambitions. More widely, today's organizations increasingly recognize their responsibility to lead by example and encourage sustainable practices when engaging with customers.\n\nFinancial information",

It looks beyond impact alone to assess the potential of topics to influence ongoing value creation, as shown by the materiality matrix below. In 2020, we re-evaluated and refreshed the BES by engaging with relevant internal and external experts, as well as selected stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), business partners, and customers. While we see many opportunities for our business, we are also mindful of potential challenges ahead. The BES takes into account the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, and its impact on Aegon's business and wider market environment.\n\nIt is important to note that, while the BES incorporates findings from Aegon's own overarching risk management process, the exercise is also informed by many other sources. The BES provides a 'helicopter' view of the material macro-scale headwinds and tailwinds specific to our business operations, as assessed by our experts and viewed by our stakeholders.

It also means we can provide more personalized and convenient products, as well as a better customer experience. Furthermore, by paying attention to issues of data protection and information security, we can establish strong, long-term customer relationships by building trust with the people we support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customer propositions and technological innovation\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Challenge\n\nAegon is exploring the potential of innovative technologies to help us offer our customers new solutions and improved levels of service. This approach involves close collaboration with fintech and insurtech companies to harness their knowledge and innovation capabilities. Technological advances allow us to be more flexible in our product offering, offering increasing focus on customer well-being, early diagnostics, and health tracking, among other areas. By moving to a service model based on preventive as well as protective services, we can adapt to the evolution of our traditional customer segments. With shifting socio-demographic categories and the emergence of new modes of employment (for example, 'gig economy' work and working from home), digital innovations will allow us to tailor our service offering around individuals' needs. Meanwhile, we can continue to integrate our social purpose into our products, for instance by offering tailored solutions to vulnerable customers, such as people diagnosed with HIV, or by promoting savings plans and financial education to individuals impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCustomers increasingly expect a seamless digital journey with Aegon, and they expect us to play a proactive, positive role in society. To maintain our strong relationships with our partners and customers, we need to keep abreast of changes in our industry and in the digital landscape. Doing so allows us to stay ahead of our traditional competitors as well as an emerging generation of fintechs and insurtechs. Furthermore, since business development and innovation often take place at the business unit level, Aegon must ensure that all global business units and teams are working toward cohesive and consistent innovative customer solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reputation\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Challenge\n\nAegon relies on the trust of all of our stakeholders. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have the opportunity to further prove our trustworthiness as a company by integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into our core business and by striving to have a positive impact on society at large. How we engage with our customers around ESG is also important. By communicating in a transparent and empathetic way, and offering our customers and stakeholders the support they need, we can ensure our reputation is protected and enhanced. We can also take advantage of social and digital media to spread our message to new audiences. Equally, it is important that we continue to select third-party providers that reflect positively on our brand and reputation.\n\nSociety expects insurers to pay attention to a wide range of ESG factors; failure to do so creates the possibility of long-term reputational damage from the perspective of customers and investors. It is particularly easy for trust to be lost in times of heightened tension such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate the potential for reputational damage, Aegon must remain mindful of the needs of all stakeholders when launching new or amending existing propositions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4 Low rates, low economic growth and/uni00A0high/uni00A0debts\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Challenge\n\nAegon has been working on the assumption of 'lower for longer' interest rates for/uni00A0some time, and we closely monitor credit rating and default developments. We are therefore well-positioned to manage through market dislocations to protect value for our stakeholders. Furthermore, the growing pressure on state finances as a result of weak economic growth and debt challenges, in part due to the impact of COVID-19, has led to a shift in responsibility for adequately saving for retirement, and subsequently converting savings into a lifetime income, to the individual. We are prepared to play a greater societal role in supporting individuals through retirement by taking steps to increase the range of products and solutions we offer and to expand our offering to new user groups beyond our traditional customer base.\n\nThe global economic outlook is uncertain in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term. The pandemic has pushed up public debt and deficits and raised the likelihood of non-performing loans. The possibility of a debt crisis and sustained low economic growth increases as the pandemic goes on, and with it the probability of a persistent low-interest-rate environment. The threat is difficult to mitigate as it depends on factors largely outside our control. However, we must be aware of its significance to our activities, including our role as an investor, and we must continue to monitor our counterparty and concentration risks. In this way, we can tailor our business strategies and investments to manage the situation.\n\nCyberattacks can cause damage to the interests of customers and stakeholders and undermine their trust in Aegon. Threats are becoming more sophisticated, and malicious actors are taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing to launch increasingly complex attacks. Moreover, data management requirements are evolving quickly: the potential for large fines from regulators and class action litigation is growing. Aegon must continue to invest in information security to protect our business, and our customers' information, from an evolving cyberthreat landscape.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 5 Pandemic\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Challenge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMajor health crises, such as COVID-19, provide opportunities for Aegon to prove its relevance by helping customers concerned about their shortand long-term health. The pandemic is also an opportunity to show customers the importance of secure financial planning. Alongside our established longterm financial products, we can provide new preventive services such as health management and monitoring. We can also capitalize on the recent rapid developments in remote customer service and advice to improve digital and in-person customer journeys in the future.\n\n## 6 People skills\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Challenge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith technology playing an ever-growing role in financial services, Aegon can establish itself as a leading employer that is home to a diverse and highly skilled workforce. Through interesting and forward-looking work, future-focused training opportunities - such as our Analytics Accelerator program - and strong inclusion, diversity, and engagement policies, we can attract and develop the wide range of talented people we need to drive our future growth strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 7 Trade wars, regionalization, and protectionism\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Challenge\n\nAt Aegon, we are able to use our geographic diversity (with activities in the United Kingdom, Europe, the Americas, and Asia) to our advantage. We invest in our regional teams to ensure Aegon is represented on the ground by market experts in our local financial markets.\n\n## 8 Climate change and loss of biodiversity\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Challenge\n\nAegon has robust systems in place to monitor the environmental impact of our/uni00A0direct business activities as well as our investments. By deploying and strengthening these resources, we can continue to take steps to ensure we have a positive impact on the planet and help safeguard the environment for future generations. At the same time, the further integration of ESG into our core strategy will allow us to support our customers by addressing their concerns around climate change and biodiversity loss by shifting our investment portfolio into more ESG-aligned areas. Taking a proactive stance on climate change and other environmental and ESG issues is likely to provide Aegon with long-term commercial opportunities: increasingly, companies that think and act responsibly enjoy a 'sustainability premium' that enables them to attract like-minded customers and employees.\n\nWe must continue to embed environmental considerations into our business and investment decisions, to avoid damaging the planet and to minimize the potential for negative impacts associated with environmental changes outside our control. At the same time, while direct physical risks to Aegon from exceptional environmental catastrophes and loss of biodiversity are limited, new regulatory requirements on climate change are highly likely to be relevant to our business. We will need to be ready to comply with any new regulations. We also recognize that environmental and other ESG-related topics are increasingly front of mind for Aegon's stakeholders, and there is a possibility of reputational damage if we do not demonstrate our commitment to protecting the environment.\n\nWe have little influence over global political processes, and potential barriers to accessing certain markets are beyond our control. We are active in markets in the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, where trade negotiations may continue to be particularly volatile in years ahead. This could pose problems for Aegon's businesses in those regions.\n\nAs our industry becomes increasingly technology-driven, skills shortages will become more prominent, creating a challenging recruitment environment. This situation is currently being exacerbated as so-called baby boomers (people born between 1946 and 1964) enter retirement. Aegon must be able to compete with different industries, as well as our direct competitors, to attract new talent. New hires must possess the skills required not only for today's business but also for the financial services industry of the future. Technology is a key area of focus when it comes to selecting new employees and in the development of internal training programs for our current workforce, while risk management, financial modeling, and sales and marketing are also increasingly valuable skillsets.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (and possible next waves, mutations, or other viruses) raises mortality rates and increases claim payouts in the short term. The pandemic also increases the likelihood of bankruptcy or receivership among Aegon's corporate customers, which would impact our pensions business. The outbreak has also had wider economic impacts that affect us and the third parties we work with. To counter third-party risks and improve business continuity management, we have put in place enhanced monitoring and reporting procedures to identify issues at critical and high-risk third parties. Major health crises also threaten our human capital and the well-being of our employees. It is important that we retain the flexibility to adjust our ways of working and that we are able to support our staff and retain their engagement throughout future challenges. Embedding effective measures for transitioning to remote working in our crisis response plans allows us to react quickly to new health threats and maintain business continuity.",

We do this by providing investments, protection, and retirement solutions that directly address the needs of a world where life expectancies are increasing, and careers and retirement are lengthening and becoming more flexible. While healthcare is increasingly effective, it is also becoming expensive as public and corporate sources of lifelong pensions and care are transferring risk to individuals in the face of financial pressure.\n\n## Focused portfolio and capital management\n\nIn 2020, Aegon embarked on the transformation of our organization, with a new strategic focus aimed at changing our performance trajectory and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. As part of our new direction, we are narrowing our strategic focus to selected core and growth markets, as well as one global asset management business. Aegon's three core markets are the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, which are among the largest retirement, investment, and protection markets in the world. Our growth markets are Spain and Portugal, Brazil, and China. Together, our core and growth markets represent more than 50% of global GDP.\n\nAs part of this focused approach, we will explore opportunities for expansion in these regions, including capitalizing on local growth opportunities, building strong local partnerships, and pursuing promising sales and distribution channels. Alongside this, Aegon Asset Management (AAM) - a key enabler for success - will implement a new global operating platform, allowing us to capitalize on economies of scale, realize synergies, and grow our third-party assets.\n\nIn small markets or markets where we have sub-scale or niche positions, we will manage capital tightly and have a bias to exit. The agreement to sell our Central & Eastern European (CEE) businesses exemplifies the actions we are taking to increase our focus.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Aegon decided to restructure TLB as well as its business in India. TLB - a high-net-worth business operating in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Bermuda has responded to challenging market conditions by rightsizing the organization through a variety of expense reduction initiatives. TLB will pivot to products that are not only capitallight, but will offer an attractive value proposition for its customers as well. In India, unprofitable and sub-scale traditional\n\nsales channels have been closed, and the company's focus is fully on digital distribution channels going forward.\n\n## Disciplined capital management\n\nWithin our core markets, our strategy is to distinguish between our Financial Assets and our Strategic Assets. We will reallocate capital from the former to the latter, as well as to our growth markets.\n\nStrategic Assets are businesses with a greater potential for an attractive return on capital, and where we are well-positioned for growth. In these businesses, we will pursue opportunities to increase our customer base through new sales and customer retention, by improving both the customer and the advisor experience. In the United States, these businesses include Workplace Solutions, as well as selected product lines in the Individual Solutions division: Term Life, Whole Life, and Indexed Universal Life.\n\nAegon will also continue to sell mutual funds, stable value solutions and selected individual retirement products, such as accumulation variable annuities with limited interest rate sensitivity. In the Netherlands, Strategic Assets include defined contribution Workplace Solutions and mortgage origination, where we aim to maintain our leadership positions. We will also look to expand our niche position with our Dutch online bank, Knab, which will serve as a digital gateway to individual retirement solutions. In the United Kingdom, the business as a whole is considered a Strategic Asset, and we will continue to invest in our market-leading platform to improve the digital experience for customers, advisors and employers.\n\nFinancial Assets are blocks of business that are generally closed for new sales. They are capital intensive and offer relatively low returns, often due to the low interest rate environment. While continuing to serve our customers, we will run these businesses for optimal financial outcomes, maximizing the net present value of free cash flows and seeking opportunities to reduce and release capital. For example, in the Netherlands, we will no longer offer new defined benefit group pension products and individual life products, with the exception of direct annuities. In the United States, variable annuities with significant interest rate sensitive living and death benefit riders, stand-alone individual long-term care, and fixed annuities are considered to be Financial Assets. We are reviewing the potential to implement a dynamic hedging strategy for variable annuities with income and death benefit riders. Subsequently, we will consider a broad range of options for this block of business.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Aligning our organization to our strategy\n\nTo realize our transformation, we will shift to an intense organizational rhythm, and operate with a clear and more disciplined governance. This means that we will adapt our target operating model. A prime example of this adaption is that we are establishing dedicated teams to manage the Financial Assets in the United States and in the Netherlands. We will appoint executives to these teams who have the competencies, skills, and mindset to manage these books for optimal financial outcomes.\n\nWe will also speed up decision-making and install clear accountabilities. We will move to a concept of 'accountability within a clear framework'. In this new model the Group sets strategy, allocates capital, defines risk appetite, sets targets, and drives strategy implementation. In addition, the Group determines functional mandates, sets policies and frameworks, and provides shareholder services. Business units develop local strategies within the group strategic framework, as well as operating plans to ensure their implementation.\n\nIn order to implement this transformation, we will invest in our execution capabilities and skills to nurture great talent across the Group and will hire new talent where appropriate. We need to ensure that talented people are in the right positions, and we need to enable them to continue developing.\n\n## Increasing profitable growth\n\nWe are working to materially improve our operating performance by reducing costs, expanding margins, and growing profitably. Our approach is supported by a rigorous and granular operating plan, which includes an expense savings program targeting a cost reduction of EUR 400 million by 2023 compared with 2019 levels, representing 13% of the addressable expense base. Of these savings, Aegon will reinvest EUR 150 million in business growth. In addition to the expense savings initiatives, activities targeting revenue growth are expected to contribute a total of EUR 150 million to earnings by 2023. These include growing in our affiliate distribution channels, optimizing pricing and products, improving customer retention, and increasing cross-selling, as well as increasing the conversion of assets under administration to assets managed in house by AAM.\n\nFurther to improving Aegon's long-term profitability, we are taking steps to create a more robust and financially resilient business that offers greater predictability and stability in our performance and financial strength. In particular, we aim to limit interest rate sensitivity, as well as our sensitivity to other financial market movements, while strengthening our balance sheet and reducing debt. For example, we have put plans in place to reduce our economic interest rate exposure in the United States by one third to one half and we have implemented improvements to our internal model that mitigate the volatility caused by the basis risk between the reference portfolio used for the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) volatility adjustment and our own asset portfolio.\n\n## Creating value\n\nAs part of our new strategic approach, we have identified several areas that will contribute to profitable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders over the coming years.\n\n## Growing our customer base\n\nAegon will continue to develop its extensive base of almost 30.4 million individual customers. We will do this by increasing market penetration and improving retention in markets where we are well-positioned for growth and that offer potential attractive returns on capital. Specifically, we will explore opportunities to grow Strategic Assets in our core markets and in our growth markets, examples of which are our life business in China and our bancassurance business in Spain and Portugal.\n\n## Enhanced customer experiences\n\nBy modernizing our business processes and technology, we can enhance the user experience, namely by introducing straightthrough processing to execute customer requests much faster, while offering new and improved customer propositions. We will also continue to invest in self-service capabilities for our customers, offering them choices in terms of how they interact with Aegon.\n\nWe believe high-quality digital tools go hand in hand with strong customer relationships, and we see these as two sides of the same coin. As we develop our front-end advisor and customer portals, we will make sure our interaction with customers remains human and empathetic. We have already made inroads in several of our core and growth markets. For example, in the United Kingdom, we are investing in our platform to improve the digital experience for our customers, while simultaneously enabling Aegon's advisors and other colleagues to work more productively and efficiently.\n\n## Improving margins\n\nWe are identifying ways to improve margins by reducing expenses, increasing efficiency, and pursuing opportunities for profitable growth across Aegon's different markets and business lines. Within our core markets, we have carefully identified specific opportunities for profitable growth, for example by expanding our use of proprietary investment solutions.\n\nAAM's move to a global operating platform will enable us to streamline our operations and improve profitability. Our new globalized approach will drive growth in affiliated channels and in third-party assets where competitive strength exists.\n\nTo support these actions and realize our growth objectives, we will continue to build a high-performance culture, invest in talent development, and focus on delivery. We intend to build on our strengths: our brands, our extensive global customer base, and our deep expertise in designing solutions, managing assets, and creating distribution networks. In this way, we are confident we will be able to better support our customers and fulfill our purpose.",

Across our global business units, we are replacing legacy information technology (IT) infrastructures and processes with a more innovative, digitalized operating model. At the same time, we are developing a more agile working environment that will allow us to absorb new ideas and technologies into our core business more easily.\n\nSet against this long-term digitization strategy, we are also mindful of the possible IT risks created by people working from home during the pandemic. We are therefore taking steps to minimize cyberthreats as well as other potential hazards.\n\n## Faster, smoother, more efficient\n\nBy transforming and digitalizing more of the customerfacing side of our business, we can offer existing Aegon customers a smoother and more cohesive experience. This will also create opportunities for innovative product offerings and open up new markets for our services. For example, in the UK Aegon launched a workplace app that is helping plan members improve their financial wellbeing, allowing them to view their pension information and to understand their investments even better.\n\nMore generally, we are improving the overall user journey for customers who want to do business online. From an operational perspective, a more automated, technologydriven approach will reduce costs and enhance critical functions such as sales and distribution, pricing, claims management, fraud detection, and risk analysis.\n\nFor example, as part of our qualitative-to-quantitative (Q2Q) underwriting pilot in Transamerica, we have launched a state-of-the-art electronic application for our intermediaries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhich ensures that nearly all submissions are in good order and therefore enables agent-friendly and customer-friendly instant decision making for the vast majority of applications.\n\n## Doing more with data\n\nA foundation of our digital transformation strategy is improving how we manage, process, and store data. We have set a three-year timeframe to transfer all our data assets from Aegon's regional data centers to the cloud. With better and more cohesive stewardship and ownership, we can use our data in a more intelligent way to benefit customers and grow our business, while making sure we continue to comply fully with laws and regulations. For example, we have significantly improved our pricing models for mortgages and P&C insurance at Aegon The Netherlands which helped us to maintain the attractive economics amid intense competition.\n\nPeople are also a key ingredient of our digital transformation strategy. We have built analytical teams in all major country units to ensure close alignment of these competencies with the local businesses.\n\n## Developing for the digital age\n\nAt the same time, we are helping existing Aegon employees develop their digital skills and knowledge. Our learning management system, which is open to all employees, offers a range of IT, compliance, and digital training options. We also offer in-depth training on specialist topics, including through our Analytics Accelerator program.\n\nAs well as deepening our internal talent, we are working closely with promising technology-driven companies in our industry to tap into their knowledge and innovation capabilities in fintech and insurtech. Within Aegon, our drive for digital transformation has already borne fruit in the form of new businesses, such as Knab, our wholly owned digital bank in the Netherlands.",

Interest rates dropped considerably in the United States, whereas equity markets and credit spreads were extremely volatile globally. This had a marked impact on Aegon's financial results. Furthermore, excess mortality induced by the pandemic had a negative impact on our earnings in the United States. Overall, the Group demonstrated resilience, as demonstrated by the capital ratios of our main business units all being above their operating levels. New medium-term external targets were introduced in December 2020. Aegon has already made good progress toward these targets, as underscored by the expense savings and deleveraging achieved in 2020.\n\n## Financial targets and performance\n\nAegon's underlying earnings before tax amounted to EUR 1,729 million in 2020, a decrease of 12% compared with 2019. All business units except the United States showed improved performance, partially driven by expense savings. Results in the United States decreased due to the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, namely adverse mortality and lower interest rates. Net income amounted to EUR 55 million in 2020, versus EUR 1,525 million in 2019. The/uni00A0decrease was driven primarily by the adverse impact of assumption updates in the United States. As part of our annual/uni00A0assumption review process, we lowered our interest rate/uni00A0assumptions and updated our Life and Long-Term Care assumptions, which led to a stronger balance sheet. For further details, please refer to the Results of Operations section of this report.\n\nIn 2020, we took several actions to strengthen our balance sheet and improve the Company's risk profile. In this context, we decided to retain the final dividend for 2019 and rebase the interim dividend from a level of 15 cents per share for 2019 to 6 cents for 2020. Rebasing the dividend ensures that it is sustainable and well covered by the free cash flows that we generate, even in reasonable stress scenarios. Free cash flows in excess of what was needed to cover shareholder dividends and holding company expenses were used to repay USD 500 million senior debt in December 2020. Furthermore, actions were taken to improve the capital positions of Aegon's business units, as well as to reduce the volatility of their capital ratios. The capital ratios of each of Aegon's main business units ended the year above their respective operating levels.\n\nIn December 2020, Aegon introduced new three-year financial targets, covering the period to 2023. The new targets reflect Aegon's focus on deleveraging, reducing addressable expenses, generating free cash flows, and growing returns for the Company's shareholders.\n\n## Non-financial performance\n\nDuring 2020, Aegon had six non-financial indicators that were tied directly to specific aspects of our strategy. They also helped us address material topics and measure progress toward our objectives as both as a provider of financial services to our customers and as an employer.\n\nThrough these metrics, we can demonstrate an increase in the value we provided to our customers in 2020. Our total customer base increased by 1.4% to 30.4 million, an endorsement of our value proposition reflected by the loyalty of our existing customer base. This value is also reflected through the decisions of 4.6 million customers to entrust us in 2020, an 8% increase in the rate of new customer additions. These results are borne out by our Net Promoter Score (NPS) for 2020, which saw the proportion of our businesses performing above the average of our peers reach 32%.\n\nWith respect to the value we provide our employees, we are pleased to see that reflected in the marked increase in the employee engagement score in 2020, with a five point increase over 2019.",

In terms of our business partners, we rolled out the EcoVadis platform to enhance our ability to evaluate the ESG performance of our suppliers and to use the leverage of our EUR 1.6 billion procurement spend for the benefit of wider\n\nsociety. On an even larger scale, we are using the leverage of our/uni00A0investments to drive benefits for society; to this end we actively pursued 575 ESG-related engagements with companies in 2020, a 60% increase since 2018. We are also increasing the transparency of our portfolio, notably, in 2020 we extended the disclosure of the carbon footprint of our investments through the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to cover our global General Account holdings.\n\n## External targets 2021 - 2023\n\n| Metric                             | Target                                                        | 2020                                                                                                             | 2019                                             |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Reduce leverage                    | EUR 5.0 - 5.5 billion of gross financial leverage             | EUR 6.0 billion                                                                                                  | EUR 6.7 billion                                  |\n| Implement expense savings          | EUR 400 million lower addressable expenses,  compared to 2019 | EUR 136 million including  a/uni00A0contribution from  expense initiatives of  over EUR/uni00A075/uni00A0million | Not applicable, as this  is/uni00A0the base year |\n| Increase free cash flows           | EUR 1.4 - 1.6 billion cumulatively                            | EUR 530 million                                                                                                  | EUR 923 million                                  |\n| Distribute capital to shareholders | Around EUR 0.25 dividend per share over 2023                  | EUR 0.12 per share                                                                                               | EUR 0.15 per share                               |\n\nDuring 2020, Aegon had six non-financial indicators that were tied directly to specific aspects of our strategy.

Through the lens of a provider of/uni00A0financial services with a purpose of helping people achieve a lifetime of financial security, we reflected on a/uni00A0simple question; how can we optimize our contribution to/uni00A0help society though these times?\n\nFrom the very onset of the pandemic, it was clear that there would be a heavy toll on the finances of people everywhere. To this end, we focused on leveraging the knowledge and expertise of our people to help mitigate this impact. Aegon the Netherlands approached Nibud (the Dutch National Institute for Family Finance Information), as part of its 'Helpen met geldzaken' ('Help with your finances') program, and from April 2020, our colleagues have been offered training on how to support friends and family on managing\n\nOur responsible business approach sets a minimum standard for all Aegon business units to follow, with our individual country units encouraged to take additional steps to tailor their approaches to their local markets. In 2020, Aegon the Netherlands outlined its enhanced responsible business strategy for 2020-2025 in its dedicated Responsible Business Report. Furthermore, Aegon the Netherlands is a founding member of the Spitsbergen Ambition, a collective of Dutch financial services organizations committed to combating climate change by financing activities and investments. The company is also a signatory to the 2019 Dutch National Climate Agreement alongside Aegon Asset Management's unit in the Netherlands.\n\nRisk management is an important aspect of our responsible business approach. We proactively identify and manage nonfinancial risks related to ESG that could potentially impact our business. To this end, we include non-financial risks, such as climate change, within our enterprise risk management (ERM) framework and take steps to mitigate their impact on Aegon and our wider stakeholder base.\n\n## Individuals Responsible products\n\nAegon helps individuals responsibly manage and prepare for retirement by providing a wide range of savings and investment products, as well as offering financial planning and advice. We also help people improve their financial awareness and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntheir personal finances during the pandemic and beyond. Participants learn how to help people to create an overview of their incomings and outgoings, and to make better financial choices. They also learn what they can and cannot do as a volunteer and are given information about government measures relating to COVID-19.\n\nSince first offering the training opportunity in April as a pilot with 20 participants, 74 colleagues immediately volunteered and since more than 500 Aegon colleagues at all levels of the Company have taken part. We quickly realized that the benefits of the program could be amplified through wider participation of the financial sector, and to this end we actively engaged with eight other insurance and banking providers. So far, more than 4,500 workers from across the financial industry have taken part. Aegon is now working to promote the training to other members of the Schuldeiserscoalitie ('Creditors Coalition'), a coalition of Dutch companies committed to preventing their customers from getting into debt.\n\nliteracy by providing information and orchestrating regular surveys and campaigns.\n\nWe engage with customers through multiple channels, including polls and surveys, conferences, panels, perception studies, and workshops. In all our interactions, whether virtual or face to face, we seek to create a personal connection with customers and to understand their lives, aspirations, and needs.\n\nClose customer interactions enable us to reach untapped or underserved groups of people around the world, including individuals with specific needs who may not be part of the traditional market for our financial products and solutions. While we continue to build our middle- and higher-income customer base worldwide, we also work to bring financial services and our products to lower-income customers. In the United States, Transamerica offers Final Expense Whole Life Insurance to meet the needs of individuals on limited incomes whose families may not be able to afford the expenses associated with death and funeral services.\n\nWe are also working to extend insurance coverage to people who have previously been considered uninsurable. Our WinSocial program, run by our joint venture MAG Aegon in Brazil, offers insurance to people with diabetes. The initiative, which forms part of our Qualitative to Quantitative (Q2Q) pilot program (see next page), uses a mobile app and website to ask customers",

This automationbased concept is being trialed with potential insurance customers in the United States, via Transamerica, as well as through our Brazilian joint venture, MAG. Q2Q involves moving an applicant from a very reduced set of questions, revolving around medical risk, to a resulting rate-class that both stratifies that risk and determines pricing, without the need for fluid samples or laboratory tests.\n\nA clear advantage of this quantitative approach is that it can be applied consistently to all applicants, vastly reducing the potential for human bias. This is thanks to a\n\nhealth and lifestyle questions before validating their responses via heart and glucose monitoring.We hope to broaden this initiative to cover other formerly uninsurable groups, including individuals with hypertension, HIV, and certain cancers. Furthermore, in our Transamerica business, we will roll out our new, digital underwriting capability along with significant customer experience upgrades across our core life products over the next two years.\n\n## Insurance for people living with HIV in Brazil\n\nAbout 0.4% of Brazil's population is living with HIV and AIDS. HIV-positive individuals are often considered uninsurable due to the risk of the condition developing into AIDS.\n\nHowever, with the right monitoring regime and antiretroviral therapy treatment, HIV can often be controlled, making it a manageable chronic condition. Aegon research indicates that, as in the case of other chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, people living with HIV can be insurable if they can give evidence of sufficient control over their condition.\n\nIn the spirit of Aegon's WinSocial pioneering offering of insurance to people living with diabetes mellitus, Aegon looks forward to leveraging its proprietary digital underwriting capabilities (Q2Q) to further expand opportunities for other individuals who have historically struggled to access fair treatment and insurance. We expect to begin issuing policies to qualifying individuals living with HIV in 2021.\n\nsystematic method Aegon has developed for evaluating, and therefore preventing, so-called disparate impacts (when a data input or rule for its use in underwriting produces different results for protected population classes). For example, factors with the potential to create bias, such as credit scores, are carefully identified and removed from the underwriting process.\n\nWe believe Q2Q represents a significant step forward for the insurance industry. We plan to share our observations from the pilot with our partners on an ongoing basis, as we work toward a common goal of meeting a crucial consumer need for a convenient, fair, and accurate underwriting process.\n\n## Smarter customer relationships\n\nAegon's increased focus on digital transformation and customer centricity underpins our efforts to help individuals achieve a lifetime of financial security. By combining efficient, digitized interactions with humanized customer experiences, we can provide financially inclusive products and attend effectively to our customers' needs during challenging periods in their lives.\n\nOur customer experience experts are working to advance the digital solutions we provide, without overlooking the need for empathy and a human touch during critical interactions. For/uni00A0example, during the COVID-19 outbreak, Transamerica used its Voice of the Customer platform to gather the views of more than 3,000 employers on emergency legislation and shutdowns. A previously largely analog process was made 100% digital, which increased performance, accuracy, and ease of use. At Aegon Spain and MAG in Brazil, new digital environments were made available in 2020, enabling customers to obtain an overview of their products and services and take simple actions such as changing a payment method. This not only offers the digital convenience but also provides reassurance to our customers.\n\nWe use advanced technologies, such as data analytics, to help us gather customer data more intelligently via digital user platforms such as mobile phones. This allows us to further customize our products and solutions and drive down costs (see 'Q2Q' above).\n\nSophisticated data-driven insurance technologies can also help us better evaluate the risks of selling to customers, especially those with chronic medical needs. Ongoing digital health tracking using wearable technology and fitness applications can encourage customers to make healthier lifestyle choices. Digital",

These technologies allow an increased level of insight for insurers when it comes to (potential) policyholders. On an ethical level, this situation poses unprecedented challenges to the traditional pillars of insuring non-certainty of a risk, statistical predictability, and mutual support or pooling across policyholders.\n\nIf data is not used in a controlled and compliant way -/uni00A0in/uni00A0terms of sources or invasions of privacy - by consumers or insurers, the relationship between the two parties is jeopardized. Fair insurance is then put at risk, undermining the crucial role it plays. The financial and/or reputational consequences can be dire.\n\nIn contrast, using data and algorithms in a controlled, responsible, and compliant way, with an appropriate contract between consumers and insurers, can enhance the societal role of insurance. Insurance can become accessible to segments of the population that were previously considered uninsurable. Policies can be dynamically adapted\n\nhealth monitoring not only makes the underwriting process quicker, cheaper, and more accurate, but also enables us to build more sustained and engaged connections with our customers. Moreover, it allows us to reach and help new groups of people with more affordable, personalized products.\n\nFurther to the need to comply with relevant laws and regulations, the social benefits of better financial inclusion are matched by the commercial and reputational advantages for Aegon. On the one hand, the costs of accessible digital underwriting solutions are much lower than in traditional, manual methods; on the other, we have found that customers who appreciate how we work to protect the more vulnerable in our society will recommend us to other people, building our reputation in our markets. Smarter customer relationships therefore create value for shareholders and customers alike.\n\n## Society\n\n## Retirement research\n\nHealthy aging and financial security in later life are at the heart of our business. Given the global trends of longer lifespans and aging societies, we believe we have a societal responsibility to help people plan effectively for old age and lead a longer, more active retirement. To support this ambition, Aegon conducts in-depth, practical research on financial planning, retirement, health, and insurance issues.\n\nThe Aegon Center for Longevity and Retirement (ACLR) was established to increase awareness of, and stimulate dialogs\n\nto the specific circumstances of an individual, and ultimately move from indemnification to prevention.\n\nAt Aegon, we want to truly act on our purpose and therefore plan to use innovative data approaches, AI, and other technologies in certain areas. But we want to do so in a controlled, responsible, and compliant manner and we also expect the same from our customers and partners. Furthermore, thanks to our involvement in international industry forums where such issues are increasingly being debated (for example, EIOPA's Consultative Expert Group on Digital Ethics), we believe Aegon can set an example when it comes to industry standards and can help shape the growing regulatory environment around data ethics.\n\nWe are mindful that some of the considerations around AI, digital technology, and data ethics may be controversial. We are therefore looking at the issues carefully, and from a variety of perspectives. Innovation raises questions that are sometimes uncomfortable or difficult to deal with. Nevertheless, we believe it is important to encourage such debates in order to make the most of the opportunities offered by new technologies, and identify smart, valuable, and ethical solutions for our customers.\n\nabout, issues relating to longevity, population aging, and retirement security. Our aim is to see these themes included in policymaking agendas across the globe.\n\nTogether with the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies\u00ae and the Instituto de Longevidade Mongeral Aegon, the ACLR conducts an annual survey on retirement readiness and attitudes in 15 countries. The survey has gathered information from more than 130,000 respondents during its nine-year history.\n\nThe 2020 survey and accompanying report focused on agefriendly employment and explored the important role of employers in helping workers successfully prepare for retirement. The report drew attention to employer-sponsored retirement and other welfare benefits, flexible work arrangements, and workplace wellness programs, among other initiatives.\n\n## Shifting responsibility for retirement\n\nLonger lifespans are putting traditional, state-managed retirement systems under strain and shifting responsibility away from governments and employers toward individuals, who may not be fully equipped to plan for their financial security. The pandemic has further exposed the fragility of retirement systems run by governments that now find themselves needing to redirect funds toward supporting their economies.\n\nAegon's products and services are focused on helping our customers to achieve a dignified retirement.",

        "page_content": "## Linking executive pay to ESG performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Aegon, our commitment to upholding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations is demonstrated in our compensation and benefits policies at the highest levels. For example, we are incorporating inclusion and diversity targets into the remuneration of all Executive Board and Management Board members.\n\nMore widely, according to our Executive Board's Remuneration Policy, 50% of a member's variable compensation is related to non-financial performance indicators, of which at least one must be ESG-related and clearly support the wider interests of society. Such a target might, for example, focus on the organization's carbon footprint, inclusion and diversity\n\nAegon is active in many international projects that aim to fulfill this goal; for example, an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working group on the future of work, and the Living, Learning, and Earning Longer initiative led by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the OECD, and US-based retirement interest group AARP. Within Aegon, our Silver Starters program (developed jointly with the Leyden Academy on Vitality and Ageing) provides online entrepreneurship coaching to over50s, to promote lifelong learning and healthy attitudes to aging.\n\n## The environment\n\nA key part of our responsibility to society is to reduce our impact on the environment. In 2015, Aegon signed the Paris/uni00A0Pledge for Action, affirming our commitment to the ambition set out by the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. We are also a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nAs a financial services provider, we do not operate energy-\n\nor resource-intensive processes in the offices and data centers that comprise our direct business operations, nor are we aware of any environmental incidents relating to these activities. The environmental impact of our business activities relates primarily to the organizations in which we invest. To this end, it is important that we set high standards for ourselves in our responsible investment philosophy (see page 31).\n\nFor example, in January 2021, in response to the threat of climate change, Aegon UK announced its intention to achieve netzero carbon emissions across its default pension fund ranges by 2050. Before then, the business aims to halve carbon emissions associated with its default funds by 2030. This commitment follows a survey of Aegon UK's customers carried out in late 2020, in which nearly half of all respondents expressed their wish to see investing for a net-zero carbon future made mandatory.\n\npractices, or risk management. The executives' variable compensation is dependent on the fulfillment of this target as well as their other performance indicators. In 2021, our CEO, Lard Friese, will work toward specific performance objectives that focus on inclusion and diversity, and on further integrating ESG into Aegon's strategy.\n\nThis is just the start: our aim is for commitments made at the top to filter through the rest of our businesses. This will see managers across our regions take responsibility for employee engagement and make sustainability a key objective that is embedded in everything they do.\n\nAegon's other country units are working toward similar targets. In 2019, Aegon the Netherlands joined more than 50 leading Dutch companies in signing the Coalitie Anders Reizen: an agreement to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030.\n\n## Carbon neutrality of our own operations\n\nAegon's direct business operations in the Netherlands, the United/uni00A0Kingdom, and the United States have been carbonneutral since 2016. Carbon neutrality was extended to cover the entire Group in 2019. We take a hierarchical approach to manage our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:\n\n- 1.  We seek to reduce activities with a carbon footprint, namely fossil fuel consumption and air travel.\n- 2.  We look to substitute remaining activities with low-emission alternatives.\n- 3.  We offset any residual emissions.\n\nAegon's direct energy usage fell by 17.6% in 2020, as many Aegon employees worked from home throughout much of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our use of air travel was also greatly reduced as virtual conferencing tools such as Microsoft Teams replaced face-to-face meetings. On a prepandemic basis, our overall energy consumption fell by 5.5% year-on-year in 2019, supported by the rationalization of our property portfolio worldwide and the consolidation of our operations into more energy-efficient buildings.\n\nReduce : The first tier of our GHG reduction approach focuses on limiting activities that result in carbon emissions. We aim to capitalize on changes to our standard working practices as a result of COVID-19 to further reduce the footprint of our direct business operations. Our owned premises in the United Kingdom are certified to ISO 50001 (Energy Management Systems), and our Netherlands operations are working toward equivalent coverage to the same standard. In addition, Aegon's UK premises",

Aegon takes steps to mitigate the environmental impact of our direct operations, for example by minimizing our energy consumption and using renewable electricity. However, we/uni00A0have an even greater influence through our investments:/uni00A0climate change is a key topic within Aegon's/uni00A0responsible investment framework, and we report the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our General Account investments.\n\nAt Aegon, we strive for consistent disclosure with regard to climate change and sustainability and have been supportive of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2017. We follow the TCFD's four-pillar framework for our own reporting and we encourage the wider adoption of the framework by our investee companies and other partners. Aegon's efforts to comply with the TCFD are presented in more detail in the TCFD disclosure on page 427, which also forms part of the directors' report.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur efforts to address climate change are overseen by the Climate Change Working Group (CCWG), under the instruction of Aegon's Responsible Business and Investment Committee (RBIC). The CCWG is tasked with evaluating new climate developments affecting our business activities and recommending actions as necessary.\n\n## Strategy\n\nClimate change is a fundamental consideration within Aegon's responsible business strategy. Aegon is committed to a responsible way of doing business, which includes\n\nare certified to ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems) and we are pursuing Energy Star Certification for all our owned US premises.\n\nSubstitute : Renewable energy forms the second tier of our GHGreduction approach. We source 'green tariff' electricity for our\n\nmaking a lasting contribution to a healthy environment. We also address climate change through Aegon's Groupwide Responsible Investment Policy, including through our active ownership approach. As an institutional investor, Aegon expects investee companies to make a concerted effort to minimize their environmental impact. We actively engage with the companies we invest in - both individually and collectively - through networks to encourage better climate-related risk practices, including emissions disclosure and target setting.\n\n## Risk management\n\nClimate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding the timing, scope, and severity of potential impacts. Within our wider responsible investment approach, Aegon enforces strict climate-related criteria as part of our screening and engagement process for investee companies. These include measurement and reporting of climate impacts; consideration of transition and/or physical risks, plans, and targets to reduce emissions; and other sector- or situation-specific topics.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nAegon measures and reports annually on its operational carbon footprint. Our main operations in the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have been carbon-neutral since 2016 by reducing their facility-level emissions and supporting offset projects in cooperation with the non-governmental organization (NGO) ClimateCare. In 2019, we extended the scope of our offsetting to cover all of our wholly owned operations. Our operational emissions are reported in full on page 421. Since 2018, we have also measured the carbon footprint of our General Account investments. With regards to the carbon footprint associated with our investments, in 2020 we broadened our disclosure beyond the Netherlands to cover our global General Account, reaching 77% coverage of Corporate Fixed Income, and 98% coverage of Sovereign Fixed Income.\n\nEuropean operations and purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) for the electricity we consume in the United States. Year to year, the share of renewable electricity within our wider mix is consistently greater than 95%. Solar panels have also been installed on the roof of our Aegonplein head office in The Hague, generating energy for neighboring homes and businesses.",

We apply this ethos to our own proprietary investments and use our influence to encourage similar standards in the accounts we manage. By taking an active approach to responsible investment, we seek to minimize risks and explore new opportunities to serve the interests of our customers and society at large.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Aegon implemented its revised Group-wide Responsible Investment Policy, which determines how we manage our proprietary assets globally as part of the investment process for our General Account. As well as reiterating our previous environmental commitments, the updated policy further limits exposure to climate-damaging activities such as thermal coal production and usage.\n\nThe policy recognizes a broad range of recurring environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics, from climate change to health and corporate governance. These topics are assessed regularly as part of the review process for our Responsible Investment Policy. The most recent review, in January 2021, further underscores our commitment to fighting loss of biodiversity, together with further improvements to our investment process.\n\nIn addition to incorporating ESG thinking into investment decisions for our General Account, we are committed to expanding our ESG offering in Separate Accounts, which we offer to policyholders and pension plan members as investment strategies.\n\n## Asset manager: Our solutions\n\nGuided by our overarching Responsible Investment Policy, Aegon Asset Management (AAM) has established a Responsible Investment Framework that reflects these key elements including similar policies put forward by AAM's clients.\n\nOur Responsible Investment Framework is structured as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 ESG integration - Material ESG factors are fundamental to our investment decision-making across all AAM portfolios. By integrating ESG considerations into traditional financial analysis, the AAM research team arrives at an independent view of an issuer's fundamentals.\n- \u25a0 Active ownership - We actively engage with investee companies across a wide range of industries to improve their ESG profile and address sustainability issues, often in cooperation with other investors to maximize our influence. We also exercise any shareholder voting rights we have to support our engagement efforts and enhance long-term value creation for all stakeholders.\n- \u25a0 Solutions - AAM provides a range of responsible investment solutions to pursue ESG objectives alongside financial returns. These solutions are categorized into four types: 1) exclusionbased strategies, 2) best-in-class strategies, 3) sustainabilitythemed strategies, and 4) impact investments.\n\n## Activities in 2020\n\n## Engagements\n\nIn 2020, Aegon engaged with 575 companies on a wide range of issues, including; climate risk and reporting, critical health issues, and corporate governance, through AAM. Many of these engagements focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses of our investee companies. In particular, we have sought to ensure companies provide adequate protection for their employees by taking suitable health and safety precautions. We also entered into a dialog with pharmaceutical companies involved in the development of COVID-19 treatments, to ensure fair access to essential medicines, and in particular, vaccines for people around the world.\n\n2020 also drew attention to issues of diversity and racial equality in the United States and elsewhere. The growing awareness around diversity issues is in line with AAM's ongoing engagements with investee companies with regard to inclusion and diversity. A priority during these discussions has been to encourage companies to provide more transparent disclosure in terms of their diversity policies, programs, and targets.",

Aegon will no longer invest in companies that own more than 10 gigawatts of coal-fired electricity generation capacity and have plans to extend their capacity. We also exclude companies that produce more than 20 million tons of thermal coal annually and are actively expanding their coal-related operations from our investment universe. This is in addition to those deriving 30% or more of their revenue from the exploration, mining, or refining of thermal coal. This threshold will gradually be lowered over the coming years, to eventually reach 5% or below in 2029.\n\nInformation Technology\n\nReal Estate\n\nEnergy\n\nUtilities\n\nCommunication Services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMilestone 1:\n\nConcerns flagged with a company.\n\nMilestone 2: Company response (letter, e-mail, phone call) commencement of dialog.\n\nMilestone 3: Concrete steps taken by the company to resolve flagged concerns.

The fund selects companies that demonstrate strong ESG performance, the exclusion of controversial activities, and positive impact.\n\nAs a signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), in 2020 AAM scored the highest possible rating (A+) for strategy and governance of responsible investment activities for the fourth consecutive year.",

In September, Transamerica and AAM's US business jointly launched two new responsible investing bond mutual funds: the Transamerica Sustainable Bond and the Transamerica High Yield ESG/uni00A0funds. In/uni00A0December, Transamerica also replaced one of its sub-advisors on an existing equity strategy with AAM, and changed the strategy to Sustainable Equity Income, thereby giving Transamerica dedicated responsible investing offerings in both the fixed income and equity spaces. At the end of 2020, the Sustainable Equity Income strategy had assets of USD 1.2 billion across two funds: a retail fund and a series trust fund used in Transamerica's variable annuity business.\n\nAegon UK also expanded its ESG solutions during 2020. Together with our investment partner, BlackRock, the Company increased its exposure to investments that have ESG credentials in the Aegon BlackRock LifePath portfolios that are available to workplace investors via our Aegon TargetPlan and Aegon Master Trust fund ranges. Between September 2020 and mid2021, the number of ESG investments held by the LifePath portfolios will increase from 27% to 68% for LifePath investors planning to retire in 2050 and beyond.\n\nFurther information about AAM's activities can be found in the dedicated Responsible Investment Report published by AAM.\n\n## Local commitments\n\nAegon's business units, including Transamerica, Aegon the Netherlands, and Aegon UK, are guided by our Group-wide Responsible Investment Policy, which they implement through their respective investment activities. Equally, our business units are encouraged to take additional measures to reflect the preferences and standards of Aegon's customers and other stakeholders in their respective local markets.\n\nSeveral of our units have taken additional steps to strengthen their screening efforts. For example, in January 2021, Aegon UK announced its commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its default pension fund ranges by 2050. The company also intends to cut carbon emissions associated with default funds in half by 2030. In November 2020, Aegon the Netherlands joined a coalition of Dutch investors using satellites to target companies with deforestation in their supply chains. The coalition demands that companies publicly disclose supplier lists for palm oil and other agricultural 'soft' commodities. Companies that have been involved in deforestation in the past are required to take steps to mitigate their effects and avoid contributing further to this issue.\n\n## Active ownership in action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our active engagement strategy, Aegon works with companies with the potential to contribute to the clean energy transition and the realization of the climate targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2020, Aegon Asset Management (AAM) continued to engage with a leading multinational steelmaker to support its decarbonization plans and its implementation of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. This engagement has been well-received by the company's management, and we held several meetings focused on carbon reduction. The interactions have been coordinated within the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), an investor-based workgroup aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe believe our collaboration has had a positive impact. In October 2020, the steelmaker announced plans to build on its existing carbon-reduction ambitions, having made a Group-wide commitment to being carbonneutral by 2050. The company has also introduced its first 'green steel' solutions for customers, which include steel produced via carbon-neutral processes as well as through the use of 'green' hydrogen generated from renewables.\n\nAegon and other IIGCC-affiliated investors will continue to engage with the company on its transition plans in 2021, and the implementation of its sustainability targets.\n\nOur country units also commit to local initiatives and platforms aimed at promoting responsible business activity. In 2020, Aegon the Netherlands joined Platform Living Wage Financials (PLWF), an alliance of financial institutions that encourages investee companies to address the failure to pay a living wage in global supply chains. The company also joined the Access to Medicine Index, a research program that ranks leading pharmaceutical companies based on their efforts to ensure the sufficient availability of medicines for people in all regions and of all backgrounds and income levels.",

One outcome was that US employers sponsoring eligible retirement plans were given the option of offering their employees access to retirement savings through COVID-19-related distributions and loans, along with certain tax waivers. While this was welcome news for many, it meant that employers were faced with complex new rules at an already difficult time.\n\nIn April, Transamerica launched a comprehensive CARES Act Customer Support Initiative to encourage retirement plan sponsors to offer these new distribution options to participants requiring access to funds, putting customers' minds at ease.\n\nThere were five steps to Transamerica's initiative:\n\n- 1.  Waiving all retirement plan fees associated with COVID-19related distributions, thus supporting retirement plan sponsors and COVID-19-impacted workers.\n- 2.  Waiving plan amendment fees for retirement plan sponsors who used Transamerica's pre-approved document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nAegon's purpose is to help our customers achieve a lifetime of financial security. Part of this security is the peace of mind that comes from knowing we will be there when they need us most and we will respond with empathy and clarity.

We can build trust and value by connecting with people on a human level, by being both personal and informative, and by offering reassurance and care alongside timely and relevant advice so that people can make decisions that are right for them.\n\nWe have seen that increases in longevity and population aging are/uni00A0putting government-sponsored retirement benefits under severe financial strain. In many countries around the world, traditional defined benefit plans offered by employers are disappearing and being replaced by employee-funded defined contribution retirement plans. With these shifts, individuals are expected to take on increasing responsibility for self-funding a greater portion of their retirement income.\n\nWorkers are shouldering more of the weight of financial decisionmaking for their retirement savings compared with the past, and they need to make more informed decisions.

Donating USD 500,000 to Direct Relief to support healthcare workers in their COVID-19 relief efforts.\n\nAt Aegon, we know that people work hard over many years to build up their retirement funds, and that for customers affected by COVID-19, accessing retirement savings is a last resort at a time of unforeseen upheaval. The Transamerica initiative was a timely and practical response that supported our customers as they made difficult decisions, aligning with Aegon's wider efforts to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security. By providing clarity on the new legislation and its implications, encouraging plan sponsors to act, and reassuring customers that they would not be penalized unfairly, we were able to help people in immediate financial difficulties access the money they needed to weather the crisis.\n\nliteracy skills are more important than ever, yet barely more than one-quarter (28%) of workers were able to answer three basic financial literacy questions correctly. 1 Given what is at stake and the complexity involved, policymakers, the financial services industry, employers, and others must work collaboratively to further develop and offer access to lifetime income solutions.\n\n## Where our customers are\n\n(total number of customers by location, in millions, end-2020)\n\n<!-- image -->",

To measure our performance, we use the Net Promoter Score (NPS), measured through 'touchpoint NPS' (tNPS), 'journey NPS' (jNPS), and 'relational NPS' (rNPS) on a scale of -100 to +100. These are all used to steer and improve the quality of our internal processes and the customer service experience we deliver. NPS measurements are included in various management-level targets. Our relational NPS programs cover the vast majority of our customers (87%) across our different territories and businesses.\n\nAt Aegon, we took care to guide and support our customers during the difficulties they faced in 2020. Our success in improving our customers' experience with us is shown by our NPS results, with an improved absolute and relative performance in Aegon's three biggest markets: the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands.\n\nIn the Netherlands, rNPS reached an all-time high score in 2020. We can attribute this increase largely to a better emotional connection with customers, achieved through high-quality customer contact during the pandemic and our empathetic communication.\n\n## Aegon recognized for excellent customer/uni00A0service/uni00A0in/uni00A0Spain\n\nFor the second year in a row, Aegon Spain was recognized in the Customer Service of the Year awards, winning awards in both the Health Insurance and Life Insurance categories.\n\nThe awards, granted by the Sottotempo association, recognize the innovation and quality of the service that Aegon offers our customers. This follows thorough discussions with customers regarding their thoughts on the customer service Aegon provides by telephone, as well as via email and web browsing. The discussions focused on aspects such as availability, quality of response, and technical quality, and also reflected on the 'human' quality of Aegon's interactions with customers.\n\nAegon's approach to customer service in Spain reflects our wider ambition to remain close to our customers by providing support throughout the different stages of people's lives, especially when they need it most.\n\nIn the United States, we used our rNPS survey as an opportunity to gather customer feedback about how communication in times of uncertainty affects brand loyalty and trust. The results were clear: those who indicated they had received some type of communication from Transamerica had an average NPS of +54, and 75% agreed with the statement \"Transamerica is a brand I trust.\" On the other hand, those who indicated they had received no communication had an average NPS of +2, and only 51% agreed that they trusted Transamerica. Overall, our relational score remained stable at its already high level, which also led to improvements in our market position.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, we also saw our response to the pandemic enhance relationships with our customers. Our tNPS performance has remained above target levels since the outbreak of the pandemic. We also maintained the strong improvements made to Aegon UK's rNPS in previous years. And with our peers' performance decreasing, our NPS position stood above the market average in 2020 (32%).\n\nOverall, our relationship with customers - relative to our peers - improved in comparison with 2019, mainly driven by the performance of Aegon UK. The details of benchmarked rNPS are provided in Part IV of this report.",

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the transition to working from home across our organization, it has become more important than ever that we keep our people feeling supported and engaged. We do this by ensuring our employee community is connected, healthy, and happy.\n\nTo promote the health and welfare of our employees, in 2020 we:\n\n- \u25a0 Focused on creating new opportunities for their career development;\n- \u25a0 Introduced a new performance management process with a stronger focus on development;\n- \u25a0 Promoted greater diversity within an inclusive workplace; and\n- \u25a0 Fostered training and development to equip our employees with future-ready capabilities.\n\nEvery year, we conduct a Global Employee Survey across our businesses. In 2020, we continued to see very high participation levels, with 82% of our employees providing responses. The survey included questions in four key categories: Engagement, Leadership, Inclusion, and Diversity. Our scores in all of these areas increased compared to the previous year. The Engagement score rose from 67% in 2019 to 72% in 2020, while Leadership increased from 55% to 63%. It is reassuring to see that Aegon's employees reported feeling engaged and supported. Our 2020 Inclusion score, at 79% (up from 76% in 2019), is one point above our external benchmark. In the Diversity category, our overall score reached 73% (versus 69% in 2019), though responses to specific questions show that we need to gain a deeper understanding of the situation and increase our inclusion and diversity efforts. The results of the survey have been discussed with Aegon's respective business unit leaders. In 2021, business unit leaders will work toward a personal or business target related to the implementation of follow-up actions to improve employee engagement.\n\nDue to COVID-19, much of Aegon's staff worked from home throughout most of 2020. We supported employees by providing furniture, as well as information technology (IT), tools, and hardware to enable a healthy and safe home-based working environment. We also introduced the 'Working from Home' framework to support staff during this period and set vitality and engagement as a priority. The focus areas of this program are: keep fit, keep connected, keep performing, keep motivated, and keep developing. We also recognize the potential impact of extended remote working on people's mental health. In spring 2020, Aegon UK began a series of webinars to offer employees support on managing their mental well-being while working from home.\n\nAlthough the framework is global, local units have been able to adapt it to fit their specific circumstances, thereby better supporting employees and keeping people connected. In several\n\ncountry units, offers such as increased paid leave in 2020 and expanded flexible working arrangements, helped employees balance their work and personal lives. We also reimbursed additional costs related to working from home.\n\nAs the situation evolved, we started to explore future ways of working at Aegon. Like many organizations, we found multiple benefits to remote working, including greater flexibility and a better work-life balance for employees, more digitalization of processes, and reduced travel (which helps both employees and the environment). We conducted two employee surveys (in April and July 2020) to gain insights into how our people were faring during the crisis. On the basis of this feedback, Aegon is actively considering several measures for the future, including possible hybrid working models where offices may no longer be the default workspace for individuals, but would remain available for team collaboration.\n\n## Compensation and benefits\n\nIn a highly competitive labor market, our remuneration policy is designed to attract, motivate, and retain talented staff whose skills and values can help us achieve our strategy. Aegon's Global Remuneration Framework stresses the importance of 'pay for performance', while ensuring incentives and variable pay do not compromise integrity or encourage excessive risk-taking. Both financial and non-financial metrics are used to assess performance; the mix between the two depends on the individual's position and seniority. In 2020, we paid out EUR 2.0 billion in salaries and benefits to our 22,322 employees. We also provided a range of other benefits including, flexible working arrangements, company retirement plans, and parental leave, as well as paid time off for volunteering on community projects. Most of our businesses offer employee health programs; these include fitness programs and screening for serious illnesses such as cancer and heart disease, as/uni00A0well as programs to reduce workplace stress and improve mental well-being. Several of Aegon's country-based business units also offer flexible options for purchasing or leasing a bike.\n\n## Where our employees work\n\n(by reporting segment, end-2020)\n\n<!-- image -->",

This global approach enables us to better measure and prioritize our employees' development.\n\nThe new process, which is hosted on our Workday platform, sees us move away from the manager-led, backwardlooking structure of biannual reviews, toward a more frequent and forward-looking approach, with ongoing dialogs led by employees. Goal-setting at the start of each year, now focuses on an employee's ambitions relating to performance and development. During the year, the new system encourages check-ins with managers, twoway feedback, and discussions about goals as they evolve. End-of-year performance conversations now emphasize an employee's impact, interests, and long-term career development.\n\n## Equal pay\n\nAegon was the first company in the Netherlands to make agreements with trade unions in its collective labor agreement on equal pay for men and women. We also recognize that, for some women, a shorter tenure or work history is the direct result of unaddressed inequalities throughout history.\n\nFurthermore, since 2017 Aegon UK has publicly reported its gender pay gap data, which measures the difference between average earnings of male and female employees, expressed as a percentage of males' earnings. The most recent annual Gender Pay Gap Report, published in April 2020, shows a mean gender pay gap of 34.7% for Aegon UK Corporate Services Limited in 2019, a slight improvement on the 2018 figure of 35%.\n\n## Development\n\nMaking sure our workforce has the right skills and competencies is vital for the success of our organization. More widely, we are aware of growing shortages of skills and talent across the financial services sector, which are becoming more acute as so-called baby boomers retire and the industry transitions to a more digitized way of working. Closer to home, the value of these skills is only amplified when combined with the deep organizational knowledge and strong capabilities of our employees, which are tailored to the specific functions of Aegon's business operations. However, we note the difficulty of maintaining our employee development objectives in the context of an evolving organization. 2020 saw a 6% decrease in Aegon's workforce, continuing a long-term trend, due to the strategic divestment of certain businesses and the transition of specific operational activities (with skilled\n\nThe Perform and Develop system empowers Aegon employees at all levels of the organization to be open about their career aspirations and to take the lead on their own development. As well as giving employees greater ownership of their careers, the new process also brings other benefits: it encourages senior leaders to become more engaged as role models, and helps human resources teams with talent and performance management.\n\nThe launch of Perform and Develop has been supported by global and local training and communication materials, as well as digital nudges, to help colleagues make the most of the new system. Indeed, one Pulse Survey in September revealed that 64% of employees had talked about their performance goals with their manager in the past month, while 80% had received or given feedback.\n\nemployees) to Aegon's business partners. In addition, our digital transformation continues to provide opportunities for the automation of certain business processes. It is essential that we balance the requirement for on-going financial value creation with the preservation of critical knowledge and skills that support our future success, as well as the need to maintain an energizing environment where our employees feel valued.\n\nTo avoid potential skills gaps, Aegon seeks to attract new employees with a wide range of specialties and backgrounds. At the same time, it is essential we give our existing workforce opportunities to develop professionally and adapt to new digital tools and ways of working. We offer Aegon employees -/uni00A0at all levels - a wide range of training and career development programs, including through our Learning Management System.\n\nMany of our trainings focus on IT and digital skills. One such example is our Analytics Accelerator program, which consists of online learning modules and virtual training sessions, available at foundational, manager, and expert levels. Other specialized trainings cover areas including products and sales, new regulations, risk management, responsible investment, information security, and data privacy. All employees have access to our Global Learning Catalog and are encouraged to use it to help shape their development journey. In 2020, we spent a total of EUR 11 million on training and development, equivalent to approximately EUR 500 per employee.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, the number of employees participating in training programs fell, but has since risen to just under pre-pandemic levels. Likewise, in-person seminars and",

We continue to follow our 70-20-10 formula: 70% of an employee's development takes place during the course of their everyday work, 20% happens via networking and informal learning, and the remaining 10% is made up of formal training.\n\nIn 2020, we introduced Absorb: our first, truly global learning management program for all employees, including those in our smaller units and joint ventures. This replaces the previous local systems, yet still allows Aegon's different businesses to roll out contextually specific content. Absorb also hosts worldwide learning journeys that all employees can access. We continued to focus on analytics in 2020, and launched various programs tailored to different levels of the organization. We also rolled out several 'deep dive' digital and technology courses to enable employees to continue working on their core skills while working from home due to the pandemic.\n\nAt Aegon UK, our development program for aspiring managers received 32 applications from men and 33 from women in 2020. The first two cohorts will include 17 men and 19 women. By ensuring we have a good gender balance in our talent pipeline, we will ultimately build a more diverse pool of talent from which to select the leaders of the future, and create equal opportunities for men and women.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nAt Aegon, we recognize that our workforce is made up of people from a wide range of backgrounds. We want everyone to feel that they can bring their authentic self to work without fear of judgment or discrimination. By creating a safe and engaged environment where people are valued, respected, and committed to supporting each other, we can improve organizational effectiveness, make better and more inclusive decisions, and build our understanding of our customers.\n\nOur approach to inclusion and diversity is to ensure our actions and policies are woven into all areas of our businesses and at all levels of the Company. At the top of the organization, Aegon CEO Lard Friese confirmed his commitment to the Company's Statement on Inclusion & Diversity and will work toward a specific inclusion-related target as part of his 2021 objectives. Inclusion-related targets will also be included in the objectives of Aegon N.V. Management Board members and local management teams.\n\nIn 2020, Transamerica CEO Mark Mullin signed the national CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge, committing to actions to build trust and empowerment in the workplace. Transamerica was also recognized by the Diversity Best Practices Inclusion Index for the third year running, as well as being named one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Women for a second consecutive year. Meanwhile, Aegon UK signed up to the Race at Work Charter, part\n\n## Celebrating inclusion and diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAegon Proud is one of our long-established employee resource groups (ERGs). During October, to celebrate Coming Out Day, the network hosted the 2020 Pride Photo Exhibition in the Netherlands. This exhibition was promoted by the global Aegon Proud community across all country units and was made available for all employees to view. The photos featured scenes from the lives of LGBTQ+ people from around the world, promoting the visibility of different identities and raising awareness of diversity. The exhibition took on a special importance this year with COVID-19 restrictions limiting traditional annual Pride gatherings, and accordingly the photos were also made available online to colleagues around the globe.\n\nof a government initiative to boost racial equality in the workplace. The Charter sets out five specific calls to action and provides a framework for measuring diversity and improving inclusion.\n\nMeanwhile, Aegon's employees continue to take active ownership of inclusivity matters within the Company. As the Black Lives Matter movement gathered pace during 2020, employees at Transamerica founded Black Professionals for Change, a new employee resource group (ERG). The group is already having an impact, with a series of conversations called 'Straight Talk on the Black Experience' underway. The discussions provide a space for employees to share their personal stories and experiences. This new group is one of many company-sponsored ERGs that show our employees' commitment to fostering positive change and an inclusive work environment.\n\nIn 2020, we asked the Central Agency for Statistics in the/uni00A0Netherlands (CBS) to measure the cultural diversity of Aegon/uni00A0the Netherlands using anonymized data on race and gender. The results show that we still have work to do for Aegon/uni00A0to be a true reflection of today's society: only 13% of employees have a non-Western background, most of whom work in lower-level roles. The research also identified an overrepresentation of men in senior (and thus higher-paid) positions. Aegon the Netherlands is taking steps to address this, including by setting targets for the number of women in/uni00A0application procedures, making equality a more central factor in succession planning at the top of the company, and/uni00A0conducting an analysis of a possible glass ceiling. The CBS results will be/uni00A0used as a baseline measurement for future years but will also/uni00A0help us design a diversity policy that truly responds to the/uni00A0current reality of our organization.",

We understand that the decision to speak up can be emotional, complex, and daunting, so Speak Up has been designed to be clear and accessible for use by anyone who works for, or on behalf of Aegon. Our step-by-step Toolkit prepares colleagues for what to expect and guides them through the process, whether they choose to make a report via the anonymous helpline, online, or in person. The Speak Up Toolkit is available as both a website and an app, and offers emotional support as well as practical information.\n\nIn 2020, we launched mandatory training on the Speak Up program for all employees. We provided a customized offering for four different user groups: leadership, management, all staff, and report handlers. By tailoring training to specific roles (for example, leaders' and managers' training includes sections on being receptive to people coming forward), we hope to empower employees, demystify the reporting process, and encourage people to look out for and speak up about misconduct.\n\nAegon also completed the universal roll-out of our Let's Talk: Inclusion e-learning program on unconscious bias and how to identify and tackle it. This inclusion training is designed for all our employees (with a specific version for managers that addresses inclusive leadership) and comprises four learning modules as well as reference materials. The program also features 'digital nudges' that will prompt a change in thinking habits at key moments, for example during talent discussions and recruitment processes, to promote more inclusive decision-making. Take-up has been particularly strong at Aegon Asset Management (AAM), where training has been supported by a series of executive coaching sessions and team-based action-planning sessions.\n\nOther steps we took in 2020 include the launch of a new global marketing pledge in pursuit of more inclusive communications messaging and greater diversity in our marketing. Inclusion and diversity are also integrated in Aegon's core policies, including our new Statement on Human Rights, demonstrating our commitment to this important topic. This also shows how we are maturing in terms of this ambition.\n\nAt the global level, we continue to work toward achieving greater gender balance at Board level and have consistently achieved a good gender balance on our Supervisory Board. We recognize that more needs to be done to reduce gender disparities at the highest levels of our organization.\n\nPromisingly, we exceeded our 2020 target of 30% female representation across our worldwide senior management, achieving 32%. This success in part can be attributed to a deliberate focus on more inclusive decision-making and genderfocused interventions within our units.\n\nWe will continue with our efforts to improve gender diversity in senior management positions, targeting 34% across Aegon at the end of 2021. We aim to achieve this by linking inclusion and diversity targets to the remuneration of Executive and Management Board members and developing an organizationwide five-year plan. Appropriate targets will be in place by the end of the first quarter of 2021, together with a clear ambition through 2025.\n\nAegon the Netherlands set a goal for 2020 to hire 10 new employees from disadvantaged backgrounds. While we did not achieve our ambition, we have identified the challenges we must overcome to make this program a success. We are determined to increase diversity in our recruitment and will make renewed efforts in 2021 and beyond. Furthermore, we have introduced a target of 30% for all new hires in the Netherlands to reflect the multitude of dimensions of people diversity, with a particular focus on gender and culture. Aegon's progress on increasing ethnic diversity will be tracked through our continued partnership with CBS, which will provide analysis on an annual basis.\n\n## Compliance\n\nWe have long fostered a culture of ethical compliance. Aegon's Code of Conduct sets out rules and guidelines that shape and govern the actions of all our employees. It also commits us to complying with all legal and regulatory requirements and to prevent insider dealing, corruption, and bribery. In 2020, training on the Code of Conduct was completed by 97% of Aegon's global workforce. We also carry out an annual systematic integrity risk analysis (SIRA) and take actions to address any gaps in performance.\n\nIn March 2020, we published our Financial Economic Crime Statement, in which we committed to complying with several Aegon policies on financial economic crime (FEC). These policies protect our businesses from involvement in crimes such as fraud, money laundering, and bribery, and are reviewed at least once every three years. We made it compulsory for all Aegon's global employees to undertake our anti-money laundering training in 2020. Aegon is also committed to the Wolfsberg Group principles on Financial Crime Compliance.",

Brokers and financial advisors can build sustainable practices of their own by drawing on our insights and our products to serve their customers. In return, they bring insurance market intelligence and investment assets to Aegon, meaning we can create and distribute targeted product offerings to our customers.\n\nWe seek long-term strategic partnerships with suppliers that we believe have superior capabilities and/or can deliver a higher-quality service to our customers at a lower cost. Aegon has trusted, long-standing relationships in place with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for Transamerica and with Atos in the UK. In 2020, Aegon the Netherlands agreed on an administration contract with IBM for a portfolio of 800,000 individual life insurance policies, which will be managed using IBM's cloud technologies.\n\n## Responsible procurement\n\nAs part of Aegon's responsibility to our customers and investors, we are careful to make sure the partners and suppliers we work with are aligned with Aegon's ethics, values, and standards. Our/uni00A0responsible procurement approach focuses on third party vendors who provide rights and protections to their workers who perform important outsourced functions for Aegon. Additionally, we also consider the role of diversity and minority suppliers within our supply chain.Equally, we want the contingent workforce who form part of our worker base to enjoy the same rights and protections as those directly employed by Aegon. This/uni00A0is increasingly important given the expansion of our outsourced operations in areas such as technology.\n\nAccordingly, in 2020, we replaced Aegon's previous Sustainable Procurement Policy with a new Vendor Code of Conduct, which sets out the minimum standards our partners must commit to. This document reflects the consistent approach to responsible business that we aim to foster throughout our organization.\n\nWe have also started using SAP Ariba, a vendor lifecycle management platform for registering third parties and monitoring them through data feeds. Moreover, Aegon is an early adopter of Ariba Risk Management technology, which supports our thirdparty risk management processes and enables us to invite vendors to contribute to a risk assessment directly from the Ariba system.\n\nIn addition, Aegon now works with an external assessment company, EcoVadis, to evaluate the ESG risks involved in our partnerships with suppliers. The EcoVadis assessment categories are aligned with the standards laid out in our Vendor Code of Conduct, including key topics such as a supplier's environmental policies and their labor, human rights, and ethics record. The EcoVadis results can be integrated into our Ariba platform, creating greater oversight of a vendor's ESG credentials.\n\n## Supporting our suppliers during COVID-19\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was a test of Aegon's supply chain, including for Transamerica's outsourced teams in India. Some information technology (IT) workers lacked the equipment and internet access needed to transition to home-based working, but we worked with vendors to facilitate remote access for 635 workers and also brought in additional US-based staff to assist with the backlog that had resulted from the delay. To ensure continuity of services as the situation evolved, we monitored vendors across four areas: productivity, availability of resources, liquidity, and IT infrastructure. This allowed us to anticipate, manage, and resolve supply chain issues arising from the pandemic.\n\nThis partnership allows us to take a more proactive approach to responsible business. Should the external assessment reveal that a partner falls short of our expectations, we can work with them on corrective actions. This new system for risk management allows us more comprehensive oversight of our partners' ESG policies, actions, and results. We are now better able to choose suppliers we can trust, and thus to be a good corporate citizen, creating sustainable value for the societies we operate in.\n\nIn 2020, we decided that we would assess our top 250 vendors by spend (representing 80% of Aegon's total procurement spend). Within one year, we have valid EcoVadis scorecards for 67 of these accounts, covering 56% of the spend of these top vendor accounts. We will continue to increase the level of coverage over time.\n\nIn the future, our procurement process will prioritize the selection and contracting of vendors who share our values beyond the minimum standards and support us in upholding our values across the supply chain. By engaging with our suppliers, we encourage them to make positive changes to their operations and products for the benefit of wider society and the environment. While the consolidation of our suppliers and the management of our supplier base are important drivers of Aegon's ESG and, in turn, economic performance, we are mindful not to exclude smaller, local suppliers with the potential to benefit our immediate communities.",

Of this, EUR 123 million was in dividends to shareholders and the remaining EUR 248 million was delivered to Aegon bondholders.\n\nPayment of dividends depends ultimately on the Company's capital position and available free cash flows. Before deciding on dividends, Aegon's management team also assesses the prospects for financial performance. Against the uncertain economic backdrop of COVID-19 in 2020, we announced that we would retain the 2019 final dividend and that we had rebased our 2020 interim dividend at a lower level. This decision also allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet, as part of wider efforts to make Aegon a materially better, more enduring, and more profitable company in the years to come. Our goal is to deliver sustainable dividends to shareholders and, over time, to increase dividends in line with recurring free cash flows.\n\nShareholders may also derive (or lose) value from the performance\n\nof our shares. In 2020, Aegon's stock price decreased by 20.5%. The wider European insurance sector performed better, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Insurance index ending the year down by 13.5%. We believe the reasons for the relative underperformance include the lower interest rates in the United States, to which we are more exposed than other European insurers. Our total shareholder return for the year amounted to a loss of 18.4% (this measure considers payment of dividends as well as share price performance).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Society\n\nOur purpose, to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security, also helps reduce future pressures on public pension systems by preparing individuals to take greater responsibility for funding their retirement. Moreover, Aegon's long-running research into retirement readiness builds awareness of risks and provides insights and recommendations that benefit society. We also support our communities in a wide variety of ways.\n\n## Community investment\n\nWe support local communities through charitable donations and volunteer work. Our goals are to:\n\n- \u25a0 Serve and strengthen the communities where we do business and create a better quality of life for beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 Engage and involve employees; and\n- \u25a0 Promote Aegon's responsible business vision to all stakeholders.\n\nIn 2020, Aegon's Charitable Donations Standards were fully integrated into our charitable work. The new Standards set out our intent to align the majority of our donations not only with Aegon's purpose, but also with our approach to responsible business.\n\nThe Standards require all country and business units to allocate at least 50% of their annual donations to causes that reflect two key themes: financial security and personal well-being. Financial security includes financial education and literacy for children and adults, in addition to later-life employment solutions. Personal well-being comprises longevity, physical fitness, mental vitality, disease prevention, and support for livable communities.\n\nIn a year when the health and finances of people globally faced the threat of COVID-19, Aegon acted to support our most vulnerable communities in direct and tangible ways.\n\nDuring the spring lockdowns, Aegon's initial response centered on providing immediate healthcare support and relief. Through donations to hospitals, our various business units funded medical supplies and resources in regions worldwide. In Asia, Aegon THTF, Aegon's joint venture in China, donated RMB 1 million to the Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, at the epicenter of the outbreak. We also distributed 50,000 face masks. In Hungary, EUR 85,000 that had been earmarked for canceled Aegon events was redirected to two hospitals. Meanwhile, in the United States, we gave USD 500,000 to Direct Relief, an organization providing protective gear to frontline healthcare workers. Aegon the Netherlands joined other Dutch insurers in donating to a fund for healthcare workers and their families. The fund provides financial support to healthcare workers and/ or their families in the event of them suffering severe illness or death as a result of being infected with COVID-19.\n\nAs the COVID-19 situation unfolded, we began to channel our community investments into projects to alleviate the financial consequences of the pandemic, with special attention paid to people who needed help handling their finances. Additionally, Aegon UK is supporting local charities on the frontline of the crisis, such as food banks and organizations providing aid to the vulnerable elderly.\n\nOverall, through our businesses, Aegon supports approximately 500 charities and good causes. Aegon's donations in 2020 amounted to EUR 9.5 million, a 16% increase compared to 2019. In the United States, our donations are handled by the Aegon Transamerica Foundation, which donates on average 5% of its assets every year. In the United Kingdom, local donation decisions are made by our employee Charity Committee.",

In-person volunteering was restricted in 2020 due to COVID-19, and our annual company-wide Volunteer Friday was unavoidably canceled. Despite these constraints, 4,399 employee volunteer hours were recorded in 2020 (equivalent to EUR 0.2 million, based on volunteers' average salaries).\n\nWhere possible, we adapted our charitable work to meet society's needs during the pandemic. Some of our employees in the Netherlands received Nibud (the Dutch National Institute for Family Finance Information) training on budgeting and financial planning, which they then used to support their wider communities by sharing what they learned with family and friends, as well as through virtual volunteering efforts (see page 25 for further details).\n\n## Human rights\n\nAt Aegon, we are committed to the principle that all people are entitled to basic rights and freedoms, regardless of their nationality, gender, religion, race, or any other protected status. Basic rights and freedoms include civil rights, political rights, social and economic rights, cultural rights, the rights of minorities, the rights of women, and the rights of vulnerable groups, such as children and indigenous peoples.\n\nAs well as ensuring the rights and well-being of our own workers, Aegon's Responsible Investment Policy seeks to ensure human and labor rights are suitably upheld by the companies we invest in. We also reach out to companies that we believe are at risk of breaching minimum standards for human rights, with a view of encouraging them to uphold human and workers' rights.\n\nAegon is committed to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the principles on human rights and labor standards as set forth by the UN Global Compact, and the core standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO). This commitment is explicitly incorporated in numerous Aegon policies, such as the global Code of Conduct, the Statement on Inclusion & Diversity, the new Statement on Human Rights, and the Aegon Operational Risk Taxonomy. Aegon faces the most potential risks in indirect business relationships, which is why human rights are at the core of our Responsible Investment Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct.\n\nIn 2020, we carried out our biennial Human Rights Risk Assessment, through which we aim to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts that may be linked to our operations, products, and services. As in 2018, the results showed no significant human rights risks in most of Aegon's operating environments (including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands). Turkey, Indonesia, India, and China still present the highest likelihood of human rights violations, followed by Brazil. We intend to review the methodology used in the assessment in future years.\n\nWe also developed a new and more comprehensive Statement on Human Rights in 2020, which emphasizes the importance of human rights as part of Aegon's broader ESG approach to responsible business, investment, and procurement. It is designed to frame our ongoing stewardship of human rights, including both the direct impacts of our daily operations and the indirect impacts of our business activities. Aegon seeks to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts in areas we can directly influence, and to address any such risks as they are identified. Each business unit's management team is responsible for implementing the Statement in their local region, but we also encourage each unit to develop supplemental policies, governance, and activities to meet local requirements and stakeholder expectations. We will review and update Aegon's global Statement annually as necessary.\n\n## Responsible tax\n\nWe are firmly committed to making a valuable economic and social contribution to the communities in which we operate, both through our own tax payments and through collection and payments of third-party taxes. We seek to pay 'fair taxes', which for us means paying the right amounts of tax in the right places.\n\nIt is our policy to allocate profits where value is created through our commercial business activities. For us, tax follows business, which means that our decisions are taken for business reasons and not for tax advantages.\n\nWe publish our Global Tax Policy online. This policy outlines Aegon's approach to responsible tax, which seeks to align the long-term interests of all our customers, employees, business partners, investors, and wider society. We also hold regular meetings with NGOs to discuss Aegon's tax strategy and policy.\n\nWe strive to work together with tax authorities in a constructive and transparent manner. Our Horizontal Monitoring Agreement with the Dutch tax authorities shows our commitment to this principle. This includes public discussion and disclosure of policies and principles, as well as the overall governance and oversight of our tax position.\n\nAegon's business principles require identification and prudent management of risks. Accordingly, robust governance practices necessary to the management and control of tax affairs and risks are maintained. Tax risks are monitored through our Tax Control Framework. The risk response depends on the type of risk, likelihood and impact analysis, and the chance of repetition and reputational exposure. For instance, for tax reporting and compliance risks automated validations and review controls are in place. Specific controls are in place to ensure that tax dilemmas are dealt with in accordance with our Global Tax Policy. On a quarterly basis, local tax teams provide attestation that operations are compliant with the Global Tax Policy. The Tax Risk Oversight Committee has a final say on dilemmas that have been escalated to it. Where deemed necessary, tax authorities clearance is sought.",

Some numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n\nAegon Global Tax focusses on Tax Technology in setting its strategic targets. We believe that technology could be an effective means of achieving process efficiency and automated control. In the Netherlands, a tax data management system in combination with automated tax reporting is in the process of being built. We strive for this technology to make tax reporting and compliance, such as preparation of Dutch corporate income tax and value added tax returns, more automatic.\n\nWe value transparency. Disclosures are provided in our financial statements and cover tax payments in our main markets. We provide country-by-country tax reporting in a transparent and accurate manner to the tax authorities. We also provide details of our total tax contribution company-wide and by region in the charts above. Taxes borne are a cost of business and affect our financial results. Taxes collected are not a direct cost of business but are collected on behalf of governments from others. The reported numbers are on cash payment or accrual basis.\n\nAegon's tax function maintains an adequate staff of qualified and trained tax professionals to provide timely and high-quality tax support to our commercial decision-makers. In this regard, proper governance and procedures are in place to ensure that:\n\n- \u25a0 The tax team understands and is engaged in the tax effects of day-to-day business operations and involved in all significant business developments, investments and transactions;\n- \u25a0 Tax consequences are considered as part of every major business decision; and\n- \u25a0 Aegon's tax control framework is constantly evolving to a higher maturity level.\n\nThe Aegon Global Tax team is continuously trained on tax law, jurisprudence and/or other relevant developments.\n\nAegon's tax function reports regularly to the Executive Board and Management Board on day-to-day operations and the status and effectiveness of the function.

Nevertheless, the Supervisory Board is satisfied that we fulfilled our responsibilities to Aegon and its stakeholders during the year.\n\nFrom the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Supervisory Board has been kept informed about the measures being taken to keep employees safe, and to maintain service to our customers at a time when they need Aegon most. Throughout the year we have also noted the resilience and dedication shown by our employees to ensure that our customers were well supported. We are paying close attention to the pressure that long-term working from home, amid lockdowns and other restrictions, can have on our employees. Aegon is taking steps to make things easier where it can.\n\nAlongside the Supervisory Board's usual oversight functions, key/uni00A0focus areas in 2020 were Aegon's ability to navigate through the pandemic, the CEO transition, and the development and implementation of the new strategy.\n\n## CEO transition and implementation of the new/uni00A0strategy\n\nRestrictions on public gatherings due to COVID-19 necessitated making use of the Dutch Emergency Act to make Aegon's AGM in May 2020 accessible by electronic means. The meeting was held successfully with online interaction with our shareholders, who approved the appointment of Lard Friese as the new CEO.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the Working from Home environment, the Executive Board spent a considerable amount of time during 2020 regularly updating the Supervisory Board on the development of Aegon's new strategy. The detailed proposals and clear presentations by management have allowed us to evaluate, challenge constructively and advise on each step,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof which there have been several significant ones during 2020. An important decision was the divestment of Aegon's businesses in Central & Eastern Europe. This transaction helped define the perimeter of the Group, while finding the right new owner for these businesses.\n\nDuring Capital Markets Day on December 10, 2020, the leadership team presented the road map to improve Aegon's performance and detailed the actions that had already been taken. These choices are supported by a detailed operating plan that has been designed to reduce expenses and reinvest capital towards growth. We welcome the new strategic focus aimed at improving Aegon's performance and increasing value for customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe have full confidence in the leadership team, who have instilled an intense organizational rhythm to ensure a highperformance culture and the delivery on the plans and targets outlined at the Capital Markets Day. I am pleased that we will propose to the 2021 AGM that Matt Rider be reappointed as Chief Financial Officer for a four-year term to continue his contribution to Aegon's transformation.\n\nThe Supervisory Board fully supports the increased emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues within Aegon, as illustrated by the revised Group-wide Responsible Investment Policy. We will intensify oversight of the Company's policies and performance on these subjects that are vital to both Aegon and wider society.\n\n## Strengthening the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board was fortunate to be able to draw upon diverse and deep experience when making important judgements during 2020.

As a company established and/uni00A0listed in the Netherlands, Aegon must comply with Dutch law and is subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\nAegon is governed by three corporate bodies:\n\n- \u25a0 General Meeting of Shareholders\n- \u25a0 Supervisory Board\n- \u25a0 Executive Board\n\nAegon also has a Management Board. This works in unison with the Executive Board and helps to oversee operational issues and the implementation of Aegon's strategy. Aegon's corporate governance structure is the responsibility of both the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. Any substantive change to this structure is submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders for discussion.\n\n## The shareholders Listing and shareholder base\n\nAegon's common shares are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. Aegon has institutional and retail shareholders around the world. More than three-quarters of shareholders are located in Aegon's three main markets, the Netherlands, United States, and the United Kingdom. Aegon's largest shareholder is Vereniging Aegon, a Dutch association with a special purpose to protect the broader interests of the Company and its stakeholders.\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nA General Meeting of Shareholders is held at least once a year and, if deemed necessary, the Supervisory or Executive Board of the Company may convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. The main function of the General Meeting of Shareholders is to decide on matters such as the adoption of annual accounts, the approval of dividend payments and (re)appointments to the Supervisory Board and Executive Board of Aegon.\n\n## Convocation\n\nGeneral Meetings of Shareholders are convened by public notice at least 42 days before the meeting. The convocation states the time and location of the meeting, the record date, the agenda items, and the procedures for admittance to the meeting and representation at the meeting by means of a written proxy. Those shareholders who alone or jointly represent at least 1% of Aegon's issued capital or a block of shares worth at least EUR 100 million may request items be added to the agenda of a General Meeting of Shareholders. In accordance with Aegon's Articles of Association, such a request will be granted if it is received in writing at least 60 days before the meeting, and if there are no important interests of the Company that dictate otherwise.\n\n## Record date\n\nThe record date is used to determine shareholders' entitlements with regard to their participation and voting rights. In accordance with Dutch law, the record date is 28 days before the day of the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\n## Attendance\n\nEvery shareholder is entitled to attend the General Meeting to speak and vote, either in person or by proxy granted in writing. This includes proxies submitted electronically. All shareholders wishing to take part must provide proof of their identity and shareholding and must notify the Company ahead of time of their intention to attend the meeting. Aegon also solicits proxies from New York registry shareholders in line with common practice in the United States.\n\n## Voting at the General Meeting\n\nAt the General Meeting, each common share carries one vote. In the absence of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon casts one vote for every 40 common shares B it holds.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nAegon's Supervisory Board oversees the management of the Executive Board, in addition to the Company's business and corporate strategy. The Supervisory Board must take into account the interests of all Aegon stakeholders. The Supervisory Board operates according to the principles of collective responsibility and accountability.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, following nomination by the Supervisory Board itself. Aegon aims to ensure that the composition of the Company's Supervisory Board is in line with Aegon's diversity policy for the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Management Board and is as such wellbalanced in terms of professional background, geography, gender and other relevant aspects of the diversity policy. A profile, which is published on aegon.com, has been established that outlines the required qualifications of its members. Supervisory Board members are appointed for a four-year term and may then be reappointed for another four-year period. Subsequently, a Supervisory Board member can be reappointed again for a period of two years, and then extended by two years at the most. Supervisory Board members are no longer eligible for (re)appointment after reaching the age of 70, unless the Supervisory Board decides to make an exception.",

At present, Aegon's Supervisory Board consists of seven members, all of whom qualify as independent in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. It will be proposed to the shareholders to appoint Jack McGarry and Frans Blom as members of the Supervisory Board during the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 3, 2021.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board also oversees the activities of its committees.

In the event of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon may cast one vote for every common share and one vote for every common share B.\n\nA Special Cause may include:\n\n- \u25a0 The acquisition by a third party of an interest in Aegon N.V. amounting to 15% or more;\n- \u25a0 A tender offer for Aegon N.V. shares; or\n- \u25a0 A proposed business combination by any person or group of persons, whether acting individually or as a group, other than in a transaction approved by the Company's Executive and Supervisory Boards.\n\nIf Vereniging Aegon, acting at its sole discretion, determines that a Special Cause has arisen, it must notify the General Meeting of Shareholders. In this event, Vereniging Aegon retains full voting rights on its common shares B for a period limited to six months. Vereniging Aegon would, for that limited period, command 32.6% of the votes at a General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIt is the right of Vereniging Aegon to, at its own discretion, take the decision to exercise its full voting rights on common shares B. In case of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon also preserves its full voting rights on common shares B if the Executive Board invoked a '250-day period to consider' in circumstances as are expected to be determined in the Dutch Civil Code following adoption of a new act thereto by the Dutch government in 2021 or the '180-day period respond time\" as provided for in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Issue and repurchase of shares\n\nNew shares may be issued up to the maximum of the Company's authorized capital, following a resolution adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Shares may also be issued following a resolution of the Executive Board, subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, providing, and to the extent that, the Board has been authorized to do so by the General Meeting of Shareholders. A resolution authorizing the Executive Board to issue new shares is usually presented at Aegon's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nAegon is entitled to acquire its own fully paid-up shares, providing it acts within existing statutory restrictions.\n\nShareholders usually authorize the Executive Board to purchase the Company's shares under terms and conditions determined by the General Meeting.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer of common shares. Common shares B can only be transferred with the prior approval of Aegon's Supervisory Board.\n\nAegon has no knowledge of any agreement between shareholders that might restrict the transfer of shares or the voting rights pertaining to them.\n\n## Significant agreements and potential change of control\n\nAegon is not party to any significant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate as a result of a change of control following a public offer for the outstanding shares of the Company, other than those customary in financial markets (for example, financial arrangements, loans and joint venture agreements).\n\n## Share plan\n\nSenior executives at Aegon companies and some other employees are entitled to variable compensation of which part is granted in the form of shares. For further details, please see the Remuneration Report on page 66 and note 50 of the notes to Aegon's consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report. Under the terms of existing share plans the vesting of granted rights is predefined. The shares shall vest as soon as possible in accordance with payroll requirements of the relevant subsidiary after the adoption of the Company's Annual Report at the Annual General Meetings of Shareholders in the year of vesting of these shares.\n\n## Appointing, suspending or dismissing Board members\n\nThe General Meeting of Shareholders appoints members of both the Supervisory and Executive Boards, following nominations by the Supervisory Board. These nominations are binding providing at least two candidates are nominated. The General Meeting of Shareholders may cancel the binding nature of these nominations with a majority of two-thirds of votes cast, representing at least one half of Aegon's issued capital. The General Meeting may, in addition, bring forward a resolution to appoint someone not nominated by the Supervisory Board. Such a resolution also requires a two-thirds majority of votes cast, representing at least one half of Aegon's issued capital.\n\nMembers of Aegon's Supervisory and Executive Boards may be suspended or dismissed by the General Meeting of Shareholders with a two-thirds majority of votes cast, representing at least one half of Aegon's issued capital, unless the suspension or dismissal has first been proposed by the Company's Supervisory Board. A member of the Executive Board may also be suspended by the Supervisory Board, although the General Meeting of Shareholders has the power to annul this suspension.",

The version of the code applicable to the financial year 2020 is the version that came into force on January 1, 2017. Aegon endorses the Code and strongly supports its principles for sound and responsible corporate governance and long-term value creation. Aegon regards the Code as an effective means to help ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are duly represented and taken into account. It is the responsibility of both the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board to oversee Aegon's overall corporate governance structure.\n\nIn general, Aegon applies the best practice provisions set out in the Code. There is one best practice provision with which Aegon does not fully apply. In this case, Aegon adheres, as much as is possible, to the spirit of the Code.\n\n## Best Practice 4.3.3\n\nThe Dutch Corporate Governance Code recommends that the General Meeting of Shareholders may cancel the binding nature of nominations for appointments of members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board with an absolute majority of votes and a limited quorum.\n\n## Aegon's position on Best Practice 4.3.3\n\nAegon's Articles of Association provide for a larger majority and a higher quorum than those advocated by the Code. Given that the Company has no specific anti-takeover measures, the current system is deemed appropriate within the context of the 1983 Merger Agreement under which Aegon was formed. However, to mitigate any possible negative effects stemming from this, the Supervisory Board has decided that, in the absence of any hostile action, it will only make nominations for the appointment of members to the Executive and Supervisory Boards that are non-binding in nature.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nFor an extensive review of Aegon's compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, please refer to the Corporate Governance Statement on Aegon's corporate website.\n\n## Differences between Dutch and US company laws\n\nDutch company law is different from US law in the following respects: Aegon, like most large Dutch public companies, has a two-tier governance system comprising an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. The Executive Board is the executive body. Its members are not Aegon employees and have an engagement agreement with the Company. Members of the Executive Board are appointed and dismissed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, as inside directors are in the United States. The Remuneration Policy as regards the members of the Executive Board is adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The number of the Executive Board members and the terms of their engagement are determined by the Supervisory Board within the scope of the adopted Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe Supervisory Board performs supervisory and advisory functions only, and its members are outsiders that are not employed by the Company. The Supervisory Board has the duty to supervise the performance of the Executive Board, the Company's general course of affairs and the business connected with it. The Supervisory Board also assists the Executive Board by/uni00A0giving advice. Other powers of the Supervisory Board include the prior approval of certain important resolutions of the Executive Board. Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a/uni00A0four-year term and may be dismissed by the General Meeting of/uni00A0Shareholders. The remuneration of Supervisory Board members is fixed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Resolutions entailing a significant change in the identity or/uni00A0character of the Company or its business require the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders.",

Specific attention was paid to the Compliance and Control roadmap of Aegon the Netherlands;\n- \u25a0 Assessing a quarterly dashboard that outlined risks with regards to the execution of the strategic change programs in each region, and how those risks were monitored and mitigated. A deep-dive was scheduled on the US programs;\n- \u25a0 Reviewing the Group Risk appetite, which consists of the risk strategy and risk limits and tolerances; and\n- \u25a0 Reviewing the risk governance structure and risk competencies, including the skills necessary for the risk function.\n\nThe Risk Committee also discussed several regulatory topics, including the DNB Focus! report and actions in the context of Recovery and Resolution regulation. The Risk Committee furthermore spent time on the market risk impact on the annual budget plan, reinsurance developments, updates on the IT security roadmap, the IT Risk Management Framework, the assessment of the performance improvement program, the strategic human resources program Future Fit and on risks and approaches in dealing with third party relations of the Company. In addition, the Risk Committee dedicated time to wider developments in the geopolitical environment, including risks associated with Brexit and the financial markets\n\nin 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a number of important asset and liability management and hedging topics across the Group. The Risk Committee noted that the risk framework and the organization adapted well to evolving COVID-19 developments.\n\n## The Nomination and Governance Committee\n\n## Composition\n\nOn December 31, 2020, the composition of the Nomination and Governance Committee was as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 William L. Connelly (Chair);\n- \u25a0 Mark Ellman;\n- \u25a0 Corien M. Wortmann-Kool; and\n- \u25a0 Dona D. Young.\n\n## Role and responsibilities\n\nThe main role and responsibilities of the Nomination and Governance Committee are to assist and advise the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in the areas of Human Resources Management and Corporate Governance. This includes:\n\n- \u25a0 Board member and senior management succession planning;\n- \u25a0 Drawing up selection criteria and procedures for the appointment of Board members, together with supervising the selection criteria and procedures for senior management;\n- \u25a0 Advising on and proposing nominations, appointments and reappointments;\n- \u25a0 Reviewing and updating the Supervisory Board profile and charters for the Supervisory Board and its committees;\n- \u25a0 Periodically assessing the functioning of individual members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board;\n- \u25a0 Overseeing the corporate governance structure of the Company, compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and any other applicable corporate governance legislation and regulations; and\n- \u25a0 Assessing and advising on the responsible business strategy as part of the corporate strategy, and overseeing the execution of the responsible business strategy.\n\n## Committee meetings\n\nAegon's Nomination and Governance Committee held six meetings in 2020. In addition to the committee members, these meetings were attended in whole or in part by the CEO, the Global Head Human Resources and the General Counsel.\n\nFurther to the activities mentioned below, the Nomination and Governance Committee discussed senior management team developments and governance matters and structures. The Committee thereby paused on the internal board structures in Aegon's material business units.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee also reviewed the important outside board positions of the members of the Management and Supervisory Boards and discussed specific appointments to important outside board positions where applicable.",

The profiles of Supervisory Board members, as well as their capabilities also in terms of working collectively with other members of the Supervisory Board, were debated by the Committee. The existing and impending vacancies in the Supervisory Board were discussed (whereby it was considered important to enhance financial and Solvency II expertise) and resulted in (i) the appointment of Ms. Caroline Ramsay and Mr. Thomas Wellauer at the Annual Shareholder meeting of May 15, 2020 and (ii) the nomination of Mr. Jack McGarry and Mr. Frans Blom for appointment at the Annual Shareholder meeting on June 3, 2021.\n\nA Supervisory Board Competency overview is published on aegon.com.\n\n## Executive and Management Board related activities\n\nDuring 2020, the Nomination and Governance Committee discussed the CFO (re)appointment, reviewed the composition of the Management Board and was informed - and consulted on - the succession of Management Board vacancies, and on certain/uni00A0appointments of key management.\n\nThe Committee was also kept apprised of major organizational changes, developments in employee engagement, talent management and international mobility. The Supervisory Board was also informed about the annual Global Employee Survey, which was conducted at the end of 2020. The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of this survey in detail in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n## Diversity\n\nEnhancing diversity in the Executive, Management and Supervisory Boards is an important issue for Aegon. Selection and appointment is based on expertise, skills and relevant experience, and the Supervisory Board takes diversity into account with a view to achieving its aim of having a balanced Supervisory, Executive and Management Board composition.\n\nIn 2017, the Supervisory Board adopted a diversity policy for the Executive, Management and Supervisory Boards. The purpose of the diversity policy is to have a more balanced and diverse composition of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Management Board in terms of nationality, age, gender and educational, professional and geographical background and experience of the individual members. The Committee strives to have at least 30% female and male representation in the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Management Board.\n\nIn the current Supervisory Board composition, there are three female members out of seven members in total (meeting the recent target under Dutch law that at least 30% of the positions should be filled by women and at least 30%\n\nby men). For the Executive Board and Management Board such balanced gender composition has not been met.\n\nWhen identifying candidates for open positions in the Executive and Supervisory Boards, the Committee actively searches for female candidates. It also instructs external search firms to present female candidates. More information on diversity within the Board is available in the Supervisory Board Composition and Competency overview and in Chapter 7 (Diversity) of the Corporate Governance Statement - as published on aegon.com.\n\n## The Remuneration Committee\n\n## Composition\n\nOn December 31, 2020, the composition of the Remuneration Committee was as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Ben J. Noteboom (Chair);\n- \u25a0 William L. Connelly; and\n- \u25a0 Thomas Wellauer.\n\n## Role and responsibilities\n\nThe main role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are to advise the Supervisory Board and prepare decisions to be taken by the Supervisory Board. The Committee is designated to safeguard sound remuneration policies and practices within the Company by overseeing the development and execution of these policies and practices. In order to ensure that the remuneration policies and practices take all types of risks properly into account, in addition to considering liquidity and capital levels, the Remuneration Committee assesses in particular the remuneration governance processes, procedures and methodologies adopted. Furthermore, the Committee ensures that the overall remuneration policy is consistent with the longer-term strategy of the Company and the longer-term interests of its shareholders, investors and other stakeholders. This includes:\n\n- \u25a0 Reviewing the Aegon Group Global Remuneration Framework and making recommendations on the remuneration policies;\n- \u25a0 Overseeing the remuneration of the Executive Board and Heads of Group Control functions;\n- \u25a0 Preparing recommendations regarding variable compensation both at the beginning and at the end of the performance year; and\n- \u25a0 Preparing the information provided to shareholders on remuneration policies and practices, including the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Committee meetings\n\nThe Remuneration Committee had five meetings in 2020. In addition to the committee members, these meetings were attended in whole or in part by the CEO, the Global Head Human Resources and the General Counsel.\n\nIn 2020, the Remuneration Committee concluded on amending the remuneration policies for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, in order to implement the changes as required by the Shareholder Rights Directive implementation",

The above included:\n\n- \u25a0 Setting the outcome of the 2019 Group Performance Indicators and of the 2019 Individual Performance Indicators for Executive Board members, and allocating variable compensation related to 2019 where required;\n- \u25a0 Setting the 2020 Individual Performance Indicators for Executive Board members;\n- \u25a0 Setting the 2020 Group Performance Indicators and targets for remuneration purposes;\n- \u25a0 Preparing for the 2021 performance indicators;\n- \u25a0 Reviewing and/or approving the ex-ante risk assessments and ex-post assessments, any exemption requests under the remuneration policies and changes to the list of Material Risk Takers (Identified Staff);\n- \u25a0 Addressing the impact of COVID-19 on targets and variable compensation; and\n- \u25a0 Reviewing the related Remuneration Report.\n\nIn addition, the Remuneration Committee discussed developments with respect to possible new regulations pertaining to remuneration.\n\n## Annual Accounts\n\nThis Annual Report includes the Annual Accounts for 2020, which were prepared by the Executive Board and discussed by both the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.

Noteboom, and was approved by the Supervisory Board. In the first chapter, the Remuneration Committee presents an overview of the business and remuneration highlights in 2020 and/uni00A0a look ahead to 2021. This is followed by chapter two which contains a general introduction to Aegon's Global Remuneration Framework, Human Resources Strategy, Remuneration Principles, the concepts of total compensation and variable compensation, Risk Management in relation to remuneration, and remuneration of/uni00A0Material Risk Takers. The third chapter is the 2020 Supervisory Board Remuneration Report, which contains a summary of the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy that was applicable in 2020 and the Supervisory Board remuneration over the recent years. In chapter four, the 2020 Executive Board Remuneration Report provides a summary of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy that was applicable in 2020, the Executive Board remuneration over the recent years and the 2021 Executive Board performance indicators.\n\n## 1. Business and remuneration highlights\n\nThis chapter presents an overview of the business and remuneration highlights in 2020 and a look ahead to 2021.\n\n## 2020 Business highlights\n\nIn 2020, Aegon introduced its new strategy and put in place a set of measures and new financial targets aimed at increasing value for all our stakeholders. This approach seeks to change\n\nAegon's performance trajectory over the coming years, improving our business by reducing costs, expanding margins and growing profitability. The first concrete steps to deliver on our plans were taken, such as the announcements to divest Stonebridge and our operations in Central & Eastern Europe, and restructuring our businesses in India, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Aegon also took measures to strengthen the balance sheet resulting in the capital ratios of its three main business units ending the year above their respective operating levels. (For a more detailed update, please see the 'Letter from our CEO' and the 'Letter of Supervisory Board Chairman' in this 2020 Integrated Annual Report.)\n\nIn terms of business performance, 2020 was a challenging year. Aegon's Return on Equity decreased in 2020 due to lower results in the Americas. This was largely due to the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, namely adverse mortality and lower interest rates. These drivers also caused the Normalized Capital Generation for 2020 to decrease compared to 2019. Fees and Premium based Revenues in 2020 were broadly stable compared to 2019, as the positive impact from higher equity markets on fees was partly offset by outflows in lines of business such as Variable Annuities and Retirement Plans in the Americas. Market Consistent Value of New Business in 2020 decreased primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on Variable Annuities in the Americas. Lower sales driven by the pandemic were also a contributing factor. The Relational Net Promoter Score increased by one point to 18 due to our NPS improvement plans and administration partnerships with third parties which increased service levels.\n\n| Business performance highlights                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Return on Equity (in %)                                  | 8.5%   | 9.5%   |\n| Fees and Premium based Revenues (in EUR million)         | 4,811  | 4,787  |\n| Normalized Capital Generation (in EUR million)           | 1,340  | 1,569  |\n| Market Consistent Value of New Business (in EUR million) | 262    | 465    |\n| Relational Net Promoter Score                            | 18     | 17     |\n\nIn 2020, Aegon's Supervisory Board consisted of the following members: Mr. William L. Connelly (Chairman), Ms. Corien M. Wortmann-Kool (Vice Chairman), Ms. Dona D. Young, Mr. Mark A. Ellman, Mr. Ben J. Noteboom, Mr. Ben van der Veer (until May 15, 2020), Mr. Thomas Wellauer (per May 15, 2020) and Ms. Caroline Ramsay (per May 15, 2020). At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020, shareholders approved the appointment of Mr. Wellauer and Ms. Ramsay, while/uni00A0at the closure of the meeting the term of Mr. Van der Veer ended. During the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 3, 2021, the Supervisory Board will propose to appoint\n\nMr./uni00A0Jack McGarry and Mr. Frans Blom as members to the Supervisory Board for a term of four years as of June 3, 2021.\n\nAegon's Executive Board consisted of the Chief Executive Officer, who served as Chairman, and the Chief Financial Officer in 2020: Mr. Alexander R. Wynaendts was the Chief Executive Officer from the beginning of 2020 until he was succeeded by Mr. Lard Friese after he was appointed to the Executive Board at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020. Mr. Matthew J. Rider was the Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Executive Board during the full 2020 calendar year. He was appointed as member of the Executive Board for four years at the",

During the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 3, 2021, the Supervisory Board will propose to reappoint Mr. Rider as member to the Executive Board for a term of four years as of June 3, 2021.\n\nAegon's Executive Board is assisted in its work by the Aegon's Management Board, which has 12 members, including the members of the Executive Board. In 2020, Aegon's Management/uni00A0Board was composed of Mr. Alex R. Wynaendts (until May 15, 2020), Mr. Lard Friese (per May 15, 2020), Mr./uni00A0Matthew J. Rider, Mr. Mark Bloom, Mr. Mark Mullin, Mr. Marco Keim, Mr. Maarten Edixhoven, Mr. Adrian Grace (until March 31, 2020), Mr. Mike Holliday-Williams (per April 1, 2020), Mr. Bas NieuweWeme, Ms. Allegra van H\u00f6vell-Patrizi, Mr. Onno van Klinken, Ms. Carla Mahieu and Mr. Duncan Russell (per September 1, 2020).\n\n## 2020 Remuneration highlights\n\nAegon's shareholders adopted the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy and the Executive Board Remuneration Policy at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020 with 98.98% and 83.57% of the votes cast respectively. Both policies were amended to comply with the then new Dutch Act which implemented the European Shareholder Rights Directive, to increase the transparency, and to better substantiate the rationale for the design of the policies. Based on this new Act, both policies also required a qualified majority of 75% of the votes cast. After adoption, both policies came into force retroactively as of January 1, 2020.\n\nThe amendment to the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy did not include any changes to the remuneration structure or fee levels for members of the Supervisory Board. It did add the option for the Supervisory Board to annually index the fees for economic developments in the Netherlands.\n\nCompared to the previous Executive Board Remuneration Policy, the new policy increased the alignment of the Executive Board remuneration with the long-term interest of Aegon. The policy also took into account feedback received on Aegon's previous Remuneration Policy, and embedded new remuneration rules, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 Increasing the portion of variable compensation which is paid in Aegon shares from 50% to 66.66%.\n- \u25a0 Simplifying the pay-out of variable compensation to consist of one upfront cash portion of 33.33% and one share portion of 66.66% which is deferred for 3 years (i.e. cliff-vesting, instead of previous practice of vesting in tranches). After vesting, the shares will be subject to an additional 2-year holding period. This increases the average period during which the allocated shares are restricted from 4.2 years to 5 years.\n- \u25a0 Basing variable compensation on a mix of performance indicators which are measured either on a 1-year or a 3-year performance horizon, instead of a 1-year performance horizon only.\n\n- \u25a0 Including performance indicators, such as Relative Total Shareholder Return and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), both of which are relevant for Aegon, its shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nAt the same Annual General Meeting, shareholders were asked to cast an advisory vote on the Remuneration Report for the first time. The 2019 Remuneration Report was approved with 83.79% of the votes cast. After the vote, Aegon collected feedback from several large shareholders to further improve the quality of the Remuneration Report. Based on this feedback, the Supervisory Board made a few changes to this remuneration highlight section, and disclosed more information on the calculation of variable compensation for the Executive Board in chapter four.\n\nAegon assessed its performance against the 2020 targets that were set prior to the COVID-19 crisis, and no changes to the rules for calculating variable compensation were made as a consequence of it. Aegon believes its mechanism for calculating variable compensation works properly, both in good and in challenging times, so no additional measures were needed. Due to the economic impact of COVID-19, most of the variable compensation that was allocated for 2020 has been lower compared to previous years, including that for the Executive Board members. Aegon also initiated a financial soundness risk assessment in relation to variable compensation which was awarded in previous years (for performance in 2016-2019), and was scheduled to be paid-out in 2020. After/uni00A0reviewing the assessment, the Supervisory Board concluded that payment of these awards would not materially impact the/uni00A0financial soundness of Aegon, and therefore approved the/uni00A0payment thereof.\n\nIn 2020 Aegon paid out EUR 167 million in variable compensation and 23 employees received EUR 1 million or more in total annual compensation (i.e. the sum of fixed compensation, variable compensation and pension contributions paid in 2020). These employees worked for Aegon's Corporate Center, Aegon Americas, Aegon UK and Aegon Asset Management.\n\nThe Executive Board members did not receive a salary increase during 2020. For the period during which the individual served as Executive Board member in 2020, Mr. Friese received EUR 931,071 in fixed compensation (ca. 7.5 months), Mr./uni00A0Wynaendts received EUR 495,931 (ca. 4.5 months) and Mr./uni00A0Rider received EUR 940,950 (full year). For that same period, Mr. Friese was allocated EUR 2.0 million in total compensation, Mr. Wynaendts EUR 1.2 million (2019: EUR 3.9 million for the full year) and Mr. Rider EUR 2.0 million (2019: 2.1 million). In addition, Mr. Friese received a sign-on arrangement of EUR 1.23 million when he joined Aegon in March 2020, of which 50% is in cash and 50% in shares. Of this amount 55% has been paid in 2020. The remainder will be paid in later years subject to continued employment (20% in 2021, 14% in 2022, 9% in 2023 and 3% in 2024). The sign-on arrangement",

Mr. Wynaendts was not entitled to a/uni00A0severance payment after stepping down as Executive Board member and the subsequent termination of his employment.\n\nThe 2020 CEO pay ratio was 32.2 (2019: 32.8, 2018: 42.2). This/uni00A0ratio was based on the annualized IFRS-EU remuneration expenses for Mr. Friese and employee expenses in 2020, which have been audited. The annualized annual expenses for Mr./uni00A0Friese's total compensation were EUR 3.5 million, including EUR 0.9 million for/uni00A0the sign-on arrangement (2019: EUR 3.8 million, 2018: EUR 4.4 million, both for Mr. Wynaendts). The average expenses for the employees' total compensation were EUR 109,855 (2019: EUR 115,371, 2018: EUR 104,459), which were calculated by:\n\n- \u25a0 The total IFRS-EU remuneration expenses for all employees, which are the total employee expenses (see Note 14) minus/uni00A0the CEO remuneration expenses:\n- EUR 1,995 million - EUR 3.5 million = EUR 1,991 million.\n- \u25a0 Divided by the number of employees in scope, which are the total number of employees minus employees in joint ventures and associates (as their expenses are not included in Note 14) and minus the CEO: 22,322 - 4,193 - 1 = 18,128 employees.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee took note that certain factors have influenced the CEO pay ratio, such as the compensation and sign-on package of the new CEO, lower pay-out of variable compensation to employees in 2020, the change to a defined contribution pension plan in the Netherlands per 2020 (was defined benefit) and significant differences in the geographical footprint of the Aegon's employee population, leading to a slight decrease compared to last year.\n\n## Looking ahead to 2021\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 3, 2021, Aegon will ask its shareholders to approve the reappointment of Mr. Rider to the Executive Board and cast an advisory vote on this Remuneration Report.\n\nMr. Rider's fixed compensation will be increased by 5% per June/uni00A02021 (from EUR 940,950 to EUR 987,998), if shareholders approve his reappointment. His last increase was two years ago (2.5% per June 2019). The increase will keep Mr. Rider aligned with internal and external compensation levels, economic developments (e.g. inflation) and changes to the compensation levels of other senior managers within Europe and in the Netherlands. There are no other changes foreseen to the compensation packages of Mr. Friese and Mr. Rider in 2021.\n\nAegon will monitor the development of rules, regulations and guidance that could affect our remuneration policies. This includes the intended changes to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, and the finalization of the European Committee's guidelines on the standardized presentation of the remuneration report.\n\n## 2. Remuneration at Aegon in general\n\nThis chapter contains a general introduction to Aegon's Global Remuneration Framework, Human Resources Strategy, Remuneration Principles, the concepts of total compensation and variable compensation, Risk Management in relation to remuneration and remuneration of Material Risk Takers.\n\n## Global Remuneration Framework\n\nAegon's Global Remuneration Framework (GRF) outlines the Aegon Group Human Resources Strategy, the Aegon Group Remuneration Principles and the Aegon Group Remuneration Guidelines, which apply to all Aegon employees, including the Executive Board members. The GRF has been designed in accordance with relevant rules, guidelines, and interpretations, such as the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Solvency/uni00A0II Legal Framework.\n\nAegon's remuneration policies are derived from the GRF, which includes the Executive Board Remuneration Policy and local business Remuneration Policies. These policies define specific terms and conditions for the employment of our employees across the various countries and local businesses. All steps in the remuneration process are governed by the GRF and its underlying policies. Staff from Human Resources, Risk Management and Compliance are involved in all steps of the process.\n\n## Human Resources Strategy\n\nIn order to support the Aegon Strategy and local business objectives, the Aegon Group Human Resources Strategy contains the following remuneration-related goals:\n\n- \u25a0 Attract, retain, motivate, and reward a highly qualified and diverse workforce;\n- \u25a0 Align the interests of executives, managers and all other employees with the business strategy and risk tolerance, the values and the long-term interests of Aegon;\n- \u25a0 Provide a well-balanced and performance-related compensation package to all employees, taking into account shareholder and other stakeholder interests, relevant regulations, the corporate responsibilities and Future Fit values ('Acting as one, Customer centricity, Agility and Accountability').\n\n## Remuneration Principles\n\nBased on the Human Resources Strategy, Aegon has formulated the following Remuneration Principles, which are the foundation for all remuneration policies and practices within the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 Aegon remuneration is employee-oriented by fostering a sense of value and appreciation in each individual employee; promoting the short- and long-term interests and well-being of all Aegon staff via fair compensation, pension and/or other benefits; supporting employees' career development; and supporting the (international) mobility of its staff;\n- \u25a0 Aegon remuneration is performance-related by establishing a clear link between pay and performance by aligning objectives and target setting with performance evaluation and\n\nV",

Total compensation typically consists of fixed compensation, variable compensation (where in line with the local market practice), pension and other benefits. Market survey information from reputable sources is used to regularly assess the competitiveness of compensation levels and practices which Aegon offers its employees.\n\n## Variable compensation\n\nVariable compensation, if any, is capped at an appropriate level as a percentage of fixed compensation.\n\nThe Dutch Financial Supervision Act has a provision that makes it possible to offer employees up to a maximum variable compensation opportunity that is equal to the European/uni00A0Capital Requirements Directive compensation ratio (i.e. 100% of fixed compensation). This provision was specifically created for corporate office employees of companies based in the Netherlands, which employ at least 75% of their employees abroad. In 2020, Aegon met this criterion and offered selected senior corporate office employees a variable compensation opportunity up to this maximum.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, Aegon has obtained shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of May 20, 2016 to offer a maximum variable compensation opportunity up to 200% of fixed compensation to\n\nselected senior employees outside Europe in positions that, based on local market practice, could receive variable compensation that exceeds 100% of fixed compensation./uni00A0Within this mandate, Aegon offered selected senior employees outside Europe such an opportunity in 2020. Aegon's capital was not adversely impacted by the maximum variable compensation that could be paid out.\n\nVariable compensation for senior management is usually paid out in cash and shares over multiple years, and is subject to further conditions being fulfilled. Variable compensation already paid out may also be retrieved under certain circumstances ('claw-back').\n\n## Risk Management in relation to Remuneration\n\nVariable compensation may have an impact on risk-taking behaviors and, as such, may undermine effective risk management. The opportunity to receive high variable compensation can lead to excessive risk taking, which can have a material impact on Aegon's financial soundness. To avoid such undesired effects, both the Risk Management and Compliance functions are involved in the design and execution of remuneration policies and practices.\n\nThe GRF includes additional remuneration requirements for three specific employee categories, as their roles and responsibilities require tailored risk mitigating measures and governance processes. These remuneration requirements are for: (i) the Executive Board; (ii) Material Risk Takers; and (iii) Control Staff. Given the rationale for having a separate policy for Material Risk Takers and the risk mitigating measures that are applied to the remuneration of these individuals, Risk Management is involved in deciding which positions are deemed Material Risk Takers. Furthermore, where exceptions to the policies are requested to reflect local practices or regulations, Risk Management and Compliance are involved to ensure such exceptions do not undermine effective risk management and that sufficient mitigating measures are undertaken.\n\nIn addition, the Risk Management and Compliance functions, together with the Human Resources and Finance functions, are responsible for the execution of the various measures that ensure the GRF and associated practices are aligned with the defined risk tolerances and behaviors. The risk mitigating measures are aimed at various moments in the variable compensation process: when the targets are set, before a variable compensation award is allocated, before deferred parts of the award are paid and after pay-out of the award (when relevant).\n\nAegon endeavors to seek an appropriate balance of ex-ante and ex-post risk assessments to ensure effectiveness in both the short- and long-term risk-taking behavior of employees.\n\n## Remuneration of Material Risk Takers\n\nAegon selects Material Risk Takers for the Aegon N.V. legal entity (i.e. the holding company) based on the Solvency II selection criteria. These positions are defined as 'the administrative, management or supervisory body, persons who effectively run",

Their selection is based on the selection criteria of the applicable European Directive, its guidelines, and local regulatory requirements (where available).\n\nIn order to differentiate between the Material Risk Takers who are selected at the holding level of the company and at the various legal entities within the Group, the former are called Group Material Risk Takers and the latter Local Material Risk Takers.\n\nThe Group and Local Material Risk Takers are subsequently subject to risk assessments and remuneration rules outlined in the applicable European Directive, its guidelines and local regulatory requirements (where available). This means that their personal objectives are subject to an ex-ante risk assessment at the start of the performance year. A minimum portion of their variable compensation will be deferred and paid in non-cash instruments (such as Aegon shares or investment in own funds). Before the allocation of variable compensation they are subject to an ex-ante risk assessment, while before pay-out of any deferred variable compensation they are subject to ex-post risk assessments. Based on these risk assessments, Aegon can adjust the intended or allocated variable compensation awards downward where deemed appropriate (however never upward).\n\n## 3. 2020 Supervisory Board Remuneration Report\n\nThe 2020 Supervisory Board Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the Dutch Civil Code/uni00A0(article art 2:135b) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The Remuneration Committee was led by the Committee's Chairman Ben J. Noteboom. This report was approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThis report contains a contains a summary of the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy which applied to 2020 and the Supervisory Board remuneration over the recent years.\n\nAegon's Supervisory Board remuneration is subject to various rules and regulations, including the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Solvency II Legal Framework.\n\n## Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy in 2020\n\nAegon's Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy is aimed at ensuring fair compensation and protecting the independence of the Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy that has been applied in 2020 was adopted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020. This policy will be subject to annual reviews by the Supervisory Board. The policy remains in place until a new or revised policy has been adopted by the shareholders in accordance with the applicable requirements from the Dutch Civil Code. The Supervisory Board will submit a proposal to the shareholders to adopt a policy at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders at least every four years.\n\nThe policy contributes to Aegon's strategy, long-term interests, and sustainability through the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members in various ways:\n\n- \u25a0 The policy provides the Supervisory Board with the means to attract, motivate, and retain competent, diverse, and experienced Supervisory Board members for the long-term. This is essential for executing Aegon's strategy and safeguarding and promoting its long-term interests and sustainability.\n- \u25a0 Supervisory Board members receive fixed remuneration for their responsibilities which does not depend on the Aegon results in order to protect their independence when supervising the manner in which the Executive Board members implement the long-term value creation strategy. These responsibilities are part of the membership of the Supervisory Board and its Committees and the position of (Vice) Chairman of the Supervisory Board and/or its Committees. The certainty of the fixed compensation also allows Supervisory Board members in their supervisory role to focus on the long-term interest and sustainability of Aegon.\n- \u25a0 The Supervisory Board members receive fixed remuneration for their activities, such as attending Committee meetings and additional Supervisory Board meetings, in order to regularly discuss the Aegon strategy, the implementation of the strategy and the principal risks associated with it, while taking into account the broader long-term interests and sustainability of Aegon.\n- \u25a0 Supervisory Board members are only allowed to privately own Aegon N.V. Shares if this is a long-term investment, aligning their interests with Aegon's long-term interests.",

The main operations are in the US, the Netherlands, and the UK, while there is also significant presence in Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The policy provides the Supervisory Board with the means to attract, motivate, and retain Supervisory Board members from various countries, predominantly based in the Netherlands and the US. As Aegon is based in the Netherlands, the policy considers the European Insurance peers as well as Dutch General Industry peers to be the relevant external reference for the Supervisory Board member's Remuneration. The policy is also influenced by the European and Dutch rules and regulations on (Executive) remuneration, which apply to Aegon as a result of its identity (i.e. being an Insurance firm in Europe and being a listed and financial company in the Netherlands).\n- \u25a0 Aegon's purpose is to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security. In order to fulfill this purpose, Aegon has a strategy to which this policy actively contributes (see above).\n\nThe Supervisory Board has not taken the internal compensation structures and levels into account as the fee-based compensation structure for Supervisory Board members differs significantly from these internal compensation structures and levels.\n\nThe Supervisory Board members are entitled to the following fees (see also the table below):\n\n- \u25a0 A base fee for membership of the Supervisory Board. No separate attendance fees are paid to members for attendance at the regular Supervisory Board meetings;\n- \u25a0 An attendance fee for each extra Board meeting attended, be it in person or by video and/or telephone conference;\n- \u25a0 A committee fee for members on each of the Supervisory Board's Committees;\n- \u25a0 An attendance fee for each Committee meeting attended, be it in person or through video and/or telephone conference; and\n- \u25a0 An additional fee for attending meetings that require intercontinental, continental or US interstate travel between the Supervisory Board member's home location and the meeting location.\n- \u25a0 The four Future Fit values 'Acting as one, Customer centricity, Agility, and Accountability' aim to create a company that is fit for the future: one that meets customers' expectations, is right for our digitally-connected, data-driven world, and can adapt quickly to changing market conditions. These values are not explicitly reflected in the policy as a result of the fee-based remuneration structure. However, these values are strongly incorporated in the Supervisory Board Charter.\n\n| Base fee for Supervisory Board membership      | EUR / year   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Chairman                                       | 80,000       |\n| Vice-Chairman                                  | 50,000       |\n| Member                                         | 40,000       |\n| Fee for Supervisory Board committee membership | EUR / year   |\n| Chairman of the Audit or Risk Committee        | 13,000       |\n| Member of the Audit or Risk Committee          | 8,000        |\n| Chairman of other committees                   | 10,000       |\n| Member of other committees                     | 5,000        |\n| Attendance fees Committee meeting              | EUR 3,000    |\n| Extra Supervisory Board meeting                |              |\n|                                                | 3,000        |\n| Travel fees                                    | EUR          |\n| Intercontinental                               | 4,000        |\n\nEach of these fees is a fixed amount. The Supervisory Board is allowed to annually index the fees for economic developments in the Netherlands, however the fees have not been indexed in 2020.\n\nThe Supervisory Board members do not receive any performance or equity-related compensation, and do not accrue pension rights with Aegon.

For this purpose, the Supervisory Board selected a primary set of peer group companies according to the following/uni00A0criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 Industry: Insurance, with a preference for Life Insurance;\n- \u25a0 Size: Average Market Capitalization, Employees, Revenue and Total Assets;\n- \u25a0 Geographic scope: Preferably companies that operate globally; and\n- \u25a0 Location: Headquarters based in Europe, excluding UK (because the non-executive directors typically have different responsibilities compared to their continental European counterparts).\n\nBased on these criteria the current peer group consists of the following 12 European Insurance companies: Ageas, Allianz, AXA, CNP Assurances, Assicurazioni Generali, Mapfre, M\u00fcnchener RE, NN Group, Swiss Life, Swiss Re, Talanx and Zurich Insurance Group. This peer group differs from the European peer group for the Executive Board as a result of excluding the UK companies. The peer group is reviewed each year and may be updated accordingly. The last update of this peer group was in 2018.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board selects a secondary peer group according to the following criteria, in order to monitor alignment with the General Industry in the Netherlands:\n\n- \u25a0 Industry: General Industry and listed on the AEX;\n- \u25a0 Size: Average Market Capitalization, Employees, Revenue and Total Assets;\n- \u25a0 Location: Headquarters based in the Netherlands.\n\nBased on these criteria, the current secondary peer group consists of the following 12 AEX companies: Ahold Delhaize, ING Group, Randstad, Heineken, NN Group, Philips, ABN AMRO, Akzo Nobel, ASML, DSM, KPN, and Wolters Kluwer. This peer group is also reviewed each year and was last updated in 2019. ING, NN Group, ABN AMRO, DSM, and Wolters Kluwer were added and replaced ArcelorMittal, RELX Group, Royal Dutch Shell, UnibailRodamco-Westfield, and Unilever. This peer group is identical to the Dutch peer group for the Executive Board.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may recommend changes to the fee levels of the Supervisory Board members, based on the results of a competitiveness review. Such recommendations would be discussed by the Supervisory Board, which can support, revise or reject them. Subsequently, shareholders will be asked to adopt the proposed fee changes at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe policy contains a temporary derogation clause, with rules which are in accordance with the Dutch Civil Code. This means derogation is only allowed in exceptional circumstances to serve the long-term interest and sustainability of Aegon or to assure its viability, for a limited period of time, when it stays in line with the general spirit of the policy and when the details are disclosed in the next remuneration report. This clause was not used in 2020.\n\nInformation on members of the Supervisory Board and the composition of its four committees can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board in this 2020 Integrated Annual Report.\n\nFinancial information",

This means 25% of the annual base fee for Supervisory Board membership and any Supervisory Board committee membership, taking into account their function (i.e. Chairman, Vice-Chairman or regular members) and the fees for their actual attendance and travel during that quarter.",

The Remuneration Committee was led by the Committee's Chairman Ben J. Noteboom. This report was approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThis report contains a summary of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy that applied to 2020, the Executive Board remuneration over the recent years and the 2021 Executive Board performance indicators. The section on remuneration over the recent years is split into a) fixed compensation 20182020, b) conditional variable compensation 2020, c) provisional variable compensation 2020, d) variable compensation 20182020, e) pay-out of allocated variable compensation, f) pension contributions 2018-2020, g) benefits 2018-2020, h) total compensation in recent years.\n\n## Executive Board Remuneration Policy in 2020\n\nThe Supervisory Board has the overall responsibility for Aegon's Remuneration Policies, including the Executive Board Remuneration Policy. The Executive Board Remuneration Policy that has been applied in 2020 was adopted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020. This policy will be subject to annual reviews by the Supervisory Board. The policy remains in place until a new or revised policy has been adopted by the shareholders in accordance with the applicable requirements from the Dutch Civil Code. The Supervisory Board will submit a proposal to the shareholders to adopt a policy at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders at least every four years.\n\nThe current policy contributes to Aegon's strategy, long-term interests and sustainability through the remuneration of the Executive Board members in various ways:\n\n- \u25a0 The policy provides the Supervisory Board with the means to attract, motivate and retain competent and experienced Executive Board members for the long-term. This is essential for executing Aegon's strategy and safeguarding and promoting its long-term interests and sustainability.\n- \u25a0 The leading performance indicator categories for successful execution of our strategy are Capital, Growth and Strategy. To support the execution of Aegon's strategy, the policy makes these performance indicator categories mandatory for the Executive Board member.\n- \u25a0 Aegon strives to create long-term value for its stakeholders and the communities in which it operates. Due to the nature of our business, value created is often financial, but it may also be social, economic, or environmental. The policy directly aligns Executive Board member's personal long-term interests with those of Aegon and its shareholders by paying a significant part of the Executive Board members' variable compensation (two-thirds) in shares, which must be held for 5 years after completion of the performance period. The pay-out in these restricted shares is combined with prohibiting Executive Board members using personal hedging strategies\n\n- or insurance, which could undermine this long-term alignment of interests. Additionally, Executive Board members are aligned with the long-term interest of Aegon, its shareholders and other stakeholders through the use of mandatory performance indicator categories of Earnings, Shareholders and Other Stakeholders.\n- \u25a0 Aegon is committed to doing business responsibly and in a sustainable way. Variable compensation of Executive Board members can be adjusted downwards (i.e. malus) or clawedback in cases where certain performance has not been achieved in a sustainable way. This includes but not limited to: significant risk and compliance incidents, insufficient response to such incidents and/or insufficient evidence of embedding of good standards of practice, such as sound and responsible business practices and integrity of products and services delivered. Additionally, the policy makes the performance indicator category Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG'), mandatory for Executive Board members to support this approach of doing business.\n\nAegon's Executive Board remuneration is subject to various rules and regulations, including the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Solvency II Legal Framework. The most prominent requirements thereof are:\n\n- \u25a0 The total variable compensation amount that is allocated to an Executive Board member for a performance year cannot exceed 100% of the fixed compensation level.\n- \u25a0 Variable compensation should be based on a mix of Aegon and personal performance, with at least 50% weight on non-financial performance.\n- \u25a0 A substantial portion of any variable compensation award should be paid in a non-cash instrument (e.g. Aegon shares) and should be deferred for at least 3 years. Additionally, award shares should be restricted for 5 years. With a 3-year vesting period, this requires an additional holding period of 2-years.\n- \u25a0 Aegon can claw-back any variable compensation which has been paid (cash and shares) in specific circumstances such as a material financial restatement or individual gross misconduct./uni00A0\n\nThese are also the main reasons why Aegon operates one Executive Board variable compensation plan per year, with a single variable compensation award which is subsequently split into cash and shares, rather than operating separate Short-Term Incentive (cash) and Long-Term Incentive (share) Plans.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may recommend policy changes to the Supervisory Board. In that case, the Remuneration Committee will conduct scenario analyses to determine the long-term effects on the level and structure of compensation granted to each Executive Board member, and reports their findings to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board can subsequently decide on referring the proposed policy changes to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for adoption.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe policy contains a temporary derogation clause, with rules which are in accordance with the Dutch Civil Code. This means derogation is only allowed in exceptional circumstances to serve the long-term interest and sustainability of Aegon or to assure its viability, for a limited period of time, when it stays in line with the general spirit of the policy and when the details are disclosed in the next remuneration report. This clause was not used in 2020.\n\n## Total compensation\n\nTotal compensation for Executive Board members is defined in the Executive Board Remuneration Policy as a combination of fixed compensation, variable compensation, pension and other benefits. The Supervisory Board determines and regularly reviews the appropriate selection of remuneration elements and their (maximum) remuneration level for Executive Board members to ensure the structure remains competitive and provides proper and risk-based incentives in line with Aegon's risk appetite. The fixed and variable compensation elements and their levels are reviewed at least once a year. The pension arrangements and other benefits and their levels are reviewed at least every four years. In its review, the Supervisory Board takes the specific role, responsibilities, experience and expertise of Executive Board members into account as well as internal and external reference information:\n\n- \u25a0 The internal references are the compensation structure and levels of the members of the Management Board of Aegon N.V. and the annual compensation changes of the general employee population and senior managers within Europe and the Netherlands specifically.\n- \u25a0 The external references are compensation trends in the market, economic developments (e.g. inflation) as well as quantitative assessments of the competitiveness against a peer group of insurance companies in Europe and a peer group of companies based in the Netherlands.\n- \u25a0 Additionally, the Remuneration Committee conducts a scenario analysis in case of a policy change to determine the long-term effect on the remuneration structure and level of each Executive Board member, and reports their findings to the Supervisory Board./uni00A0\n\nThe European Insurance peer group was selected by the following/uni00A0criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 Industry: Insurance, with a preference for Life Insurance;\n- \u25a0 Size: Average market capitalization, employees, revenue and total assets;\n- \u25a0 Geographic scope: Preferably companies which operate globally;\n- \u25a0 Location: Headquarters based in Europe.\n\nBased on these criteria, the current peer group consists of the following 16 European Insurance companies: Ageas, Allianz, Aviva, AXA, CNP Assurances, Assicurazioni Generali, Legal & General, Mapfre, M\u00fcnchener Re, NN Group, Prudential, RSA Insurance Group, Swiss Life Holding, Swiss Re, Talanx and Zurich Insurance Group. The last update of this peer group was in 2020.\n\nAgeas, RSA Insurance Group, Swiss Life Holding and Talanx were added, while Old Mutual and Standard Life Aberdeen were removed. The increased peer group size (from 14 to 16) created a more balanced selection in relation to Aegon's size data (average market capitalization, employees, revenue and total assets). This peer group differs from the European peer group for the Supervisory Board,/uni00A0/uni00A0as the latter excludes UK companies where non-executive directors typically have different responsibilities compared to their continental European counterparts.\n\nThe Dutch peer group was selected by the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 Industry: General Industry and listed on the AEX;\n- \u25a0 Size: Average Market Capitalization, Employees, Revenue and Total Assets;\n- \u25a0 Location: Headquarters based in the Netherlands.\n\nBased on these criteria, this peer group consists of the following 12 AEX companies: Ahold Delhaize, ING Group, Randstad, Heineken, NN Group, Philips, ABN AMRO, Akzo Nobel, ASML, DSM, KPN and Wolters Kluwer. The last update of this peer group was in 2019, when ING, NN Group, ABN AMRO, DSM and Wolters Kluwer were added, replacing ArcelorMittal, RELX Group, Royal Dutch Shell, Unibail-Rodamco and Unilever. This peer group is identical to the Dutch peer group for the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board will review both peer groups annually and will amend them as necessary, within the above-mentioned selection criteria, to ensure they continue to provide a reliable basis for comparison. Any change to the peer group will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may recommend changes to the compensation levels of the Executive Board members in accordance with Remuneration Policy, based on the results of this annual total compensation review and on discussions with the Executive Board members regarding their remuneration level and structure. Such recommendations would subsequently be discussed by the Supervisory Board, which can approve, revise or reject them.\n\nThe Supervisory Board discussed and approved the 2020 total compensation for the Executive Board, after taking the Remuneration Committee's review into consideration.\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation for the Executive Board members is paid in monthly instalments. The policy allows the fixed compensation to be paid in cash and in shares. All Executive Board members received their 2020 fixed compensation in cash.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may offer permanent or temporary gross monthly fixed allowance when the Supervisory Board considers this an appropriate alternative for other remuneration elements. Mr. Wynaendts continued to receive a 2% fixed allowance to which he already was entitled until the end of his term. Mr./uni00A0Friese and Mr. Rider are not entitled to an allowance.",

The performance indicators contribute to Aegon's strategy, long-term interests and sustainability, within Aegon's risk tolerance and should comply with the following rules:\n\n- \u25a0 It contains a mix of financial and non-financial performance indicators, with at least 50% weight allocated to the non-financial performance indicators in accordance with article 1:118.3 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act;\n- \u25a0 The maximum weight for unadjusted financial indicators is determined by the Global Remuneration Framework and is currently set at 50%./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 It contains a mix of Aegon and personal performance indicators, which can range in weight between 50-80% and 20-50% respectively, depending on the Aegon priorities of the performance year.\n- \u25a0 At least 20% of the indicators has a retrospective 3-year performance horizon, while the remainder has a 1-year performance horizon;\n- \u25a0 The indicators should cover/uni00A0the following mandatory performance indicator categories: Shareholders, Capital, Earnings, Growth, Stakeholders, ESG and Strategy.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee and the Executive Board members prepare a proposal for the performance indicators, weights and target levels. These are subsequently reviewed by Aegon's Risk Management team (i.e. the first ex-ante risk assessment) before the Supervisory Board approves these, to ensure that:\n\n- \u25a0 The performance indicators and weights are in line with the policy;\n- \u25a0 The financial performance indicators are consistent with the risk tolerance statements;\n- \u25a0 The non-financial performance indicators are consistent with risk tolerance levels, regulatory requirements, reasonable stakeholder expectations and are supporting sound and responsible business practices and integrity of the products and services delivered./uni00A0\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sends the proposal and the ex-ante risk assessment to the Supervisory Board, which can approve, revise or reject the proposal. After approval, the Executive Board members are granted their conditional variable compensation awards for the plan year. This conditional award equals their at target variable compensation level, split between 33.33% upfront cash and 66.66% deferred Aegon shares. The grant price for the shares is equal to the volume\n\nweighted average price on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange for the period December 15 to January 15 at the start of the plan year.\n\nAfter the completion of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee prepares a recommendation for the allocation of a variable compensation award to each Executive Board member. This recommendation is based on the actual performance results compared to target levels and takes a second ex-ante risk assessment by the Risk Management team into account. This risk assessment looks into whether there are reasons for a downward adjustment of the intended variable compensation award (malus) which were not take into account yet, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 Significant risk or compliance incident(s);\n- \u25a0 Insufficient response to risk incident(s), compliance incident(s), regulatory fine(s) and/or insufficient execution of risk mitigating measures in response to these incidents;\n- \u25a0 Breaches of laws and regulations;\n- \u25a0 Insufficient evidence of embedding good standards of practice;\n- \u25a0 Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n- \u25a0 Reputation damage due to risk events.\n\nIn this assessment possible risk mitigating behaviors are also taken into account, such as remaining within risk limits, risk reduction, risk avoidance, risk transfer and risk response by the Executive Board member./uni00A0\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sends its recommendation and the second ex-ante risk assessment to the Supervisory Board, which can approve, revise or reject the recommendation. This Supervisory Board decision includes validating that, when taken together, the results of the performance indicators represent a fair reflection of the overall performance of the Executive Board member over the performance year.\n\nThe allocated variable compensation award is subsequently split between 33.33% upfront cash (i.e. paid in the year following the performance year) and 66.66% deferred shares. These shares are deferred for a 3-year period after allocation after which they cliff-vest. Before vesting, the Risk Management team executes an ex-post risk assessment which looks into whether there are reasons for a downward adjustment of the original variable compensation award (malus) which were not taken into account yet. This risk assessment takes the same criteria into consideration as the second ex-ante risk assessment. Based on this assessment, the Remuneration Committee subsequently prepares a recommendation how to pay-out the deferred portion (i.e. unchanged or adjusted downward). The Remuneration Committee sends its recommendation and the ex-post risk assessment to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board can approve, revise or reject the recommendation./uni00A0",

Examples of misconduct are, but not limited to, a significant breach of laws and/ or regulations, use of violence, either verbally or physically, involvement with fraud, corruption or bribery, significant issues due to evident dereliction of duty and/or discrimination of any kind (for example age or gender). For practical reasons the clawback amount can be set-off or settled against any current or future obligations as permitted by law.\n\n## Pension arrangements\n\nThe Executive Board members are entitled to pension contributions that equal 40% of their fixed compensation level, which consists of the following three parts:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Participation in Aegon's defined contribution pension plan for/uni00A0NL-based employees, for their fixed income up to EUR/uni00A0110,111 (2020 threshold set by Dutch law).\n- \u25a0 Participation in Aegon's defined contribution pension plan for/uni00A0NL-based employees, for their fixed income above EUR 110,111.\n- \u25a0 An additional gross allowance for pension to make the sum of these three pension contributions equal to 40% of their fixed compensation level.\n\nThe Executive Board members receive pension contributions that are somewhat higher compared to NL-based employees of similar age (ca. 10-15% difference). This is done to achieve a competitive total compensation level. Please note the Supervisory Board will consider discontinuing the additional gross allowance for new Executive Board members, while ensuring their total compensation level stays competitive, and including this as a policy change in the next update of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Wynaendts was entitled to an additional gross allowance for pension of 28% of his fixed compensation level as part of a grandfathered pension arrangement./uni00A0\n\n## Other benefits\n\nOther benefits include non-monetary benefits (e.g. company car), social security contributions by the employer, and tax expenses borne by Aegon./uni00A0\n\nAegon does not grant Executive Board members personal loans, guarantees or other such arrangements, unless in the normal course of business and on terms applicable to all employees, and only with the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Terms of Engagement\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are appointed for four years and may then be re-appointed for successive mandates also for a period of four years. Executive Board members have a board agreement with Aegon N.V., rather than an employment contract. Members of the Executive Board may terminate their board agreement with a notice period of three months. The Supervisory Board may terminate the board agreement by giving six months' notice if it wishes to terminate the agreement.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may entitle Executive Board members to a termination payment up to or equal to the total annual fixed compensation level. This payment is not allowed in case of early termination at the initiative of the Executive Board member (unless due to imputable acts or omissions of Aegon), imputable acts or omissions by the Executive or failure of Aegon during the appointment term of the Executive Board members. Mr. Friese and Mr. Rider have a termination clause included in their board agreement. Mr. Wynaendts was not entitled to a termination payment when his board agreement was terminated in 2020.\n\n## Executive Board remuneration in recent years\n\nIn this section you will find the fixed compensation, variable compensation, pension, other benefits, and total compensation amounts of the Executive Board members. Please note that the 2020 compensation amounts for Mr. Friese and Mr. Wynaendts are pro-rated because of joining and leaving the Executive Board respectively on May 15, 2020, unless stated otherwise (e.g. when amounts are annualized).",

Fixed compensation 2018-2020\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Friese received EUR 931 thousand in fixed compensation (annualized EUR 1,485 thousand), Mr. Wynaendts received EUR 496 thousand (annualized EUR 1,327 thousand) and Mr. Rider received EUR 941 thousand. None of the Executive Board members received an increase in their fixed compensation level in 2020. In addition to this and the table below, Mr. Friese received a sign-on arrangement of EUR 1,228 thousand when joining Aegon in March 2020, that was split between 50% in cash (EUR 617 thousand) and 50% in Aegon shares (161,333 shares).\n\nOf this amount 55% has been paid in 2020. The remainder will be paid in later years subject to continued employment (20% in 2021, 14% in 2022, 9% in 2023 and 3% in 2024). The IFRS-EU expenses for these fixed compensation amounts were equal to the amounts in the table/uni00A0below, except for Mr. Friese in 2020 due to the nature of his sign-on arrangement. The combined IFRS-EU expenses for his regular fixed compensation and sign-on arrangement were EUR 1,869 thousand (EUR 570 thousand for the cash-part of the sign-on arrangement and EUR 368 thousand for the share-part).\n\n| In EUR thousand          | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Lard Friese 1)           | 931    | -      | -      |\n| Alex Wynaendts 2)        | 496    | 1,314  | 1,295  |\n| Matt Rider               | 941    | 931    | 918    |\n| Total fixed compensation | 2,368  | 2,245  | 2,213  |\n\n- 1 The disclosed amount for 2020 covers the period that Mr. Friese has been a member of the Executive Board (per May 15, 2020). The annualized amount is EUR 1,485 thousand (excluding sign-on amounts).\n- 2 The disclosed amount for 2020 covers the period that Mr. Wynaendts was a member of the Executive Board (until May 15, 2020). The annualized amount is EUR 1,327 thousand.\n\n## B. Conditional variable compensation 2020\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Friese, Mr. Wynaendts and Mr. Rider each had an at target variable compensation opportunity of 80% of their fixed compensation level at year-end (or end of term). The variable compensation award was based on the results on the Aegon and their personal performance indicators and related target levels,\n\nwhich had been approved by the Supervisory Board at the start of 2020 (or after their appointment). As a result, they would receive the following if the performance indicator results reached the threshold (50%), target (80%) and maximum level (100%), taking into account the grant price of EUR 4.083 for the shares:\n\n| Variable compensation opportunity 2020   | Variable compensation opportunity 2020   | Threshold (50%)   | Target (80%)   | Maximum (100%)   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Lard Friese                              | Total (EUR thousand)                     | 466               | 745            | 931              |\n|                                          | in cash (EUR thousand)                   | 155               | 248            | 310              |\n|                                          | in shares                                | 76,012            | 121,619        | 152,024          |\n| Alex Wynaendts                           | Total (EUR thousand)                     | 248               | 397            | 496              |\n|                                          | in cash (EUR thousand)                   | 83                | 132            | 165              |\n|                                          | in shares                                | 40,487            | 64,779         | 80,974           |\n| Matt Rider                               | Total (EUR thousand)                     | 470               | 753            | 941              |\n|                                          | in cash (EUR thousand)                   | 157               | 251            | 314              |\n|                                          | in shares                                | 76,818            | 122,909        | 153,637          |\n\n## C.

Mr. Friese and Mr. Rider voluntarily agreed to at least hold on to the shares received as compensation to an equivalent of 100% of their fixed compensation level, once they have reached that level. This concerns the total net number of shares which have been allocated to them, but that have not been sold (i.e. includes the net number of shares in the deferral period and holding period). After the allocation of the 2020 variable compensation award, Mr. Friese will hold 42% of his fixed compensation in net shares and Mr. Rider 78%. Please note Mr. Rider received 50% of his variable compensation in shares for the 2017-2019 period, while per the new 2020 Executive Board Remuneration Policy all Executive Board members receive 67% of their variable compensation in deferred shares.\n\n## F. Pension contributions 2018-2020\n\nThe allocated amounts in the first table represent the total pension contributions made in relation to the performance year concerned. The second table contains the expenses for pension, as recognized under the IFRS-EU accounting treatment in the income statement.\n\nMr. Friese (from May 2020), Mr. Wynaendts (from June 2019) and Mr. Rider received pension contributions which equaled to 40% of their fixed compensation level. Up to and including May 2019, Mr. Wynaendts participated in a defined benefit arrangement. This arrangement included a back service liability which reflected the increase of his fixed compensation in 2016 and 2018, as well as low interest rates and the final settlement made in May 2019. Additionally, Mr. Wynaendts was entitled to a gross payment of 28% of his fixed compensation level as part of a grandfathered pension arrangement.\n\n| In EUR thousand             | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Lard Friese 1)              | 373    | -      | -      |\n| Alex Wynaendts 2)           | 337    | 1,302  | 2,463  |\n| Matt Rider                  | 376    | 373    | 367    |\n| Total pension contributions | 1,086  | 1,675  | 2,830  |",

We have internal policies, procedures and frameworks setting out how decisions should be made in areas such as procurement, investment, tax, product development, remuneration and information security. We also have a Code of Conduct, which applies to all Aegon employees worldwide. The Code of Conduct contains basic principles governing our workplace, social responsibility and business conduct. The aim of these policies and procedures is to protect stakeholders by ensuring we are aware in our decision-making of all relevant financial and non-\n\nfinancial factors. We monitor implementation and take remedial action where necessary to ensure full compliance. We have a dedicated Non-Financial Risk Committee, meeting monthly. The Committee's members are drawn from Aegon's Legal, Compliance and Risk departments, among others.\n\nThe table below shows how various environment, social and governance (ESG) risks are incorporated into Aegon's decisionmaking processes, as well as the measurement of outcomes, policies and metrics.\n\n| EU Directive  2014/95/EU  on Non- Financial  Information   | Area              | Policy or guideline                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Indicators  (used to  monitor compliance  and/or outcomes)                                                          | Performance 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Article 3.1.b(i)  Environmental,  social and  personnel    | Business  conduct | Code of Conduct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| matters                                                    | and ethics        | \u00b7 Applies to all employees worldwide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00b7 Total number of  incidents of fraud  involving employees,  intermediaries and  third parties                      | \u00b7 Incidents of possible fraud involving  employees, intermediaries and third  parties decreased to 4,014.

(Re)insurance companies and Aegon Bank (KNAB), as well as some of the investment undertakings in the Group, are required to maintain a minimum solvency margin based on local requirements. In addition, the Group as a whole is subject to prudential requirements on a group basis, including capital, internal governance, risk management, reporting and disclosure requirements, pursuant to Solvency II and the Financial Conglomerates Directive. Eligible capital to cover solvency requirements includes shareholders' equity, perpetual capital securities, and dated subordinated debt.\n\n## Solvency II Introduction\n\nThe Solvency II framework imposes prudential requirements at group level as well as on the individual EU insurance and reinsurance companies in the Aegon Group. Insurance supervision is exercised by local supervisors on the individual insurance and reinsurance companies in the Aegon Group, and by the group supervisor at group level. The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) is Aegon's Solvency II group supervisor. Solvency II, which came into effect in EU member states on January 1, 2016, introduced economic, risk-based capital requirements for insurance and reinsurance companies in all EU member states, as well as for groups with insurance and/or reinsurance activities in the EU. The Solvency II approach to prudential supervision can be described as a 'total balance sheet-approach,' and takes material risks to which insurance companies are exposed into account.\n\nThe Solvency II framework is structured along three pillars. Pillar 1 comprises quantitative requirements (including technical provisions, valuation of assets and liabilities, solvency requirements and own fund requirements). Pillar 2 requirements include governance and risk management requirements, and requirements for effective supervision (the supervisory review process). Pillar 3 consists of disclosure and supervisory reporting requirements. These three pillars should not only be considered in isolation, but also in terms of how they interact with one another. More complex risks, for instance, require a stronger risk management and governance structure or could lead to higher capital requirements. In addition to these requirements, which apply to individual EU insurers and reinsurers, the Solvency II framework is complemented by requirements that apply at group level (group supervision). This means that a number of requirements from the Solvency II framework that apply to the individual EU insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply, with necessary modifications, at group level. The core focus of EU insurance supervision is, however, on the supervision of individual EU insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\n## Pillar 1\n\nSolvency II requires EU insurance and reinsurance companies to determine technical provisions at a value that corresponds with the present exit value of their insurance and reinsurance obligations towards policyholders and other beneficiaries of insurance and reinsurance contracts. The calculation of the technical provisions should be based on market consistent information to the extent to which that information is available.\n\nThe value of the technical provisions is equal to the sum of a best estimate and a risk margin. The discount rate at which technical provisions are calculated is an important element in order to determine the technical provisions. This and other parameters to determine the technical provisions may have an important effect on the amount and volatility of the own funds that insurance and reinsurance undertakings are required to maintain. The Solvency II framework contains several measures (in particular the volatility adjustment and matching adjustment) that should reduce volatility of the own funds (the excess of assets over liabilities).\n\nInsurers and reinsurers are required to hold eligible own funds in addition to the assets held to cover the technical provisions in order to ensure that they are able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months with a probability of at least 99.5% (insurance or reinsurance company's balance sheet ability to withstand a 1-in-200-year event). The buffer that insurance and reinsurance companies are required to hold is the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). Insurance and reinsurance companies are allowed to: (a) use a standard formula to calculate their SCR (the rules for which are set out in detail in the Solvency II rules and guidelines); (b) use an internal model (for which the approval of the supervisory authorities is required); or (c) use a partial internal model (PIM) (which is a combination of the standard formula and an internal model, and requires approval of the supervisory authorities). An internal model is developed by the insurance or reinsurance company in question, and should better reflect the actual risk profile of the insurance or reinsurance company than the standard formula. Aegon (as a group) uses a PIM.\n\nIn addition to the SCR, insurance and reinsurance companies should also calculate a Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR). This represents a lower level of financial security than the SCR, below which the level of eligible own funds held by the insurance or reinsurance company is not allowed to drop. An irreparable breach of the MCR would lead to the withdrawal of an insurance or reinsurance company's license. Insurance and reinsurance companies are required to hold eligible own funds against the SCR and MCR. Own funds capital is divided into three tiers in accordance with the quality of the own funds. The lower tiers of own funds (tiers 2 and 3) represent a limited part of the eligible own funds, as excess lower tier capital",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nis disregarded for purposes of calculating SCR. Furthermore, the SCR may consist of limited amounts of off-balance sheet own funds ('ancillary own funds' such as letters of credit or guarantees). The MCR must be covered entirely by tier 1 and tier 2 on-balance sheet items ('basic own funds').\n\nFor the US insurance entities, Authorized Control Level RBC authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take actions necessary to place the company under regulatory control (i.e., rehabilitation or liquidation). Aegon considers the Authorized Control Level RBC to be a level similar to the Solvency II MCR.\n\nCompany Action Level RBC requires the company to prepare and submit an RBC Plan to the commissioner of the state of domicile. Aegon considers the Company Action Level RBC to be similar to the Solvency II SCR. At 100% Solvency SCR, insurance regulators in the European Union will require management to submit a regulatory recovery plan.\n\n## Pillar 2\n\nUnder Pillar 2, insurance and reinsurance companies are required to set up and maintain an adequate and effective system of governance, which includes an appropriate internal organization (such as policies and procedures), a risk governance system and an effective assessment of the risk and solvency position of the Company (including a prospective assessment of risks), through the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) process. In general, Solvency II requires insurance and reinsurance companies to maintain an effective system of governance that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the insurance or reinsurance company. A number of risks that insurance or reinsurance companies face can only be addressed through proper governance structures, rather than quantitative requirements. Management of the insurance or reinsurance company is ultimately responsible for the maintenance of an effective governance system.\n\nInsurance and reinsurance companies are required to have an adequate and transparent organizational structure, with a clear allocation and appropriate segregation of responsibilities. The system of governance should be subject to regular internal review. Solvency II requires insurance and reinsurance companies to have written policies in a number of areas (such as risk management, internal control, internal audit and outsourcing (where appropriate)). A number of key functions are required to be part of the system of governance (compliance, risk management, the actuarial function and internal audit).\n\nThe persons responsible for these functions are required to be fit and proper. The Pillar 2 requirements include specific requirements relating to the risk management system. This should cover at least the following areas: underwriting and reserving, asset-liability matching, investments (in particular derivatives and similar commitments), liquidity and concentration risk management, operational risk management, deferred taxes, reinsurance and other risk mitigating techniques. Risk management relating to Solvency II is discussed in further detail\n\nin the section Risk management on page 111. As part of the risk management system, insurance and reinsurance undertakings are required to undertake an ORSA, which includes the overall solvency needs of the undertaking, taking into account the risk profile, risk tolerance limits and business strategy, the ongoing compliance with Solvency II capital requirements and rules regarding technical provisions, and the extent to which the risk profile of the undertaking deviates from the assumptions underlying the calculation of the SCR. Solvency II Pillar/uni00A02 requirements also include detailed requirements with respect to outsourcing, including intra group outsourcing. The Supervisory Review Process (SRP), which is part of Pillar 2, allows supervisory authorities to supervise the ongoing compliance of insurance and reinsurance undertakings with Solvency II requirements. Possible enforcement measures include: the imposition of capital add-ons (for instance in the event that the risk profile of the undertaking deviates from the SCR calculation or if there are weaknesses in the system of governance); the requirement to submit and execute a recovery plan (in the event of a (potential) breach of the SCR or a short term financing plan (in the event of a (threatening) breach of the MCR); and ultimately, the revocation of an insurance or reinsurance license (a measure that relates to EU-licensed insurance or reinsurance undertakings, and not to the Group as a whole, which does not have a license).\n\n## Pillar 3\n\nSolvency II included detailed reporting and disclosure requirements. These requirements include non-public supervisory reporting on a regular (usually tri-annual) basis through regular supervisory reports (RSR), complemented by detailed quantitative reporting templates (QRTs) reported on a quarterly basis, which contain detailed financial data.\n\nIn addition, it is a requirement to publish a Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) on an annual basis.\n\n## Group supervision\n\nSolvency II not only imposes regulatory requirements on individual EU insurance and reinsurance undertakings; many of the requirements that apply to the individual insurance and reinsurance undertakings apply, with the necessary modifications, at group level. These requirements include group solvency requirements, group reporting and disclosure requirements, and requirements regarding the system of governance, risk management and internal control framework at group level. The/uni00A0group requirements do not include an MCR. Solvency II does however require groups to maintain eligible own funds, at least equal to a floor, as further defined in the Solvency II rules (the absolute floor of the group solvency capital requirement), which can be considered to be the MCR at group level. Although entities that are not subject to solo supervision under Solvency II (such as entities in other financial sectors, non-financial entities, and regulated and non-regulated entities in third countries) are not directly subject to Solvency II requirements, these entities may be affected indirectly by the Solvency II group requirements. Entities in other financial sectors are, in most cases, taken into account in",

Under the Accounting Consolidation method the group is essentially treated as one economic unit whereas the Deduction and Aggregation method requires the group to aggregate entities, rather than fully consolidate entities for the purpose of the group capital requirements.\n\nHowever, subject to certain conditions, entities in other financial sectors may be included in accordance with the accounting consolidation method. In particular, this may be the case when the group supervisor is satisfied as to the level of integrated management and internal control regarding these entities. Furthermore, DNB may require groups to deduct any participation from the own funds eligible for the Group Solvency ratio. As of 2020, as required by DNB, Aegon includes its participation in Aegon Bank N.V. in the Group Solvency ratio, pursuant to new guidance, issued by DNB during 2020, using Basel III requirements (as implemented in Europe) in the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and EU Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), that Aegon Bank N.V. is subject to. The prudential requirements (including CRD IV and CRR) are described in more detail on page 368.\n\nAs referred to in the 'Capital and liquidity management' section, Aegon uses a combination of the two aggregation methods defined within the Solvency II framework to calculate the Group Solvency ratio, the Accounting Consolidation method and the Deduction and Aggregation method. Aegon applies the Accounting Consolidation method as the default method.\n\nHowever, for insurance entities domiciled outside the EEA for which provisional or full equivalence applies, such as the United States, Aegon uses the Deduction and Aggregation method, with local regulatory requirements to translate these into the Group Solvency position. US insurance and reinsurance entities are included in Aegon's group solvency calculation in accordance with local US Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. Until June 30, 2017, Aegon used 250% of the local Company Action Level (CAL) RBC as the SCR equivalent. Aegon received approval from DNB to apply a revised methodology, as of July 1, 2017, that includes lowering the conversion factor from 250% to 150% RBC, and reducing the contribution to own funds by 100% of the local Company Action Level RBC requirement to reflect transferability restrictions. This methodology is subject to annual review, and the change enhances comparability with European\n\npeers. The RBC and CAL, as well as the allocation of restricted Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments between the accounting consolidation and deduction and aggregation part of the Group are described in more detail in the 'Capital and Liquidity' section of this Annual Report.\n\nAbsent any regulatory guidance to the contrary, Aegon's UK insurance subsidiaries will continue to be included in the Group/uni00A0Solvency II calculation in accordance with Solvency II standards, including Aegon's approved Partial Internal Model. Aegon will monitor the developments regarding a potential equivalence decision by the European Commission relating to/uni00A0the/uni00A0United Kingdom as well as the developments in the UK/uni00A0insurance regulatory system.\n\nSolvency II group supervision is exercised by a combination of the supervisory authorities of the local insurance and reinsurance entities and the group supervisor. An important role in the cooperation between the supervisory authorities in the context of group supervision is played by the college of supervisors, in which the local and group supervisors are represented. This college is chaired by the group supervisor.\n\n## Recent developments Solvency II Solvency II 2020 review\n\nIn December 2020 EIOPA issued its final opinion in respect of the technical advice requested by the European Commission in the context of the Solvency II 2020 review. In line with the draft technical advice and the questions raised by the European Commission, the opinion covers, among others, the/uni00A0following areas:\n\n- \u25a0 Long-term guarantee/uni00A0(LTG) measures and measures to better reflect equity risk;\n- \u25a0 Specific methods, assumptions and standard parameters used when calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement under the standard formula;\n- \u25a0 Technical provisions (including changes to the calculation of the risk margin),\n- \u25a0 Own funds;\n- \u25a0 Calculation of the Minimum Capital Requirement;\n- \u25a0 Reporting and disclosure\n- \u25a0 Proportionality;\n- \u25a0 Group supervision;\n- \u25a0 Freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment (on a cross-border basis and through branch offices);\n- \u25a0 Macro-prudential policy;\n- \u25a0 Recovery and resolution;\n- \u25a0 Insurance guarantee schemes, and\n- \u25a0 Other items related to the supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\nThe next step is for the European Commission to develop a legislative proposal that is currently expected to be published in the beginning of the 4 th quarter of 2021. While the EIOPA Opinion is important input for the European Commission, it will develop its own opinion which elements of the EIOPA",

Subsequently, the co-legislators at European level will assess the proposal in order to arrive at final text, resulting in amendments to the Solvency II Directive and Solvency II Delegated Regulation.\n\n## DNB guidance issued during 2020\n\nDuring 2020, DNB changed its earlier guidance with respect to the treatment of credit institutions in the calculation of group solvency in accordance with Solvency II requirements. As of the 4 th quarter of 2020, Aegon is required to include Aegon Bank into group solvency in accordance with Solvency II rules (using CRD IV/CRR capital requirements).\n\nDuring 2020 DNB amended its guidance with respect to the modeling of deferred taxes (and to the Loss Absorbing Capacity of Deferred Taxes or \"LAC DT\" - in particular) for the solvency capital calculation pursuant to Solvency II. This was following amendments to the Solvency II Delegated regulation, published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 18, 2019, referred to as the Solvency II 2018 review.\n\n## Sustainability and Solvency II\n\nIn March 2018, the European Commission adopted its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance. This action plan is part of broader efforts to connect finance with the European and global economy for the benefit of the planet and wider society. Specifically, the Action Plan aims to: (1) reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, (2) manage financial risks stemming from climate change, resource depletion, environmental degradation and social issues; and (3) foster transparency and long-termism in financial and economic activity.\n\nAs part of the Action Plan, EIOPA has provided the European Commission in April 2019 with technical advice on the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the delegated acts under Solvency II and the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD). This advice focused primarily on qualitative requirements in Solvency II and the IDD. The Solvency II advice includes recommendations on the integration of sustainability risks in risk management, including in the calculation of the overall solvency needs in the context of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and in the application of the prudent person principle, applicable to the investment of insurers' assets. In the context of the IDD, the advice focused on the integration of policyholder preferences with respect to sustainability when acquiring insurance products. In addition, the European Commission requested EIOPA's views on the integration of sustainability, in particular climaterelated developments, into the Solvency II framework focusing on quantitative requirements. EIOPA provided its opinion in September 2019, which the European Commission is expected to take into account in the Solvency II 2020 review. A formal legislative proposal by the European Commission in the context of the Solvency II 2020 review is currently expected to be released in the second half of 2021.\n\nFurthermore, in November 2019, DNB published its expectations for the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) with respect to sustainability. In November 2020 EIOPA has published a consultation on the use of climate change risk scenarios in the ORSA in the form of a draft supervisory opinion. According to EIOPA, supervisors such as DNB should expect insurers, in the ORSA, to subject material climate change risks to at least two long-term climate scenarios. The final EIOPA opinion is expected to be published in the spring of 2021./uni00A0\n\n## Financial conglomerate supervision\n\nSince October 2009, Aegon has been subject to supplemental group supervision by DNB in accordance with the requirements of the EU's Financial Conglomerate Directive. Supplemental group supervision pursuant to the Financial Conglomerate Directive includes supplementary capital adequacy requirements for financial conglomerates and supplementary supervision on risk concentrations and intra-group transactions in the financial conglomerate. Due to the introduction of the Solvency II group supervisory requirements - which include similar, and to a large extent overlapping, requirements to those covered by Financial Conglomerates Directive - supplemental group supervision pursuant to the Financial Conglomerates Directive has become significantly less relevant.\n\n## Recovery and resolution and systemic risk G-SII designation\n\nOn November 3, 2015, Aegon was designated by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII), based on an assessment methodology developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Up until 2019, the FSB reviewed the G-SII designation annually. However, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, decided not to publish a new list of G-SIIs for 2017 or 2018. In November 2019, in recognition of the fact that the Holistic Framework (see below) provides an enhanced approach to assessing and mitigating systemic risk in the global insurance sector, the FSB decided to suspend the identification of global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs). In November 2022, the FSB will, based on the initial years of experience with the application of the Holistic Framework, review the need to either discontinue or re-establish an annual identification of G-SIIs.\n\nDue to its G-SII status, Aegon was subject to an additional layer of direct supervision at the group level. In accordance with these requirements, Aegon submitted a liquidity risk management plan, a systemic risk management plan, and an ex ante recovery plan to DNB and to the crisis management group (CMG) that was established. In spite of the suspension of the identification of G-SIIs, these requirements, which are included in the holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector, continue in practice. Aegon continues to update these plans on an annual basis. In addition, the Aegon Group's Resolution Authority (the Dutch Central Bank) is responsible for the development of Aegon's resolution plan.",

Some of the provisions of the Holistic Framework are included in the IAIS Insurance Core Principles (that apply to all insurers), while others are included in ComFrame (the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or IAIGs).\n\nThe Holistic Framework consists of an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures and powers of intervention, an annual IAIS global monitoring exercise which includes a collective discussion of the outcomes and associated supervisory responses, and an assessment of consistent implementation of supervisory measures. ComFrame establishes supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the effective groupwide supervision of IAIGs. ComFrame is a comprehensive and outcome-focused framework that provides supervisory minimum requirements tailored to the international activities and sizes of IAIGs. ComFrame builds on the Insurance Core Principles that are applicable to the supervision of all insurers. The provisions of both ComFrame and the Insurance Core Principles must be implemented in local legislation in order to have a binding effect.\n\nIf the FSB were to discontinue the annual identification of G-SIIs after the review of the Holistic Framework in November 2022 or, alternatively, Aegon would not be identified as a G-SII, Aegon would still be subject to ComFrame and ICS, to the extent these would be implemented in local legislation.\n\n## Recovery and resolution Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers\n\nOn January 1, 2019, the Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers (R&R Act) came into force in the Netherlands, replacing the previously applicable intervention regime for insurance companies in the Netherlands faced with financial difficulties. The R&R Act has introduced a revised regulatory framework for recovery and resolution of Dutch insurance and reinsurance companies, and provides for a range of measures to be taken by these companies and the Dutch Central Bank, in order for these insurance and reinsurance companies to be prepared for recovery in circumstances where it no longer meets the required solvency requirements and for orderly resolution, in circumstances where it is failing or is likely to fail. The R&R Act introduces a requirement for Dutch insurance companies and reinsurance companies, such as the Dutch insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries in the Aegon Group, to draw up and maintain an ex ante recovery plan, that should allow these entities, when faced with financial problems, to take measures to recover their solvency ratio and continue to operate in going concern. In addition, the Dutch Central Bank, in its capacity as national resolution authority in gone concern circumstances (as opposed to its role as supervisory authority in going concern) is required to draw up and maintain a resolution plan, which should provide for the orderly resolution of the Dutch insurance and reinsurance entities in the group, or the group, to avoid unnecessary damage\n\nto policyholders and beneficiaries and to provide an alternative to ordinary bankruptcy proceedings. The R&R Act allows DNB to require a Dutch insurance or reinsurance company or a group in certain circumstances, to remove, ex ante, impediments to effective resolution of a Dutch insurance or reinsurance undertaking, such as the revision of financing arrangements, the reduction of exposures, the transfer of assets, the termination or limitation of business activities, the prohibition of starting certain new business activities, changes to the legal or operational structure of the group, or the securing certain critical business lines.\n\nThe R&R Act allows DNB to intervene in situations where a Dutch insurer or reinsurer, where it is failing or is likely to fail, as defined in the R&R Act. The powers under the R&R Act may also extend to the level of the group and to entities, other than in insurance or reinsurance entities in the Netherlands, that are part of the group, such as Aegon N.V.. The powers include the transfer of the undertaking to a third party, the transfer to a bridge institution and the transfer of certain specific assets and/ or liabilities. In addition, a bail-in tool is introduced, that allows for the write-off or conversion of rights of creditors, including policyholders and beneficiaries, while respecting the principle that they should not be worse off through resolution, including the application of the bail-in tool, than they would in ordinary insolvency proceedings.\n\nAs a result of the recent adoption of the IAIS Holistic Framework, the developments with respect to the identification of G-SIIs by the FSB and the introduction of the Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution of Insurers, Aegon will continue to update its ex ante group recovery plan (pursuant to the Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution of Insurers) and the liquidity risk management plan (which is not required under the Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution of Insurers but is expected under the Holistic Framework). Similarly, the CMG, established as part of the G-SII requirements, will remain in place. In addition, the Aegon Group's Resolution Authority (the Dutch Central Bank) remains responsible for the development of Aegon's resolution plan, pursuant to the Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution of Insurers and as expected for IAIGs under the Holistic Framework. As part of the Solvency II 2020 review, it is likely that the European Commission will propose to introduce a recovery and resolution regime at European level, based on minimum harmonization, which means that local regimes should meet minimum standards, set at European level.\n\n## Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive\n\nFurthermore, to parts of the Aegon Group, in particular Aegon Bank N.V., the framework of the EU Directive on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investments firms (the \"Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive\") is applicable. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive also contains provisions that, in certain specific circumstances, where both Aegon Bank N.V. and Aegon N.V. fail or are likely to fail, could be applied to mixed financial holding companies such as Aegon N.V., including the right of bail-in of creditors.",

The intervention measures available to the Minister of Finance, include in particular the right to expropriate assets of the financial institution, as well as securities and/or other financial instruments issued by or with the cooperation of the financial institution. The exercise of this power may significantly impact the rights of the owners or holders of these assets, securities and/or financial instruments.\n\n## Insurance Capital Standards\n\nThe IAIS is developing a risk based global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS). The ICS is designed to be appropriate for IAIGs, covered by ComFrame. IAIS standards are not self-executing and must be adopted by local jurisdictions to be formally applicable.\n\nThe IAIS' ultimate goal, by a date yet to be determined, is a single ICS (referred to by the IAIS as group-wide prescribed capital requirement (PCR)) and that includes a common methodology by which one ICS achieves comparable (i.e. substantially the same) outcomes across jurisdictions. Ongoing work is intended to lead to improved convergence over time on the key elements of the ICS towards the ultimate goal. According to the IAIS, not prejudging the substance, the key elements include valuation, capital resources and capital requirements. In November 2019, the IAIS adopted ICS Version 2.0, which is being used during a five-year monitoring period for confidential reporting to groupwide supervisors and discussion in supervisory colleges.\n\nThe ICS will not be used as a group-wide Prescribed Capital Requirement (PCR) during the monitoring period. The purpose of the five-year monitoring period is to monitor the performance of the ICS over a period of time, and not the capital adequacy of IAIGs. Therefore, ICS results will not be used as a basis to trigger supervisory action and IAIGs are not expected to manage their business to the ICS. During the monitoring period, results based on ICS version 2.0, should we voluntarily decide to prepare these, would be privately disclosed to our group supervisor, reported to the IAIS, and discussed by supervisors at Aegon's supervisory college. From 2025 onwards, it is envisaged that local jurisdictions will formally enact the ICS, which is described as a minimum standard.\n\nIn previous years, Aegon has participated in the ICS field testing to understand the potential consequences for Aegon of the ICS, both from capital and operational perspectives.\n\n## IBOR transition\n\nThe future of IBORs (Interbank Offered Rates) such as Euribor and LIBOR has been a major topic on the global agenda since the G20 asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to undertake a fundamental review of leading interest rate benchmarks in 2013. The FSB proposed new standards to reform interest rate benchmarks and the use of transaction-based input data instead of non-transactional/panel input data. In the EU, this is adopted in the new Benchmark Regulation (BMR), which stipulates that from January 2020 only BMR-compliant benchmarks may be used within the EU.\n\nAegon recognizes that IBOR transitions potentially have implications for all reporting units, including our insurance, asset management and banking activities. Despite ongoing uncertainties on how the transition from IBORs to alternative benchmarks will be managed, it is widely acknowledged that IBOR benchmarks impact financial products and contracts, including among others, derivatives, corporate bonds, structured debt products, deposits, and mortgages.\n\nThe impact of the IBOR transition on the business and operating models is described in transition plans and include among others project solutions and actions, timelines, and ownership to ensure timely preparation and implementation. Aegon is well underway with the implementation of the actions as described in the transition plans. In July 2020, the discount rates used for EUR-denominated cleared derivatives were switched from EONIA to \u20acSTR. In the US, the cleared market has switched discount rates from Fed Funds to SOFR in October 2020.\n\n## Geopolitical environment\n\nJust before the Brexit transition period ended after 31 December 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed on a new 'Trade and Cooperation Agreement' outlining their post-Brexit relationship. Overall, the agreement does not make provisions for financial services firms in the UK to access the single market of the European Union and contains few provisions specific to financial services. Nevertheless, the main risks for Aegon have been mitigated and a Memorandum of Understanding between the European Union and the United Kingdom is pending (expected by the end of the first quarter of 2021) which should provide further clarity on equivalence. Over the past years, Aegon has implemented various actions to reduce the potential effects of a cliff-edge scenario (e.g., for derivatives & clearing, cross-border policies and data transfer) and although there is still some residual risk, there is no major impact on the organization at the moment. Preparations have been made for the known events that may occur, however, there is an awareness that Brexit might still result in unforeseen events that could have impact even after the transition deal has ended. Hence, the developments are being monitored closely.",

In line with its risk tolerance, the goal of Aegon's capital and liquidity management is to promote strong and stable capital adequacy levels for its businesses, in addition to maintaining adequate liquidity to ensure that the Company is able to meet its obligations.\n\nAegon follows a number of guiding principles in terms of capital and liquidity management:\n\n- \u25a0 Promoting strong capital adequacy in Aegon's businesses and operating units;\n- \u25a0 Managing and allocating capital efficiently in support of the strategy and in line with its risk tolerance;\n- \u25a0 Maintaining an efficient capital structure, with an emphasis on optimizing Aegon's cost of capital;\n- \u25a0 Maintaining adequate liquidity in both the operating units and the Holding to ensure that the Company is able to meet its obligations by enforcing stringent liquidity risk policies; and\n- \u25a0 Maintaining continued access to international capital markets on competitive terms.\n\nAegon believes that the combination of these guiding principles strengthens the Company's ability to withstand adverse market conditions, enhances its financial flexibility, and serves both the short-term and the long-term interests of the Company, its customers and other stakeholders.\n\nThe management and monitoring of capital and liquidity is firmly embedded in Aegon's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, and is in line with Aegon's risk tolerance. Aegon's risk tolerance focuses on capital generation, solvency and liquidity, risk balance and responsible business with effective controls. Its core aim is to assist management in carrying out Aegon's strategy within the Group's capital and liquidity resources.\n\n## Management of capital\n\nIn 2020, Aegon updated its Capital Management Policy for the Group to simplify the policy while maintaining strong\n\ncapital positions at the Group and in the units. Aegon's capital management framework is based on adequate capitalization of its operating units, Cash Capital at Holding and leverage.\n\n## Capital adequacy of Aegon's operating units\n\nAegon manages capital in operating units at levels sufficient to absorb moderate shocks without impacting the remittances to the Group. These moderate shocks could be caused by various factors, including general economic conditions, capital markets risks, underwriting risk factors, changes in government regulations, legal and arbitration proceedings. To mitigate the impact of such factors on the ability of operating units to transfer funds, Aegon establishes an operating level of capital in each of the units: 150% SCR for Solvency II units and 400% Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Company Action Level (CAL) in the US, which includes additional capital in excess of regulatory capital requirements. Aegon manages capital in the units to this operating level over-the-cycle.\n\nAfter investments have been made in new business to generate organic growth, capital generated by Aegon's operating units is available for distribution to the holding company. In addition to an operating level, Aegon establishes a minimum dividend payment level of capital in each of the units: 135% SCR for Solvency II and 350% RBC CAL in the US. As long as the capital position of the unit is above this minimum dividend payment level, the unit is expected to pay remittances to the Group.\n\nWhen the operating unit's capital position approaches the minimum dividend payment level, capital management tools are used to ensure that units will remain well capitalized. The frequent monitoring of actual and forecasted capitalization levels of its operating units is an important element in Aegon's capital framework in order to actively steer and manage towards maintaining adequate capitalization levels.\n\nThe regulatory capital requirement, minimum dividend payment level, operating level and actual capitalization for Aegon's main operating units at December 31, 2020, are included in the following table:\n\n| Capital requirements                             | Regulatory capital  requirement   | Minimum dividend  payment level   | Operating  level   | Actual  capitalization   | Excess over  regulatory capital  requirement   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| United States (RBC ratio)                        | 100% RBC CAL                      | 350%                              | 400%               | 432% RBC CAL             | EUR 5.9 bln                                    |\n| Aegon Levensverzekering N.V.

State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) have adopted RBC requirements for insurance companies. RBC calculations measure the ratio of a/uni00A0company's statutory capital, which is measured on a prudent regulatory accounting basis, to a minimum capital amount determined by the risk-based capital formula. The RBC formula measures exposures to investment risk, insurance risk, market risk, and general business risk. The formula, as used for calculating the solvency ratio, applies a covariance diversification offset to determine the appropriate Risk-Based Capital. Life/uni00A0reinsurance is treated as life insurance. The most pertinent RBC measure is the CAL risk-based capital requirement. This is the regulatory intervention level below which a company must submit a remediation plan to its state regulators. The domiciliary state regulator has the authority to require additional capital depending on the type, volume and nature of the business being conducted. The domiciliary state regulator also has the ability to require corrective actions if a company is deemed by the commissioner to pose a Hazardous Financial Condition. The CAL is set at 200% of the Authorized Control Level (ACL), the level at which regulators are permitted to seize control of a company.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the combined risk-based capital ratio of Aegon's life insurance subsidiaries in the United States was estimated to be 432% (2019: 470%) of the CAL risk-based capital requirement. The decrease was mainly due to negative market impacts driven by the decline of interest rates and adverse mortality experience impacted by the COVID-19. This was partly offset by the positive impact of earnings from existing business in excess of new business strain and various one-time items, including a refinement of the application of the new variable annuity framework, various mergers and restructuring of reinsurance captives and the sale of the Transamerica Pyramid property.\n\nUnder the Solvency II requirements, the activities of Aegon Americas life insurance and reinsurance companies have been consolidated into the Aegon Group Solvency II figures through the Deduction & Aggregation method using available and required capital as per the RBC regime. Aegon uses 150% of the local RBC CAL as the Solvency II SCR equivalent for including the US life insurance and reinsurance entities into the Group solvency calculation, and in addition, reducing Own Funds by an amount equal to 100% RBC Company Action Level requirement to reflect transferability restrictions. The US conversion methodology is subject to periodic review and approval by the DNB. The nonregulated US entities and the US holding companies are included in the Aegon Group Solvency II results through application of the Accounting Consolidation method under Solvency II, using Solvency II valuation and capital requirement for these entities.\n\n## Aegon Levensverzekering N.V. (NL Life)\n\nAegon Levensverzekering N.V. uses a Partial Internal Model (PIM) to calculate the solvency position under Solvency II. The calculation includes the use of the volatility adjustment (VA), but does not include the use of any transitional measures. The initial internal model of NL Life was approved on November 26, 2015, by the supervisor, the DNB, as part of the Internal Model Application Process. The Solvency II position of NL Life, on December 31, 2020, is estimated to be 159% (2019: 164%). The decrease was mainly driven by widening of mortgage spreads and the negative impact from a decrease in the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes (LAC-DT). NL Life decided to lower the LAC-DT from 65% to 45% to reduce the sensitivity of this factor to economic variances. Increased investments in corporate credits and remittances paid to Group also lowered the Solvency II ratio. This decrease was partly offset by the normalized capital generation on in-force business, favorable impact from assumption changes, and the impact from a change in the internal model to reduce the sensitivity of the solvency ratio to credit spread movements.\n\n## Scottish Equitable Plc (SE Plc)\n\nScottish Equitable Plc (SE Plc) uses a Partial Internal Model (PIM) to calculate the solvency position under Solvency II. The calculation includes the use of both the matching adjustment (for annuities) and the volatility adjustment (for the with-profits fund)./uni00A0The initial internal model of Aegon UK was approved on December 14, 2015 by the insurance supervisor PRA as part of the Internal Model Application Process. The Solvency II position of SE Plc on December 31, 2020, is estimated to be 156% (2019: 148%). The increase was primarily driven by a favorable impact from the update of the expense assumptions, reflecting the cost reduction initiatives. The normalized capital generation had a further positive impact. This was partly offset by negative market impacts, mainly driven by lower interest rates.\n\nSince January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union. Absent any regulatory guidance to the contrary, Aegon's UK insurance subsidiaries will continue to be included in the Group Solvency II calculation in accordance with Solvency II standards, including Aegon's approved Partial Internal Model. For/uni00A0more details, reference is made to the section/uni00A0'Regulation and Supervision'.\n\n## Improving risk-return profile\n\nAegon continues to take measures to improve its risk-return profile. In 2020, several actions were taken to strengthen the capital position and reduce the volatility of the local capital positions.\n\nThe Dutch life business implemented internal model changes and invested more in corporate bonds to mitigate volatility caused by the basis risk between the EIOPA VA reference portfolio and its own asset portfolio. Furthermore, it was decided to lower the factor applied when calculating the loss-absorbing",

Examples of these programs include hedging the interest rate and equity risk stemming from guarantees in the Netherlands, hedging the interest rate risk and equity risk in Aegon UK, and hedging the capital position in the Americas against adverse equity and interest rate movements. In 2020 Aegon initiated a program to materially reduce linear interest rate risk in the US. 25% of this plan had been executed by the end of 2020, primarily by lengthening the duration of its asset portfolio. Aegon has an active global reinsurance program in order to optimize the risk-return profile of other insurance risks. In addition, Aegon monitors the risk-return profile of new business written, withdrawing products that do not meet the required hurdle rates for all stakeholders including policyholders and shareholders.\n\nAegon is considering taking further actions to improve its riskreturn profile by potentially further hedging the legacy variable annuities block in the US, which will allow us to more actively consider a broad range of options for this block of business.\n\nFurthermore, Aegon announced the sale of the insurance, pension and asset management business in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Turkey to Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG) and the sale of Stonebridge, a UK-based provider of accident insurance products, both of which were not considered core to Aegon's strategy.\n\n## Cash Capital at Holding and liquidity management\n\nLiquidity management is a fundamental building block of Aegon's overall financial planning and capital allocation processes. Liquidity is coordinated centrally at Aegon N.V., through Cash Capital at Holding, and managed both centrally and at the operating unit level.\n\nThe ability of the holding company to meet its cash obligations depends on the amount of liquid assets on its balance sheet and on the ability of the operating units to pay remittances to the holding company. In order to ensure the holding company's ability to fulfil its cash obligations, to maintain sufficient flexibility to provide capital and liquidity support to Aegon's operating units, and to provide stability in external dividends, the Company manages Cash Capital at Holding, including Aegon's centrally managed (unregulated) holding companies, to an operating range of EUR 0.5 to EUR 1.5 billion.\n\nThe main sources of liquidity in Cash Capital at Holding are remittances from operating units and divestitures. In addition, contingent internal and external liquidity programs are maintained to provide additional safeguards against extreme unexpected liquidity stresses.\n\nAegon uses these cash flows from its operating units to pay for holding expenses, including funding costs. The remaining free cash flow is available to execute the Company's strategy to strengthen the balance sheet through deleveraging, to make capital injections into units as required, to fund dividends on its shares, and to return capital to shareholders if possible, all subject to maintaining targeted Cash Capital at Holding. Aegon aims to pay out a sustainable dividend to enable equity investors to share in its performance.\n\nWhen determining whether to declare or propose a dividend, Aegon's Executive Board balances prudence with offering an attractive return to shareholders. This is particularly important during adverse economic and/or financial market conditions. Furthermore, Aegon's operating units are subject to local insurance regulations that could restrict remittances to be paid to the holding company. There is no requirement or assurance that Aegon will declare and pay any dividends.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, Aegon held a balance of EUR 1.1 billion in Cash Capital at Holding, compared to EUR 1.2 billion on December 31, 2019. The decrease of EUR 50 million reflects the net impact of remittances from operating units and capital injections in operating units, divestitures, earn-out payments and the redemption of senior unsecured notes, holding expenses and capital returns to shareholders. During 2020 Aegon redeemed the maturing USD 500 million senior notes with a coupon of 5.75% issued in 2005.\n\nProceeds from the sale of Aegon joint ventures in Japan of EUR 153 million were received in 2020 as well as remittances from Aegon Americas (EUR 465 million) and Aegon Netherlands (EUR 175 million). Remittances from other operating units were more than offset by capital injections and investments, amounting to a net outflow of EUR 13 million. These capital injections mainly related to the expansion of Aegon's life and non-life insurance partnership with Banco Santander following its acquisition of Banco Popular.\n\nDuring 2020, payments related to 2020 interim dividend and the corresponding share buybacks amounted to EUR 122 million and holding and funding expenses amounted to EUR 297 million.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nThe Company's liquidity risk policy sets guidelines for its operating companies and the holding in order to achieve a prudent liquidity profile and to meet cash demands under extreme conditions. Aegon's liquidity is invested in accordance with the Company's internal risk management policies. Aegon believes that its working capital, backed by its external funding programs and facilities, is ample for the Company's present requirements.\n\nAegon maintains a liquidity policy that requires all business units to project and assess their sources and uses of liquidity over a two-year period under normal and severe business and",

This policy ensures that liquidity is measured and managed consistently across the Company, and that liquidity stress management plans are in place.\n\nAegon's operating units are primarily engaged in the life insurance and pensions business, which is a long-term activity with relatively illiquid liabilities and generally matching assets. Liquidity consists of liquid assets held in investment portfolios, in addition to inflows generated by premium payments and customer deposits.\n\n## Leverage\n\nAegon uses leverage in order to lower the cost of capital that supports businesses in the Aegon Group, thereby contributing to a more effective and efficient use of capital. In managing the use leverage throughout the Group, Aegon has implemented a Leverage Use Framework that is part of Aegon's broader Enterprise Risk Management framework.\n\n## Financial leverage\n\nIn 2020, Aegon reduced its gross financial leverage by USD 500 million to EUR 6.0 billion through the redemption of a senior note in December 2020 and aims to reduce its gross financial leverage from the current level to the range of EUR 5.0 - 5.5 billion over the period of 2021 to 2023. This reduction of leverage will strengthen the balance sheet, reduce Aegon's risk profile and make Aegon more resilient.\n\nThe following are metrics that Aegon assesses in managing leverage:\n\n- \u25a0 Gross financial leverage ratio;\n- \u25a0 Fixed charge coverage;\n- \u25a0 Various rating agency leverage metrics; and\n- \u25a0 Other metrics, including gross financial leverage divided by normalized capital generation.\n\nAegon's gross financial leverage ratio is calculated by dividing total financial leverage by total capitalization. Aegon defines total financial leverage as debt or debt-like funding issued for general corporate purposes and for capitalizing Aegon's business units. Total financial leverage includes hybrid instruments, subordinated and senior debt. Aegon's total capitalization consists of the following components:\n\n- \u25a0 Shareholders' equity, excluding revaluation reserves and cash flow hedge reserves, based on IFRS as adopted by the EU;\n- \u25a0 Non-controlling interests and Long Term Incentive Plans not yet vested; and\n- \u25a0 Total financial leverage.\n\nAegon's fixed charge coverage is a measure of the Company's ability to service its financial leverage. It is calculated as the sum of underlying earnings before tax and interest expenses on financial leverage divided by interest payments on financial leverage. The fixed charge coverage includes the impact of interest rate hedging.\n\n## Operational leverage\n\nAlthough operational leverage is not considered part of Aegon's total capitalization, it is an important source of liquidity and funding. Operational leverage relates primarily to financing Aegon's mortgage portfolios through securitizations, warehouse facilities, covered bonds, and the/uni00A0use of a Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) facility.\n\nAegon enters into reinsurance agreements for risk and capital management purposes with several affiliated captive insurance companies (captives). All captives are fully consolidated for IFRS reporting and for Solvency II based on local valuations under equivalence.\n\nThe captives are utilized for a number of purposes that may include:\n\n- \u25a0 Financing term life insurance (subject to Regulation XXX reserves) and universal life insurance with secondary guarantees (subject to Regulation AXXX reserves) to support lower-risk statutory reserves at a lower cost for policyholders and shareholders;\n- \u25a0 Managing and segregating risks.\n\nIn 2020 Aegon's exposure to captives was significantly reduced to streamline and simplify Aegon's legal organization structure in the US and to strengthen the cash flow testing sufficiency through higher statutory reserves. Letters of Credit (LOCs) issued by third parties provided to captives to provide collateral to affiliated insurers are disclosed in note 45 'Commitments and contingencies' to the consolidated financial statements. These LOCs have been provided by third parties for the benefit of the affiliated company whose liabilities are reinsured. Existing captive structures are continually monitored and may be refinanced to achieve financial goals.\n\n## Funding and back-up facilities\n\nThe majority of Aegon's financial leverage is issued by Aegon/uni00A0N.V., the parent company. A limited number of other Aegon companies have also issued debt securities, but for the most part these securities are guaranteed by Aegon N.V.\n\nAegon N.V. has regular access to international capital markets under a USD 6 billion debt issuance program. Access to the capital market in the United States is made possible by a separate shelf registration.\n\nAegon also has access to domestic and international money markets through its EUR 2.5 billion commercial paper programs. As at December 31, 2020, Aegon had EUR 72 million outstanding under these programs (2019: EUR 58 million).\n\nTo support its commercial paper programs and need for LOCs, and to enhance its liquidity position, Aegon maintains backup credit and LOC facilities with international lenders. The/uni00A0Company's principal arrangements comprise a EUR 2 billion syndicated revolving credit facility and an LOC facility of USD 2.4 billion. The syndicated revolving credit facility",

In addition, Aegon also maintains various shorter-dated bilateral backup liquidity facilities in addition to committed and uncommitted LOC facilities.\n\n## Rating agency ratings\n\nAegon's objective is to maintain very strong financial strength ratings in its main operating units, and this plays an important role in determining the Company's overall capital management strategy. Aegon maintains strong financial strength ratings from\n\nseveral international rating agencies for its main operating units, and a strong credit rating for Aegon N.V..\n\nFollowing Aegon's request, Fitch Ratings withdrew its ratings of Aegon N.V., Aegon USA and Aegon UK on December 1, 2020. At that time Fitch Ratings also affirmed the ratings as A- for Aegon N.V.'s long-term issuer rating, BBB+ for Aegon N.V.'s senior debt rating, BBB- for Aegon N.V.'s subordinated debt rating, F2 for Aegon N.V.'s commercial paper rating, A+ for Aegon USA's financial strength rating and A+ for Aegon UK's financial strength rating.\n\n| December 31, 2020            | Aegon N.V.   | Aegon USA   | Aegon the  Netherlands   | Aegon UK   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| S&P Global 1)                |              |             |                          |            |\n| Financial strength           | -            | A+          | A+                       | A+         |\n| Long-term issuer             | A-           | -           | -                        | -          |\n| Senior debt                  | A-           | -           | -                        | -          |\n| Subordinated debt            | BBB          | -           | -                        | -          |\n| Commercial paper             | A-2          | -           | -                        | -          |\n| Moody's Investors Service 1) |              |             |                          |            |\n| Financial strength           | -            | A1          | -                        | -          |\n| Long-term issuer             | A3           | -           | -                        | -          |\n| Senior debt                  | A3           | -           | -                        | -          |\n| Subordinated debt            | Baa1         | -           | -                        | -          |\n| Commercial paper             | P-2          | -           | -                        | -          |\n| A.M.

In Aegon's Non-EEA (European Economic Area) regions, (re)insurance entities domiciled in third-countries deemed (provisionally) equivalent (US life insurance entities, Bermuda, and Brazil), the capital requirement is based on local capital requirements. For more information about recent developments on Solvency II, please refer to section 'Regulation and supervision'.\n\nTo calculate its Group Solvency Ratio, Aegon applies a combination of the Group consolidation methods available under Solvency II: the Accounting Consolidation (AC) and Deduction & Aggregation (D&A) based methods. Solvency\n\nII capital requirements are mainly used for the EEA-based insurance and reinsurance entities, applying the Accounting Consolidation method. Local requirements are used for insurance and reinsurance entities in (provisionally) equivalent third-country jurisdictions./uni00A0On July 11, 2020, DNB published industry-wide guidelines regarding the treatment of banks in Group Solvency II calculation. As a consequence, Aegon has included Aegon Bank in the calculation of its Group Solvency as per December 31, 2020. Before December 31, 2020 Aegon Bank was excluded from the Group Solvency II ratio. The 2019 year-end Solvency II ratio excluding Aegon Bank was 201%. If Aegon Bank were included, the 2019 comparative ratio would be 198%.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, Aegon's estimated capital position was:\n\n|                         | December 31, 2020  1)   | December 31, 2019 2)   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| Group Own Funds         | 18,582                  | 18,470                 |\n| Group SCR               | 9,473                   | 9,173                  |\n| Group Solvency II ratio | 196%                    | 201%                   |\n\n- 1 The Solvency II ratios are estimates, are not final until filed with the respective supervisory authority.\n- 2 For 2019, the Group Solvency II ratio excludes Aegon Bank.

The positive impact was partly offset by unfavorable market impacts triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, reflected by a sharp decrease in interest rates, compounded by negative credit variances partly caused by widening of mortgage spreads.\n\nAegon's Group Partial Internal Model (PIM) Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) amounted to EUR 9,473 million on December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 9,173 million 2 ). The SCR increased by EUR 300 million since December 31, 2019 and was mainly due to new business strain and the inclusion of Aegon Bank, which was partly offset by the release of in-force SCR.\n\nAs a result of the above changes in Own Funds and PIM SCR, the Group Solvency II ratio declined by 5%-points/uni00A0to 196%\n\nin 2020.

Under the new Variable Annuity framework which Aegon Americas adopted in 2019, sensitivities are mainly driven by the change in reserves, while required capital is fairly stable. In declining equity markets, Own Funds decrease due\n\n1\n\nto the need to set up higher reserves for the Variable Annuity product, partly offset by payoffs on equity hedge programs. Furthermore, declining equity markets result in a reduction to the assets backing employee pension plan liabilities and a decrease in the value of private equity and hedge fund investments. The decrease in the sensitivity to the equity up scenario since 2019 is due to an update to the macro hedge program which in the past protected the RBC ratio against extreme falls in equity markets. The new program is designed to provide payoffs in less severe down equity markets, while giving up some gains in up equity markets.\n\nThis 2019 published Group Own Funds excludes Aegon Bank. The 2019 Group Own Funds including Aegon Bank is EUR 19,207 million.\n\n- 2 This 2019 published Group SCR excludes Aegon Bank. The 2019 Group SCR including Aegon Bank is EUR 9,707 million.",

The asymmetry between up and down shocks is caused by the impact of guarantees and the associated hedges and the impact of the symmetric adjuster on the equity capital which has a prescribed flooring and capping on the shock./uni00A0\n\nFor SE Plc, under an equity down scenario, the reduction in Own Funds is partly offset by the reduction in SCR with the main exposures coming from the Staff Pension scheme and the unitized business. The asymmetry in the exposure is affected by the hedging and treatment of staff pension scheme surplus under IAS19.\n\n## Interest Rates Sensitivities\n\nThe Group has limited ratio sensitivity to interest rate movements driven by driven by hedging programs in place.\n\nIn Aegon Americas, a decrease in interest rates results in a need to set up higher reserves for Variable Annuity and Universal Life products, partly offset by payoffs from interest rate hedge programs. Own Funds decrease further from an increase in employee pension plan liabilities relative to the invested assets. The opposite occurs in rising interest rate scenarios. The decrease in the sensitivity to interest rates is the result of a refinement to the application of the new variable annuity framework and the various mergers that took place over the year.\n\nNL Life is over-hedged on a Solvency II Own Funds basis leading to Own Funds losses when rates go up and Own Funds gains when rates go down. This results in Aegon the Netherlands' solvency ratio being exposed to rising interest rate scenario.\n\nFor SE Plc, exposure to interest rate down scenarios is caused by higher required capital on mortality, expense and policyholder lapse risks which are partly offset by gains on the swaps held in the general account.\n\n## Spread Sensitivities\n\nIn order to simplify the interpretation of spread sensitivities, the knock-on effects of the EIOPA VA are not reflected in the spread sensitivities shown here. The non-government spread sensitivities include the shocks on mortgages, corporates bonds and structured instruments. With the approval of DNB, starting 4Q 2020, the spread sensitivities reflect the change to the internal model that was made to reduce the sensitivity of the Dutch life solvency ratio to credit spread movements. This impacts the sensitivities shown for non-government spreads, government spreads, mortgage spreads and EIOPA VA.\n\nThe Group is exposed to widening of spreads across nongovernment, government, and mortgage instruments due to lower asset valuation. For Aegon Americas, exposure to narrowing of spreads arises from a lower discount rate for valuing the employee pension plan liabilities. This is partly offset by the impact on Variable Annuities where narrowing credit\n\nspreads increase the value of separate account assets resulting in a release of reserves reflecting a lower cost of Variable Annuities guarantees./uni00A0\n\nExposure to government spread sensitivities is contributed by NL Life and SE Plc both of which are exposed to spreads widening due to the reduction in the value of their fixed income assets.\n\nGroup is exposed to mortgage spreads widening, due to exposure in NL Life, which has an adverse impact on the asset valuation. Aegon Americas credit defaults sensitivity reflects the combined impact of credit defaults and adverse credit rating migrations on assets held in the general account portfolio.\n\n## Longevity Sensitivities\n\nThe Group is exposed to higher longevity driven by Aegon Americas, NL Life, and SE Plc, due to the higher liability valuation since longevity is only partially hedged. Higher longevity also increases the SCR requirements held by these units. The increase in longevity scenario in Aegon Americas is driven by the need to set up additional reserves for the Long Term Care business under the scenario following the assumption updates during the year.\n\n## Capital quality\n\nCapital quality is a reflection of Aegon's stability and ability to absorb future financial losses.\n\nSolvency II distinguishes between basic Own Funds and ancillary Own Funds. Aegon's total Own Funds are comprised of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 basic Own Funds. Aegon does not currently have ancillary Own Funds. Tier 1 basic Own Funds are divided into unrestricted Tier 1 capital and restricted Tier 1 capital. The latter category contains Own Funds instruments subject to the restrictions of article 82 (3) of the Solvency II Delegated Regulation, which includes grandfathered Tier 1 Own Funds instruments. Based on agreements with its supervisory authorities, Aegon applies a fungibility and transferability restriction with respect to charitable trusts within Aegon Americas. These restrictions, applied to Aegon's basic Own Funds, result in Aegon's Available Own Funds./uni00A0Aegon used to have a restriction equal to the Own Funds of Aegon Bank, which is reversed as per December 31, 2020 based on the industry-wide guidelines published by DNB regarding the treatment of banks in Solvency II ratios.\n\n## Available Own Funds\n\nUnrestricted Tier 1 capital consists of Aegon's share capital, share premium and the reconciliation reserve. The reconciliation reserve includes deductions to account for foreseeable dividends that/uni00A0meet the IFRS definition of a liability or have been approved by the Board, but that have yet to be distributed to Aegon's shareholders, and restrictions related to Aegon's withprofits fund in the UK for which the excess of Own Funds over its capital requirement is ring-fenced for policyholders, and therefore unavailable to Aegon's shareholders.",

Tier 3 capital is subject to eligibility restrictions to qualify as Eligible Own Funds.\n\n## Eligible Own Funds\n\nUnder Solvency II regulation, restrictions apply to the eligibility of restricted Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital. The total\n\nof Tier/uni00A02 and Tier 3 capital may not exceed 50% of the SCR while the eligibility of Tier 3 capital is limited to 15% of the SCR. Restricted Tier 1 capital may not exceed 20% of Tier 1 Own Funds. As a result, it is possible that part of the Own Funds overflows to another tier or that is not considered eligible in determining the Group Solvency II ratio.\n\nWhen applying the eligibility restrictions, Aegon determines its tiering limits based on:\n\n- \u25a0 EEA entities - representing the part of the Group covered by the Accounting Consolidation (AC) based method, for which tiering limits are based on the SCR of the consolidated part of the Group, i.e. the consolidated group SCR; and\n- \u25a0 Non-EEA entities - representing the part of the Group covered by the Deduction & Aggregation (D&A) method. If a prudential regime of an equivalent or provisionally equivalent thirdcountry applies, such as the regulatory regimes in the United/uni00A0States, the Own Funds brought in by the Deduction & Aggregation method are allocated to tiers according to the principles laid out in Articles 87 to 99 of the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive for each individual third-country insurance undertaking.\n\nThe table below shows the composition of Aegon's Available and Eligible Own Funds, taking into consideration tiering restrictions.\n\nThe Available Own Funds are equal to the Eligible Own Funds per December 31, 2020.

The product suite includes savings and annuity products that feature a guaranteed level of benefit. Aegon also issues mortgage loans in the Netherlands that are initiated using long-term insurance funds. Products are priced using a market-consistent framework and comprehensive asset liability management (ALM) programs are implemented to ensure that the assets backing policyholder benefits are invested prudently over the long term.\n\nA range of ALM techniques are used across the Group. These range in terms of sophistication and complexity from cash-flow matching (for traditional fixed annuities) to duration matching (for the Universal Life range of products) to derivative-based semi-static and dynamic hedges (to match variable annuities).\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework includes several risk policies that govern ALM strategies, such as the Investment and Counterparty Risk Policy (ICRP). The ICRP governs the management of investment risks associated with credit, equity, property, alternative asset classes, interest rate and currency risk in addition to option markets, implied volatility risk, interest rate options and swaptions.\n\nAs well as product-level ALM programs, subsidiary businesses are required by the ICRP to maintain overarching entity-level ALM strategies that set the direction and limits for the aggregated product-level programs. Significant or complex ALM strategies are approved at group level, and all programs are subject to Group Risk oversight.\n\nTogether with the ICRP, which guides ALM strategy, several other ERM policies govern concentration risk, liquidity risk, use of derivatives and securities lending and repos. As Aegon uses derivatives extensively, collateral calls can be significant depending on market circumstances. Liquidity is managed at legal entity level in the first instance, and the large US and Dutch units may use external market solutions to match projected liquidity requirements with funding.\n\nThe introduction of Dodd-Frank Act in the United States in 2010 and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) derivative regulations in 2013 has led to Aegon transitioning a significant proportion of formerly over-the-counter positions to clearing houses in recent years. Collateral and margin requirements increased, introducing the potential for liquidity strain, which must be carefully managed. Market volatility can cause collateral requirements to increase rapidly, which means that it is always important to have sufficient high-quality collateral available. Regular liquidity stress testing is used to monitor required liquidity and ensure that sufficient funding is available.\n\n## Americas\n\nThe investment choices of/uni00A0Aegon's companies in the United States are subject to regulation dependent upon the laws of the applicable state in which each company is domiciled. Each state prescribes the nature, quality and percentage of various types of investments that may be made by the companies. Such laws generally permit investments in government bonds, corporate debt, preferred and common stock, real estate, and mortgage loans, while limiting investment in other classes of investments.\n\nA range of ALM strategies are used at the product-group level. For traditional general account insurance, the ALM strategy is to select high-quality investment assets that are matched to the corresponding liability. This strategy takes currency, yield, and maturity characteristics into consideration. Asset quality and diversification are also taken into account, together with policyholders' reasonable expectations with regard to the sharing of excess interest. Transamerica has commenced a multi-year program to gradually lengthen the duration of the assets to provide a closer match to the liability duration.\n\nIn the United States, Aegon has written a significant volume of variable annuity business, which is managed using sophisticated dynamic hedging techniques. Clearly defined hedge strategies (CDHS) cover first order 'delta' and 'rho' of withdrawal benefit (GMWB) guarantees, together with higher order programs partially covering 'gamma' and 'vega' sensitivities. Legacy variable annuity income benefit (GMIB) and death benefit (GMDB) guarantees are currently covered by the/uni00A0'Macro Hedge Program' which provides additional protection for regulatory capital against a sharp fall in equity markets. The potential for extending CDHS coverage to hedge the legacy/uni00A0variable annuities using a dynamic strategy is being reviewed in 2021.\n\nIn the United States, Aegon also uses various liquidity management techniques - including a contingent liquidity management facility - to ensure sufficient access to funding for collateral calls in the event of rapidly rising interest rates. Regular stress testing is used to monitor and manage liquidity risk.\n\n## The Netherlands\n\nAegon the Netherlands uses fixed income instruments to match its long-term liabilities. These include high-quality sovereign and corporate bonds, together with a sizeable portfolio of Dutch residential mortgages. A strategic asset allocation is used to manage the asset portfolio. A derivative-based hedge program reduces residual interest rate and other market risk exposures. The hedge program for embedded guarantees is monitored daily in order to offset liability sensitivities and also to protect against volatility in best estimate economic cost of these guarantee liabilities.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nDerivatives are central to Aegon's hedging strategy, and the derivatives market has been subject to many changes in recent years. These include the introduction of the EMIR directive in Europe. Furthermore, counterparty risks associated with derivative contracts are mitigated by collateral, and the introduction of central clearing has increased collateral requirements and reduced counterparty risk over recent years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAegon UK primarily uses ALM to protect Solvency II Own Funds. This is achieved by using a unit matching program to guard against fluctuations in best estimate liabilities. Equity options, interest rate and inflation swaps are also used to reduce the residual basis risk associated with unit-linked liabilities. Programs are also in place to match assets with the liabilities of the remaining annuity book and the staff pension scheme.\n\nThe UK with-profits business is written in the policyholder-owned fund (otherwise called the 'with-profits fund'). The funds with the highest guaranteed rates have been closed to premiums since 1999, and all funds have been closed to new business with investment guarantees since October 2002 (except for a small increase in regular payments). The fund contains free assets that have not yet been fully distributed to individual policyholders. Free assets help meet the cost of guarantees and provide a buffer to protect the fund from the impact of adverse events.\n\nThe free assets are partly invested in equity put options and interest rate swaps and swaptions. Aegon UK has an exposure only after these assets have been exhausted. The risk of exposure has been assessed by Aegon UK as remote, based on applying the risk-based capital approach required for Solvency II reporting in the UK. As the fund is closed for new business, the free assets are gradually being distributed to the with-profit policyholders through the applicable bonus system.\n\n## Aegon International\n\nAcross the Central & Eastern European units, ALM focuses on asset-liability matching in terms of duration and liquidity. In Spain and Portugal, insurance liabilities are predominately long-term life benefits, and the focus of ALM is to minimize interest rate risk by duration matching.\n\nTransamerica Life Bermuda (TLB) was established in 2005 with full-service branches opened in 2006 in Hong Kong and Singapore, writing universal life (UL) products and term products for the high-net-worth segment. TLB's ALM strategy is to invest in predominantly investment-grade fixed income assets to generate stable returns and support the UL crediting philosophy over the policy term. Derivative instruments can be used for efficient portfolio management and ALM. Assets are invested predominantly in the United States and in US dollardenominated assets to match the currency of TLB's products.",

While the objectives and use can vary by region due to local market considerations and product offerings, the use of reinsurance is coordinated and monitored globally.\n\nIn order to minimize its reinsurer defaults exposure, Aegon regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its reinsurers, and where appropriate, arranges additional protection through letters of credit, trust agreements and overcollateralization. For certain agreements, funds are withheld for investment rather than relying on the reinsurer to meet investment expectations. Default exposure is further reduced by using multiple reinsurers within certain reinsurance agreements.\n\nThere are no material problems with reinsurance recoverability. Aegon has exposure to Scottish Re US (SRUS), whose ultimate parent is in liquidation and which itself is in rehabilitation with the Delaware regulator since March 2019. Aegon is continuing discussions with the receiver and the regulator to assess options provided in the rehabilitation plan, as well as liquidation.\n\nTransamerica has set up a valuation allowance of USD 143 million (EUR 125 million) in relation to the ongoing rehabilitation process. Separately, Aegon ceded business to Senior Health Insurance of Pennsylvania (SHIP). The Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner filed an application in January 2020 with the state's\n\nCommonwealth Court to have SHIP placed in rehabilitation. Aegon was protected by a trust account and had assessed that the trust assets were sufficient to cover the reserves and receivables from SHIP on Aegon's balance sheet. In December 2020, Aegon completed the recapture of the reserves with SHIP and the transfer of the assets under the management of Aegon Asset Management. SHIP will retain a remainder interest in the trust assets should there be any left over after all obligations are paid.\n\nExternal reinsurance counterparties are, in general, major global reinsurers. At the same time, local reinsurers are utilized to ensure a balance for local capacity and diversification. The role of Corporate Center and use of reinsurance by region is explained in more details below:\n\n## Corporate Center\n\nGlobal coordination takes place through Aegon Corporate Center, working closely with local business units. The Global Reinsurance Use Committee (GRUC) is a global body that shares and discusses updates and matters of interest among local and global reinsurance managers. The GRUC also oversees Aegon's Reinsurance Use Policy and facilitates approval of transactions and reinsurers as required by the Policy. Reports are shared with the Global Risk and Capital Committee, Group Management Board and Supervisory Board Risk Committee as appropriate.\n\n## Americas\n\nAegon Americas manages its life insurance exposure through various types of agreements with reinsurers. It relies heavily on quota-share and excess-of-loss reinsurance arrangements. The primary purpose of these agreements is to diversify Aegon Americas' overall risk and limit the maximum loss on risks that exceed policy retention levels. Maximum retention levels vary by product, method of underwriting, and the nature of the risk being reinsured. In most recent years, Americas has also used Excess of Loss Reinsurance to support reserves considered as excessive or redundant supporting secondary guarantees of Universal Life or Term business.\n\n## The Netherlands\n\nAegon the Netherlands reinsures part of its insurance exposure with third-party reinsurers under traditional indemnity and 'excess of loss' contracts. Reinsurance helps Aegon manage, mitigate, and diversify its insurance risks, and thereby limit the maximum loss it may incur. Since January 1, 2014, Aegon the Netherlands has reinsured its term life assurance through a quota-sharing contract. Aegon the Netherlands no longer writes new term life assurance, but the existing reinsurance arrangements remain in force. In December 2019, Aegon announced the reinsurance of about one quarter of its longevity exposure in the Netherlands. The contract commenced on December 31, 2019 and will run until the portfolio runs off. For non-life, Aegon the Netherlands historically only reinsured its property, general and motor thirdparty liability business. For property insurance, motor third-party liability insurance, and general third-party liability, 'excess of loss' contracts are in place. In December 2020, Aegon reinsured part of its disability business for the self-employed on a quota share business.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAegon UK uses reinsurance to both manage risk and maximize financial value. The degree to which reinsurance is used across the product lines varies, depending largely on the appropriateness and value of reinsurance available in the market. The protection business is significantly reinsured. A reinsurance panel is in place to provide reinsurance, predominantly on a quota-share basis, across the range of benefits. A facultative reinsurance panel is also used to assist the placement of very large cases.\n\n## Aegon International Central and Eastern Europe\n\nAegon uses reinsurance for its life and non-life businesses in order to mitigate insurance risk. The majority of treaties in force for Aegon's operations in Central & Eastern Europe are non-proportional excess of loss programs - except for the life reinsurance treaties - which are made on a surplus and quotashare basis (including various riders). The most significant reinsurance program currently in force is a property catastrophe excess of loss treaty.",

This means that both its joint ventures in Spain and Portugal and own business are treated as a whole, with similar economic conditions and a similar panel of reinsurers, while individual profit shares without losses are carried forward by each entity belonging to Aegon Spain. The main contract for mortality and morbidity provides proportional reinsurance protection for both its individual risk and group risk policies. Aegon Spain thereby seeks/uni00A0to optimize the cost of reinsurance coverage, while achieving prudential diversification of its insurance risk by limiting the maximum possible losses on risks that exceed retention levels. Household insurance contracts for the Aegon Santander joint ventures follow the same principles, with maximum retention levels varying both by product and by the nature of the risk being reinsured. Natural catastrophe reinsurance programs are also in place to provide cover for high impact - low frequency events. As part of the acquisition of Allianz Popular Vida in the second quarter of 2020, Aegon reinsured the savings business with Santander Seguros.\n\n## China: Aegon THTF\n\nAegon THTF shares its morbidity and mortality risk with international and national reinsurers. The mortality risk of individual products is shared through a surplus reinsurance structure. Aegon THTF reviews the reinsurance structure regularly, adjusting it based on claims experience and its risk acceptance capability.\n\n## India: Aegon Life\n\nAegon Life uses reinsurance for part of the mortality and morbidity risks of the policies it sells.\n\n## Hong Kong and Singapore: Transamerica Life Bermuda (TLB)\n\nTLB uses third-party mortality reinsurance for its universal life and traditional policies. Mortality reinsurance takes the form of yearly renewable term, excess-of-retention or quotashare arrangements. This is typically arranged through a pool of reinsurers. TLB entered into a reinsurance treaty to provide further protection for the local solvency position in Singapore.",

As a result, the Company is exposed to a range of underwriting, operational and financial risks. Aegon's risk management and internal control systems are designed to ensure that these risks are managed effectively and efficiently in a way that is aligned with the Company's strategy.\n\nFor Aegon, risk management involves:\n\n- \u25a0 Understanding risks that the Company faces;\n- \u25a0 Maintaining a company-wide framework through which the risk-return trade-off associated with these risks can be assessed;\n- \u25a0 Maintaining risk tolerances and supporting policies to limit exposure to a particular risk or combination of risks; and\n- \u25a0 Monitoring risk exposures and actively maintaining oversight of the Company's overall risk and solvency positions.\n\nBy setting certain predefined tolerances and adhering to policies that limit the overall risk to which the Company is exposed, Aegon is able to accept risk with the knowledge of potential returns and losses.\n\nThis section provides a description of Aegon's risk management. Risks and risk management are also referred to in various other sections of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report, as they are relevant throughout the Company, for its various activities and its financial results. Relevant sections are:/uni00A0Aegon's business environment on page 13; note 4 on Financial Risks in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 192; and Risk factors on page 382.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework\n\nAegon's ERM framework is designed and applied to identify and manage potential risks that may affect Aegon. This means identifying and managing individual and aggregate risks within Aegon's risk tolerance in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of Aegon's objectives. The ERM framework covers the ERM components as identified by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The ERM framework applies to all of Aegon's businesses for which it has operational control. Aegon's businesses are required to either adopt the Group-level ERM framework directly, or tailor it to local needs while meeting the requirements of the Group-level ERM framework.\n\n## Risk strategy, risk appetite statement and risk tolerances\n\nThe formulation of the risk strategy starts with the principle that taking a risk should be based on serving a customer's need. In terms of Aegon's purpose statement, risk taking should be instrumental in helping people achieve a lifetime of financial security. The competence with which Aegon is able to manage the risk is assessed and Aegon's risk preferences are formulated, taking into account Aegon's risk capacity. The risk preferences\n\neventually lead to a targeted risk profile that reflects the risks Aegon wants to keep on the balance sheet, and the risks Aegon would like to avoid.\n\nAegon's risk appetite statement and risk tolerances are established in order to assist management in carrying out Aegon's strategy using the resources available to Aegon. The risk appetite statement is linked to Aegon's purpose of helping people achieve a lifetime of financial security. Aegon's risk appetite statement emphasizes that Aegon businesses:\n\n'Fulfil our promises towards our customers and other stakeholders by delivering sustainable and growing long-term free capital generation, with strong resilience in solvency and liquidity, healthy balance in exposures, and by running a responsible business with effective controls.'\n\nFollowing from the risk appetite statement, risk tolerances are defined on:\n\n- \u25a0 Capital generation, to ensure free capital generation remains sufficiently in line with projections.\n- \u25a0 Solvency and liquidity, to ensure that Aegon remains solvent and liquid even under adverse scenarios.\n- \u25a0 Risk balance, to ensure a healthy balance of risk exposures that supports delivering on our capital generation and return on capital targets.\n- \u25a0 Responsible business with effective controls, which acknowledges an acceptable level of operational risk and stresses a low tolerance for (lack of) actions which could lead to material adverse risk events that result in breaking promises or not meeting reasonable expectations of customers, legal breaches or reputational damage.\n\nThe tolerances are further developed into measures, limits and thresholds that have to be complied with to remain within the tolerances.\n\n## Risk identification and risk assessment\n\nAegon has identified a risk universe that captures all known material risks to which the Company is exposed. In order to assess all risks, a consistent methodology for measuring risks is required. Aegon's methodology for this is documented in a manual and kept up to date. The risk metrics are embedded in Aegon's key reports and are used for decision making.\n\n## Risk response\n\nAegon distinguishes the following risk responses:\n\n- \u25a0 Management can accept the risk when the risk exposure is within the set risk tolerance; and\n- \u25a0 Management can decide to control, transfer or avoid the risk when an exposure exceeds the established risk tolerance or if cost-benefit analysis supports further actions.",

The impact of key financial, underwriting, and operational risk drivers on earnings and capital is shown in the quarterly risk dashboard for the various risk types both separately as well as on an aggregate basis.\n\nRisk exposures are compared with the limits as defined by Aegon's risk tolerance statements. Reporting also includes risk policy compliance and incident and compliance reporting. Finally, the main risks derived from Aegon's strategy and the day-to-day business are discussed, as well as forward looking points for attention. If necessary, mitigating actions are taken and documented.\n\n## Risk control\n\nA system of effective controls is required to mitigate the risks identified. In Aegon's ERM framework, risk control includes risk\n\ngovernance, risk policies, internal control framework, model validation, risk embedding, risk culture and compliance.\n\n## Risk universe and risk appetite\n\nThe risk factors described in this Integrated Annual Report (see risk factors in the 'additional information' section) generally have an impact on financial markets (e.g. interest rates and share prices), underwriting assumptions (e.g. longevity and policyholder behavior) or result in operational risk events (e.g. fraud and business disruption). Aegon's risk universe is structured to reflect the type of risk events to which the Company is exposed. The identified risk categories are financial risk, underwriting risk, and operational risk. Specific risk types are identified within these risk categories. The risk universe captures all known material risks to which Aegon is exposed. These risks, internal or external, may affect the Company's operations, earnings, share price, value of its investments, or the sale of certain products and services. In the context of Aegon's risk strategy, a risk appetite is set for the three identified risk categories (see table below).\n\n| Risk category   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Appetite                                                                                                                                  |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Underwriting    | The risk of incurring losses when actual experience deviates from  Aegon's best estimate assumptions on mortality, longevity,  morbidity, policyholder behavior, P&C claims and expenses used  to price products and establish technical provisions. | Medium to high - Underwriting risk is Aegon's core business  and meets customer needs.                                                    |\n| Financial       | The risk of incurring financial losses due to movements in  financial markets and the market value of balance sheet items.  Elements of financial risk are credit risk, investment risk, interest  rate risk and currency risk.                      | Low to medium - Accepted where it meets customer needs  and the risk return profile is acceptable.                                        |\n| Operational     | Operational risk results from operational failures or external  events, such as processing errors, legal and compliance issues,  natural or man-made disasters, and cybercrime.                                                                      | Low - Accepted as a necessary condition of conducting  business, but mitigated as much as possible in an economi- cally efficient manner. |\n\n## Most significant risks\n\nThe most significant risks Aegon faces in terms of exposures and required capital are:\n\n- \u25a0 Financial markets risks (particularly related to credit, equity, and interest rates);\n- \u25a0 Underwriting risk (particularly related to longevity and policyholder behavior); and\n- \u25a0 Operational risks (particularly related to reputation and continuity of operations).\n\n## Description of risk types Financial risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of economic loss due to the deterioration in the financial condition of counterparties, either through fair value losses on traded securities or through defaults on traded securities, loans, and mortgages. Having a well-diversified investment portfolio means that Aegon can accept credit spread risk to earn a liquidity premium on assets that match liabilities. The focus is on high-quality securities with low expected defaults because Aegon has a low appetite for default risk.\n\n## Equity market risk and other investment risks\n\nAegon runs the risk that the market value of its investments changes. Investment risk affects Aegon's direct investments\n\nin the general account, indirect investments on the account of policyholders and agreements where Aegon relies on counterparties, such as reinsurance and derivative counterparties. Aegon has a low preference for investments in equity securities via the general account. Equity investments generate an equity risk premium over the long run, but in combination with a high capital charge result in a relatively low return on capital. Aegon has experience and expertise in managing complex investment guarantees and leverages this capability by providing customers access to a range of investment strategies and guaranteed benefits.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nAegon is exposed to interest rates as both its assets and liabilities are sensitive to movements in long- and short-term interest rates, as well as to changes in the volatility of interest rates. Aegon accepts interest rate risk in order to meet customer needs. However, as no spread is earned on this interest rate risk, Aegon prefers to mitigate the risk to the extent possible.\n\n## Currency exchange rate risk\n\nAs an international company, Aegon is exposed to different currencies, and therefore to movements in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exposure exists primarily when policies are denominated in currencies other than the issuer's functional",

Assets allocated to equity are held in local currencies to the extent shareholders' equity is required to satisfy regulatory and self-imposed capital requirements. Currency exchange rate fluctuations therefore affect the level of shareholders' equity as a result of converting local currencies into euro (EUR), the Group's reporting currency. The Company holds its capital base in various currencies in amounts that correspond to the book value of individual business units.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nAegon needs to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet shortterm cash demands, not only under normal conditions, but also in the event of a crisis. To that end, Aegon has put a strong liquidity management strategy in place. The Company considers extreme liquidity stress scenarios, including the possibility of prolonged 'frozen' capital markets, an immediate and permanent rise in interest rates, and policyholders withdrawing liabilities at the earliest conceivable date. In addition, the Company has liquidity stress planning in place.\n\n## Underwriting risk\n\nUnderwriting risk relates to the products sold by Aegon's insurance entities and represents the risk of incurring losses when actual experience deviates from Aegon's best estimate assumptions on mortality, morbidity, policyholder behavior, P&C claims and expenses. Aegon has a preference to selectively grow underwriting risk, but this must work handin-hand with a strong underwriting process. Aegon's earnings depend, to a significant degree, on the extent to which claims experience is consistent with assumptions used to price products and establish technical liabilities. Changes in, among other things, morbidity, mortality, longevity trends and policyholder behavior may have a considerable impact on the Company's income. Assumptions used to price products and establish technical liabilities are reviewed on a regular basis. Please refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies to the consolidated financial statement for further information.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nLike other companies, Aegon faces operational risk resulting from operational failures or external events, such as processing errors, inaccuracies in used models, actions by personnel, non-compliance to laws and regulations, and natural or manmade disasters, including climate change. In addition, major programs or organizational transformations may also increase potential for operational risks. Aegon's systems and processes are designed to support complex products and transactions, and to avoid such issues as system failures, business disruption, financial crime, and breaches of information security. Aegon monitors and analyses these risks on a regular basis, and where necessary revises contingency plans to deal with them. Aegon's operational risk universe distinguishes eight risk\n\ntypes: business risk; legal, regulatory, conduct and compliance risks; tax risk; financial crime risk; processing risk; information technology and business disruption risk; people risk; and facility risk. These level 1 risk types are split out into more granular level 2 risk types. The operational risk universe also covers social and environmental risks./uni00A0Please refer to the chapter on nonfinancial policies, procedures, and outcomes for an overview of how various environmental, social and governance topics are incorporated in decision making processes and policies throughout the Company.\n\n## Information security risk\n\nInformation security risk has been recognized by Aegon as an important operational risk. Aegon's global information security program is intended to establish security controls that safeguard data, technology, and operations, as well as activities outsourced to third parties. Aegon recognizes the need to continually strengthen its existing security control environment and preventative tooling as new cyber threats and exposures emerge. Evaluations and scenario testing of security controls - including detection and response capabilities - are performed by both internal and external experts, and identified vulnerabilities are tracked and monitored by management. This program is overseen by Aegon's Global Chief Information Security Officer, who has a direct reporting line to the Global Chief Technology Officer, who is a member of the Management Board, in conjunction with local business unit management and information security officers. Moreover, periodic updates are provided to Aegon's Supervisory Board. Aegon management recognizes the need to establish and maintain adequate information security systems that are capable of addressing potential cyber security attacks.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nBoth industry-wide and within Aegon, cultural and behavioral elements of risks increasingly play a role within overall risk frameworks. Relevant in this context are, among others, the European Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Conduct risk refers to the risks inherent in behaviors, business and staff integrity and business culture, including, but not limited to, meeting the standards of Aegon's Market Conduct Principles.\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nAegon is committed to a strong anti-fraud program to protect its clients and assets from fraudulent behavior by clients, business partners, employees or any other external entity or individual. Mandatory requirements for identifying, mitigating, and monitoring internal, external, and intermediary fraud risks are captured in the Group Anti-Fraud policy. Aegon Regions have implemented these requirements in local policies, processes, and procedures. As part of Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA) 2020, all regions provided insight in their local anti-fraud programs and indicated that controls with regard to internal, external and intermediary fraud were properly designed and operating effectively.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) risk\n\nESG risks are covered by Aegon's risk universe and in 2020 climate risk was more explicitly recognized in the risk universe, given its increasing relevance and the need to manage the impact on Aegon's risk profile. Risk management regularly interacts and cooperates on ESG risks, including climate risk, with the Global Corporate Sustainability Team reporting into the CEO and the Climate Change Working Group (CCWG) of the Responsible Business and Investment Committee chaired by a member of Aegon's Management Board. This is covered in more detail in the Responsible Business section and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section of this report. Of note for 2020 were the recognition of climate change and loss of biodiversity as material topics in the Aegon Business environment scan.\n\n## Pandemic risk - COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 impacts the company through financial markets and underwriting developments (mortality rates), and also has operational risks. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, targeted control assessments were conducted across all regions to monitor the operational risk impact of the pandemic. The assessments showed that the controls continued to operate effectively. The assessments covered the impact on core business processes, the working from home environment and the related information security risk, service levels to customers, and the health of employees. In addition, ongoing attention was directed at third party risk with the aim to monitor financial health, security and capacity aspects as well as to provide support where needed, to avoid negative knock-on effect for Aegon./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Business environment scan\n\nIn addition to the management of described risk types, Aegon performs a business environment scan. The aim is to identify topics, including opportunities and new and developing challenges, which could have significant impact on value creation and Aegon's financial strength, competitive position, or reputation. The scan essentially functions as a materiality assessment and is meant as a check on the ongoing appropriateness of the risk universe, to ensure completeness of Aegon's risk assessment and to provide input for ongoing strategy development.\n\nThe business environment scan is performed on a biennial basis, with annual updates for significant changes.\n\nTopic identification, mapping and selection are based on desk research, interviews with experts and management selection. Outcomes can be used for materiality reporting, as input for Aegon's strategy process and for possible follow-up in terms of further analysis, tracking or as a global project. For more information on the materiality reporting refer to the section: Aegon's business environment on page 13.\n\n## Risk governance framework\n\nAegon's risk management is based on clear, well-defined risk governance. The goals of risk governance are to:\n\n- \u25a0 Define roles and responsibilities, and risk reporting procedures for decision makers;\n- \u25a0 Institute a proper system of checks and balances;\n- \u25a0 Provide a consistent framework for managing risk in line with the targeted risk profile; and\n- \u25a0 Facilitate risk diversification.\n\n## Governance structure\n\nAegon's risk management framework is represented across all levels of the organization. This ensures a coherent and integrated approach to risk management throughout the Company. Similarly, Aegon has a comprehensive range of company-wide risk policies that detail specific operating guidelines and limits. These policies include legal, regulatory, and internally set requirements, and are designed to keep overall risk-specific exposures to a manageable level. Any breach of policy limits or warning levels triggers remedial action or heightened monitoring. Further risk policies may be developed at a local level to cover situations specific to particular regions or business units.\n\nAegon's risk management governance structure has four basic layers:\n\n- \u25a0 The Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board Risk Committee (SBRC);\n- \u25a0 The Executive Board and the Management Board;\n- \u25a0 The Group Risk & Capital Committee (GRCC) and its subcommittees; and\n- \u25a0 The Regional Risk & Capital Committees.\n\nThe SBRC reports to the Supervisory Board on topics related to the ERM framework and the internal control system. The formal responsibility regarding the effectiveness and design, operation, and appropriateness of the ERM and internal control system rests, however, with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee works closely together with the SBRC with regard to the oversight of and reports on the effectiveness of the ERM framework and the risk control systems of the Company. The Audit Committee relies on the findings of the SBRC. The SBRC is responsible for overseeing Aegon's ERM framework, including risk governance and measures taken to ensure risk management is properly integrated into the Company's broader strategy.\n\nFor a description of the main roles and responsibilities of the/uni00A0SBRC see the section on the Risk Committee on page 62 of/uni00A0the Report of the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Executive Board and the Group's Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to inform the Supervisory Board of any risk that directly threatens the solvency, liquidity, or operations of the Company.",

The Executive Board adopts the risk strategy, risk governance, risk tolerance and material changes in risk methodology and risk policies. The Group's CRO has a standing invitation to attend Executive Board meetings and a direct reporting line to the Supervisory Board to discuss ERM and related matters and is a member of the Management Board.\n\nThe Management Board oversees a broad range of strategic and operational issues. While the Executive Board is Aegon's statutory executive body, the Management Board provides vital support and expertise in safeguarding Aegon's strategic goals. The Management Board discusses and sponsors ERM, in particular the risk strategy, risk governance, risk tolerance and the introduction of new risk policies.\n\nThe Executive Board and Management Board are supported by the/uni00A0Group Risk & Capital Committee (GRCC). The GRCC is Aegon's most senior risk committee. It is responsible for managing Aegon's balance sheet at the global level, and is in charge of risk oversight, risk monitoring and risk management related decisions on behalf of the Executive Board and in line with its charter. The GRCC ensures risk-taking is within Aegon's risk tolerances; that the capital position is adequate to support financial strength, credit rating objectives and regulatory requirements, and that capital is properly allocated. The GRCC informs the Executive Board about any identified (near) breaches of overall tolerance levels which threaten the risk balance, as well as any potential threats to the Company's solvency, liquidity, or operations.\n\nThe GRCC has three sub-committees: the ERM framework, Accounting and Actuarial Committee (ERMAAC), the NonFinancial Risk Committee (NFRC) and the Model Validation Committee (MVC).\n\nThe purpose of the ERMAAC is to assist the GRCC, Executive Board and Management Board with financial risk framework setting and maintenance across all group-level balance sheet bases, including policies, standards, guidelines, methodologies, and assumptions.\n\nThe purpose of the NFRC is to assist the GRCC, Executive Board and Management Board with non-financial risk framework setting and maintenance, including policies, standards, guidelines and methodologies and to act as formal discussion and exchange of information platform on matters of concern regarding nonfinancial risk management.\n\nThe MVC is responsible for approving all model validation reports across Aegon. This is an independent committee that reports into the GRCC and the Executive Board to provide information on model integrity and recommendations for further strengthening of models.\n\nEach of Aegon's regions has a Risk & Capital Committee (RCC). The responsibilities and prerogatives of the RCCs are aligned with the GRCC and further set out in their respective charters, which are tailored to local circumstances.\n\nIn addition to the four basic layers described above, Aegon has an established Group-wide risk function. It is the mission of the Risk Management function to ensure the continuity of the Company through safeguarding the value of existing business, protecting Aegon's balance sheet and reputation, and through supporting the creation of sustainable value for all stakeholders.\n\nIn general, the objective of the Risk Management function is to support the Executive Board, Management Board, Supervisory Board, and regional and business unit boards in ensuring that the Company reviews, assesses, understands, and manages its risk profile. Through oversight, the Risk Management function ensures the group-wide risk profile is managed in line with Aegon's risk tolerances, and stakeholder expectations are managed under both normal business conditions and adverse conditions caused by unforeseen negative events.\n\nThe following roles are important in order to realize the objective of the Risk Management function:\n\n- \u25a0 Advising on risk-related matters including risk tolerance, risk governance, risk methodology and risk policies;\n- \u25a0 Supporting and facilitating the development, incorporation, maintenance and embedding of the ERM framework and sound practices; and\n- \u25a0 Monitoring and challenging the implementation and effectiveness of ERM practices.\n\nIn the context of these roles, the following responsibilities can be distinguished:\n\n## Advising on risk-related matters\n\n- \u25a0 Bringing businesses together to facilitate information exchange, sharing best practices, and working together on relevant case studies and external standards in order to develop, adopt and maintain relevant standards of practice throughout Aegon; and\n- \u25a0 Optimizing the use of capital and growth within risk/return and consumer conduct criteria.\n\n## Supporting and facilitating\n\n- \u25a0 Developing and maintaining the global ERM framework for identifying, measuring, and managing all material risks the Company is exposed to as defined in Aegon's risk universe and protecting Aegon's reputation;\n- \u25a0 Developing and maintaining Aegon's risk methodology as described in the Aegon Market Consistent Reporting Manual (AMCRM);\n- \u25a0 Supporting the businesses with implementing the ERM framework, risk methodology and standards of practice where needed;",

Business unit CROs have either a direct reporting line to the Group CRO or one of the regional CROs that reports directly to the Group CRO.\n\n## Internal control system\n\nAegon has developed an internal control system that serves to facilitate its compliance with applicable laws, regulations and administrative processes, and the effectiveness and efficiency of operations with regard to its objectives, in addition to the availability and reliability of financial and non-financial information. The overall internal control system ensures appropriate control activities for key processes and the documentation and reporting of administrative and accounting information. The internal control system is embedded through policies and frameworks such as the ERM framework, the Model Validation Framework and the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Framework, which is considered more encompassing in scope than the Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO, 2013), on which criteria for the internal control system are based.\n\nThe internal control system has been developed in accordance with regulations that Aegon must comply with (i.e. SarbanesOxley Act and Solvency II). Aegon's control activities should ensure an adequate level of internal control over Aegon's objectives and in particular compliance, operational and financial reporting objectives including the production of IFRS and Solvency II numbers. The objective is to provide assurance regarding the reliability, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and quality of internal and external (regulatory) reporting, the safeguarding of assets, and compliance with internal and external requirements. A key element of Aegon's internal control system is to facilitate action planning and embed continuous improvement regarding the internal control environment throughout the organization.",

The objective of this structure is to avoid surprises due to the materialization of unidentified risks, or from losses that exceed predefined risk tolerance levels and related limit structures.\n\nThe Company's first line, the business and support functions, has direct responsibility for managing and taking risk in accordance with defined risk strategy, risk tolerances and risk policies. The second line includes the risk management function and the compliance function.

Finally, both the Compliance function/uni00A0and the Operational & Model Risk Management function play key roles in monitoring the Company's adherence to external rules and regulations and internal policies.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements,\n\nAegon's directors and management have adopted a going concern basis on the reasonable assumption that the Company is and will be able to continue its normal course of business in the foreseeable future.\n\nRelevant facts, circumstances and risks relating to the\n\nconsolidated financial position on December 31, 2020, were assessed in order to reach the going concern assumption. The main areas assessed were financial performance, capital adequacy, financial flexibility, liquidity, and access to capital markets, together with the factors and risks likely to affect Aegon's future development, performance, and financial position. Commentary on these areas is set out in the 'Capital and liquidity management', 'Risk management',/uni00A0'Results of operations' and/uni00A0'Business Overview' sections in this Annual Report. Management concluded that the going concern assumption is appropriate on the basis of the financial performance of the Company, its continued ability to access capital markets, adequate solvency ratios, and the level of leverage and Cash Capital at Holding.\n\nAegon's risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance for the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of Aegon's published financial statements. They cannot, however, provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of Aegon's financial statements can be prevented or detected.\n\nOn the basis of the above, Aegon's Executive Board states the following with respect to risks to the Company's financial reporting:\n\n- \u25a0 The report provides sufficient insights into any failings with regards to the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems;\n- \u25a0 Aegon's risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the Company's financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies;\n- \u25a0 Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis; and\n- \u25a0 The report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of the Company's continuity for the period of twelve months after the preparation of the report.\n\nThe statements in this section are not statements in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.",

These are the topics that, we believe, will have the most impact on our business in the years ahead, not only on our financial performance, but also our ability to continue creating long-term value for the societies in which we operate. This report looks in detail at these topics, and at how we, as a financial services company, are meeting the challenges and opportunities they represent for our business. Our material topics are also built into our annual strategy cycle.\n\nSignificant audiences: This report is intended first and foremost for investors. We believe it's important that financial markets price in fully social, business and environmental risk. For this to happen, management must disclose these risks, and work to understand the connection between value creation and longerterm financial performance. Legislators are already moving in this direction, with the adoption of the EU Directive on Non-Financial Reporting and the publication of recommendations from the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Aegon is not only a financial services provider. It is also an investor. Consequently, this report also examines the efforts we've made to embed social, environmental, and economic factors into our own investment decision-making.\n\nResponsibility: As Aegon's Executive Board, we bear ultimate responsibility for this report and its contents. This is our eighth integrated report - but the third time we've published a combined integrated and Annual Report. We're happy to support the IIRC and GRI in their push for more complete and relevant corporate reporting. Disclosure is only part of the story. For us, integrated reporting is also about understanding both the financial and non-financial factors affecting our business, and using that understanding to drive better, more integrated decision-making.\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands, March 17, 2021\n\n## The Executive Board of Aegon N.V.\n\nLard Friese, CEO\n\nMatthew J.

Based on this evaluation, Aegon's CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There have been no material changes in the Company's internal controls, or in other factors, that could significantly affect internal controls over financial reporting subsequent to the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.\n\nDue to the listing of Aegon shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Aegon is required to comply with the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX 404. These regulations require that Aegon's CEO (the Chairman of the Executive Board) and CFO report on and certify the effectiveness of Aegon's internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis. Furthermore, external auditors are required to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Aegon's internal controls over financial reporting. The SOX 404 statement by the Executive Board is stated below, followed by the report of the external auditor.\n\n## Management's Annual Report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe directors and management of Aegon are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Aegon's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of Aegon's principal executive and financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its published financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u25a0 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n- \u25a0 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;\n- \u25a0 Provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n- \u25a0 Provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on Aegon's financial statements would be prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of Aegon's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\n\nIn making its assessment management used the criteria established in 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission' (COSO, 2013 framework).\n\nBased on the assessment, management concluded that, in all material aspects, the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. They have reviewed the results of its work with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included on the following page.\n\n## Management's assessment of going concern\n\nThe directors and management of Aegon have adopted a going concern basis, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, on the reasonable assumption that the Company is, and will be, able to continue its normal course of business in the foreseeable future.\n\nRelevant facts and circumstances relating to the consolidated financial position on December 31, 2020, were assessed in order to reach the going concern assumption. The main areas assessed are financial performance, capital adequacy, financial flexibility, liquidity, and access to capital markets, together with the factors likely to affect Aegon's future development, performance, and financial position. Commentary on these is set out in the 'Capital and liquidity management', 'Risk management', 'Results of operations' and 'Business overview' sections in this Annual Report. Taking into account the financial performance of the Company, its continued ability to access capital markets, the fact that its solvency and leverage ratios are well within target range, and the level of cash capital at Holding, management concluded that the going concern assumption is appropriate.\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands, March 17, 2021\n\n## The Executive Board of Aegon N.V.\n\nLard Friese, CEO\n\nMatthew J.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness\n\nof internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nMarch 17, 2021 PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.\n\nOriginal has been signed by G.J.

The 2020 interim dividend amounted to EUR/uni00A00.06 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.0015 per common share B. The interim dividend was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. The interim dividend was payable as of September 18, 2020. At the General Meeting of Shareholders currently scheduled for June 3, 2021, the Executive Board will, in line with its earlier announcement and barring unforeseen circumstances, propose a final dividend of EUR/uni00A00.06 per common share (at each shareholders option\n\nin cash or in stock), and EUR/uni00A00.0015 per common share B, which has financial rights attached to it of 1/40 th of a common share. This will bring the total dividend for 2020 to EUR/uni00A00.12 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.003 per common share B. In case of a final dividend, this will be paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. The value of the stock dividend will be approximately equal to the cash dividend. Dividends in US dollars are calculated based on the foreign exchange reference rate (WM/Reuters closing spot exchange rate fixed at 5.00 pm Central European Summer Time ('CEST')) on the US-ex dividend day.\n\n|      | EUR per common share  1)   | EUR per common share  1)   | EUR per common share  1)   | USD per common share  1)   | USD per common share  1)   | USD per common share  1)   |\n|------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Year | Interim                    | Final                      | Total                      | Interim                    | Final                      | Total                      |\n| 2016 | 0.13                       | 0.13                       | 0.26                       | 0.15                       | 0.15                       | 0.29                       |\n| 2017 | 0.13                       | 0.14                       | 0.27                       | 0.15                       | 0.16                       | 0.32                       |\n| 2018 | 0.14                       | 0.15                       | 0.29                       | 0.16                       | 0.17                       | 0.33                       |\n| 2019 | 0.15                       | 0.00  2)                   | 0.15                       | 0.17                       | -                          | 0.17                       |\n| 2020 | 0.06                       | 0.06  3)                   | 0.12                       | 0.07                       |                            |                            |\n\n- 1 Paid at each shareholders' option in cash or in stock.\n- 2 Aegon forewent the 2019 final dividend of EUR 0.16 to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its risk profile.",

The reconciliation of this measure to the most comparable IFRS-EU measure is presented in note 5 'Segment information' of the consolidated financial statements. This non-IFRS-EU measure is calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis the revenues and expenses of Aegon's joint ventures in China, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain and Aegon's associates in Brazil, France, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.\n\nThe information on the following tables also includes the non-IFRS-EU financial measure net underlying earnings. This is/uni00A0the after-tax equivalent of underlying earnings before tax. The/uni00A0reconciliation of net underlying earnings to the most comparable IFRS-EU measure is presented in this section. Aegon believes that these non-IFRS-EU measures provides meaningful supplemental information about the underlying operating results of Aegon's businesses, including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing/uni00A0the businesses.\n\nAegon's senior management is compensated based in part on Aegon's results against targets using the non-IFRS-EU measures presented in this report. While many other insurers in Aegon's peer group present substantially similar non-IFRS-EU measures, the non-IFRS-EU measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the non-IFRS-EU measures presented by other insurers. There is no standardized meaning to these measures under IFRS-EU or any other recognized set of accounting standards and readers are cautioned to consider\n\ncarefully the different ways in which Aegon and its peers present similar information before making a comparison. Aegon believes the non-IFRS-EU measures present within this report, when read together with Aegon's reported IFRS-EU financial statements, provide meaningful supplemental information for the investing public. This enables them to evaluate Aegon's businesses after eliminating the impact of current IFRS-EU accounting policies for financial instruments and insurance contracts, which embed a number of accounting policy alternatives that companies may select in presenting their results (as companies may use different local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAPs)), and this may make the comparability difficult between time periods.\n\nFor the discussion on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018, including certain comparative discussion on our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, please refer to the section Results of operations on pages 126 to 146 in Aegon's 2019 Integrated/uni00A0Annual Report.",

Underlying earnings before tax decreased by 12% compared with 2019 to EUR 1,729 million in 2020, as a result of the impact of lower interest rates and adverse mortality experience in the Americas, which was partly attributable to COVID-19 as a cause of death. These impacts were partly offset by higher earnings from the other units, supported by expense savings. Furthermore, other charges increased compared with 2019 driven by assumption changes in the Americas. In addition, net impairments increased and the loss from fair value items increased compared with 2019, reflecting the adverse economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income amounted to EUR/uni00A055 million in 2020. Underlying earnings before tax together with gains on investments and the result from run-off businesses were more than offset by fair value losses, net impairments and other charges, resulting in a loss before tax of EUR/uni00A037 million. Income tax was a benefit of EUR/uni00A092 million, and mainly reflects the tax benefit on the net loss in the Americas.\n\n## Underlying earnings before tax\n\nAegon's underlying earnings before tax decreased by 12% compared with 2019 to EUR 1,729 million in 2020. This was mainly driven by the Americas as a result of the impact of lower interest rates and adverse mortality experience in the Life business. This was partly offset by higher earnings from the other units, supported by expense savings.\n\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax in the Americas/uni00A0decreased by 27% compared with 2019/uni00A0to EUR 820 million in 2020. This was mainly caused by the impact of lower interest rates, and adverse mortality experience in the Life business, which was partly attributable to COVID-19 as a cause of death. Favorable morbidity experience as a result of COVID-19, mostly related to the closed block of Long-Term Care insurance, as well as higher investment income and higher fees as a result of favorable equity market performance in Variable Annuities, were offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower account balances in Fixed Annuities and the impact of outflows and contract discontinuances in Retirement Plans.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from the Netherlands increased by 3% compared with 2019 to EUR 665 million in 2020, as expense savings across all segments and higher earnings in the Banking and the Service business more than offset lower non-life earnings. Lower operating expenses were driven by the impact of moving from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan for the future pension accrual of Aegon's own employees.\n- \u25a0 In the United Kingdom, underlying earnings before tax improved by 3% compared with 2019/uni00A0to EUR 144 million in 2020. This was driven/uni00A0by higher underlying earnings before tax from the Digital Solutions business as a result of lower expenses and higher fee income from continued growth in platform assets, reflecting growth in the Workplace channel.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Asset Management increased by 31% compared with 2019 to EUR 182 million in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by the performance of Aegon's Chinese asset management joint venture, Aegon Industrial Fund Management Company (AIFMC). This more than offset lower underlying earnings before tax in Aegon's Global Platforms in 2020 compared with 2019.\n- \u25a0 Total Holdings costs amounted to EUR 237 million in 2020/uni00A0compared with EUR 228/uni00A0million in 2019. This is mainly due to the refinancing of debt. Aegon redeemed perpetual securities, for which the interest expense used to be recorded directly through equity, and issued dated (Tier 2) instruments, for which the interest expense is recorded through the profit & loss statement. This led to an unfavorable impact on underlying earnings before tax, even though the refinancing resulted in lower coupons.\n\n## Fair value items\n\nThe loss from fair value items amounted to EUR/uni00A0470 million\n\nin 2020. Fair value losses in the Americas were the main driver. These losses resulted from the macro hedge program net of reserve movements as a result of equity markets movements over the year, and from losses on unhedged risks and unhedged volatility in the Life business.\n\n## Realized gains on investments\n\nRealized gains on investments amounted to EUR/uni00A0150 million in 2020, driven by the Americas and Aegon International./uni00A0These gains reflect normal trading activity and portfolio adjustments to lengthen the duration of the investment portfolio in Aegon International.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Impairment charges\n\nNet impairments of EUR/uni00A0237 million in 2020 were primarily caused by impairments on bonds in the Americas - mainly in the/uni00A0energy and communications sectors - and on the unsecured loan portfolio in the Netherlands./uni00A0\n\n## Other charges\n\nOther charges amounted to EUR 1,239 million in 2020, driven by the Americas. The Americas recorded other charges of EUR 1,110 million in 2020 mainly due to unfavorable impacts from model and assumption changes./uni00A0Assumption changes resulted from a more conservative view on certain economic and non-economic parameters in actuarial models. In addition, the Americas incurred other charges due to a valuation allowance related to the ongoing rehabilitation process of a reinsurer, the restructuring of captives, and a provision for a settlement of class action litigation related to monthly deduction rate adjustments on certain universal life policies./uni00A0For the Holdings, other charges amounted to EUR 130 million and resulted primarily from IFRS 9 / 17 implementation expenses./uni00A0Assumption updates in the Netherlands resulted in other income, which offset restructuring charges in the various units as well as expenses to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulation and a provision related to the resolution of pending litigation, both in the Netherlands.\n\n## Run-off businesses\n\nThe results of run-off businesses increased compared with 2019 to a gain of EUR/uni00A029 million in 2020, which included a onetime benefit./uni00A0\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax was a benefit of EUR/uni00A092 million, mainly as a result of the tax benefit on the net loss in the United States. Furthermore, the tax benefit reflects regular tax exempt income items and the use of tax credits.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses decreased by 2% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A03.9 billion in 2020. This decrease primarily reflects a reduction in expenses resulting from the performance improvement plan and lower pension costs in the Netherlands. Furthermore, expenses benefited from lower travel, marketing, and sales activities due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These were partly offset by higher IFRS 9 / 17 implementation expenses and increased restructuring expenses compared with 2019.\n\n## Production\n\nGross deposits were up by 37% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0199 billion in 2020, mainly driven by higher deposits in Aegon's Chinese joint venture AIFMC. In addition, Aegon witnessed continued momentum in the Netherlands at online bank Knab and Aegon Cappital, the company's Premium Pension Institute selling new style defined contribution pension products. Net outflows during 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A013.8 billion and were primarily due to outflows in the Americas in the Retirement Plan business following contract discontinuances and higher participant withdrawals. Furthermore, the United Kingdom showed net outflows driven by the institutional platform. This was partly offset by net inflows in the Netherlands from its online bank and defined contribution business, and continued net inflows in Asset Management, primarily driven by the strategic partnership AIFMC. New life sales declined by 15% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0731 million in 2020. In the Americas, this was mainly driven by lower Whole Life sales compared with 2019, as a result of the decision to make product changes and sunset certain legacy products. In the Netherlands, this was caused by lower individual life single premium production compared with 2019 as Aegon exited that market in March 2020, and lower recurring premium pension sales compared with 2019 due to the low interest rate environment. In Aegon International, new life sales decreased compared with 2019 due to the continuing challenging market circumstances and the COVID-19 lockdown. New premium production for Accident & Health and property & casualty insurance decreased by 13% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0312 million in 2020, as 2019 included a single large disability contract in the United States. The remaining decline results largely from the decision to exit the individual Medicare supplement market in the United States.\n\n## Capital management\n\nDuring 2020, shareholders' equity increased by EUR/uni00A00.4 billion to EUR/uni00A022.8 billion, as lower interest rates and their impact on the revaluation reserve more than offset the adverse impact of currency movements. Aegon's shareholders' equity, excluding revaluation reserves, non-controlling interests and share options not yet exercised amounted to EUR/uni00A015.5 billion on December 31, 2020, or EUR/uni00A07.45 per common share.\n\nGross financial leverage improved to EUR/uni00A06.0 billion on December 31, 2020, compared with EUR/uni00A06.7 billion at the end of 2019, which was mostly the result of the repayment of USD 500 million senior debt in December 2020. Cash capital at the holding declined from EUR/uni00A01.2 billion at the end of 2019 to EUR/uni00A01.1 billion at the end of 2020. Free Cash Flows amounted to EUR/uni00A0530 million for 2020. These Free Cash Flows were used to reduce leverage and pay dividends to Aegon's shareholders. Capital injections of EUR/uni00A0201 million mainly related to the expansion of Aegon's life and non-life insurance partnership with Banco Santander following its acquisition of Banco Popular, and more than offset EUR/uni00A0153 million proceeds from the sale of Aegon's stake in joint/uni00A0ventures in Japan.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nOn December 31, 2020, Aegon's estimated Solvency II ratio amounted to 196%, down from 201% at the end of 2019. This decrease was driven by adverse market movements triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the inclusion of Aegon Bank in the calculation of the Group Solvency II ratio in accordance with industry-wide guidelines from the Dutch Central Bank. The estimated RBC ratio in the United States decreased to 432% on December 31, 2020, from 470% on December 31, 2019. This resulted from the adverse impact from market movements, in particular lower interest rates, and dividend payments to the US intermediate holding company. These more than offset the benefit from management actions, including the sale of the Transamerica Pyramid. The estimated Solvency II ratio of the Dutch Life business at the end of 2020\n\namounted to 159%, down from 164% at the end of 2019. The decline reflects Aegon's decision to lower the factor applied when calculating the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes (LAC-DT) from 65% to 45%, increased investments in corporate credits and volatility in the separate account business. The estimated Solvency II ratio for Scottish Equitable PLC amounted to 156% at the end of 2020, up from 148% at the end of 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the update of the expense assumptions in the second half of 2020, reflecting the benefit of cost reduction initiatives. This more than offset adverse market variances, driven mostly by lower interest rates. The capital ratios as disclosed in this section represent Aegon's estimates, are not final until filed with the regulator, and are subject to supervisory review.",

Underlying earnings before tax decreased by 26% compared with 2019 to USD/uni00A0936/uni00A0million in 2020 mainly caused by the impact of lower interest rates, adverse mortality experience in the Life business, which was in part attributable to COVID-19, and lower fee income from outflows in Retirement Plans. Gross deposits decreased to USD 43.2 billion in 2020 compared with USD 45.2 billion in 2019, as higher gross deposits in Mutual Funds were more than offset by lower gross deposits in Retirement Plans and Variable Annuities. New life sales declined by 8% to USD 433 million in 2020 compared with USD 469 million in 2019 due to lower Whole Life sales, which more than offset increased term life and Indexed Universal Life sales. New premium production for Accident & Health insurance was down 21% compared with 2019 to USD 154 million in 2020, reflecting the strategic decision to exit the individual Medicare supplement market and the sale of a single large disability contract in 2019.\n\n## Net income\n\nAegon's businesses in the Americas reported a net loss of USD 611 million in 2020 compared with a net income of USD 1.3 billion in 2019. The decline in net result was largely driven by lower underlying earnings, one-time impacts from assumptions changes, net impairments, and COVID-19 pandemic related market impacts on fair value items. Underlying earnings before tax in 2020 of USD 936 million decreased by 26% compared with 2019. Results on fair value items amounted to a loss of USD 576 million in 2020, which was primarily related to the following items:\n\n- \u25a0 Hedges without an accounting match under IFRS resulted in a loss of USD 468 million. This was driven by the macro hedge program net of reserve movements as a result of equity markets movements over the year, and losses on unhedged risks and unhedged volatility in Indexed Universal Life.\n- \u25a0 Fair value investments amounted to a loss of USD 156 million, mainly driven by a USD 71 million mark-to-market loss from valuation updates related to the/uni00A0Pyramid building complex in San Francisco, and underperformance of credit derivatives due to credit spread widening, partly offset by alternative investments in limited partnerships with energy exposure outperforming long-term expected return.\n- \u25a0 The result on fair value hedges with an accounting match amounted to a gain of USD 47 million caused by gains on unhedged risks.\n\nRealized gains on investments were USD 106 million resulting from normal trading activity in a low interest rates environment. Net impairments amounted to a loss of USD 166 million, reflecting corporate bond impairments\n\nmainly in the energy and communications sectors, partly offset by recoveries on residential mortgage backed securities. Income before tax from run-off businesses in 2020 was a profit of USD 33 million, which included a one-time benefit. Other charges of USD 1.3 billion in 2020 were composed of a charge related to assumption changes of USD 919 million, a valuation allowance of USD 143 million related to the ongoing rehabilitation process of a reinsurer, USD 128 million one-time charges for the restructuring of captives, a USD 64 million provision for a settlement of class action litigation related to monthly deduction rate adjustments on certain universal life policies, and by other restructuring and transformation charges. This was partly offset by a one-time gain of USD 81 million related to the closure of a separate account stable value product that had been shrinking steadily due to the availability of more attractive proprietary product offerings with higher margins in the Retirement Plan business. The charge related to assumption changes were made following the annual assumption review, leading to/uni00A0changes in certain economic and non-economic parameters in actuarial models. Firstly, from a prudent lowering of the long-term interest rate assumption from 4.25% to 2.75% while maintaining the 10-year grading period, this included the related separate account bond return assumption adjustment. Secondly, assumptions in the Life business were reviewed, primarily related to Universal Life premium persistency and mortality rates. Thirdly, assumptions for the Long-Term Care book were set more conservatively, including halving of the morbidity improvement assumption. Finally, also mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions in the Variable and Fixed Annuity business were adjusted.",

USD 121 million of these claims can specifically be attributed to COVID-19 as a direct cause of death, and part of the remaining adverse mortality experience is likely attributable to the pandemic as well. Adverse persistency in 2020 was USD 45 million, mainly from Term Life policies. Lower interest rates and changes in the asset portfolio drove unfavorable intangible adjustments of USD 145 million. Furthermore, low interest rates led to a reduction in investment income partly compensated by higher investment volumes.\n- \u25a0 Accident & Health underlying earnings before tax increased by 50% to USD 360 million in 2020 compared with USD 241 million in 2019, mainly due to favorable morbidity experience of USD 167 million, mostly related to the closed block of Long-Term Care insurance and impacts to it of/uni00A0the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u25a0 Retirement Plans underlying earnings before tax were down 41% to USD 95 million in 2020 compared with USD 160 million in 2019. This resulted mainly from/uni00A0lower fees from outflows, partly compensated by stronger equity market performance in 2020 compared to 2019.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Mutual Funds declined from USD 37 million in 2019 to USD 30 million in 2020. This was caused by higher commissions payments from increased sales, and non-recurrence of one-time income item/uni00A0in 2019.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Variable Annuities increased by 6% to USD 448 million in 2020 compared with USD 423 million in 2019, driven by higher investment income on reserves, and higher fees as a result of favorable equity market performance, partly offset by net outflows.\n- \u25a0 Fixed Annuity underlying earnings before tax decreased by 54% compared with 2019 to USD 51 million in 2020, mainly due to the impact of lower interest rates and lower account balances.\n\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Stable Value Solutions amounted to USD 80 million in 2020 compared with USD 85 million in 2019 caused by margin pressure in a competitive market.\n- \u25a0 Latin America reported/uni00A0lower underlying earnings before tax with USD 11 million in 2020 compared to USD 15 million in 2019, reflecting currency exchange rate changes and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially compensated by an increase in premiums and sales in Brazil./uni00A0\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses increased by 2% compared with 2019 to USD 1.8 billion in 2020 reflecting/uni00A0investments in customer service, increased spend for technology, an increase in restructuring charges, and contractually pre-agreed increases in administration expense associated with the operations administration partnerships. This was partly offset by expense savings initiatives and lower expenses for travel, marketing, and sales activities due to COVID-19 related restrictions and cancellations.\n\n## Production\n\nGross deposits decreased to USD 43.2 billion in 2020 compared with USD 45.2 billion in 2019, as higher gross deposits in Mutual funds and Fixed Annuities were more than offset by lower gross deposits in Retirement Plans, Variable Annuities, and from Latin America. Net outflows amounted to USD 20.5 billion in 2020, mainly caused by Retirement Plans due to a number of large contract discontinuances and participant withdrawals. Variable Annuities and Fixed Annuities saw outflows as these books mature./uni00A0\n\nNew life sales declined by 8% to USD 433 million in 2020 compared with USD 469 million in 2019./uni00A0Term Life pricing actions taken in late 2019 helped to improve sales, but were more than offset by lower Whole Life sales as a result of the decision to make product changes and sunset certain legacy products. Indexed Universal Life sales increased benefitting from changes in non-medical underwriting guidelines and increased sales at World Financial Group. New premium production for Accident & Health insurance was down 21% compared with 2019 to USD 154 million in 2020, reflecting the strategic decision to exit the individual Medicare supplement market and the sale of a single large disability contract in 2019.",

This/uni00A0was primarily driven by fair value losses in 2019 due to an increase in the Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) deficit driven by credit spread movements that did not reoccur in/uni00A02020. Underlying earnings before tax increased by 3% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0665 million in 2020 as expense savings across all segments and higher earnings in/uni00A0the Banking and the Service businesses more than offset underwriting results in the/uni00A0Life and Non-Life businesses.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income amounted to EUR/uni00A0561 million in 2020, driven by underlying earnings before tax of EUR/uni00A0665 million. The result from fair value items was a gain of EUR/uni00A050 million in 2020 whereas in 2019 a loss of EUR/uni00A0365 million was recorded, primarily as the result from an increase in the LAT deficit./uni00A0The 2020 fair value items included/uni00A0a EUR/uni00A0950 million gain on interest rate hedges. This gain was driven by lower interest rates and was an offset against the negative impact of lower interest rates on the LAT deficit, for which in total fair value losses of EUR/uni00A01.1 billion were recorded in 2020./uni00A0Fair value items in 2020 furthermore included a gain on investments of EUR/uni00A086 million and a gain on the guarantee provision of EUR/uni00A0144 million, mainly due to an increase of the own credit spread used to discount liabilities./uni00A0Net impairment charges amounted to EUR/uni00A049 million and mainly related to the Bank's unsecured loan portfolio and the impairment of an associate company of Aegon./uni00A0Other income in 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A078 million, and was driven by a positive impact from assumption updates. This was partly offset by restructuring charges for various initiatives to make the organization more efficient and effective as well as expenses to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulation, and a provision related to the resolution of pending litigation./uni00A0Income tax in 2020 amounted to a charge of EUR/uni00A0197 million, while income before tax was EUR/uni00A0758 million in 2020, resulting in an effective tax rate on income before tax of 26.0%. The effective tax rate reflects the fact that the Dutch nominal tax rate will remain at 25% as from 2021, resulting in a reversal of earlier impacts from the previously anticipated lowering of the tax rate to 21.7%./uni00A0\n\n## Underlying earnings before tax\n\nUnderlying earnings before tax from Aegon's operations in the Netherlands increased by 3% compared with 2019 to EUR 665 million compared with the first half of 2019.\n\n- \u25a0 Life earnings declined by 6%/uni00A0compared with 2019 to EUR 466 million in 2020, largely due to higher reinsurance costs following the longevity reinsurance transaction in December 2019/uni00A0as well as/uni00A0the negative impact from a change in the treatment of longevity and mortality results in underlying results./uni00A0These drivers were partly offset by lower operating expenses, driven by the impact of moving from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan for the future pension accrual of Aegon's own employees, and by higher investment margins, partly as a result of increasing the allocation to corporate credit within the investment portfolio.\n- \u25a0 Earnings from Non-life decreased by 59%/uni00A0compared with 2019 to EUR 13/uni00A0million in 2020./uni00A0One-time effects were the main driver. In 2020, an additional provision of EUR 14 million was set up for disability insurance, while 2019 contained a favorable one-time reserve release of EUR 12 million. These one-time effects more than offset the favorable impact from better claims experience for sick leave and lower pension costs.\n- \u25a0 Banking earnings rose by 10% compared with 2019/uni00A0to EUR 113/uni00A0million in 2020, driven by higher fee income and lower operating expenses due to/uni00A0lower pension costs.\n- \u25a0 Earnings from the Service business increased to EUR 74/uni00A0million in 2020 from EUR 18 million in 2019, driven by lower operating expenses, due to expense savings and lower pension costs, as well as higher fee income, reflecting portfolio growth.",

This was partly offset by higher restructuring expenses.\n\n## Production\n\nGross deposits increased by 24% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A016.4 billion in 2020, driven by continued momentum at online bank Knab and Aegon Cappital, the company's Premium Pension Institute selling new style defined contribution pension products. Net deposits increased by 22% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A01.8 billion in 2020, reflecting increases at both online bank Knab and Aegon Cappital. Compared with 2019, new life\n\nsales decreased by 33% to EUR/uni00A092 million in 2020, caused by lower individual life single premium production as Aegon exited that market in March 2020, and lower recurring premium pension sales due to the low interest rate environment. Furthermore, sales in 2019 were elevated arising from a pension buy-out, as well as higher sales from a purchase of additional yearly pension increases by an existing customer./uni00A0New premium production for accident and health insurance was up by 5% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A016 million in 2020, resulting from increased disability sales. New premium production for property & casualty insurance increased by 22% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A015 million in 2020. This was driven by better commercial momentum in all product lines except for travel insurance, where COVID-19 had a negative impact.",

The improvement is driven by the non-recurrence of fair value losses on hedges that impacted the 2019 results. Underlying earnings before tax in 2020 amounted to GBP 128 million which is an increase of GBP 6 million compared with 2019, and was driven by higher underlying earnings before tax from the Digital Solutions business.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income in 2020 amounted to GBP 60 million, as underlying earnings before tax were partially offset by Other charges. Underlying earnings before tax rose by 5% compared with 2019 to GBP 128 million in 2020./uni00A0Other charges amounted to GBP 61 million and included transition and conversion charges related to the agreement with Atos for administration services related to the Existing Business, charges for the Cofunds integration, and impairments of intangibles related to the Cofunds acquisition in 2017 and related to Stonebridge, following the announced sale of the business./uni00A0There was a partial offset from income related to policyholder taxes, which were fully offset by higher income taxes. Income before tax in 2020 amounted to GBP 66 million and the income tax amounted to GBP 6 million. The latter includes a charge related to the aforementioned policyholder taxes.\n\n## Underlying earnings before tax\n\nUnderlying earnings before tax rose by 5% compared with 2019 to GBP 128 million in 2020.\n\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Digital Solutions increased to GBP 45 million in 2020, from GBP 36/uni00A0million in 2019. This was mainly/uni00A0driven by higher fee income from platform assets, reflecting growth in the Workplace channel, and lower expenses./uni00A0Lower earnings from the protection and distribution business were a partial offset, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from/uni00A0the Existing Business declined by 4% compared with 2019 to GBP 82 million in 2020, due to the gradual run-off of the underlying portfolios despite an improvement in persistency in the unit-linked and traditional pension portfolios./uni00A0This was in part/uni00A0offset by favorable mortality experience in the retained annuity portfolio.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses amounted to GBP 406 million in 2020, which was a decrease of 13% compared with 2019. This decrease was driven by both lower restructuring expenses and expense savings.\n\n## Production\n\nGross deposits decreased by 11% compared with 2019 to GBP 7.6 billion in 2020. This was driven mostly by the institutional business, which can be lumpy and has low margins. Gross deposits for other channels were broadly in line with 2019 despite headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic./uni00A0Net outflows amounted to GBP 3.2 billion compared with GBP 3.1 billion in 2019. Net outflows were driven mainly by the institutional business. The Workplace platform showed positive net deposits and while for the Retail platform net outflows were recorded in 2020, an improvement was shown compared with 2019./uni00A0New life sales decreased by 18% compared with 2019 to GBP 30 million in 2020, reflecting the impact on protection sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

An increase in underlying earnings before tax and realized gains on investments was offset by higher impairments and other charges for 2020 compared with 2019./uni00A0Fair value items amounted to a loss of EUR/uni00A01 million in 2020. Realized gains on investments increased from EUR/uni00A036 million in 2019 to EUR/uni00A046 million in 2020. Realized gains in 2020 were driven by asset sales in TLB in order to lengthen the duration of the investment portfolio and normal trading activity. Net impairments of EUR/uni00A016 million were the result of bankruptcies and restructurings in TLB's asset portfolio and a write-off of a stake in an e-broker investment.\n\nOther charges amounted to EUR/uni00A01 million in 2020. Included in this is a EUR/uni00A053 million gain on the sale of Aegon's stake in the variable annuity joint ventures in Japan. This was mostly offset by the charge resulting from the lowering of the longterm interest rate assumption in TLB, a software impairment in Hungary and restructuring charges. In addition, there were other charges related to the expansion of the joint ventures in Spain and a recapture of reinsurance blocks./uni00A0Income tax in 2020 was EUR/uni00A022 million, a decrease of EUR/uni00A011 million compared with 2019. This decrease was due to a benefit from a change in the taxation of commission payments.\n\n## Underlying earnings before tax\n\nUnderlying earnings before tax from International amounted to EUR 156 million in 2020, which was EUR 12 million or 8% higher compared with 2019. Higher earnings in Spain and Portugal and lower losses in the Other segment more than offset lower results at TLB.\n\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Spain and Portugal were EUR 53/uni00A0million, which was/uni00A028%/uni00A0higher compared with 2019. This was driven by the ongoing growth of the life portfolio in the joint ventures, as well as better technical results, mainly due to fewer health insurance claims because of the lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u25a0 TLB, the high-net-worth business, recorded underlying earnings before tax of EUR 49 million, a decrease of EUR 15 million compared with 2019. This was mostly caused by adverse mortality experience. Lower sales and/uni00A0the impact of lower interest rates also had a negative impact on earnings which was partly offset by expense savings and higher surrender benefits.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Hungary/uni00A0increased by 6% compared with 2019 to EUR 46 million in 2020. This was the result of business growth and increased underwriting results in non-life.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from China increased by 23% compared with 2019 to EUR 18 million in 2020. The/uni00A0increase was the result of ongoing growth of in-force business.\n- \u25a0 For the Others segment, the result improved to a loss of EUR 10/uni00A0million, an/uni00A0EUR 8/uni00A0million increase compared with 2019. This was mainly due to expense savings in the business and synergies realized. Another factor was the sale of Aegon's 50% stake in the loss-making variable annuity joint ventures in Japan, which closed in January 2020.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses in 2020 decreased by 6% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0400 million. They benefitted from expense savings as well as pandemic induced lower sales and marketing efforts. The lower operating expenses also benefitted from the sale of Aegon's stake in the Japanese joint ventures and the depreciation of the Hungarian Forint. Combined these more than offset an increase in operating expenses in China caused by higher personnel costs as a result of business growth./uni00A0",

This/uni00A0was driven by increased underlying earnings before tax in Strategic Partnerships and fair value gains on investments. Supported by continued net inflows from Strategic Partnerships, Asset Management achieved positive external third-party net inflows for the ninth consecutive year. Net flows in external third-party asset management amounted to EUR 5.9 billion in 2020. Net flows decreased by 14% compared with 2019 driven by Global Platforms, which was mainly attributable to redemptions as a result of the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income increased by 56% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0151 million in 2020. This was driven by higher underlying earnings before tax and fair value gains on investments of EUR/uni00A022 million in 2020.\n\n## Underlying earnings before tax\n\nUnderlying earnings before tax increased by 31% compared with 2019 to EUR 182 million in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by the performance of Aegon's Chinese asset management joint venture, AIFMC. This more than offset lower underlying earnings before tax in Aegon's Global Platforms in 2020 compared with 2019.\n\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Strategic Partnerships increased to EUR 136 million in 2020 compared with EUR 69 million in 2019. This was mainly driven by higher performance fees, net of performance-based compensation, in AIFMC in 2020.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings before tax from Global Platforms decreased to EUR 43 million in 2020 compared with EUR 62 million in 2019. This was mainly caused by lower management fees for the Fixed Income Platform, in part driven by outflows. Earnings growth in the Dutch Mortgage Fund and asset backed securities were a partial offset.\n- \u25a0 Underlying earnings from the Other segment decreased to EUR 3 million in 2020 compared with EUR 8 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly driven by/uni00A0performance fees in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses increased by 9% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0485 million in 2020. The increase mainly stems from higher performance-based compensation in AIFMC and higher expenses driven by AIFMC's business growth./uni00A0For Global Platforms, expenses reduced, as lower personnel and travel expenses more than offset higher investments in IT. The cost/ income ratio in 2020 decreased by 5% compared with 2019 as higher management and performance fees more than offset performance-based compensation.\n\n## Production\n\nExternal third-party gross inflows increased by 67% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0135 billion in 2020./uni00A0This increase resulted from higher gross inflows in Strategic Partnerships, which increased by EUR/uni00A051 billion in 2020. This was driven by new fund launches at AIFMC in 2020, and inflows into existing AIFMC funds as a result of increased investor confidence throughout 2020. Global Platform recorded gross flows of EUR/uni00A019.4 billion in 2020, which was an increase of EUR/uni00A03.4 billion compared with 2019, mainly through the Fixed Income Platform.\n\n2020 was the ninth consecutive full year of positive external third-party net inflows for Asset Management. Net external third-party inflows decreased by 14% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A05.9 billion in 2020. The decrease of net inflows was driven by Global Platforms./uni00A0The decrease in net inflows is mainly attributed to redemptions in the Fixed Income and Fiduciary Services & Multi Management Platforms as a result of the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net deposits from Strategic Partnerships increased compared with 2019 driven by continued net inflows at AIFMC.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nAssets under management increased by 10% compared with 2019 to EUR/uni00A0388 billion in 2020. This was driven by favorable market movements, as markets saw an increase due to monetary stimulus and positive news flows on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Third-party net inflows contributed as well to the increase in assets under management./uni00A0\n\nFurthermore, a transaction involving Aegon's asset management joint venture with La Banque Postale added to the increase in assets under management. La Banque Postale Asset Management has combined its fixed-income and insurance asset management with Natixis' subsidiary Ostrum Asset Management. Aegon's share in the underlying earnings before tax of its asset management joint venture with La Banque Postale remains unchanged. However, Aegon's share in terms of assets under management increased by EUR/uni00A010 billion.",

Refer to note 2.1.2 Voluntary changes in accounting policies for details about this change.\n- 3 Mandatory change in accounting policy in 2019 mainly due to impact of adopting IFRS 16 on Leases. A modified retrospective approach was applied and therefore prior periods were not restated.\n\nRemea-",

Aegon N.V. serves as the holding company for the Aegon Group and has listings of its common shares in Amsterdam and New York.\n\nAegon N.V. (or 'the Company') and its subsidiaries ('Aegon' or 'the Group') have life insurance and pensions operations in/uni00A0more than 20 countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia and are also active in savings and asset management operations, accident and health insurance, general insurance and to a limited extent banking operations. Headquarters are located in The Hague, the Netherlands. The Group employs over/uni00A022,000 people worldwide (2019:/uni00A0over 23,000).\n\n## 2 Significant accounting policies 2.1 Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of (investment) properties and those financial instruments (including derivatives) and financial liabilities that have been measured at fair value. Information on the standards and interpretations that were adopted in 2020 is provided below in note/uni00A02.1.1. Aegon also adopted voluntary changes in accounting policies, effective January 1, 2020, disclosed in note/uni00A02.1.2. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise stated. The consequence is that the rounded amounts may not add up to the rounded total in all cases. All ratios and variances are calculated using the underlying amount rather than the rounded amount./uni00A0\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS-EU requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates. Included among the material (or potentially material) reported amounts and disclosures that require extensive use of estimates are: fair value of certain invested assets and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired and other purchased intangible assets, goodwill, policyholder claims and benefits, insurance guarantees, pension plans, income taxes and the potential effects of resolving litigation matters. Aegon applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging) under the European Union (EU) 'carve out' of IFRS-EU. Details are provided in note/uni00A02.9/uni00A0Derivatives and note/uni00A024 Derivatives.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Aegon N.V. were approved by the Executive Board and by the Supervisory Board on March/uni00A017, 2021. The financial statements will be put for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on/uni00A0June 3, 2021. The shareholders' meeting can decide not to adopt the financial statements but cannot amend them.\n\n## 2.1.1 Adoption of new IFRS-EU accounting standards and amendments effective in 2020\n\nNew standards and amendments to standards become effective at the date specified by IFRS-EU, but may allow companies to opt for an earlier adoption date. In 2020, the following amendments to existing standards issued by the IASB became mandatory:\n\n| Accounting standard/ amendment/ interpretation                         | IASB effective date   | Endorsed by EU   | Impact for Aegon   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3)                        | January 1, 2020       | Yes              | Low                |\n| Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)                 | January 1, 2020       | Yes              | Low                |\n| Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards | January 1, 2020       | Yes              | Low                |\n| Early adopted:                                                         |                       |                  |                    |\n| COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16)               | June 1 , 2020         | Yes              | Low                |\n\nNone of these amendments to existing standards are significantly impacting the financial position or the consolidated financial statements.",

A deferred cost of reinsurance is established when Aegon enters into a reinsurance transaction, except for reinsurance transactions that are entered into as part of a plan to exit a business.\n\nUnder the previous accounting policy, the amortization of the deferred cost of reinsurance is based solely on assumptions relating to the underlying insurance contracts. Under the new accounting policy, for products sold in the Americas and Asia where the amortization is based on expected gross profit margins (EGPs), these EGPs are net of reinsurance (i.e., net of actual reinsurance cash flows that exceed expected reinsurance cash flows). Additionally, the reinsurance cash flows used to calculate the amortization rate are unlocked prospectively. The accounting policy on the amortization of similar intangibles, such as deferred policy acquisition costs, are updated accordingly.\n\nThe new policy was adopted because it better reflects the economics of Aegon's reinsurance transactions and aligns to current market practice. The previous accounting policy would have resulted in significant income volatility in the event of incurred claims with large sums insured, despite the fact that a significant part of the losses is reinsured.\n\nImpact of the adjustment on previous periods is provided in the following tables, including references to the notes that are impacted by the change in accounting policy.\n\n| Impact of voluntary changes in  accounting policies on the  consolidated/uni00A0income statement   | Note   | December  31, 2019  (as previously  reported)  1)   | Change in  accounting  policy related  to Reinsurance  Accounting   | December  31, 2019  (restated)   | December  31, 2018  (as previously  reported)  1)   | Change in  accounting  policy related  to Reinsurance  Accounting   | December  31, 2018  (restated)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Income from reinsurance ceded                                                                      | 9      | 3,532                                               | 54                                                                  | 3,586                            | 3,740                                               | 52                                                                  | 3,791                            |\n| Policyholder claims and benefits                                                                   | 12     | 56,797                                              | 58                                                                  | 56,856                           | 10,557                                              | 57                                                                  | 10,614                           |\n| Commissions and expenses                                                                           | 14     | 6,153                                               | (1)                                                                 | 6,153                            | 6,224                                               | -

IFRS 9 combines classification and measurement, the expected credit loss impairment model and hedge accounting. The standard replaces IAS 39 and all previous versions of IFRS 9. Under IFRS 9 Classification and Measurement, financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, based on both the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics. The classification and measurement of financial liabilities is unchanged from existing requirements apart from own credit risk. For financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss, the changes which are attributable to the change in an entity's own credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income, unless doing so would enlarge or create an accounting mismatch. For the impairment component, the IASB included requirements for a credit loss allowance or provision which should be based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.\n\nApplication of IFRS 9 is required for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. However, on May 18, 2017, the IASB published the final version of the IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts standard. Prior to its finalization, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (the predecessor standard to IFRS 17) that provides for a qualifying insurer a temporary exemption that permits, but does not require, the insurer to apply IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement rather than IFRS 9 for annual periods beginning before January 1, 2021 (i.e., a temporary exemption of IFRS 9). The objective of the amendment is to address the temporary accounting consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17./uni00A0This amendment was endorsed by the European Union in November 2017.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the IASB decided, next to a number of significant amendments to the Standard and subject to EU endorsement process, to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As a consequence of the IFRS 17 deferral, the IASB also agreed to revise the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 in IFRS 4 to allow entities to continue applying the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 until January 1, 2023.\n\nAn entity is eligible to apply the temporary exemption if the carrying amount of its liabilities connected with insurance activities is\n\n- \u25a0 Greater than 90% of the total carrying value of all liabilities; or\n- \u25a0 Between 80%/uni00A0and 90% of the total carrying value of all its liabilities, and the insurer does not have significant activities unrelated to insurance.\n\nAegon performed this analysis at December 31, 2015, and concluded that it meets the requirements for the temporary exception as 94% of its liabilities are connected with insurance activities. As a result, Aegon elected to make use of the temporary exemption of IFRS 9.",

An implementation project was started in 2017 and is combined with the implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.\n\nBy qualifying for and electing the temporary exemption, the IFRS 4 amendment requires certain additional disclosures; specifically, Aegon is required to disclose information to enable users of financial statements to compare insurers applying the temporary exemption with entities applying IFRS 9. This information is presented below:\n\n## Fair value changes\n\nThe table below presents an overview of the fair value of the classes of financial assets as of December 31, 2020, as well as the change in fair value during the reporting period.

The Standard will replace IFRS 4, which was intended as an interim solution and allowed insurers to continue to use accounting principles that they had applied prior to the initial adoption of IFRS. IFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with discretionary participating features issued. The objective of the Standard is to ensure that entities provide relevant information in a way that faithfully represents those contracts. This information should provide users of financial statements with a basis to assess the effects that the contracts have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the insurer. The Standard also specifies presentation and disclosure requirements to enhance comparability between insurance companies.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the IASB decided, next to a number of significant amendments to the Standard and subject to EU endorsement process, to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As a consequence of the IFRS 17 deferral, the IASB also agreed to revise the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 in IFRS 4 to allow entities to continue applying the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 until January 1, 2023.",

Early adoption of the standard is therefore not expected. An implementation project was started soon after the publication of the new Standard./uni00A0Based on the final/uni00A0amendments/uni00A0of June 2020 quantitative/uni00A0assessments are performed and expected to continue during 2021. The outcome of these quantitative assessments will form the basis for final methodology and policy choices. The impact of the initial application on Aegon's financial statements is expected to be significant.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn 2019, Aegon elected to early adopt the 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)' issued in September 2019. In accordance with the transition provisions, the Phase 1 amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed on January 1, 2019 or were designated thereafter. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements, thereby ensuring that uncertainty on the outcome of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR reform) does not result in early termination of hedge accounting, notably because the retrospective effectiveness may fall outside of the required range due to the IBOR reform.\n\nPlease refer to note/uni00A024 Derivatives for the required disclosures of the uncertainty arising from IBOR reform for hedging relationships for which the Group applied the reliefs.\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued the 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)', which address issues that might affect financial reporting during the IBOR reform, including the effects of changes to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships arising from the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate. The Phase 2 amendments have no impact for the Group in 2020. Aegon continues to follow the developments of IBOR reform, and will assess the impact for the Group when further information becomes available.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Aegon N.V. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries (including consolidated structured entities) are entities over which Aegon has control. Aegon controls an entity when Aegon is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The assessment of control is based on the substance of the relationship between the Group and the entity and, among other things, considers existing and potential voting rights that are substantive. For a right to be substantive, the holder must have the practical ability to exercise that right.\n\nThe subsidiary's assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value on the acquisition date and are subsequently accounted for in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, which is consistent with IFRS-EU. Intra-group transactions, including Aegon N.V. shares held by subsidiaries, which are recognized as treasury shares in equity, are eliminated. Intra-group losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests are initially stated at their share in the fair value of the net assets on the acquisition date and subsequently adjusted for the non-controlling share in changes in the subsidiary's equity.\n\nThe excess of the consideration paid to acquire the interest and the fair value of any interest already owned, over the Group's share in the net fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill. Negative goodwill is recognized directly in the income statement. If the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in the business combination has been determined provisionally, adjustments to these values resulting from the emergence of new evidence within 12 months after the acquisition date are made against goodwill. Aegon recognized contingent considerations either as provision or as financial liability depending on the characteristics. Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are stated at fair value when control is obtained.\n\nSubsidiaries are deconsolidated when control ceases to exist. Any difference between the net proceeds plus the fair value of any retained interest and the carrying amount of the subsidiary including non-controlling interests is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Transactions with non-controlling interests\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners. Therefore disposals to non-controlling interests and acquisitions from non-controlling interests, not resulting in losing or gaining control of the subsidiary are recorded",

Any difference between consideration paid or received and the proportionate share in net assets is accounted for in equity attributable to shareholders of Aegon N.V.\n\n## Investment funds\n\nInvestment funds managed by the Group in which the Group holds an interest are consolidated in the financial statements if the Group has power over that investment fund and it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. In assessing control, all interests held by the Group in the fund are considered, regardless of whether the financial risk related to the investment is borne by the Group or by the policyholders (unless a direct link between the policyholder and the fund can be assumed).\n\nIn determining whether Aegon has power over an investment fund all facts and circumstances are considered, including the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Control structure of the asset manager (i.e. whether an Aegon subsidiary);\n- \u25a0 The investment constraints posed by investment mandate;\n- \u25a0 Legal rights held by the policyholder to the separate assets in the investment vehicle (e.g. policyholders could have the voting rights related to these investments);\n- \u25a0 The governance structure, such as an independent board of directors, representing the policyholders, which has substantive rights (e.g. to elect or remove the asset manager); and\n- \u25a0 Rights held by other parties (e.g. voting rights of policyholders that are substantive or not).\n\nExposure or rights to variability of returns can be the result of, for example:\n\n- \u25a0 General account investment of Aegon;\n- \u25a0 Aegon's investments held for policyholder;\n- \u25a0 Guarantees provided by Aegon on return of policyholders in specific investment vehicles;\n- \u25a0 Fees dependent on fund value (including, but not limited to, asset management fees); and\n- \u25a0 Fees dependent on performance of the fund (including, but not limited to, performance fees).\n\nInvestment funds where Aegon acts as an agent are not consolidated due to lack of control of the funds. In particular, for some separate accounts, the independent board of directors has substantive rights and therefore Aegon does not have power over these separate accounts but acts as an agent.\n\nFor limited partnerships, the assessment takes into account Aegon's legal position (i.e. limited partner or general partner) and any substantive removal rights held by other parties. Professional judgment is applied concerning the substantiveness of the removal rights and the magnitude of the exposure to variable returns, leading to the conclusion that Aegon controls some, but not all, of the limited partnerships in which it participates.\n\nUpon consolidation of an investment fund, a liability is recognized to the extent that the Group is legally obliged to buy back participations held by third parties. The liability is presented in the consolidated financial statements as investment contracts for account of policyholders. Where no repurchase obligation exists, the participations held by third parties are presented as noncontrolling interests in equity. The assets allocated to participations held by third parties or by the Group on behalf of policyholders are presented in the consolidated financial statements as investments for account of policyholders.\n\nEquity instruments issued by the Group that are held by investment funds are eliminated on consolidation. However, the elimination is reflected in equity and not in the measurement of the related financial liabilities towards policyholders or other third parties.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nA structured entity is defined in IFRS 12 as 'An entity that has been designed so that voting rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.' In these instances the tests and indicators to assess control provided by IFRS 10 have more focus on the purpose and design of the investee (with relation to the relevant activities that most significantly affect the structured entity) and the exposure to variable returns, which for structured entities lies in interests through e.g. derivatives, and will not be focused on entities that are controlled by voting rights.\n\nStructured entities that are consolidated include certain mortgage backed securitization deals, where Aegon was involved in the design of the structured entities and also has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the investee's returns. Other factors that contribute to the conclusion that consolidation of these entities is required includes consideration of whether Aegon fully services",

Management must be committed to the sale, which is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\nUpon classification as held for sale, the carrying amount of the disposal group (or group of assets) is compared to their fair value less cost to sell. If the fair value less cost to sell is lower than the carrying value, this expected loss is recognized through a reduction of the carrying value of any goodwill related to the disposal group or the carrying value of certain other non-current, non-financial assets to the extent that the carrying value of those assets exceeds their fair value. Any excess of the expected loss over the reduction of the carrying amount of these relevant assets is not recognized upon classification as held for sale, but is recognized as part of the result on disposal if and when a divestment transaction occurs.\n\nClassification into or out of held for sale does not result in restating comparative amounts in the statement of financial position.\n\n## 2.3 Foreign exchange translation\n\n## a. Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. Items included in the financial statements of individual group companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n\nAt the reporting date, monetary assets and monetary liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the closing rate of exchange prevailing on that date, except for own equity instruments in foreign currencies which are translated using historical exchange rates. Non-monetary items carried at cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, while assets carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognized in the income statement when they arise, except when they are deferred in other comprehensive income as a result of a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge. Exchange differences on non-monetary items carried at fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income or the income statement, consistently with other gains and losses on these items.\n\n## b. Translation of foreign currency operations\n\nOn consolidation, the financial statements of group entities with a foreign functional currency are translated to euro, the currency in which the consolidated financial statements are presented. Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rates on the reporting date. Income, expenses and capital transactions (such as dividends) are translated at average exchange rates or at the prevailing rates on the transaction date, if more appropriate. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are translated at the closing rates on the reporting date.\n\nThe resulting exchange differences are recognized in the 'foreign currency translation reserve', which is part of shareholders' equity. On disposal of a foreign entity the related cumulative exchange differences included in the reserve are recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 2.4 Segment reporting\n\nReporting segments and segment measures are explained and disclosed in note/uni00A05 Segment information.\n\n## 2.5 Offsetting of assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and has the intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis or simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterpart.",

Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is recognized as an intangible asset for interests in subsidiaries and is measured as the positive difference between the acquisition cost and the Group's interest in the net fair value of the entity's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Subsequently, goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges. It is derecognized when the interest in the subsidiary is disposed.\n\n## b. Value of business acquired\n\nWhen a portfolio of insurance contracts is acquired, whether directly from another insurance company or as part of a business combination, the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the insurance liabilities is recognized as value of business acquired (VOBA). The Group also recognizes VOBA when it acquires a portfolio of investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nVOBA is amortized over the useful life of the acquired contracts, based on either the expected future premiums, revenues or the expected gross profit margins. The amortization period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date; any change in estimates is recorded in the income statement. For all products, VOBA, in conjunction with deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) where appropriate, is assessed for recoverability using aggregation levels on a geographical jurisdiction basis or at the level of portfolio of contracts that are subject to broadly similar risks and managed together as a single portfolio. The portion determined not to be recoverable is charged to the income statement. VOBA is considered in the liability adequacy test for each reporting period, for more details refer to 2.19.f Liability adequacy testing.\n\nWhen unrealized gains or losses arise on available-for-sale assets backing the insurance liabilities, VOBA is adjusted to equal the effect that the realization of the gains or losses (through a sale or impairment) would have had on VOBA. The adjustment is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity. VOBA is derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.\n\n## c. Future servicing rights\n\nOn the acquisition of a portfolio of investment contracts without discretionary participation features under which Aegon will render investment management services, the present value of future servicing rights is recognized as an intangible asset. Future servicing rights can also be recognized on the sale of a loan portfolio or the acquisition of insurance agency activities.\n\nThe present value of the future servicing rights is amortized over the servicing period and is subject to impairment testing. It is derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.\n\nWhere applicable, Aegon recognizes other intangibles on the acquisition of a business combination such as those related to customer relationships./uni00A0This can include customer contracts, distribution agreements and client portfolios. For these intangibles the present value of future cash flows are recognized and amortized in the period when future economic benefits arise from these intangibles. These intangible assets are also presented under future servicing rights.\n\n## d. Software and other intangible assets\n\nSoftware and other intangible assets are recognized to the extent that the assets can be identified, are controlled by the Group, are expected to provide future economic benefits and can be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize internally generated intangible assets arising from research or internally generated goodwill, brands, customer lists and similar items.\n\nSoftware and other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation of the asset is over its useful life as the future economic benefits emerge and is recognized in the income statement as an expense. The depreciation period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date, with any changes recognized in the income statement.\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognized when it is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.",

Financial assets, excluding derivatives\n\nFinancial assets are recognized at trade date (except for Private placements that are recognized at settlement date) when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. All financial assets are classified for accounting purposes depending on the characteristics of the instruments and the purpose for which they were purchased.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe following financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss: financial assets held for trading, financial assets managed on a fair value basis in accordance with the Group's investment strategy and financial assets containing an embedded derivative that is not closely related and that cannot be reliably bifurcated. In addition, in certain instances the Group designates financial assets to this category when by doing so a potential accounting mismatch in the financial statements is eliminated or significantly reduced.\n\nFinancial assets with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend to sell in the near future are classified as loans. Those for which the holder may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than because of credit deterioration, are accounted for as available-for-sale.\n\nAll remaining non-derivative financial assets are classified as available-for-sale.\n\n## Measurement\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable incremental transaction costs.\n\nLoans and financial assets held-to-maturity are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement as incurred. Available-for-sale assets are recorded at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. Financial assets that are designated as hedged items are measured in accordance with the requirements for hedge accounting.\n\n## Amortized cost\n\nThe amortized cost of a debt instrument is the amount at which it is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortized cost and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the debt instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the instrument. When calculating the effective interest rate, all contractual terms are considered. Possible future credit losses are not taken into account. Charges and interest paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts are included in the calculation.\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide information on the fair value of all financial assets, including those carried at amortized cost where the values are provided in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). For quoted financial assets for which there is an active market, the fair value is the bid price at the reporting date. In the absence of an active market, fair value is estimated by using present value based or other valuation techniques. Where discounting techniques are applied, the discount rate is based on current market rates applicable to financial instruments with similar characteristics. The valuation techniques that include unobservable inputs can result in a different outcome than the actual transaction price at which the asset was acquired. Such differences are not recognized in the income statement immediately but are deferred. They are released over time to the income statement in line with the change in factors (including time) that market participants would consider in setting a price for the asset. Interest accrued to date is not included in the fair value of the financial asset.",

Financial assets of which the Group has neither transferred nor retained significantly all the risk and rewards and retained control are recognized to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement. If significantly all risks are retained, the assets are not derecognized.\n\nOn derecognition, the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized in the income statement as a realized gain or loss. Any cumulative unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in the revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity is also recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Security lending and repurchase agreements\n\nFinancial assets that are lent to a third party or that are transferred subject to a repurchase agreement at a fixed price are not derecognized as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset. A liability is recognized for cash (collateral) received, on which interest is accrued.\n\nA security that has been received under a borrowing or reverse repurchase agreement is not recognized as an asset. A receivable is recognized for any related cash (collateral) paid by Aegon. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as investment income. If the Group subsequently sells that security, a liability to repurchase the asset is recognized and initially measured at fair value.\n\n## Collateral\n\nWith the exception of cash collateral, assets received as collateral are not separately recognized as an asset until the financial asset they secure defaults. When cash collateral is recognized, a liability is recorded for the same amount.\n\n## b. Real estate\n\nInvestments in real estate include property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both. Investments in real estate are presented as 'Investments'. Property that is occupied by the Group and that is not intended to be sold in the near future is classified as real estate held for own use and is presented in 'Other assets and receivables'.\n\nAll property is initially recognized at cost. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the real estate and borrowing cost for longterm construction projects if recognition criteria are met. Subsequently, investments in real estate are measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Real estate held for own use is carried at its revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of revaluation less subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the useful life of a building. Land is not depreciated. Revaluation of real estate for own use is recognized in/uni00A0other comprehensive income and accumulated in revaluation reserve in equity. On revaluation the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount.\n\nOn disposal of an asset, the difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying amount is recognized in the income statement. Any remaining surplus attributable to real estate in own use in the revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings.\n\n## Maintenance costs and other subsequent expenditure\n\nExpenditure incurred after initial recognition of the asset is capitalized to the extent that the level of future economic benefits of the asset is increased. Costs that restore or maintain the level of future economic benefits are recognized in the income statement as incurred.\n\n## 2.8 Investments for account of policyholders\n\nInvestments held for account of policyholders consist of investments in financial assets as well as investments in real estate. Investment return on these assets is passed on to the policyholder. Also included are the assets held by consolidated investment funds that are backing liabilities towards third parties. Investments for account of policyholders are valued at fair value through profit or loss.",

Definition\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments of which the value changes in response to an underlying variable, that often require little or no net initial investment and are settled at a future date.\n\nAssets and liabilities may include derivative-like terms and conditions. With the exception of features embedded in contracts held at fair value through profit or loss, embedded derivatives that are not considered closely related to the host contract are bifurcated, carried at fair value and presented as derivatives. In assessing whether a derivative-like feature is closely related to the contract in which it is embedded, the Group considers the similarity of the characteristics of the embedded derivative and the host contract. Embedded derivatives that transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for as insurance contracts.\n\nDerivatives with positive values are reported as assets and derivatives with negative values are reported as liabilities. Derivatives for which the contractual obligation can only be settled by exchanging a fixed amount of cash for a fixed amount of Aegon N.V. equity instruments are accounted for in shareholders' equity.\n\n## b. Measurement\n\nAll derivatives recognized on the statement of financial position are carried at fair value.\n\nThe fair value is calculated net of the interest accrued to date and is based on market prices, when available. When market prices are not available, other valuation techniques, such as option pricing or stochastic modeling, are applied. The valuation techniques incorporate all factors that market participants would consider and are based on observable market data, to the extent possible.\n\n## c. Hedge accounting\n\nAs part of its asset liability management, the Group enters into economic hedges to limit its risk exposure. These transactions are assessed to determine whether hedge accounting can and should be applied.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge (which includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being used and how hedge effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be highly effective in accomplishing the objective of offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated on a prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a comparison of the changes in the fair value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to the hedged item. A hedging relationship is considered highly effective if the results of the hedging instrument are within a ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.\n\nFor hedge accounting purposes, a distinction is made between fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and other interbank offered rates ('IBORs') has become a priority for global regulators. There is currently uncertainty around the timing and precise nature of these changes, in light of which the following assumptions have been made with respect to hedge accounting:\n\n- \u25a0 When considering the 'highly probable' requirement, it is assumed that the current benchmark interest rate on which the hedged positions is based will not change as a result of IBOR reform.\n- \u25a0 In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be 'highly effective' on a forward-looking basis, it is assumed that the current benchmark interest rate on which the cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative that hedges it are based is not altered as a result of the IBOR reform.\n- \u25a0 Hedge accounting is not discontinued during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective effectiveness falls outside the required 80-125% range.\n- \u25a0 For macro hedging the assessment whether the hedged risk component is a separately identifiable, is performed only when a hedged item is first included in the hedge and not on an ongoing basis.\n- \u25a0 The cash flows hedge reserve relating to the period after the IBOR reform is expected to take effect, is not recycled solely because cash flows are expected to change.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in the profit and loss account, together with fair value adjustments to the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge relationship no longer",

The EU 'carve out' macro hedging enables a group of derivatives (or proportions thereof) to be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument and removes some of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting. Under the EU 'carve out', ineffectiveness in fair value hedge accounting only arises when the revised projection of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the designated amount of that bucket. Aegon applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging) under the EU 'carve out' to mortgage loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in the profit and loss account, together with the fair value adjustment on the mortgages (hedged items) insofar as attributable to interest rate risk (the hedged risk).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk of a forecasted transaction or a recognized asset or liability and could affect profit or loss. To the extent that the hedge is effective, the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity. Any ineffectiveness is recognized directly in the income statement. The amount recorded in shareholders' equity is released to the income statement to coincide with the hedged transaction, except when the hedged transaction is an acquisition of a non-financial asset or liability. In this case, the amount in shareholders' equity is included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nNet investment hedges are hedges of currency exposures on a net investment in a foreign operation. To the extent that the hedge is effective, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in the net foreign investment hedging reserve in shareholders' equity. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement. The amount in shareholders' equity is released to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively for hedges that are no longer considered effective. When hedge accounting is discontinued for a fair value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried on the statement of financial position with changes in its fair value recognized in the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued for a cash flow hedge because the cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gain or loss in shareholders' equity is recognized immediately in the income statement. In other situations where hedge accounting is discontinued for a cash flow hedge, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, accumulated gains or losses in shareholders' equity are amortized into the income statement when the income statement is impacted by the variability of the cash flow from the hedged item.\n\n## d. Brexit\n\nSince January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) is no longer a member of the European Union./uni00A0Just before the Brexit transition period ended after December 31, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed on a new 'Trade and Cooperation Agreement' outlining their post-Brexit relationship. Overall, the deal is light on financial services. Aegon no longer enters into new derivatives transactions with UK counterparties, repapered with EU 27 counterparties and clearing members and transferred a large majority of its derivatives that were cleared at the London Clearing House to EU 27 clearing members and to Eurex in Frankfurt.\n\n## 2.10 Investments in joint arrangements\n\nIn general, joint arrangements are contractual agreements whereby the Group undertakes, with other parties, an economic activity that is subject to joint control. Joint control exists when it is contractually agreed to share control over an economic activity. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInvestments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Aegon has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nUnder the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognized at cost, which includes positive goodwill arising on acquisition. Negative goodwill is recognized in the income statement on the acquisition date. If joint ventures are obtained in successive share purchases, each significant transaction is accounted for separately.",

Interests held by venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds that qualify as an associate are accounted for as an investment held at fair value through profit or loss. Interests held by the Group in venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds that are managed on a fair value basis, are also accounted for as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nInterests in associates are initially recognized at cost, which includes positive goodwill arising on acquisition.

Reinsurance assets are also held as part of exiting the business. For contracts transferring sufficient insurance risk, a reinsurance asset is recognized for the expected future benefits, less expected future reinsurance premiums. Reinsurance contracts with insufficient insurance risk transfer are accounted for as investment or service contracts, depending on the nature of the agreement.\n\nReinsurance assets are measured consistently with the assumptions associated with the underlying insurance contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract. They are subject to impairment testing and are derecognized when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the contract is transferred to another party.\n\nAegon is not relieved of its legal liabilities when entering into reinsurance transactions, therefore the reserves relating to the underlying insurance contracts will continue to be reported on the consolidated statement of financial position during the contractual term of the underlying contracts.",

The insurance premiums for the original contracts are presented gross of reinsurance premiums paid.\n\n## 2.13 Deferred expenses\n\n## a. Deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC)\n\nDPAC relates to all insurance contracts as well as investment contracts with discretionary participation features and represents directly attributable costs that are related to the selling, underwriting and initiating of these insurance contracts.\n\nDPAC are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable and are subsequently amortized based on factors such as expected gross profit margins. For products sold in the United States and Asia with amortization based on expected gross profit margins or revenues, the amortization period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date and any change in estimates is recognized in the income statement. Estimates include, but are not limited to: an economic perspective in terms of future returns on bond and equity instruments, mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions, maintenance expenses and expected inflation rates.\n\nFor all products, DPAC, in conjunction with VOBA where appropriate, is assessed for recoverability at least annually as part of the liability adequacy test for each reporting period. If appropriate, the assumptions included in the determination of estimated gross profits or revenues are adjusted. The portion of DPAC that is determined not to be recoverable is charged to the income statement.\n\nFor products sold in the United States and Asia, when unrealized gains or losses arise on available-for-sale assets backing the insurance liabilities, DPAC is adjusted to equal the effect that the realization of the gains or losses (through sale or impairment) would have had on its measurement. This is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity.\n\nDPAC is derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.\n\n## b. Deferred cost of reinsurance\n\nA deferred cost of reinsurance is established when Aegon enters into a reinsurance transaction, except for reinsurance transactions that are entered into as part of a plan to exit a business. When Aegon enters into a reinsurance contract as part of a plan to exit a business, an immediate loss is recognized in the income statement. Upon reinsurance, Aegon is not relieved of its legal liabilities, so the reserves relating to the underlying reinsured contracts will continue to be reported in the consolidated statement of financial position during the contractual term of the underlying contracts.\n\nThe difference, if any, between amounts paid in a reinsurance transaction and the amount of the liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured contracts is part of the deferred cost of reinsurance.\n\nWhen losses on buying reinsurance are deferred, the amortization is based on the assumptions of the underlying insurance contracts. In the Netherlands, the amortization is based on the percentage of premium paid on the reinsurance contract. For products sold in the Americas and Asia where the amortization is based on expected gross profit margins (EGPs), these EGPs will be net of reinsurance (i.e., net of actual reinsurance cash flows that exceed expected reinsurance cash flows). The amortization is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## c. Deferred transaction costs\n\nDeferred transaction costs relate to investment contracts without discretionary participation features under which Aegon will render investment management services. Incremental costs that are directly attributable to securing these investment management contracts are recognized as an asset if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and if it is probable that they will be recovered.\n\nFor contracts involving both the origination of a financial liability and the provision of investment management services, only the transaction costs allocated to the servicing component are deferred. The other transaction costs are included in the carrying amount of the financial liability.\n\nThe deferred transaction costs are amortized in line with fee income, unless there is evidence that another method better represents the provision of services under the contract. The amortization is recognized in the income statement. Deferred transaction costs are subject to impairment testing at least annually.\n\nDeferred transaction costs are derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.",

Trade and other receivables are initially recognized at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Equipment is initially carried at cost, depreciated on a straight line basis over its useful life to its residual value and is subject to impairment testing. The accounting for real estate held for own use is described in note/uni00A02.7 Investments.\n\n## 2.15 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash at banks and in-hand. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments generally with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known cash amounts, are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash requirements. Money market investments that are held for investment purposes (backing insurance liabilities, investment liabilities or equity based on asset liability management considerations) are not included in cash and cash equivalents but are presented as investments or investments for account of policyholders.\n\n## 2.16 Impairment of assets\n\nAn asset is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the amount that would be recovered through its use or sale. For tangible and intangible assets, financial assets and reinsurance assets, if not held at fair value through profit or loss, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated when there are indications that the asset may be impaired. Irrespective of the indications, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that are not amortized, are tested at least annually.\n\nThere are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring investments and determining if impairment exists. These risks and uncertainties include the risk that the Group's assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer and the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated. Any of these situations could result in a charge against the income statement to the extent of the impairment charge recorded.\n\n## a. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets are tested individually for impairment when there are indications that the asset may be impaired. For goodwill and intangible assets with an undefined life, an impairment test is performed at least once a year or more frequently as a result of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate an impairment charge may be necessary. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying and the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of an asset's value in use and its fair value less cost of disposal. The value in use represents the discounted future net cash flows from the continuing use and ultimate disposal of the asset and reflects its known inherent risks and uncertainties. The valuation utilizes the best available information, including assumptions and projections considered reasonable and supportable by management. The assumptions used in the valuation involve significant judgments and estimates. Refer to note/uni00A029 Intangible assets for more details.\n\nImpairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income to the extent that they offset a previously recorded revaluation reserve relating to the same item. Any further losses are recognized directly in the income statement. Impairment of deferred policy acquisition costs is included in note/uni00A015 Impairment charges/(reversals).\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, impairment losses are reversed when there is evidence that there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the recognition of the last impairment loss. The reversal is recognized in the income statement to the extent that it reverses impairment losses previously recognized in the income statement. The carrying amount after reversal cannot exceed the amount that would have been recognized had no impairment taken place.\n\nNon-financial assets that only generate cash flows in combination with other assets and liabilities are tested for impairment at the level of the cash-generating unit. The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The allocation is based on the level at which goodwill is monitored internally and cannot be larger than an operating segment. When impairing a cash-generating unit, any goodwill allocated to the unit is first written-off and recognized in the income statement. The remaining impairment loss is allocated on a pro rata basis among the other assets, on condition that the resulting carrying amounts do not fall below the individual assets' recoverable amounts.\n\n## b. Impairment of debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments are impaired if there is objective evidence that a credit event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset that has a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows. Individually significant loans and other receivables are first assessed",

All non-impaired assets measured at amortized cost are then grouped by credit risk characteristics and collectively tested for impairment.\n\nFor debt instruments carried at amortized cost, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is reduced through an allowance account. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying and recoverable amount of the investment. The recoverable amount is determined by discounting the estimated probable future cash flows at the original effective interest rate of the asset. For variable interest debt instruments, the current effective interest rate under the contract is applied.\n\nFor debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, the asset is impaired to its fair value. Any unrealized loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is taken to the income statement in the impairment loss. After impairment the interest accretion on debt instruments is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.\n\nImpairment losses recognized for debt instruments can be reversed if in subsequent periods the amount of the impairment loss decreases and that decrease can be objectively related to a credit event occurring after the impairment was recognized. For debt instruments carried at amortized cost, the carrying amount after reversal cannot exceed what the amortized cost would have been at the reversal date, had the impairment not been recognized.\n\n## c. Impairment of equity instruments\n\nFor equity instruments, objective evidence of impairment of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale includes information about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the issuer operates, and indicates that the cost of the investment in the equity instrument may not be recovered. A significant or prolonged decline in fair value below initial cost is also considered objective evidence of impairment and always results in a loss being recognized in the income statement. Significant or prolonged decline is defined as an unrealized loss position for generally more than six months or a fair value of less than 80% of the cost price of the investment. Equity investments are impaired to the asset's fair value and any unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in shareholders' equity is taken to the income statement as an impairment loss. The amount exceeding the balance of previously recognized unrealized gains or losses is recognized in the income statement. If an available-for- sale equity security is impaired based upon Aegon's qualitative or quantitative impairment criteria, any further declines in the fair value at subsequent reporting dates are recognized as impairments. Therefore, at each reporting period, for an equity security that is determined to be impaired based upon Aegon's impairment criteria, an impairment is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the original cost basis, less any previously recognized impairments.\n\nImpairment losses on equity instruments cannot be reversed.\n\n## d. Impairment of reinsurance assets\n\nReinsurance assets are impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that not all amounts due under the terms of the contract may be received. In such a case, the value of the reinsurance asset recoverable is determined based on the best estimate of future cash flows, taking into consideration the reinsurer's current and expected future financial conditions plus any collateral held in trust for Aegon's benefit. The carrying value is reduced to this calculated recoverable value, and the impairment loss recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 2.17 Equity\n\nFinancial instruments that are issued by the Group are classified as equity if they represent a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and the Group has an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle its contractual obligation. In addition to common shares, the Group has issued perpetual securities. Perpetual securities have no final maturity date, repayment is at the discretion of Aegon and for junior perpetual capital securities, Aegon has the option to defer coupon payments at its discretion. The perpetual capital securities are classified as equity rather than debt, are measured at par and those that are denominated in US dollars are translated into euro using historical exchange rates.\n\nNon-cumulative subordinated notes were identified as a compound instrument due to the nature of this financial instrument. For these non-cumulative subordinated notes, Aegon had an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle the coupon payments. The redemption of the principal was however not at the discretion of Aegon and therefore Aegon had a contractual obligation to settle the redemption in cash or another financial asset or through the exchange of financial assets and liabilities at potentially unfavorable conditions for Aegon. Compound instruments were separated into liability components and equity components. The liability component for the non-cumulative subordinated notes was equal to the present value of the redemption amount and carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method./uni00A0The unwinding of the discount of this component was",

At initial recognition the equity component was assigned the residual amount after deducting the liability component from the fair value of the instrument as a whole. The equity component in US dollars was translated into euro using historical exchange rates. With effect on May 15, 2018, Aegon has exercised its right to redeem USD 525 million non-cumulative subordinated notes, subsequently leading to their redemption. As the Group's obligation under the contract has expired, the liability and equity components of the non-cumulative subordinated notes have been derecognized.\n\nIncremental external costs that are directly attributable to the issuing or buying back of own equity instruments are recognized in equity, net of tax. For compound instruments incremental external costs that were directly attributable to the issuing or buying back of the compound instruments were recognized proportionate to the equity component and liability component, net of tax.\n\nThe Group recognizes the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where it originally recognized the past transactions or events that generated the distributable profits./uni00A0A liability for non-cumulative dividends payable is not recognized until the dividends have been declared and approved.\n\nTreasury shares are shares issued by Aegon N.V. that are held by Aegon, one of its subsidiaries or by another entity controlled by Aegon. Treasury shares are deducted from Group equity, regardless of the objective of the transaction. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the instruments. If sold, the difference between the carrying amount and the proceeds is reflected in retained earnings. The consideration paid or received is recognized directly in shareholders' equity. All treasury shares are eliminated in the calculation of earnings per share and dividend per common share.\n\n## 2.18 Trust pass-through securities and (subordinated) borrowings\n\nA financial instrument issued by the Group is classified as a liability if the contractual obligation must be settled in cash or another financial asset or through the exchange of financial assets and liabilities at potentially unfavorable conditions for the Group.\n\nTrust pass-through securities and (subordinated) borrowings are initially recognized at their fair value including directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, with the exception of specific borrowings that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate, or significantly reduce, an accounting mismatch, or specific borrowings which are carried as at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis. The liability is derecognized when the Group's obligation under the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled.\n\nSubordinated borrowings include the liability component of non-cumulative subordinated notes. These notes are identified as a compound instrument due to the nature of this financial instrument. Compound instruments are separated into equity components and liability components. The liability component for the non-cumulative subordinated notes is related to the redemption amount. For further information on the accounting policy of the non-cumulative subordinated notes refer to note/uni00A02.17 Equity.\n\n## 2.19 Insurance contracts\n\nInsurance contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. In accordance with this standard, Aegon continues to apply the existing accounting policies that were applied prior to the adoption of IFRS-EU with certain modifications allowed by IFRS 4 for standards effective subsequent to adoption. Aegon applies, in general, non-uniform accounting policies for insurance liabilities and insurance related intangible assets to the extent that it was allowed under Dutch Accounting Principles. As a result, specific methodologies applied may differ between Aegon's operations as they may reflect local regulatory requirements and local practices for specific product features in these local markets. At the time of IFRS-EU adoption, Aegon was applying US GAAP for its United States operations whereas in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, Aegon was applying Dutch Accounting Principles. Since adoption of IFRS-EU, Aegon has considered new and amended standards in those GAAPs which have become effective subsequent to the date of transition to IFRS-EU. If any changes are made to current accounting policies for insurance contracts, these will be in accordance with IFRS 4.\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts under which the Group accepts a significant risk - other than a financial risk - from a policyholder by agreeing to compensate the beneficiary on the occurrence of an uncertain future event by which he or she will be adversely affected. Contracts that do not meet this definition are accounted for as investment contracts. The Group reviews homogeneous books of contracts to assess whether the underlying contracts transfer significant insurance risk on an individual basis. This is considered the case when at least one scenario with commercial substance can be identified in which the Group has to pay significant additional benefits to the policyholder. Contracts that have been classified as insurance are not reclassified subsequently.",

The liability is derecognized when the contract expires, is discharged, disposed or cancelled. Within the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, substantially modified contracts are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.\n\nInsurance assets and liabilities are valued in accordance with the accounting principles that were applied by the Group prior to the transition to IFRS-EU and with consideration of standards effective subsequent to the date of transition to IFRS-EU, as further described in the following paragraphs. In order to reflect the specific nature of the products written, subsidiaries are allowed to apply local accounting principles to the measurement of insurance contracts. All valuation methods used by the subsidiaries are based on the general principle that the carrying amount of the net liability must be sufficient to meet any reasonably foreseeable obligation resulting from the insurance contracts.\n\n## a. Life insurance contracts\n\nLife insurance contracts are insurance contracts with life-contingent benefits. The measurement of the liability for life insurance contracts varies depending on the nature of the product.\n\nLiabilities arising from traditional life insurance products that are offered by Aegon, particularly those with fixed and guaranteed account terms, are typically measured using the net premium method. Under this method the liability is determined as the sum of the discounted value of the expected benefits and future administration expenses directly related to the contract, less the discounted value of the expected theoretical premiums that would be required to meet the future cash outflows based on the valuation assumptions used. The liability is either based on current assumptions or calculated using the assumptions established at the time the contract was issued, in which case a margin for risk and adverse deviation is generally included. Furthermore, the liability for life insurance comprises reserves for unearned premiums and accrued annuity benefits payable.\n\nDepending on local accounting principles, the liability may include amounts for future services on contracts where the policy administration charges are higher in the initial years than in subsequent years.\n\nTerms and conditions, including participation features, are considered when establishing the insurance liabilities. Where the Group has discretion over the amount or timing of the bonuses distributed resulting from participation features, a liability is recognized equal to the amount that is available at the reporting date for future distribution to policyholders.\n\nIn establishing the liability, guaranteed minimum benefits issued to the policyholder are measured as described in note/uni00A02.19.c Embedded derivatives or, if bifurcated from the host contract, as described in note/uni00A02.9 Derivatives.\n\n## b. Life insurance contracts for account of policyholders\n\nLife insurance contracts under which the policyholder bears the risks associated with the underlying investments are classified as insurance contracts for account of policyholders.\n\nThe liability for the insurance contracts for account of policyholders is measured at the policyholder account balance. Contracts with unit-denominated payments are measured at current unit values, which reflect the fair values of the assets of the fund. If applicable, the liability representing the nominal value of the policyholder unit account is amortized over the term of the contract so that interest on actuarial funding is at an expected rate of return.\n\n## c. Embedded derivatives\n\nLife insurance contracts may include derivative-like terms and conditions. With the exception of policyholder options to surrender the contract at a fixed amount, contractual features that are not closely related to the insurance contract and that do not themselves meet the definition of insurance contracts are accounted for as derivatives.\n\n## Guaranteed minimum benefits\n\nCertain life insurance contracts, issued by the Group, contain guaranteed minimum benefits. Bifurcated guaranteed minimum benefits are classified as derivatives.\n\nIn the United States, the additional liability for guaranteed minimum benefits that are not bifurcated is determined each period by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The estimates are reviewed regularly and any resulting adjustment to the additional liability is recognized in the income statement. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are commonly based",

Where applicable, the calculation of the liability incorporates a percentage of the potential annuitizations that may be elected by the contract holder.\n\nIn the Netherlands, an additional liability is established for guaranteed minimum investment returns on group pension plans with profit sharing and on traditional insurance contracts, with profit sharing based on an external interest index, that are not bifurcated. These guarantees are measured at fair value.\n\n## d. Shadow accounting\n\nShadow accounting allows that all gains and losses on investments affect the measurement of the insurance assets and liabilities in the same way, regardless of whether they are realized or unrealized and regardless of whether the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the income statement or/uni00A0through other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve. In some instances, realized gains or losses on investments have a direct effect on the measurement of the insurance assets and liabilities. For example, some insurance contracts include benefits that are contractually based on the investment returns realized by the insurer. In addition, realization of gains or losses on available-for-sale investments can lead to unlocking of VOBA or DPAC and can also affect the outcome of the liability adequacy test to the extent that it considers actual future investment returns. For similar changes in unrealized gains and losses, shadow accounting is applied. If an unrealized gain or loss triggers a shadow accounting adjustment to VOBA, DPAC or the insurance liabilities, the corresponding adjustment is recognized through other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve, together with the unrealized gain or loss.\n\nSome profit sharing schemes issued by the Group entitle the policyholder to a bonus which is based on the actual total return on specific assets held. To the extent that the bonus relates to gains or losses on available-for-sale investments for which the unrealized gains or losses are recognized/uni00A0through other comprehensive income/uni00A0in the revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity, shadow accounting is applied. This means that the increase in the liability is also charged through other comprehensive income/uni00A0to shareholders' equity to offset the unrealized gains rather than to the income statement.\n\n## e. Non-life insurance contracts\n\nNon-life insurance contracts are insurance contracts where the insured event is not life-contingent. For non-life products the insurance liability generally includes reserves for unearned premiums, unexpired risk, inadequate premium levels and outstanding claims and benefits. No catastrophe or equalization reserves are included in the measurement of the liability.\n\nThe reserve for unearned premiums includes premiums received for risks that have not yet expired. Generally, the reserve is released over the coverage period of the premium and is recognized as premium income.\n\nThe liability for outstanding claims and benefits is established for claims that have not been settled and any related cash flows, such as claims handling costs. It includes claims that have been incurred but have not been reported to the Group. The liability is calculated at the reporting date using statistical methods based on empirical data and current assumptions that may include a margin for adverse deviation. Liabilities for claims subject to periodic payment are calculated using actuarial methods consistent with those applied to life insurance contracts. Discounting is applied if allowed by the local accounting principles used to measure the insurance liabilities. Discounting of liabilities is generally applied when there is a high level of certainty concerning the amount and settlement term of the cash outflows.\n\n## f. Liability adequacy testing\n\nAt each reporting date, the adequacy of the life insurance liabilities (including life insurance contracts for account of policyholders), net of VOBA and DPAC, is assessed using a liability adequacy test.\n\nAll tests performed within the Group are based on current estimates of all contractual future cash flows, including related cash flows from policyholder options and guarantees. A number of valuation methods are applied, including discounted cash flow methods, option pricing models and stochastic modeling. Aggregation levels are set either on geographical jurisdiction or at the level of portfolio of contracts that are subject to broadly similar risks and managed together as a single portfolio./uni00A0Specifically, in the Netherlands the liability adequacy test is performed on a consolidated basis for all life and non-life business, whereas in the Americas and the UK it is performed at the level of the portfolio of contracts. To the extent that the tests involve discounting of future cash flows, the interest rate applied is based on market rates or is based on management's expectation of the future return on investments. These future returns on investments take into account management's best estimate related to the actual investments and, where applicable, reinvestments of these investments at maturity. Aegon the Netherlands, as required locally, adjusts the outcome of the liability adequacy test for the difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets that are measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. For details on the fair value (measurement) of Aegon's assets and liabilities, please refer",

Only differences between the fair value and the book value build up during the period when the assets were allocated to the insurance portfolio are included in the LAT.\n\nTo the extent that the account balances are insufficient to meet future benefits and expenses, any resulting deficiency is recognized in the income statement, initially by impairing the DPAC and VOBA and subsequently by establishing an insurance liability for the remaining loss, unless shadow loss recognition has taken place./uni00A0In the Netherlands, in situations where market interest rates for the valuation of debt securities lead to a change in the revaluation reserve, and where the result of using the same assumptions for the liabilities could lead to a deficiency in the liability adequacy test that should be recognized in the income statement, shadow loss recognition is applied. Shadow loss recognition is applied to the extent that the deficiency of the insurance liabilities relates to the revaluation of debt securities as a result of movements in interest rates, the addition to the insurance liabilities is then offset against the revaluation reserve. If in subsequent periods such a deficiency of the insurance liability is no longer applicable, shadow loss recognition is reversed via the revaluation reserve.\n\nThe adequacy of the non-life insurance liability is tested at each reporting date. Changes in expected claims that have occurred, but that have not been settled, are reflected by adjusting the liability for claims and future benefits. The reserve for unexpired risk is increased to the extent that the future claims and expenses in respect of current insurance contracts exceed the future premiums plus the current unearned premium reserve.\n\n## 2.20 Investment contracts\n\nAegon conducts its operations through the following type of investment contracts:\n\nContracts issued by the Group that do not transfer significant insurance risk, but do transfer financial risk from the policyholder to the Group are accounted for as investment contracts. Depending on whether the Group or the policyholder runs the risks associated with the investments allocated to the contract, the liabilities are classified as investment contracts or as investment contracts for account of policyholders. Investment contract liabilities are recognized when the contract is entered into and are derecognized when the contract expires, is discharged, cancelled or substantially modified.\n\n## a. Investment contracts with discretionary participation features\n\nSome investment contracts have participation features whereby the policyholder has the right to receive potentially significant additional benefits which are based on the performance of a specified pool of investment contracts, specific investments held by the Group or on the issuer's net income. If the Group has discretion over the amount or timing of the distribution of the returns to policyholders, the investment contract liability is measured based on the accounting principles that apply to insurance contracts with similar features.\n\nSome unitized investment contracts provide policyholders with the option to switch between funds with and without discretionary participation features. The entire contract is accounted for as an investment contract with discretionary participation features if there is evidence of actual switching resulting in discretionary participation benefits that are a significant part of the total contractual benefits.\n\n## b. Investment contracts without discretionary participation features\n\nAt inception, investment contracts without discretionary participation features are carried at amortized cost.\n\nInvestment contracts without discretionary participation features are carried at amortized cost based on the expected cash flows and using the effective interest rate method. The expected future cash flows are re-estimated at each reporting date and the carrying amount of the financial liability is recalculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using the financial liability's original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is immediately recognized in the income statement. For these investment contracts deposit accounting is applied, meaning that deposits are not reflected as premium income, but are recognized as part of the financial liability.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide information on the fair value of all financial liabilities, including those carried at amortized cost. As these contracts are not quoted in active markets, their value is determined by using valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow methods and stochastic modeling. For investment contracts without discretionary participation features that can be cancelled by the policyholder, the fair value cannot be less than the surrender value.",

Investment contracts for account of policyholders\n\nInvestment contracts for account of policyholders are investment contracts for which the actual return on investments allocated to the contract is passed on to the policyholder. Also included are participations held by third parties in consolidated investment funds that meet the definition of a financial liability.\n\nInvestment contracts for account of policyholders are designated at fair value through profit or loss. Contracts with unit-denominated payments are measured at current unit values, which reflect the fair values of the assets of the fund.\n\nFor unit-linked contracts without discretionary participation features and subject to actuarial funding, the Group recognizes a liability at the funded amount of the units. The difference between the gross value of the units and the funded value is treated as an initial fee paid by the policyholder for future asset management services and recognized as a deferred revenue liability, refer to note/uni00A02.23 Deferred gains.\n\n## 2.21 Provisions\n\nA provision is recognized for present legal or constructive obligations arising from past events, when it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits and the amount can be reliably estimated. Management exercises judgment in evaluating the probability that a loss will be incurred.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, considering all its inherent risks and uncertainties, as well as the time value of money. The estimate of the amount of a loss requires management judgment in the selection of a proper calculation model and the specific assumptions related to the particular exposure. The unwinding of the effect of discounting is recorded in the income statement as an interest expense.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nWith the exception of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features for which potential future losses are already considered in establishing the liability, a provision is recognized for onerous contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the resulting obligations exceed the expected future economic benefits. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it.\n\n## 2.22 Assets and liabilities relating to employee benefits\n\n## a. Short-term employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognized for the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be settled within one year after the end of the period in which the service was rendered. Accumulating short-term absences are recognized over the period in which the service is provided. Benefits that are not service-related are recognized when the event that gives rise to the obligation occurs.\n\n## b. Post-employment benefits\n\nThe Group has issued defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. A plan is classified as a defined contribution plan when the Group has no further obligation than the payment of a fixed contribution. All other plans are classified as defined benefit plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThe contribution payable to a defined contribution plan for services provided is recognized as an expense in the income statement. An asset is recognized to the extent that the contribution paid exceeds the amount due for services provided.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is based on the terms and conditions of the plan applicable on the reporting date. In measuring the defined benefit obligation the Group uses the projected unit credit method and actuarial assumptions that represent the management's best estimates. The benefits are discounted using an interest rate based on the market yield for high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity that approximate the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the liability include the discount rate, estimated future salary increases, mortality rates and price inflation. To the extent that actual experience deviates from these assumptions, the valuation of defined benefit plans and the level of pension expenses recognized in the future may be affected. Plan improvements (either vested or unvested) are recognized in the income statement at the date when the plan improvement occurs.",

They are measured at fair value and are deducted from the defined benefit obligation in determining the amount recognized on the statement of financial position.\n\n## Profit or loss recognition\n\nThe cost of the defined benefit plans are determined at the beginning of the year and comprise the following components:\n\n- \u25a0 Current year service cost which is recognized in profit or loss; and\n- \u25a0 Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is recognized in other comprehensive income are revisited quarterly and are not allowed to be reclassified to profit or loss in a subsequent period.\n\nDeducted from current year service cost are discretionary employee contributions and employee contributions that are linked to service (those which are independent of the number of years of service)./uni00A0Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the applicable discount rate. Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprises interest income on plan assets and interest cost on the defined benefit obligation. Whereby interest income on plan assets is a component of the return on plan assets and is determined by multiplying the fair value of the plan assets by the applicable discount rate. The difference between the interest income on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets is included in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset).\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprise of:\n\n- \u25a0 Actuarial gains and losses;\n- \u25a0 The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset); and\n- \u25a0 Any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset).\n\n## Past service cost and gains or losses on settlements\n\nPast service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service, resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment.\n\nGains or losses on curtailments or settlements of a defined benefit plan comprise of the difference between:\n\n- \u25a0 The present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled, as determined on the date of settlement; and\n- \u25a0 The settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by Aegon in connection with the settlement.\n\nAegon recognizes (in the income statement) gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\n## c. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has issued share-based plans that entitle selected employees to receive Aegon N.V. common shares, subject to pre-defined conditions such as the grant price of the shares and (business and personal) performance criteria. The number of shares that will vest partly depends on Aegon's relative total shareholder return in comparison with a peer group.\n\nThe expenses recognized for these plans are based on the fair value on the grant date of the shares. The fair value is measured at the market price of Aegon N.V. common shares, adjusted to take into account the non-vesting and market conditions upon which the shares were granted. For example, where the employee is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, this factor is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted. For the determination of factors such as expected dividends, market observable data has been considered. In addition, where the relative total shareholder return is included in the performance criteria, this factor represents a market condition and hence is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted.\n\nThe cost for long term incentive plans are recognized in the income statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity, as the services are rendered. During this period the cumulative expense recognized at the reporting date reflects management's best estimate of the number of shares expected to vest ultimately./uni00A0\n\nThe withholding of shares to fund the payment to the tax authority in respect of the employee's withholding tax obligation associated with the share-based payment is accounted for as a deduction from equity for the shares withheld, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value at the net settlement date of the equity instruments withheld.",

Current tax receivables and payables\n\nTax receivables and payables for current and prior periods are measured at the amount that is expected to be received from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax treatment of transactions or events requires judgment and is often complex and may lead to discussions with tax authorities. Consequently, in a number of jurisdictions, prior year tax returns remain open and subject to tax authority approval or pending litigation for a number of years. The tax assets and liabilities reported are based on the best available information, supported by external advice if necessary, and are reflecting uncertainties. Differences between the final outcome and the estimates originally made are accounted for in the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which reasonable certainty is obtained. Measurement is done using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\n## b. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying value of an item and its tax value, with the exception of differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill and of assets and liabilities that do not impact taxable or accounting profits. A tax asset is recognized for tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable at the reporting date that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are not recognized if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed at each reporting period and are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Since there is no absolute assurance that these assets will ultimately be realized, management reviews Aegon's deferred tax positions at each reporting period to determine if it is probable that the assets will be realized. These reviews include, among other things, the nature and amount of the taxable income and deductible expenses, the expected timing when certain assets will be used or liabilities will be required to be reported and the reliability of historical profitability of businesses expected to provide future earnings. Furthermore, management considers tax-planning opportunities it can utilize to increase the likelihood that the tax assets will be realized. The carrying amount is not discounted and reflects the Group's expectations concerning the manner of recovery or settlement.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in relation to the underlying transaction either in profit and loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## 2.25 Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nContingent assets are disclosed in the notes if the inflow of economic benefits is probable, but not virtually certain. When the inflow of economic benefits becomes virtually certain, the asset is no longer contingent and its recognition is appropriate.\n\nA provision is recognized for present legal or constructive obligations arising from past events, when it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits and the amount can be reliably estimated. If the outflow of economic benefits is not probable, a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\n## 2.26 Premium income\n\nGross premiums, including recurring and single premiums, from life and non-life insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features are recognized as revenue when they become receivable. For products where deposit accounting is required, the deposits are not reflected as premium income, but are recognized as part of the financial liability. For these products the surrender charges and charges assessed have been included in gross premiums.\n\nPremium loadings for installment payments and additional payments by the policyholder towards costs borne by the insurer are included in the gross premiums. Rebates that form part of the premium rate, such as no-claim rebates, are deducted from the gross premium, others are recognized as an expense.

Fees and commissions that are an integral part of the effective yield of the financial assets or liabilities are recognized as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the instrument. Investment income includes the interest income and dividend income on financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nInvestment income also includes rental income due.\n\n## 2.28 Fee and commission income\n\nFees and commissions from investment management services and mutual funds are performed on an ongoing basis evenly throughout the year and are accounted for monthly (1/12 of the contractual agreement). Performance fees may be charged to policyholders in the event of outperformance in the investments compared to predefined benchmark levels. They are accounted for only when specified hurdles for generating performance fees are achieved i.e. when the full performance obligation is met.\n\nAegon acts also as an insurance broker selling insurance contracts of other insurance companies to policyholders and receiving direct sales commission as well as commissions over time when the same policyholders renew their contracts. These commissions are recognized only when received as policyholders' renewals are not certain enough to be recorded upfront.\n\n## 2.29 Policyholder claims and benefits\n\nPolicyholder claims and benefits consist of claims and benefits paid to policyholders, including benefits in excess of account value for products for which deposit accounting is applied and the change in the valuation of liabilities for insurance and investment contracts.

The net gains and losses do not include interest or dividend income.\n\n## Realized gains and losses on financial investments\n\nGains and losses on financial investments include realized gains and losses on general account financial assets, other than those classified as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Net fair value change of derivatives\n\nAll changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement, unless the derivative has been designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value movements of fair value hedge instruments are offset by the fair value movements of the hedged item, and the resulting hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in this line. In addition, the fair value movements of bifurcated embedded derivatives are included in this line.\n\n## Net fair value change on for account of policyholder financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nNet fair value change on for account of policyholder financial assets at fair value through profit or loss includes fair value movements of investments held for account of policyholders (refer to note/uni00A02.8 Investments for account of policyholders).

Interest expense on trust pass-through securities and other borrowings carried at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\n## 2.33 Leases\n\nAs of January 1, 2019, the Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.\n\n## Policy applicable from January 1, 2019\n\n## As a lessee\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of real estate and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses (using the same rate to measure the lease liability), if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. The Group presents rightof-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'Other assets and receivables' and lease liabilities in 'Other liabilities' in the statement of financial position.\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, including small office equipment. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor under an operating lease, the assets subject to the operating lease arrangement are presented in the statement of financial position according to the nature of the asset.

Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates. Included among the material (or potentially material) reported amounts and disclosures that require extensive use of estimates are: fair value of certain invested assets and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (please refer to paragraph 2.13), value of business acquired and other purchased intangible assets (please refer to paragraph 2.6), goodwill (please refer to paragraph 2.6), policyholder claims and benefits (please refer to paragraph 2.29), insurance guarantees (please refer to paragraph 2.19), pension plans (please refer to paragraph 2.22), income taxes/uni00A0(please refer to paragraph 2.24) and the potential effects of resolving litigation matters (please refer to paragraph 2.25). Accounting policies that are critical to the financial statement presentation and that require complex estimates or significant judgment are described in the following sections.\n\n## Uncertainty resulting from COVID-19\n\nDuring 2020 the world saw substantial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside related market volatility and impacts on mortality and morbidity, there continued to be general uncertainty with respect to how the pandemic would play out and what the resulting economic consequences might be.\n\nWhile some lines of business saw lower premiums and deposits and higher incurred claims over the course of 2020, Aegon currently believes there is insufficient credible experience with which to update actuarial assumptions for COVID-19 specifically. In certain businesses, Aegon has incurred losses related to COVID-19. In the Americas, Aegon recorded unfavorable life mortality results of EUR/uni00A0110 million which can be specifically attributed to COVID-19 based on the cause of death reported on the death certificate. However, actual COVID-19 related deaths were likely higher as/uni00A0not all of the deceased were tested for COVID-19 and/or were reported as COVID-19 deaths.\n\nAegon experienced positive morbidity results in its Long Term Care (LTC) block during 2020, a portion of which is believed to have been driven by COVID-19. Elevated claim terminations among customers in LTC facilities, some of which was likely caused by COVID-19, led to greater releases of reserves than expected. At the same time, there was a material decrease in the number of new LTC claims which may have been driven by the fear of COVID-19. However, there is a likelihood that as the COVID-19 pandemic situation improves, there may be an increase in these eligible, but currently deferred claims. As a result, Aegon has established an additional, Incurred But Not Reported, liability of EUR/uni00A034 million as of year end.\n\nImpairment losses were higher than in previous reporting periods which was mainly driven by COVID-19 impacts. Impairment assessments were performed, and as a result of the uncertainty in the market and adverse impact of COVID-19, Aegon recorded impairments primarily in the energy, energy maintenance technologies, and communications sectors (refer to note/uni00A015 Impairment charges/(reversals) for more details). Allowance for credit losses on consumer loan portfolios and other asset classes remained low. In certain cases, customers could defer payments for three to six months. Throughout 2020 there were no significant contract modifications that would have led to the derecognition of the original asset or the establishment of an additional liability due to COVID-19./uni00A0\n\nRevised sales and earnings projections have been considered in the periodic impairment assessment of non-financial assets, which has led to the write-off of EUR/uni00A014 million customer-related intangibles.\n\nAs part of its normal process, Aegon has updated its sensitivity analysis for the impact of changes in financial assumptions on its IFRS equity and net income included in note/uni00A04 Financial risks.",

Note 44 Fair value, provides additional information on the fair valuation methods and assumptions applied, as well as movements or transfers in fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the Group Solvency II ratio as a result of negative market and underwriting impacts. Negative market impacts are mainly caused by a sharp decrease in interest rates, compounded by negative credit variances partly caused by widening of mortgage spreads. The higher mortality related to COVID-19 in Americas resulted in a negative underwriting result partly offset by better results on LTC. As part of its normal process, Aegon has updated its sensitivity analysis for the impact of economic and non-economic assumptions on its Solvency II ratio included in the Capital and liquidity management section.\n\n## Management's assessment of going concern\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Aegon have been set up assuming a going concern basis of accounting based on the reasonable assumption that the Company is, and will be, able to continue its normal course of business in the foreseeable future. Relevant facts and circumstances relating to the consolidated financial position on December 31, 2020, were assessed in order to reach the going concern assumption. The main areas assessed are the financial performance, capital adequacy, financial position and flexibility, liquidity, ability to access capital markets, leverage ratios and the level of cash capital in the holding. Considering all these areas management concluded that the going concern assumption for Aegon is appropriate in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of assets and liabilities arising from life insurance contracts\n\nThe valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts is developed using complex valuation models. The liability for life insurance contracts with guaranteed or fixed account terms is either based on current assumptions, on the assumptions established at inception of the contract, reflecting the best estimates at the time increased with a margin for adverse deviation, or on the valuation assumptions (historical cost), without risk margin. All contracts are subject to liability adequacy testing which reflects management's current estimates of future cash flows (including investment returns). To the extent that the liability is based on current assumptions, a change in assumptions will have an immediate impact on the income statement. Also, if a change in assumption results in not passing the liability adequacy test, the entire deficiency is recognized in the income statement. To the extent that the deficiency relates to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, the additional liability is recognized through other comprehensive income in the/uni00A0related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity.\n\nAegon the Netherlands, as required locally, adjusts the outcome of the liability adequacy test for the difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets that are measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. Mortgage loans is the primary asset class for which the difference between the fair value and the book value of assets impacts the LAT./uni00A0For details on the fair value (measurement) of Aegon's assets and liabilities, please refer to note/uni00A044 Fair value.\n\nSome insurance contracts without a guaranteed or fixed contractual term contain guaranteed minimum benefits. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, it may either be bifurcated and presented as a derivative, or be reflected in the value of the insurance liability in accordance with local accounting principles. Given the dynamic and complex nature of these guarantees, stochastic techniques under a variety of market return scenarios are often used for measurement purposes. Such models require management to make numerous estimates based on historical experience and market expectations. Changes in these estimates will immediately affect the income statement.\n\nIn addition, certain acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force are recorded as DPAC and VOBA assets respectively, and are amortized to the income statement over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these policies are not realized, the amortization of these costs could be accelerated and may require write-offs due to unrecoverability.\n\n## Actuarial and economic assumptions\n\nThe main assumptions used in measuring DPAC, VOBA and the liabilities for life insurance contracts with fixed or guaranteed terms relate to mortality, morbidity, investment return and future expenses. Depending on local accounting principles, surrender, lapse, and utilization rates may be considered.\n\nMortality tables applied are generally developed based on a blend of company experience and industry wide studies, taking into consideration product characteristics, own risk selection criteria, target market and past experience. Mortality experience is monitored through regular studies, the results of which are fed into the pricing cycle for new products and reflected in the liability calculation when appropriate. For contracts insuring survivorship or mortality, allowance may be made for further longevity or mortality",

Morbidity assumptions are based on own claims severity and frequency experience, adjusted where appropriate for industry information.\n\nInvestment assumptions are prescribed by the local regulator, market observable or based on management's future expectations. In the latter case, the anticipated future investment returns are set by management on a countrywide basis, considering available market information and economic indicators. A significant assumption related to estimated gross profits on variable annuities and variable life insurance products in the United States and some of the smaller countries, is the annual long-term growth rate of the underlying assets. The reconsideration of this assumption may affect the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule, referred to as DPAC or VOBA unlocking. The difference between the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule and the revised schedule, which is based on actual and estimates of future gross profits, is recognized in the income statement as an expense or a benefit in the period of determination.\n\nAssumptions on future expenses are based on the current level of expenses, adjusted for expected expense inflation if appropriate. In Aegon the Netherlands, the expense basis makes an allowance for planned future cost savings, which are included in the liability adequacy test.\n\nSurrender and lapse rates depend on product features, policy duration and external circumstances such as the interest rate environment and competitor behavior. For policies with account value guarantees based on equity market movements, a dynamic lapse assumption is utilized to reflect policyholder behavior based on whether the guarantee is in the money. Own experience, as well as industry published data, are used in establishing assumptions. Lapse experience is correlated to mortality and morbidity levels, as higher or lower levels of surrenders may indicate future claims will be higher or lower than anticipated. Such correlations are accounted for in the mortality and morbidity assumptions based on the emerging analysis of experience.\n\n## Actuarial assumption and model updates\n\nAssumptions are reviewed periodically in the second quarter for the US and in the fourth quarter for Europe and Asia, based on historical experience, observable market data, including market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions, anticipated trends and legislative changes. Similarly, the models and systems used for determining our liabilities are reviewed periodically and, if deemed necessary, updated based on emerging best practices and available technology.\n\nDuring 2020, Aegon implemented actuarial assumption and model updates resulting in a net EUR/uni00A0580 million charge to income before tax (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0196 million charge). This is mainly related to Aegon's businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands. Assumption changes and model updates in the Americas led to a net negative impact of EUR/uni00A0805 million. This reflects a charge of EUR/uni00A0460 million related to the lowering the long-term interest rate assumption and the corresponding adjustment of the separate account bond return assumptions. During 2020, the long-term interest assumption was assumed to have a grading over 10 years to 2.75%, which was a change from the previous assumption during 2018 and 2019 of a grading over 10 years to 4.25%. Non-economic assumption changes resulted in a charge of EUR/uni00A0345 million, mainly related to Universal Life premium persistency and an increase in mortality rate assumptions, as well as lowering the morbidity improvement assumption for Long-Term Care from 1.5% per year for the next 15 years/uni00A0to 0.75% for the same period. Assumption changes and model updates in the Netherlands led to a favorable impact of EUR/uni00A0225 million mainly related to favorable longevity assumption changes, partially offset by adverse impacts from mortgage prepayment model and expense assumption updates.\n\nFor the years 2018 through 2020, Aegon kept its long-term equity market return assumption for the estimated gross profits on variable life and variable annuity products in the Americas at 8%. The long term credit spread assumption, net of assumed defaults and expenses, on our most common corporate bonds is 114bps. The 90-day Treasury yield was 0.15%, 1.55% and 2.37% at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. During 2020 the 90-day Treasury yield was assumed to have a uniform grading over 10 years to 1.5%, which was a change from the assumption during 2018 and 2019 of grading over 10 years to 2.5%. On a quarterly basis, the estimated gross profits are updated for the difference between the estimated market return and the actual market return.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nPlease note/uni00A0that the sensitivities listed in the disclosures below represent sensitivities to Aegon's position at the balance sheet date for the respective years. The sensitivities reflect single shocks where other elements remain unchanged. Real world market impacts (e.g. lower interest rates and declining equity markets) may happen simultaneously which can lead to more severe combined impacts and may not be equal to the sum of the individual sensitivities presented in the disclosure./uni00A0",

The DPAC and VOBA balances for these products in the United States amounted to EUR/uni00A02.4 billion at December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A02.7 billion).\n\nA relative increase of 10% to the mortality assumption, dependent on product and characteristics of the block of business, would reduce net income by approximately EUR/uni00A0124 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0204 million). A relative 20% increase in the lapse rate assumption would increase net income by approximately EUR/uni00A089 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0126 million).\n\nAny reasonably possible changes in the other assumptions Aegon uses to determine EGP margins (i.e. maintenance expenses) would reduce net income by less than EUR/uni00A011 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A013 million).\n\n## Sensitivity on long term care (LTC) products in the United States\n\nAfter tax sensitivities of significant product liability assumptions on the LTC IFRS after-tax Gross Present Value Reserve (GPV) are indicated below. The GPV is the liability as determined on a best estimate assumption basis./uni00A0The morbidity improvement assumption for Long-Term Care has been lowered from 1.5% to 0.75% per year for the next 15 years.\n\nA 5% increase in the utilization rates with regard to Aegon's LTC products would result in a GPV increase of approximately EUR/uni00A0186 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0178 million). A 5% decrease in the utilization rates with regard to Aegon's LTC products would result in a GPV decrease of approximately EUR/uni00A0193 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0178 million).\n\nRemoving the morbidity improvement assumption, which is a component of the utilization assumption, would result in a GPV increase of approximately EUR/uni00A0278 million/uni00A0(2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0535 million), of which EUR/uni00A0173 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0445 million) relates to the loss recognition block.\n\nReducing expected mortality by 10% would result in a GPV increase of approximately EUR/uni00A0113 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A089 million). Increasing expected mortality by 10% would result in a GPV decrease of approximately EUR/uni00A0105 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A089 million).\n\nRemoving future mortality improvement would result in a GPV decrease of approximately EUR/uni00A099 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A089 million).\n\n## Sensitivity on liability adequacy test (LAT) in the Netherlands\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the liability adequacy test (LAT) of Aegon the Netherlands resulted in a deficiency. The LAT assesses the adequacy of the insurance liabilities by comparing them to their fair value. Aegon the Netherlands adjusts the outcome of the LAT for certain unrealized gains in the bond portfolio (shadow loss recognition) and certain differences between the fair value and the book value of assets measured at amortized cost, mainly residential mortgages. Please also refer to Note 2.19f Liability adequacy testing for further details on the accounting policy.\n\nThe LAT deficit per December 31, 2020 in Aegon the Netherlands amounted to EUR/uni00A07.0 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A05.1 billion), which was partially offset by the shadow loss recognition of EUR/uni00A04.5 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03.4 billion), resulting in a net deficit of EUR/uni00A02.5 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01.7 billion).\n\nDuring 2020, the LAT deficit of Aegon the Netherlands worsened from EUR/uni00A01.7 billion to EUR/uni00A02.5 billion, which led to the recognition of additional insurance contracts liabilities per December 31, 2020 of EUR/uni00A00.8 billion. The LAT deficit was negatively impacted by the impact of lower interest rate of EUR/uni00A01.5 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01.3 billion) and adverse credit spread movements (widening mortgage spreads, tightened liquidity premium) of EUR/uni00A00.3 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.8 billion). This was partly offset by other favorable impacts (model and assumption updates and portfolio changes) totaling EUR/uni00A01.0 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.2 billion negative).\n\nDuring 2019 the outcome of the liability adequacy test in Aegon the Netherlands triggered a review of the existing sensitivities. As a result, starting from 2019, Aegon discloses sensitivities on interest rate, bond credit spread, mortgage spread and liquidity premium assumptions to assess the impact on the LAT test, without taking into account the impact of shadow loss recognition.\n\nThe results are indicated below:\n\nAn increase of 100 bps in interest rate would result in a decrease in LAT deficit of EUR/uni00A03.9 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03.5 billion). A decrease of 100 bps would result in an increase in LAT deficit of approximately EUR/uni00A05.2 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A04.7 billion).",

A decrease of 5 bps would result in an increase in LAT deficit of EUR/uni00A00.2 billion./uni00A0\n\nGiven the LAT deficit at December 31, 2020, the above mentioned results would be reflected directly in the income statement. This impact on the income statement will be partially offset by the application of shadow loss recognition, triggered by the interest rate shock.\n\n## Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy\n\nThe following is a description of Aegon's methods of determining fair value, and a quantification of its exposure to assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u25a0 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u25a0 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nAegon uses the following hierarchy for measuring and disclosing of the fair value of assets and liabilities:\n\n- \u25a0 Level I: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that Aegon can access at the measurement date;\n- \u25a0 Level II: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices of identical or similar assets and liabilities) using valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are based on observable market data; and\n- \u25a0 Level III: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) using valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.\n\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market. In the event that the market for a financial instrument is not active or quoted market prices are not available, a valuation technique is used.\n\nThe degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally inversely correlates with the level of observable valuation inputs. Aegon maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable valuation inputs when measuring fair value. Financial instruments, for example, with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and therefore less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment.\n\nThe assets and liabilities categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nAn active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The judgment as to whether a market is active may include, although not necessarily determinative, lower transaction volumes, reduced transaction sizes and, in some cases, no observable trading activity for short periods. In inactive markets, assurance is obtained that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or it is determined that adjustments to transaction prices are necessary to measure the fair value of the instrument.\n\nThe majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data, and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high. However, certain assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable and, for such assets and liabilities, the derivation of fair value is more judgmental. An instrument is classified in its entirety as valued using significant unobservable inputs (Level III) if, in the opinion of management, a significant",

'Unobservable' in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an at arm's length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value. Additional information is provided in the table headed 'Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonably possible alternatives' in note/uni00A044 Fair Value. While Aegon believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain instruments (both financial and non-financial) could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nThe valuation techniques applied to financial instrument affected by IBOR reforms remain consistent with those of other market participants, and the uncertainty on the outcome of the reforms has not affected the classification of the instruments.\n\nTo operationalize Aegon's fair value hierarchy, individual instruments (both financial and non-financial) are assigned a fair value level based primarily on the type of instrument and the source of the prices (e.g. index, third-party pricing service, broker, internally modeled). Periodically, this logic for assigning fair value levels is reviewed to determine if any modifications are necessary in the context of the current market environment.\n\n## 4 Financial risks General\n\nAs an insurance group, Aegon is exposed to a variety of risks. Aegon's largest exposures are to changes in financial markets (e.g. foreign currency, interest rate, credit and equity market risks) that affect the value of the investments, liabilities from products that Aegon sells, deferred expenses and value of business acquired./uni00A0Other risks include insurance related risks, such as changes in mortality, morbidity, bond credit spread and liquidity premium, which are discussed in note/uni00A034 Insurance contracts. Aegon manages risk at local level where business is transacted, based on principles and policies established at the Group level. Aegon's integrated approach to risk management involves similar measurement of risk and scope of risk coverage to allow for aggregation of the Group's risk position.\n\nTo manage its risk exposure, Aegon has risk policies in place. Many of these policies are group-wide while others are specific to the unique situation of local businesses. The Group level policies limit the Group's exposure to major risks such as equity, interest rates, credit, and currency. The limits in these policies in aggregate remain within the Group's overall tolerance for risk and the Group's financial resources. Operating within this policy framework, Aegon employs risk management programs including asset liability management (ALM) processes and models and hedging programs (which are largely conducted via the use of financial derivative instruments). These risk management programs are in place in each country unit and are not only used to manage risk in each unit, but are also part of the Group's overall risk strategy.\n\nAegon operates a Derivative Use Policy to govern its usage of derivatives. This policy establishes the control, authorization, execution and monitoring requirements of the usage of such instruments. In addition, the policy stipulates necessary mitigation of credit risk created through derivatives management tools. For derivatives, counterparty credit risk is normally mitigated by requirements to post collateral via credit support annex agreements or through a central clearing house.\n\nAs part of its risk management programs, Aegon takes inventory of its current risk position across risk categories. Aegon also measures the sensitivity of net income and shareholders' equity under both deterministic and stochastic scenarios. Management uses the insight gained through these 'what if?' scenarios to manage the Group's risk exposure and capital position. The models, scenarios and assumptions used are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary.\n\nResults of Aegon's sensitivity analyses are presented throughout this section to show the estimated sensitivity of net income and shareholders' equity to various scenarios. For each type of market risk, the analysis shows how net income and shareholders' equity would have been affected by changes in the relevant risk variable that were reasonably possible at the reporting date. For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown. Management action is taken into account to the extent that it is part of Aegon's regular policies and procedures, such as established hedging programs. However, incidental management actions that would require a change in policies and procedures are not considered.\n\nEach sensitivity analysis reflects the extent to which the shock tested would affect management's critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying Aegon's accounting policies. Market-consistent assumptions underlying the measurement of non-listed assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect the shock tested. The shock may also affect the measurement of assets and liabilities based on assumptions that are not observable in the market. For example, a shock in interest rates may lead to changes in the amortization schedule of DPAC or to increased impairment losses on equity investments. Although management's short-term assumptions may",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nchange if there is a reasonably possible change in a risk factor, long-term assumptions will generally not be revised unless there is evidence that the movement is permanent. This fact is reflected in the sensitivity analyses.\n\nThe accounting mismatch inherent in IFRS-EU is also apparent in the reported sensitivities. A change in interest rates has an immediate impact on the carrying amount of assets measured at fair value. However, the shock will not have a similar effect on the carrying amount of the related insurance liabilities that are measured based on locked-in assumptions or on management's long-term expectations. Consequently, the different measurement bases for assets and liabilities lead to increased volatility in IFRS-EU net income and shareholders' equity. Aegon has classified a significant part of its investment portfolio as 'available-for-sale', which is one of the main reasons why the economic shocks tested have a different impact on net income than on shareholders' equity. Unrealized gains and losses on these assets are not recognized in the income statement but are booked through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserves in shareholders' equity, unless impaired. As a result, economic sensitivities predominantly impact shareholders' equity but leave net income unaffected. The effect of movements of the revaluation reserve on capitalization ratios and capital adequacy are minimal. Aegon's target ratio for the composition of its capital base is based on shareholders' equity excluding the revaluation reserve.\n\nThe sensitivities do not reflect what the net income for the period would have been if risk variables had been different because the analysis is based on the exposures in existence at the reporting date rather than on those that actually occurred during the year. Nor are the results of the sensitivities intended to be an accurate prediction of Aegon's future shareholders' equity or earnings. The analysis does not take into account the impact of future new business, which is an important component of Aegon's future earnings. It also does not consider all methods available to management to respond to changes in the financial environment, such as changing investment portfolio allocations or adjusting premiums and crediting rates. Furthermore, the results of the analyses cannot be extrapolated for wider variations since effects do not tend to be linear.\n\nConcentration risk for financial risks are measured and managed at the following levels:\n\n- \u25a0 Concentration per risk type: Risk exposures are measured per risk type as part of Aegon's internal economic framework. A risk tolerance framework is in place which sets risk limits per risk type to target desired risk balance and promote diversification across risk types;\n- \u25a0 Concentration per counterparty: Risk exposure is measured and risk limits are in place per counterparty as part of the Counterparty Name Limit Policy; and\n- \u25a0 Concentration per sector, geography and asset class: Aegon's investment strategy is translated in investment mandates for its internal and external asset managers. Through these investment mandates limits on sector, geography and asset class are set. Compliance monitoring of the investment mandates is done by the insurance operating companies.\n\nMoreover, concentration of financial risks are measured in Aegon business planning cycle. As part of business planning, the resilience of Aegon's business strategy is tested in several extreme event scenarios. In the Adverse Financial scenario, financial markets are stressed without assuming diversification across different market factors. Within the projection certain management actions may be implemented when management deems this necessary.\n\nAegon's significant financial risks and related financial information are explained in the order as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Credit risk\n- \u25a0 Equity market risk and other investment risks\n- \u25a0 Interest rate risk\n- \u25a0 Currency exchange risk\n- \u25a0 Liquidity risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\nAs premiums and deposits are received, these funds are invested to pay for future policyholder obligations. For general account products, Aegon typically bears the risk for investment performance which is equal to the return of principal and interest. Aegon is exposed to credit risk on its general account fixed-income portfolio (debt securities, mortgages and private placements), over-thecounter derivatives and reinsurance contracts. Some issuers have defaulted on their financial obligations for various reasons, including bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy, downturns in real estate values, operational failure and fraud. During financial downturns, Aegon can incur defaults or other reductions in the value of these securities and loans, which could have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition. Investments for account of policyholders are excluded as the policyholder bears the credit risk associated with the investments.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Money market and short-term investments\n\nThe collateral reported for the money market and short-term investments are related to tri-party repurchase agreements (repos). Within tri-party repos Aegon invests under short-term reverse repurchase agreements and the counterparty posts collateral to a third party custodian. The collateral posted is typically high-quality, short-term securities and is only accessible for or available to Aegon in the event the counterparty defaults.\n\n## Mortgage loans\n\nThe real estate collateral for mortgages includes both residential and commercial properties. The collateral for commercial mortgage loans in Aegon Americas is measured at fair value. At a minimum on an annual basis, a fair value is estimated for each individual real estate property that has been pledged as collateral. When a loan is originally provided, an external appraisal is obtained to estimate the value of the property. In subsequent years, the value is typically estimated internally using various professionally accepted valuation methodologies. Internal appraisals are performed by qualified, professionally accredited personnel. International valuation standards are used and the most significant assumptions made during the valuation of real estate are the current cost of reproducing or replacing the property, the value that the property's net earning power will support, and the value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties. Valuations are primarily supported by market evidence. For Aegon the Netherlands, collateral for the residential mortgages is measured as the foreclosure value which is indexed periodically.\n\nCash collateral for mortgage loans includes the savings that have been received to redeem the underlying mortgage loans at redemption date. These savings are part of the credit side of the statement of financial position, but reduce the credit risk for the mortgage loan as a whole.\n\nA substantial part of Aegon's Dutch residential mortgage loan portfolio benefits from guarantees by a Dutch government-backed trust (Stichting Waarborgfonds Eigen Woning) through the Dutch Mortgage loan Guarantee program (NHG). With exception of NHGbacked mortgage loans originated after January 1, 2014, for which a 10% lender-incurred haircut applies on realized losses on each defaulted loan, these guarantees cover all principal losses, missed interest payments and foreclosure costs incurred upon termination and settlement of defaulted mortgage loans when lender-specific terms and conditions of the guarantee are met. When not fully met, the trust may pay claims in part or in full, depending on the severity of the breach of terms and conditions. For each specific loan, the guarantee amortizes in line with an equivalent annuity mortgage loan. When the remaining loan balance at default does not exceed the amortized guarantee, it covers the full loss under its terms and conditions. Any loan balance in excess of this decreasing guarantee profile serves as a first loss position for the lender.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe master netting agreements column in the table relates to derivative liability positions which are used in Aegon's credit risk management. The offset in the master netting agreements column includes balances where there is a legally enforceable right of offset, but no intention to settle these balances on a net basis under normal circumstances. As a result, there is a net exposure for credit risk management purposes. However, as there is no intention to settle these balances on a net basis, they do not qualify for net presentation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Reinsurance assets\n\nThe collateral related to the reinsurance assets include assets in trust that are held by the reinsurer for the benefit of Aegon. The assets in trust can be accessed to pay policyholder benefits in the event the reinsurers fail to perform under the terms of their contract. Further information on the related reinsurance transactions is included in note/uni00A026 Reinsurance assets.\n\n## Other loans\n\nThe collateral included in the other column represents the policyholders account value for policy loans. The excess of the account value over the loan value is included in the surplus collateral column. For further information on the policy loans refer to note/uni00A022.1 Financial assets, excluding derivatives.\n\nThe total collateral includes both under- and over-collateralized positions. To present a net exposure of credit risk, the overcollateralization, which is shown in the surplus collateral column, is extracted from the total collateral.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nAegon manages credit risk exposure by individual counterparty, sector and asset class, including cash positions. Normally, Aegon mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into credit support agreement, where practical, and in ISDA master netting agreements for most of Aegon's legal entities to facilitate Aegon's right to offset credit risk exposure. Main counterparties to these transactions are investment banks which are typically rated 'A' or higher. The credit support agreement will normally dictate",

Transactions requiring Aegon or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, equity swaps, currency swaps and credit swaps. Collateral received is mainly cash (USD and EUR). The credit support agreements that outline the acceptable collateral require high-quality instruments to be posted. Over the last three years, there was no default with any derivatives counterparty. The credit risk associated with financial assets subject to a master netting agreement is eliminated only to the extent that financial liabilities due to the same counterparty will be settled after the assets are realized. Eligible derivative transactions are traded via Central Clearing Houses as required by EMIR and the Dodd-Frank act. Credit risk in these transactions is mitigated through posting of initial and variation margins.\n\nAegon may also mitigate credit risk in reinsurance contracts by including downgrade clauses that allow the recapture of business, retaining ownership of assets required to support liabilities ceded or by requiring the reinsurer to hold assets in trust. For the resulting net credit risk exposure, Aegon employs deterministic and stochastic credit risk modeling in order to assess the Group's credit risk profile, associated earnings and capital implications due to various credit loss scenarios.\n\nAegon operates a Credit Name Limit Policy (CNLP) under which limits are placed on the aggregate exposure that it has to any one counterparty. Limits are placed on the exposure at both group level and individual country units. The limits also vary by a rating system, which is a composite of the main rating agencies (S&P, Moody's and Fitch) and Aegon's internal rating of the counterparty. If an exposure exceeds the stated limit, then the exposure must be reduced to the limit for the country unit and rating category as soon as possible. Exceptions to these limits can only be made after explicit approval from Aegon's Group Risk and Capital Committee (GRCC). The policy is reviewed regularly.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, there was one violation of the Credit Name Limit Policy at Group level (2019:/uni00A0two). This related to the Republic of Turkey and is being closely monitored. The breach will be resolved by the disposal of Aegon Turkey, which is expected to close in the course of 2021.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Aegon's largest corporate credit exposures are to Wilton Re Holdings Ltd, American United Mutual Insurance,/uni00A0SCOR and Reinsurance Group of America and Munich Re. Aegon had large government exposures, the largest being in the Americas, the Netherlands and Germany. Highly rated government bonds and government exposure domestically issued and owned in local currency are excluded from the Credit Name Limit Policy.\n\nAegon group level long-term counterparty exposure limits are as follows:\n\n## Group limits per credit rating\n\n| Amounts in EUR million   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| AAA                      |    900 |    900 |\n| AA                       |    900 |    900 |\n| A                        |    675 |    675 |\n| BBB                      |    450 |    450 |\n| BB                       |    250 |    250 |\n| B                        |    125 |    125 |\n| CCC or lower             |     50 |     50 |\n\n## Credit rating\n\nThe ratings distribution of general account portfolios of Aegon's major reporting units, excluding reinsurance assets, are presented in the table that follows, organized by rating category and split by assets that are valued at fair value and assets that are valued at amortized cost. Aegon uses a composite rating based on a combination of the external ratings of S&P, Moody's, Fitch and National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC which is for US only) and internal ratings. The rating used is the lower of the external rating and the internal rating.",

The loan to value (LTV) amounted to approximately 55% (2019:/uni00A053%). Of the portfolio 1% (2019:/uni00A01%) is in delinquency (defined as 60 days in arrears). In 2020, Aegon Americas recognized EUR/uni00A01 million of net impairments (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00 million net impairments) on this portfolio. In 2020, there were no foreclosures (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00 million) and no impairments or recoveries associated with foreclosed loans (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00 million).\n\nThe fair value of Aegon the Netherlands mortgage loan portfolio as per December 31, 2020, amounted to EUR/uni00A033,761 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A033,111 million). The LTV amounted to approximately 66% (2019:/uni00A067%). A significant part of the portfolio 45% (2019:/uni00A049%) is government guaranteed. Of the portfolio, 0.1% (2019:/uni00A00.1%) is in delinquency (defined as 60 days in arrears). Impairments in 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A00 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00 million). During the last ten years defaults of the portfolio have been 5 basis points on average.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAegon's investments in unconsolidated structured entities such as RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs and investment funds are presented in the line item 'Investments' of the statement of financial position. Aegon's interests in these unconsolidated structured entities can be characterized as basic interests, Aegon does not have loans, derivatives, guarantees or other interests related to these investments. Any existing commitments such as future purchases of interests in investment funds are disclosed in note/uni00A045 Commitments and contingencies.\n\nFor debt instruments, specifically for RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amount which is reflected in the credit risk concentration table regarding debt securities and money market investments. To manage credit risk Aegon invests primarily in senior notes of/uni00A0RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs. Additional information on credit ratings for Aegon's investments in RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs/uni00A0are disclosed in the sections that describe per category of debt securities the composition and impairment assessments. The composition of the RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs/uni00A0portfolios of Aegon are widely dispersed looking at the individual amount per entity, therefore Aegon only has non-controlling interests in individual unconsolidated structured entities. Furthermore these investments are not originated by Aegon.\n\nExcept for commitments as noted in note/uni00A045 Commitments and contingencies,/uni00A0Aegon did not provide, nor is required to provide financial or other support to unconsolidated structured entities. Nor does Aegon have intentions to provide financial or other support to unconsolidated structured entities in which Aegon has an interest or previously had an interest.\n\nFor RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs/uni00A0in which Aegon has an interest at reporting date, the following table presents total income received from those interests. The Investments column reflects the carrying values recognized in the statement of financial position of Aegon's interests in RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs.\n\n|                                        | Total income 2020   | Total income 2020                          | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 2020                                   | Interest income     | Total gains and  losses on sale of  assets | Total                      | Investments                |\n| Residential mortgage-backed securities | 120                 | 25                                         | 144                        | 2,565                      |\n| Commercial mortgage-backed securities  | 128                 | 92                                         | 220                        | 3,599                      |\n| Asset-backed securities                | 38                  | (5)                                        | 34                         | 2,159                      |\n| ABSs - Other                           | 79                  | 104                                        | 183                        | 1,965                      |\n| Total                                  | 366                 | 215                                        | 581                        | 10,289                     |\n\n|                                        | Total income 2019   | Total income 2019                          | December/uni00A031, 2019   | December/uni00A031, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 2019                                   | Interest income     | Total gains and  losses on sale of  assets | Total                      | Investments                |\n| Residential mortgage-backed securities | 140                 | 97                                         | 237                        | 2,729                      |\n| Commercial mortgage-backed securities  | 138                 | 182                                        | 320                        | 4,153                      |\n| Asset-backed securities                | 47                  | (1)                                        | 45                         | 1,642                      |\n| ABSs - Other                           | 87                  | 81                                         | 168                        | 2,258                      |\n| Total                                  | 412                 | 358                                        | 769                        | 10,782                     |",

Both the economy and markets fell precipitously in the first quarter with the global spread of COVID-19. In the US, Stay-at-home orders started in mid-March and auto production ceased at the same time. Furthermore, in markets the Federal Reserve (FED) eased the Federal Funds Target Rate by 100 bps, the U.S. 10-year treasury rate fell 120 bps to 70 bps, oil prices dropped from $70 a barrel to $20, the S&P 500 fell 34% and credit spreads widened. In the economy, nonfarm payrolls fell by 22 million jobs or 14% in the first couple of months of 2020, while nominal GDP contracted by 10% in the first half of 2020.\n\nAround the end of April markets and the economy began to turn. This was fueled by optimism that by following safety procedures outlined by epidemiologists the economy would normalize. The US started easing stay-at-home orders and businesses began reopening. Ford and GM resumed Auto production in mid-May. The result was that by June the S&P 500 was down only 8%, corporate bond spreads, which had widened from 125 to 366, had tightened back to 175 and employment had increased by 8 million jobs since earlier in the year. As the summer progressed, optimism grew that vaccines would be available as early as the US presidential election and life would become close to normal in the second half of 2020. As summer turned to fall, however, the recovery slowed with certain sectors recovering while others struggled. Although durable and non-durable goods consumption exceeded pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter, service related consumption lagged. Durables were up 13% and non-durables 4% while the larger services segment contracted by 8%. This reflected the ongoing pressure on businesses in dining, travel, leisure, and retail. Capital investment was also still down for the year by the end of the third quarter.",

In the second half of December, a second wave of COVID-19 virus infection was sweeping Europe and the US, and the economy started to slow as lockdowns were reinstituted in many locations. Some vaccines were approved, people were being inoculated and the US congress approved USD 900 million of fiscal stimulus to hopefully bridge the gap to normalization. Although the next six months is expected to be difficult, the market expects strong earnings and GDP growth in the second half of 2021. The market also expects to see the FED on hold for several years, due to low inflation concerns, long-term economic damage and full recovery in employment and aggregate consumer demand. Rates are priced to remain low and inflation subdued./uni00A0\n\nThe European economy contracted sharply during 2020. The lockdowns implemented in the first half of the year led to an unprecedented large fall in GDP. Activity did rebound sharply in summer when restrictions were, for a large part, lifted. However, a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections in the autumn again led to lockdowns and restrictions being implemented. These were less detrimental compared to those in the first half, but nonetheless resulted in a second fall in output./uni00A0\n\nGovernments intervened to limit the economic fallout. Fiscal authorities implemented employment and business support schemes, such that sectors most impacted would suffer less permanent damage. This resulted in large deficits and another jump in government debt levels. The ECB ensured a proper functioning financial market by implementing a new QE program, which was several times enlarged during the year. At the same time, the introduction of Pandemic Emergency Long Term Refinancing Operations (PELTRO) provided commercial banks with sufficient liquidity at favorable rates, to support the bank lending channel./uni00A0The European Union eventually approved the formation of a EUR/uni00A0750bln 'recovery fund' after disagreements about the size and the conditionalities attached. This was perceived positively by financial markets as it reduces the risk of European disintegration and supports countries most impacted.\n\nSince January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union. Just before the Brexit transition period ended after December 31, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed on a new 'Trade and Cooperation Agreement' outlining their post-Brexit relationship.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nAegon regularly monitors industry sectors and individual debt securities for indicators of impairment. These indicators may include one or more of the following: 1) deteriorating market to book ratio, 2) increasing industry risk factors, 3) deteriorating financial condition of the issuer, 4) covenant violations by the issuer, 5) high probability of bankruptcy of the issuer, or 6) downgrades by internationally recognized credit rating agency. Additionally, for asset-backed securities, cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral are monitored. A security is impaired if there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset that has a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows.\n\nIn the sections below a description is provided on the composition of the categories of debt securities and money market investments. Individual issuers rated below investment grade in any sector which have unrealized loss positions greater than EUR/uni00A025 million are disclosed separately. Furthermore, quality ratings of investment portfolios are based on a composite of the main rating agencies (S&P and Moody's) and Aegon's internal rating of the counterparty.",

Detailed cash flow models using the current collateral pool and capital structure on the portfolio are updated and reviewed quarterly. Model output is generated under base and stresscase scenarios. Aegon's RMBS asset specialists utilize widely recognized industry modeling software to perform a loan-by-loan, bottom-up approach to modeling. Key assumptions used in the models are projected defaults, loss severities, and prepayments. Each of these key assumptions varies greatly based on the significantly diverse characteristics of the current collateral pool for each security. Loan-to-value, loan size, and borrower credit history are some of the key characteristics used to determine the level of assumption that is utilized. Defaults were estimated by identifying the loans that are in various delinquency buckets and defaulting a certain percentage of them over the near-term and long-term. Assumed defaults on delinquent loans are dependent on the specific security's collateral attributes and historical performance.\n\nPrepayments and loss severity assumptions were determined by obtaining historical rates from broader market data and by adjusting those rates for vintage, specific pool performance, collateral type, mortgage insurance and estimated loan modifications. Prepayments were estimated by examining historical averages of prepayment activity on the underlying collateral. Quantitative ranges of significant assumptions within Aegon's modeling process for Prime Jumbo, Alt-A, Negative Amortization and subprime RMBS are as follows: prepayment assumptions range from approximately 0% to 73% with a weighted average of approximately 10% (2019:/uni00A08%), the increase compared to prior year is related to a change in the model from using 'delinquent' loans to using 'defaulted' loans. Assumed loan defaults range from 0% to 39% with a weighted average of approximately 20% (2019:/uni00A020%) and are dependent on the specific security's collateral attributes and historical performance, while loss severity assumptions range from approximately -150% to 105%, with a weighted average of approximately 49% (2019:/uni00A050%).",

Aegon Asset Management uses its own proprietary cash flow tools to analyze and stress test RMBS transactions. The key input parameters are default rates and loss given default assumptions, which are established based on historical pool characteristics and current loan level data. Cash flows for each bond are modelled in 225 scenarios of varying severity, ranging from our base case to extreme stress to even unrealistic scenarios to establish breaking points of the tranche. The model takes all deal characteristics, such as waterfall or reserve funds, into account and gives us detailed insight in the risk of principal loss or deferral of contractual cash flows.\n\nThe total gross unrealized loss on available-for-sale RMBS of Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands amounted to EUR/uni00A017 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A018 million), of which EUR/uni00A017 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A018 million) relates to positions of Aegon Americas. The total net unrealized gain on available-for-sale RMBS was EUR/uni00A0232 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0288 million), including a EUR/uni00A0228 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0284 million) net unrealized gain relating to positions of Aegon Americas.\n\nThe United States' non-agency RMBS saw significant spread widening across deal types during the first quarter of 2020 primarily driven by pandemic-induced economic contraction, broad market volatility and mortgage Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) liquidations. Spreads have tightened substantially to near pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2020, facilitated by unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus. Government fiscal stimulus, temporary loan forbearance programs and accumulated home equity have moderated collateral performance deterioration. Approximately 40% of COVID-19 related delinquencies have cured and another round of government assistance as well as enhanced unemployment benefits should further support recovery in the mortgage market./uni00A0\n\nIn general, the European housing market was strong at the start of the year against solid economic fundamentals. The shutdowns that followed the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a sharp negative impact on these economic fundamentals. Most financial assets weakened considerably in March, after which an improvement followed. This also holds for asset backed securities. Spreads on these assets rose significantly in March, after which a gradual spread normalization followed. This recovery was helped by the ECB which increased its asset purchase program, including ABS. This means that spreads have fallen from their March peaks, but spreads are still slightly higher than at the beginning of 2020, leading to a marginally positive total return over 2020.\n\nThere are no individual issuers rated below investment grade in this RMBS sector which have unrealized loss position greater than EUR/uni00A025 million.\n\nThe fair values of Aegon Americas' available-for-sale (AFS) RMBS instruments were determined as follows:\n\n|      | Level II   |   Level III | Total 2020   | Level II   |   Level III | Total 2019   |\n|------|------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|--------------|\n| RMBS | 2,224      |          24 | 2,248        | 2,188      |          34 | 2,222        |\n\n## Commercial mortgage-backed securities\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands hold EUR/uni00A02,982 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03,440 million) of AFS commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), of which EUR/uni00A02,970 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03,427 million) is held by Aegon Americas and EUR/uni00A012 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A013 million) by Aegon the Netherlands. CMBS are securitizations of underlying pools of mortgages on commercial real estate. The underlying mortgages have varying risk characteristics and are pooled together and sold in different rated tranches. The company's CMBS include conduit, large loan, single borrower, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations (CRE CDOs), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), government agency, and franchise loan receivable trusts.\n\nThe total gross unrealized loss on available-for-sale CMBS of Aegon Americas amounted to EUR/uni00A040 million as of December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A06 million). The total net unrealized gain on the available-for-sale CMBS as of December 31, 2020, is EUR/uni00A0133 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0157 million), of which EUR/uni00A0133 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0104 million) relates to positions of Aegon Americas. The COVID-19 pandemic had an immediate impact on commercial real estate and the CMBS sector, especially in the hospitality and retail segments where shelter-in-place orders had a profound impact on property cash flows. CMBS hospitality and retail delinquency rates experienced a dramatic increase in the second quarter; however, have found stabilization and improvement in the second half of 2020 driven by debt service relief and the reopening of the economy. Despite forced selling and uncertainty driving spread volatility at the onset of the crisis, CMBS spreads in the senior part of the capital structure have retraced and found support. Although subordinated and lower quality spreads have also retraced some of their widening, they remain wide from a historical perspective due to credit uncertainty and elevated risk of ratings migration.",

Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, Aegon Americas has no investments in CMBS (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0nil), which are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\n| CMBS by quality      | AAA   |   AA |   A |   BBB |   <BBB | Total  amortized cost   | Total fair  value   |\n|----------------------|-------|------|-----|-------|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| CMBS                 | 2,013 |  600 | 138 |    34 |     51 | 2,836                   | 2,970               |\n| At December 31, 2020 | 2,013 |  600 | 138 |    34 |     51 | 2,836                   | 2,970               |\n\n| CMBS by quality      | AAA   |   AA |   A |   BBB |   <BBB | Total  amortized cost   | Total fair  value   |\n|----------------------|-------|------|-----|-------|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| CMBS                 | 2,540 |  639 | 109 |     7 |     29 | 3,323                   | 3,427               |\n| At December 31, 2019 | 2,540 |  639 | 109 |     7 |     29 | 3,323                   | 3,427               |\n\nCMBS of Aegon Americas are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis. Detailed cash flow models using the current collateral pool and capital structure on the portfolio are updated and reviewed quarterly. Model output is generated under base and several stress-case scenarios by Aegon's internal CMBS asset specialists. For conduit securities, a widely recognized industry modeling software is used to perform a loan-by-loan, bottom-up approach. For non-conduit securities, CMBS asset specialists works closely with Aegon's real estate valuation group to determine underlying asset valuation and risk. Both methodologies incorporate external estimates on the property market, capital markets, property cash flows, and loan structure. Results are then closely analyzed by the asset specialist to determine whether or not a principal or interest loss is expected to occur.\n\nAs the remaining unrealized losses in the CMBS portfolio relate to holdings where Aegon expects to receive full principal and interest, Aegon does not consider the underlying investments to be impaired as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThere are no individual issuers rated below investment grade in the CMBS sector which have unrealized loss position greater than EUR/uni00A025 million.\n\nThe fair values of Aegon Americas' available-for-sale (AFS) CMBS instruments/uni00A0were determined as follows:\n\n|      | Level II   | Level III   | Total 2020   | Level II   | Level III   | Total 2019   |\n|------|------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|--------------|\n| CMBS | 2,970      | -           | 2,970        | 3,427      | -           | 3,427        |\n\n## Asset-backed securities\n\nAegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands hold EUR/uni00A03,718 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03,332 million) of AFS ABS instruments of which EUR/uni00A02,004 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A02,239 million) is held by Aegon Americas and EUR/uni00A01,714 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01,093 million) by Aegon the Netherlands. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, Aegon Americas has investments in ABS of EUR/uni00A02 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03 million), which are classified as fair value through profit or loss. ABS are securitizations of underlying pools of credit card receivables, auto financing loans, small business loans, bank loans, and other receivables. The underlying assets of the asset-backed securities have been pooled together and sold in tranches with varying credit ratings.\n\nThe total gross unrealized loss on available-for-sale ABS of Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands amounted to EUR/uni00A017 million as of December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A09 million). Aegon Americas has EUR/uni00A011 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A05 million) of this gross unrealized loss and Aegon the Netherlands, EUR/uni00A06 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03 million).\n\nIn the United States, spreads of asset-backed securities widened in March and April upon the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown. However, spreads tightened substantially throughout 2020 beginning in May and June, especially in on-the-run asset-backed sectors, as businesses have reopened and with reduced supply of new issue ABS bonds. Government provided stimulus to the consumer mitigated collateral performance deterioration in 2020, however, weakness in consumer oriented ABS sectors could re-emerge if additional government stimulus is not enacted and unemployment levels remain high in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, the European ABS market was shaken up by the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially in March and the beginning of April, there were severe spread widening across all European ABS sectors. In May there was a very strong rebound in spreads across all ABS sectors in line with the strong sentiment in the broader financial markets. The strong sentiment was supported by the substantial fiscal and monetary support, slowly re-opening of the economy and the abating fear of a second wave of COVID-19 infections. In November, the market recovered further on the back of positive news about vaccine developments./uni00A0",

In each case where a recovery was taken on structured securities, improvements in underlying cash flows for the security were documented and modeling results improved significantly. Recoveries on non-structured securities were supported by documented credit events combined with significant market value improvements.\n\n## Past due and impaired assets\n\nThe tables that follow provide information on past due and individually impaired financial assets for the whole Aegon Group. An asset is past due when a counterparty has failed to make a payment when contractually due. Assets are impaired when an impairment loss has been charged to the income statement relating to this asset. After the impairment loss is reversed in subsequent periods, the asset is no longer considered to be impaired. When the terms and conditions of financial assets have been renegotiated, the terms and conditions of the new agreement apply in determining whether the financial assets are past due.\n\nAegon's policy is to pursue realization of the collateral in an orderly manner as and when liquidity permits. Aegon generally does not use the non-cash collateral for its own operations.\n\n|                                                | 2020        | 2020         | 2020     | 2020   | 2019        | 2019         | 2019     | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------|\n| Past due but not impaired assets               | 0-6  months | 6-12  months | > 1 year | Total  | 0-6  months | 6-12  months | > 1 year | Total  |\n| Debt securities - carried at fair value        | 369         | 34           | 9        | 412    | 70          | 21           | 10       | 101    |\n| Mortgage loans                                 | 169         | 55           | 1        | 226    | 198         | 3            | -        | 201    |\n| Other loans                                    | 24          | 8            | 5        | 36     | 35          | 4            | 4        | 43     |\n| Accrued interest                               | 5           | 1            | 1        | 8      | 1           | -            | 1        | 2      |\n| Other financial assets - carried at fair value | -           | -            | -        | -      | 22          | -            | -        | 22     |\n| At December 31                                 | 567         | 98           | 16       | 681    | 326         | 28           | 16       | 370    |\n\n| Impaired financial assets                      |   Carrying amount  2020 | Carrying amount  2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Shares                                         |                      38 | 30                      |\n| Debt securities - carried at fair value        |                     789 | 945                     |\n| Mortgage loans                                 |                      36 | 58                      |\n| Other loans                                    |                       3 | 3                       |\n| Other financial assets - carried at fair value |                       2 | 4                       |\n| At December 31                                 |                     867 | 1,039                   |",

A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment. Significant or prolonged decline is generally defined within Aegon as an unrealized loss position for more than six months or a fair value of less than 80% of the cost price of the investment. Additionally, as part of an ongoing process, internal equity analysts actively monitor earnings releases, company fundamentals, new developments and industry trends for any signs of possible impairment.\n\nThese factors typically require significant management judgment. The impairment review process has resulted in EUR/uni00A021 million of impairment charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A07 million) for Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are EUR/uni00A058 million of gross unrealized gains and EUR/uni00A014 million of gross unrealized losses in the equity portfolio of Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A047 million of gross unrealized gains and EUR/uni00A024 million of gross unrealized losses).\n\nThe table below represents the unrealized gains and losses on share positions held by Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands.\n\n|                   | Cost basis   | Carrying value   | Net unrealized  gains / (losses)   | Carrying value of  securities with  gross unrealized  gains   | Gross  unrealized  gains   | Carrying value of  securities with  gross unrealized  losses   | Gross  unrealized  losses   |\n|-------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| December 31, 2020 |              |                  |                                    |                                                               |                            |                                                                |                             |\n| Shares            | 222          | 266              | 44                                 | 237                                                           | 58                         | 29                                                             | (14)                        |\n| December 31, 2019 |              |                  |                                    |                                                               |                            |                                                                |                             |\n| Shares            | 290          | 312              | 23                                 | 254                                                           | 47                         | 58                                                             | (24)                        |\n\nThe composition of shares by industry sector in an unrealized loss position held by Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019 is presented in the following table.\n\n|                             | 2020                                                   | 2020              | 2019                                                   | 2019              |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Unrealized losses on shares | Carrying value of  instruments with  unrealized losses | Unrealized losses | Carrying value of  instruments with  unrealized losses | Unrealized losses |\n| Financials                  | 24                                                     | (10)              | 28                                                     | (10)              |\n| Other                       | 5                                                      | (4)               | 30                                                     | (14)              |\n| Total                       | 29                                                     | (14)              | 58                                                     | (24)              |\n\n## Impairment losses on shares\n\nThe table below provides the length of time the shares held by Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands were below cost prior to their impairment in 2020 and 2019.\n\n|             | 0- 6 months    |\n|-------------|----------------|\n|             | In million EUR |\n| 2020 Shares | (4)            |\n| 2019        |                |\n| Shares      | (2)            |\n\n## Equity market risk and other investments risk\n\nFluctuations in the equity, real estate and capital markets have affected Aegon's profitability, capital position and sales of equity related products in the past and may continue to do so. Exposure to equity, real estate and capital markets exists in both assets and liabilities. Asset exposure exists through direct equity investment, where Aegon bears all or most of the volatility in returns and investment performance risk. Equity market exposure is also present in insurance and investment contracts for policyholders where funds are invested in equities, backing variable annuities, unit-linked products and mutual funds. Although most of the risk remains with the policyholder, lower investment returns can reduce the asset management fee earned by Aegon on the asset balance in these products. In addition, some of this business has minimum return or accumulation guarantees.",

The sensitivity of shareholders' equity and net income to changes in equity markets reflects changes in the market value of Aegon's portfolio, changes in DPAC amortization, contributions to pension plans for Aegon's employees and the strengthening of the guaranteed minimum benefits, when applicable. Aegon generally has positive income benefits from equity market increases and negative impacts from equity market declines as it earns fees on policyholder account balances and provides minimum guarantees for account values. Aegon uses options and other equity derivatives to provide protection against the negative impact of equity market declines. Net income and shareholders' equity in 2020 are generally less sensitive compared to 2019 mainly reflecting the new Macro/uni00A0Hedge program in the Americas executed in July 2020./uni00A0\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of net income and shareholders' equity to equity markets\n\n| Immediate change of   | Estimated approximate effects  on net income   | Estimated approximate effects  on shareholders' equity   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                  |                                                |                                                          |\n| Equity increase 10%   | 146                                            | 394                                                      |\n| Equity decrease 10%   | (208)                                          | (199)                                                    |\n| Equity increase 25%   | 290                                            | 725                                                      |\n| Equity decrease 25%   | (541)                                          | (715)                                                    |\n| 2019                  |                                                |                                                          |\n| Equity increase 10%   | 307                                            | 450                                                      |\n| Equity decrease 10%   | (374)                                          | (525)                                                    |\n| Equity increase 25%   | 721                                            | 1,083                                                    |\n| Equity decrease 25%   | (456)                                          | (837)                                                    |\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nAegon bears interest rate risk with many of its products. In cases where cash flows are highly predictable, investing in assets that closely match the cash flow profile of the liabilities can offset this risk. For some Aegon country units, local capital markets are not well developed, which prevents the complete matching of assets and liabilities for those businesses. For some products, cash flows are less predictable as a result of policyholder actions that can be affected by the level of interest rates.\n\nIn periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase. Premiums in flexible premium policies may decrease as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This activity may result in cash payments by Aegon requiring the sale of invested assets at a time when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates; this may result in realized investment losses. These cash payments to policyholders result in a decrease in total invested assets and a decrease in net income. Among other things, early withdrawals may also require accelerated amortization of DPAC, which in turn reduces net income.\n\nDuring periods of sustained low interest rates, Aegon may not be able to preserve margins as a result of minimum interest rate guarantees and minimum guaranteed crediting rates provided on policies. Also, investment earnings may be lower because the interest earnings on new fixed-income investments are likely to have declined with the market interest rates. Mortgage loans and redeemable bonds in the investment portfolio are more likely to be repaid as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates and Aegon may be required to reinvest the proceeds in securities bearing lower interest rates. Accordingly, net income declines as a result of a decrease in the spread between returns on the investment portfolio and the interest rates either credited to policyholders or assumed in reserves.\n\nAegon manages interest rate risk closely, taking into account all of the complexity regarding policyholder behavior and management action. Aegon employs sophisticated interest rate measurement techniques and actively uses derivatives and other risk mitigation tools",

Aegon operates an Investment & Counterparty Risk policy that limits the amount of interest rate risk to which the Group is exposed. All derivative use is governed by Aegon's Derivative Use Policy. A detailed description on the use of derivatives within Aegon is included in note/uni00A024 Derivatives.\n\nThe following table shows interest rates at the end of each of the last five years.\n\n|                          | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2016    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 3-month US LIBOR         | 0.24%   | 1.91%   | 2.81%   | 1.69%   | 1.00%   |\n| 3-month EURIBOR          | (0.55%) | (0.38%) | (0.31%) | (0.33%) | (0.32%) |\n| 10-year US Treasury      | 0.91%   | 1.91%   | 2.69%   | 2.41%   | 2.43%   |\n| 10-year Dutch government | (0.48%) | (0.06%) | 0.39%   | 0.53%   | 0.35%   |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in the table below shows an estimate of the effect of a parallel shift in the yield curves on net income and shareholders' equity arising from the impact on general account investments and offset due to liabilities from insurance and investment contracts. Timing and valuation differences between assets and liabilities may cause short-term reductions in net income as rates rise. Rising interest rates would also cause the fair value of the available-for-sale bond portfolio to decline and the level of unrealized gains could become too low to support recoverability of the full deferred tax asset triggering an allowance charge to income./uni00A0The offsetting economic gain on the insurance and investment contracts is however not fully reflected in the sensitivities because many of these liabilities are not measured at fair value. The short to medium term reduction in net income due to rising interest rates would be offset by higher net income in later years, all else being equal. Therefore, higher interest rates are not considered a longterm risk to the Group. However, a long sustained period of low interest rates will erode net income due to lower returns earned on reinvestments and due to lower long term returns from decreased overall portfolio yields.\n\n| Parallel movement of yield curve   | Estimated approximate effects  on net income   | Estimated approximate effects  on shareholders' equity   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                               |                                                |                                                          |\n| Shift up 100 basis points          | 187                                            | (2,316)                                                  |\n| Shift down 100 basis points        | (462)                                          | 2,064                                                    |\n| 2019                               |                                                |                                                          |\n| Shift up 100 basis points          | 370                                            | (3,263)                                                  |\n| Shift down 100 basis points        | (585)                                          | 2,499                                                    |\n\nDue to the low interest rate environment in 2020 the impact on net income and shareholders' equity became less sensitive compared to 2019./uni00A0\n\nThe hedge strategy targets minimal mismatch according to the Aegon economic framework (which broadly aligns with Solvency II Own Funds) and stabilizes Solvency II ratio volatility./uni00A0\n\n## Currency exchange rate risk\n\nAs an international group, Aegon is subject to foreign currency translation risk. Foreign currency exposure exists mainly when policies are denominated in currencies other than the issuer's functional currency. Currency risk in the investment portfolios backing insurance and investment liabilities is managed using asset liability matching principles. Assets allocated to equity are kept in local currencies to the extent shareholders' equity is required to satisfy regulatory and self-imposed capital requirements. Therefore, currency exchange rate fluctuations will affect the level of shareholders' equity as a result of translation of subsidiaries into euro, the Group's presentation currency. Aegon holds the remainder of its capital base (perpetual capital securities, subordinated and senior debt) in various currencies in amounts that are targeted to correspond to the book value of the country units. This balancing mitigates currency translation impacts on shareholders' equity and leverage ratios. Aegon does not hedge the income streams from the main non-euro units and, as a result, earnings may fluctuate due to currency translation. As Aegon has significant business segments in the Americas and in the United Kingdom, the principal sources of exposure from currency fluctuations are from the differences between the US dollar and the euro and between the UK pound and the euro.

Each asset purchased and liability incurred has its own liquidity characteristics. Some liabilities are surrenderable while some assets, such as privately placed loans, mortgage loans, real estate and limited partnership interests, have low liquidity. If Aegon requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements and existing credit facilities, it may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices or in a timely manner. Liquidity risk is also affected by the use of collateralized financial derivatives to mitigate other risks.",

Potential cash demands are assessed under a stress scenario including spikes in disintermediation risk due to rising interest rates and concerns over Aegon's financial strength due to multiple downgrades of the Group's credit rating. At the same time, the liquidity of assets other than cash and government issues is assumed to be severely impaired for an extended period of time. All legal entities and Aegon Group must maintain enough liquidity in order to meet all cash needs under this extreme scenario.\n\nAegon held EUR/uni00A033,465 million of general account investments in cash, money market products and government bonds that are readily saleable or redeemable on demand (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A031,066 million). The Group expects to meet its obligations, even in a stressed liquidity event, from operating cash flows and the proceeds of maturing assets as well as these highly liquid assets. Further, the Group has access to back-up credit facilities, as disclosed in note/uni00A037 Borrowings, amounting to EUR/uni00A03,288 million which were unused at the end of the reporting period (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03,403 million).\n\nThe maturity analysis below shows the remaining contractual maturities of each category of financial liabilities (including coupon interest). When the counterparty has a choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is included on the basis of the earliest date on which it can be required to be paid. Financial liabilities that can be required to be paid on demand without any delay are reported in the category 'On demand.' If there is a notice period, it has been assumed that notice is given immediately and the repayment has been presented at the earliest date after the end of the notice period. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount reported is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the reporting date. For example, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the reporting date.\n\nTo manage the liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities, Aegon holds liquid assets comprising cash and cash equivalents and investment grade investment securities for which there is an active and liquid market. These assets can be readily sold to meet liquidity requirements. For this reason, Aegon believes that it is not necessary to disclose a maturity analysis in respect of these assets to enable users to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.\n\n| Maturity analysis - gross undiscounted  contractual cash flows  (for non-derivatives)   | On demand   | < 1 yr  amount   | 1 < 5 yrs  amount   | 5 < 10 yrs  amount   | > 10 yrs  amount   | Total  amount   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| 2020                                                                                    |             |                  |                     |                      |                    |                 |\n| Trust pass-through securities                                                           | -           | 8                | 33                  | 91                   | 58                 | 191             |\n| Subordinated loans                                                                      | -           | 103              | 382                 | 283                  | 2,842              | 3,610           |\n| Borrowings                                                                              | -           | 1,033            | 6,627               | 747                  | 1,002              | 9,410           |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                       | -           | 45               | 97                  | 60                   | 76                 | 278             |\n| Other financial liabilities                                                             | 5,333       | 2,238            | 197                 | 100                  | 126                | 7,993           |\n| Total financial liabilities (excluding  investment/insurance contracts)                 | 5,333       | 3,427            | 7,337               | 1,282                | 4,105              | 21,482          |\n| Investment contracts  1)                                                                | 16,699      | 2,458            | 1,878               | 1,072                | 795                | 22,903          |\n| Investment contracts for account of  policyholders  1)                                  | 30,515      | 27,513           | 8                   | 4                    | 3                  | 58,043          |\n| Total investment contracts                                                              | 47,214      | 29,971           | 1,886               | 1,077                | 798                | 80,946          |\n| 2019                                                                                    |             |                  |                     |                      |                    |                 |\n| Trust pass-through securities                                                           | -           | 9                | 36                  | 106                  | 67                 | 218             |\n| Subordinated loans                                                                      | -           | 109              | 437                 | 347                  | 3,077              | 3,971           |\n| Borrowings                                                                              | -           | 3,967            | 4,202               | 1,109                | 1,119              | 10,397          |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                       | -           | 51               | 120                 | 66                   | 92                 | 331             |\n| Other financial liabilities                                                             | 4,867       | 2,713            | 313                 | 96                   | 257                | 8,245           |\n| Total financial liabilities (excluding investment/ insurance contracts)                 | 4,867       | 6,798            | 4,988               | 1,658                | 4,520              | 22,831          |\n| Investment contracts  1)                                                                | 14,281      | 1,930            | 1,888               | 1,001                | 795                | 19,895          |\n| Investment contracts for account of  policyholders  1)                                  | 32,463      | 26,298           | 6                   | 3                    | 2                  | 58,772          |\n| Total investment contracts                                                              | 46,744      | 28,228           | 1,894               | 1,004                | 797                | 78,667          |\n\nAegon's liquidity management is based on expected claims and benefit payments rather than on the contractual maturities.

All reportable segments are involved in insurance or reinsurance business, asset management or services related to these activities. The reportable segments are:\n\n- \u25a0 Americas: one operating segment which covers business units in the United States and Brazil, including any of the units' activities located outside these countries;\n- \u25a0 The Netherlands: which covers businesses activities from Aegon the Netherlands;\n- \u25a0 United Kingdom: which covers businesses activities from Existing Business and Digital Solutions;\n- \u25a0 International: one operating segment which covers businesses operating in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Indonesia, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Romania, Spain and Portugal including any of the units' activities located outside these countries;\n- \u25a0 Asset Management: one operating segment which covers business activities from/uni00A0AAM Global Platforms, Strategic Partnerships and Other;\n- \u25a0 Holding and other activities: one operating segment which includes financing, employee and other administrative expenses of holding companies.\n\nAegon's segment information is prepared by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon's joint ventures and associated companies.\n\n## Change in operating segments\n\nAegon has changed the grouping of the operating segments included in the performance measure as of 2020. As per January 1, 2020 activities in Southern and Eastern Europe and Asia have been brought together in a new operating segment, International./uni00A0\n\nThe change in segment reporting does not have an impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of Aegon. The tables presented in this document have been updated to reflect this change.\n\n## Performance Measure\n\nAegon uses the non-IFRS-EU performance measure underlying earnings before tax./uni00A0Underlying earnings before tax reflects Aegon's profit from underlying business operations and mainly excludes components that relate to accounting mismatches that are dependent on market volatility, updates to best estimate actuarial and economic assumptions and model updates or events that are considered outside the normal course of business. There is no standardized meaning to these measures under IFRS-EU or any other recognized set of accounting standards.\n\nAegon believes that its performance measure underlying earnings before tax provides meaningful information about the underlying results of Aegon's business, including insight into the financial measures that Aegon's senior management uses in managing the business. Among other things, Aegon's senior management is compensated based in part on Aegon's results against targets using underlying earnings before tax. While many other insurers in Aegon's peer group present substantially similar performance measures, the performance measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the performance measures presented by other insurers.\n\nThe reconciliation from underlying earnings before tax to income before tax, being the most comparable IFRS-EU measure, is presented in the tables in this note.\n\nThe items that are excluded from underlying earnings before tax as described further below are: fair value items, realized gains or losses on investments, impairment charges/reversals, other income or charges, run-off businesses and share in earnings of joint ventures and associates.\n\nIncluded in underlying earnings before tax is management's best estimate expected return on these products. Any overor underperformance compared to management's expected return is excluded from underlying earnings before tax.\n\n## Fair value items\n\nFair value items include the over- or underperformance of investments and guarantees held at fair value for which management's best estimate investment return is included in underlying earnings before tax.\n\nIn addition, hedge ineffectiveness on hedge transactions, fair value changes on economic hedges without natural offset in earnings and for which no hedge accounting is applied and fair value movements on real estate are included under fair value items.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nCertain assets held by Aegon are carried at fair value and managed on a total return basis, with no offsetting changes in the valuation of related liabilities. These include assets such as investments in hedge funds, private equities, real estate (limited partnerships), convertible bonds and structured products. Underlying earnings before tax exclude any over- or underperformance compared to management's best estimate investment return on assets. Based on current holdings and asset returns, the long-term expected return on an annual basis is 3-10%, depending on asset class, including cash income and market value changes. The expected earnings from these asset classes are net of deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) where applicable.\n\nIn addition, certain products offered by Aegon Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a fair value basis and include the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities. The earnings on these products are impacted by movements in equity markets and risk-free interest rates. Short-term developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings.\n\nThe fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees of Aegon's businesses in the Netherlands and Japan are excluded from underlying earnings before tax, because management's best estimate expected return for these guarantees is set at zero. In addition, fair value items include market related results on the loyalty bonus reserves in the United Kingdom. The value of these reserves are directly related to policyholder investments which value is directly impacted by movements in equity and bond markets.\n\nHolding and other activities include certain issued bonds that are held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The interest rate risk on these bonds is hedged using swaps. The fair value movement resulting from changes in Aegon's credit spread used in the valuation of these bonds are excluded from underlying earnings before tax and reported under fair value items.\n\n## Realized gains or losses on investments\n\nRealized gains or losses on investments includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, mortgage loans and other loan portfolios.\n\n## Impairment charges/(reversals)\n\nImpairment charges/(reversals) include impairments on available-for-sale debt securities, shares including the effect of deferred policyholder acquisition costs, mortgage loans and other loan portfolios at amortized cost, joint ventures and associates. Impairment reversals include reversals on available-for-sale debt securities. For Aegon the Netherlands, the expected impairments on alternative assets classes (e.g. illiquid investments - including consumer loans and catastrophe bonds - and residential real estate) are allocated to underlying earnings in order to present management's best estimate investment return in underlying earnings. Deviations from the expected impairments are presented as part of impairment charges / (reversals) in non-underlying earnings.\n\n## Other income or charges\n\nOther income or charges includes the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Items which cannot be directly allocated to a specific line of business;\n- \u25a0 The impact of actuarial and economic assumption and model updates used to support calculations of our liabilities for insurance and investment contracts sold to policyholders and related assets (refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgement in applying accounting policies); and\n- \u25a0 Items that are outside the normal course of business, including restructuring charges.\n\nIn the Consolidated income statement, the restructuring charges are included in operating expenses. Actuarial assumption and model updates are recorded in 'Policyholder claims and benefits' in the Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Run-off businesses\n\nRun-off businesses include results of business units where management in earlier years has decided to exit the market and to runoff the existing block of business. This line only includes results related to the run-off of the remaining institutional spread-based business, structured settlements blocks of business, the life reinsurance business and the bank-owned and corporate-owned life insurance (BOLI/COLI) business in the United States. Aegon has other blocks of business for which sales have been discontinued and of which the earnings are included in underlying earnings before tax./uni00A0The size of these remaining blocks is small and in 2021 this segment, along with all other businesses, will be included as part of the main lines of business in underlying earnings./uni00A0\n\n## Share in earnings of joint ventures and associates\n\nEarnings from Aegon's joint ventures in China, India, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, and Aegon's associates in Brazil, France, the Netherlands and United Kingdom are reported as underlying earnings before tax.",

The Americas recorded other charges of EUR 1,110 million in 2020 mainly due to unfavorable impacts from model and assumption changes. In addition, the Americas incurred other charges due to a valuation allowance related to the ongoing rehabilitation process of a reinsurer, the restructuring of captives, and a provision for a settlement of class action litigation related to monthly deduction rate adjustments on certain universal life policies./uni00A0",

This reflects a charge of EUR/uni00A0460 million related to the lowering the long-term interest rate assumption from 4.25% to 2.75% and the corresponding adjustment of the separate account bond return assumptions. Non-economic assumption changes resulted in a charge of EUR/uni00A0345 million, mainly related to Universal Life premium persistency and an increase in mortality rate assumptions, as well as lowering the morbidity improvement assumption for Long-Term Care from 1.5% to 0.75% per year for the next 15 years. Assumption changes and model updates in the Netherlands led to a favorable impact of EUR/uni00A0225 million mainly related to favorable longevity assumption changes, partially offset by adverse impacts from mortgage prepayment model and expense assumption updates./uni00A0\n\nThe/uni00A02019 assumption changes and model updates amounted to a negative impact of EUR/uni00A0196 million and mainly relates to Aegon's businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands.

The grant price for these shares is equal to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding a plan year and January 15 of a plan year. The actual allocation of these shares to eligible employees depends on Aegon Group performance, the employee's unit performance and individual performance on predefined financial and non-financial performance indicators and targets, as well as the continued employment of the employee./uni00A0\n\nOnce allocated, the shares are deferred and cliff-vest two years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral year. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend during the deferral period. In specific circumstances Aegon's Supervisory Board can reclaim variable compensation that has already been allocated (but still unvested) or vested (claw back).\n\n## Variable Compensation Material Risk Takers\n\nMembers of the Executive Board and the Management Board as well as other senior employees are classified as 'Material Risk Takers' in accordance with the Solvency II Legal Framework (up to 2018 these employees were classified as 'Identified Staff' in accordance with Capital Requirements Directives). In line with these rules, variable compensation for Material Risk Takers is partially paid out directly after allocation in cash and partly in Aegon shares. These shares are deferred and cliff-vest three years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral year. The shares are conditionally granted at the start of the performance year. The grant price of these shares is equal to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding a plan year and January 15 of the plan year. The actual allocation of these shares to eligible employees depends on Aegon Group performance, the employee's unit performance and individual performance against predefined financial and non-financial performance indicators and targets, as well as the continued employment of the employee.\n\nBefore allocation and vesting, the Supervisory Board can decide to adjust an award downwards based on the annual ex-ante and expost risk assessments respectively, which takes into account significant and exceptional circumstances which were not (sufficiently) reflected in the initial performance assessment. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend during the deferral period.\n\nFor the Members of the Executive Board, the shares are subject to an additional holding period of two years. During this holding period it is not allowed to sell the vested shares, with the exception of shares withheld or sold to cover for the payment of any applicable taxes, social security premiums and possible other deductions by the government due for which the Company holds a withholding obligation in connection with the vesting of the shares. In specific circumstances Aegon's Supervisory Board can reclaim variable compensation that has already vested (claw back).\n\n## Shares as Fixed Compensation\n\nSelected members of the Management Board as well as other senior employees receive part of their fixed compensation in Aegon shares each pay round, next to receiving fixed compensation in cash. The grant price of these shares is equal to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding a plan year and January 15 of the plan year. Once allocated these shares are unconditional and do not depend on the continued employment of the employee. However, the shares are deferred and cliff-vest three years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral year. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend during the deferral period.\n\n## Shares as part of a Sign-on Arrangement\n\nEmployees may be offered a sign-on arrangement when joining Aegon, including the allocation of Aegon shares, within the applicable rules and regulations. Once allocated these shares depend on the continued employment of the employee. These shares are deferred and typically cliff-vest after one, two or three years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral year. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend during the deferral period.\n\nThe following overview contains the cumulative number of shares and their status in relation to active Long Term Incentive Plans, variable compensation allocated to Material Risk Takers, shares allocated as fixed compensation and shares allocated as part of a sign-on arrangement.",

The fair values for sign-on shares differed from the other shares when the commencement date was after January 2.\n\nAegon applies a net settlement option for participants in order to meet their income tax obligations when their shares vest. This means that Aegon will not sell shares on the market, but hold these shares within Aegon and settle directly with the tax authorities in cash rather than selling shares first./uni00A0\n\nRefer to the Remuneration Report for detailed information on conditional shares granted to the Executive Board.\n\n## 15 Impairment charges / (reversals)\n\n| Impairment charges / (reversals) comprise:                               | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Impairment charges on financial assets, excluding receivables            | 291    | 133    | 71     |\n| Impairment reversals on financial assets, excluding receivables          | (29)   | (73)   | (39)   |\n| Impairment charges and reversals on non-financial assets and receivables | 128    | 109    | 46     |\n| Total                                                                    | 391    | 169    | 78     |\n\n| Impairment charges on financial assets, excluding receivables, from:   |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Shares                                                                 |     42 |      7 |      5 |\n| Debt securities and money market instruments                           |    162 |     50 |     30 |\n| Loans                                                                  |     87 |     76 |     35 |\n| Total                                                                  |    291 |    133 |     71 |",

The settlement relates to a block of around 70,000 universal life policies on which Transamerica raised the monthly deduction rates in 2015 and 2016. These adjustments were necessitated by, among other factors, low long-term interest rates and changes in future mortality experience, and were in accordance with the contractual terms of the policies. Nonetheless, the increases were challenged by policyholders in several court cases. To remove the uncertainty of ongoing litigation for Aegon and its customers, the decision was made to settle with the plaintiffs./uni00A0In January 2019, a court approved the aforementioned settlement with universal life policyholders./uni00A0Resolution of this class action ended a number of other related cases, including other related class actions. Over 99% of affected policyholders participated in the settlement.

Compared to 2019 non-taxable income decreased due to less exempt income in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the enacted future corporate income tax rate will remain 25% (instead of the earlier enacted 21.7% as from January 1, 2021) thereby reversing the beneficial tax rate impact of 2018 and 2019. In the United Kingdom, the previously enacted reduction in tax rate was also repealed leading to an increase of corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% which resulted in a beneficial tax rate impact.\n\nTax credits mainly include tax benefits from United States investments that provide affordable housing to individuals and families that meet median household income requirements.\n\nOther taxes are lower than previous years due to unfavorable equity markets which yielded lower policyholder taxes in the United Kingdom and state tax benefits in the United States due to negative income.\n\nAdjustments to prior year mainly consist of a shift between current and deferred tax in the Netherlands due to the recalculation of the technical insurance provisions for tax purposes.\n\nIn 2019 'Other' mainly relates to the one-off tax benefit in the United Kingdom due to the release of the historic deferred tax balances held in respect of the pension scheme deficit when the defined benefit pension scheme moved to surplus.\n\nThe following tables present income tax related to components of other comprehensive income and retained earnings.\n\n|                                                                                                                    | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Items that will not be reclassified to profit and loss:                                                            |        |        |        |\n| Changes in revaluation reserve real estate held for own use                                                        | (2)    | 1      | 7      |\n| Remeasurements of defined benefit plans                                                                            | 140    | 90     | (15)   |\n|                                                                                                                    | 138    | 92     | (8)    |\n| Items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit and loss:                                                    |        |        |        |\n| (Gains) / losses on revaluation of available-for-sale investments                                                  | (666)  | (726)  | 531    |\n| (Gains) / losses transferred to the income statement on disposal and impairment of  available-for-sale investments | 2      | 94     | (17)   |\n| Changes in cash flow hedging reserve                                                                               | 54     | 3      | 1      |\n| Movement in foreign currency translation and net foreign investment hedging reserve                                | (7)    | (5)    | (20)   |\n|                                                                                                                    | (616)  | (634)  | 494    |\n| Total income tax related to components of other comprehensive income                                               | (479)  | (542)  | 487    |\n\n|                                                           |    | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income tax related to equity instruments and other        |    |        |        |        |\n| Income tax related to equity instruments                  | 31 | 18     | 51     | 38     |\n| Other                                                     |    | 1      | (1)    | (12)   |\n| Total income tax recognized directly in retained earnings |    | 19     | 50     | 26     |",

If approved and in combination with the interim dividend 2020 of EUR/uni00A00.06 per common share, Aegon's total dividend over 2020 will amount to EUR/uni00A00.12 per common share. After taking into account the interim dividend 2020 of EUR/uni00A00.0015 per common share B, Aegon's total dividend over 2020 will amount to EUR/uni00A00.003 per common share B.\n\n## Interim dividend 2020\n\nThe interim dividend 2020 was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. Approximately 52% of holders of common shares elected to receive the cash dividend. The remaining 48% of shareholders elected to receive the interim dividend in stock. The cash dividend amounted to EUR/uni00A00.06 per common share, the stock dividend amounted to one new Aegon common share for every 39 common shares held. The stock dividend and cash dividend are approximately equal in value. The dividend was payable as of September 18, 2020. The interim dividend 2020 for common shares B amounted to 1/40 th of the dividend paid on common shares.\n\nTo neutralize the dilutive effect of the 2020 interim dividend paid in shares, Aegon executed a program to repurchase 24,028,645 common shares. The repurchase of shares commenced on October 1, 2020 and was completed on October 27, 2020. Aegon engaged a third party to execute the transactions on its behalf. The common shares were repurchased at a maximum of the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices during the repurchase period.\n\n## Final dividend 2019\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020 it was decided to forego the 2019 final dividend. Aegon decided to comply with the call made by European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to postpone all dividend distributions on April 2, 2020. Furthermore, in 2020 Aegon took several actions to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its risk profile. In this context, Aegon decided to retain the final dividend for 2019. Taking into account the interim dividend paid in September 2019, this results in a total dividend for the financial year 2019 of EUR/uni00A00.15 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.00375 per common share B, paid in September 2019.\n\n## Interim dividend 2019\n\nThe interim dividend 2019 was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder.

At closing, an additional loss of USD 7 million (EUR/uni00A06 million) was recognized primarily due to the write off of prepaid lease commissions and straight-line rent balances.

The derivatives held for risk management purposes are classified as economic hedges to the extent that they do not qualify for hedge accounting, or that Aegon has elected not to apply hedge accounting. The economic hedges of certain exposures relate to an existing asset, liability or future reinvestment risk. In all cases, these are in accordance with internal risk guidelines and are closely monitored for continuing compliance.\n\nBifurcated embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host contracts have been bifurcated and recorded at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position. These bifurcated embedded derivatives are embedded in various institutional products, modified coinsurance and unit-linked insurance contracts in the form of guarantees for minimum benefits.

As a result, only the net accounting ineffectiveness has an impact on the net result.\n\nAegon has entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert certain fixed-rate assets and liabilities to a floating-rate basis (generally to six months or less LIBOR). These hedges are used for portfolio management to better match assets to liabilities or to protect the value of the hedged item from interest rate movements. These agreements involve the payment or receipt of fixed-rate interest amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest amounts over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Some of the arrangements use forward starting swaps to better match the duration of assets and/uni00A0liabilities.\n\nAegon has entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert certain foreign currency fixed-rate and floating-rate assets and liabilities to US dollar floating-rate assets and liabilities. These agreements involve the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the gains and (losses) related to the ineffectiveness portion of designated fair value hedges Aegon recognized are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                       |   2020 |   2019 | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gains (losses) related to the ineffectiveness portion of designated fair value hedges |     25 |     22 | (9)    |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Aegon the Netherlands recognized EUR/uni00A0280 million positive fair value changes on mortgage loans using fair value hedge accounting under the EU carve out version of IAS 39 in the income statement (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0375 million positive). This amount was offset by EUR/uni00A0255 million negative fair value changes recognized on the derivatives used as hedging instrument (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0354 million negative).\n\n## Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges\n\nAegon has entered primarily into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert certain variable-rate assets and liabilities to a fixed-rate basis in order to match the cash flows of the assets and liabilities within Aegon's portfolio more closely. These agreements involve the payment or receipt of variable-rate interest amounts in exchange for fixed-rate interest amounts over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Aegon hedges its exposure to the variability of future cash flows from the interest rate movements for terms up to 24 years for hedges converting existing floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed-rate assets.\n\nAegon uses forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in future cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of fixed-income assets. These agreements reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on the forecasted transaction. Fair value adjustments for these interest rate swaps are deferred and recorded in equity until the occurrence of the forecasted transaction at which time the interest rate swaps will be terminated. The accumulated gain or loss in equity will be amortized into investment income as the acquired asset affects income. Aegon hedges its exposure to the variability of future cash flows from interest rate movements for terms up to 23 years. The cash flows from these hedging instruments are expected to affect the profit and loss for approximately the next 32 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the contracts for which cash flow hedge accounting was terminated resulted in deferred gains of EUR/uni00A0186 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0112/uni00A0million) that are recognized directly in equity to be reclassified into net income during the period when the cash flows occur of the underlying hedged items. During the year ended December 31, 2020, none of Aegon's cash flow hedges were discontinued as it was highly probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur by the end of the originally specified time period documented at the inception of the hedging relationship./uni00A0Aegon projects investment needs many years into the future in order to support the insurance liabilities and pay all contractual obligations arising from the policies in force today.\n\nIn addition, Aegon also makes use of cross currency swaps to convert variable or fixed foreign currency cash flows into fixed cash flows in local currencies. The cash flows from these hedging instruments are expected to occur over the next 30 years. These agreements involve the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.\n\n| Hedge ineffectiveness and reclassification of gains (losses)                                            | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges                                                               | -      | -      | 2      |\n| Gains (losses) reclassified from equity into the income statement                                       | 74     | 51     | (62)   |\n| Expected deferred gain (loss) to be reclassified from equity into net income during  the next 12 months | 92     | 89     | 9      |",

The FSB proposed new standards to reform interest rate benchmarks and the use of transaction-based input data instead of nontransactional/panel input data. In the EU this is adopted in the new Benchmark Regulation (BMR) which stipulates that from January 2020 only BMR compliant benchmarks may be used within the EU.\n\nDespite current uncertainties on how the transition from IBORs to alternative benchmarks will be managed, it is widely acknowledged that IBOR benchmarks impact financial products and contracts, including among others derivatives, corporate bonds, structured debt products, deposits and mortgages. Aegon recognizes that IBOR transitions potentially have implications for all reporting units, including its insurance, asset management and banking activities. The impact of the IBOR transition on the business and operating models are described in transition plans and include among others project solutions and actions, timelines and ownership to ensure timely preparation and implementation. We are currently implementing the actions as described in the transition plans. In July 2020 the discount rates of EUR/uni00A0cleared derivatives switched from EONIA to \u20acSTR which impacted the valuation of derivatives for which compensation was exchanged. We are in discussions with our counterparties on amending the EUR/uni00A0CSAs from EONIA to \u20acSTR. In the US, the cleared market has switched discount rates from Fed Funds to SOFR in October 2020. The switch in discount rates is expected to lead to increased liquidity in the new risk free rates.\n\nThe majority of the fair value and cash flow hedges are directly exposed to changes in benchmark rates (predominantly Euribor and USD Libor) where it is not clear until when these benchmark rates will be continued and/or how they will transition to alternative rates. For example, the majority of financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges have a maturity date beyond December 31, 2021 (Net notional amount: EUR/uni00A015,320/uni00A0million, 2019: EUR/uni00A012,165 million).\n\nAegon applies the reliefs offered in IAS 39 to ensure that this uncertainty does not result in the early termination of hedge accounting, whilst also assuming for measurement purposes that, owing to the general principle of equivalence, transitions to alternative rates will not result in significant contract modifications.\n\n## Net foreign investment hedges\n\nAegon funds its investments in insurance subsidiaries with a mixture of debt and equity. Aegon aims to denominate debt funding in the same currency as the functional currency of the investment. Investments outside the Eurozone, the United States and the United Kingdom are funded in euros. When the debt funding of investments is not in the functional currency of the investment, Aegon uses derivatives to swap the currency exposure of the debt instrument to the appropriate functional currency. This policy will ensure that total capital will reflect currency movements without distorting debt to shareholders' equity ratios. Aegon utilizes various financial instruments as designated hedging instruments of its foreign investments. These instruments include long-term and short-term borrowings, short-term debts to credit institutions, cross currency swap contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts.",

The additions to joint ventures are mainly explained by the expansion of Aegon's partnership with Santander in Spain. The disposals mainly relates to the completion of the sale of Aegon's 50% stake in the variable annuity joint ventures in Japan. Please refer to note/uni00A048 for further details. In addition, as a result of a dilution in voting rights, Aegon's investment in Amvest Residential Core Fund was reclassified from joint ventures to associates./uni00A0\n\nWith the exception of a limited number of immaterial venture capital entities, all joint ventures and associates are unlisted and are accounted for using the equity method and are considered to be non-current. The investments in joint ventures and associates include interest in insurance companies that are required to maintain a minimum solvency margin based on local directives. Such restrictions can affect the ability of these joint ventures and associates to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, or repayment of loans or advances, and therefore, there can be no assurance that these restrictions will not become a limitation in the future.

The contract reinsures a specified portfolio of insurance contracts against possible future mortality developments. The reinsurer will pay benefits as long as the participants live and receive fixed payments from Aegon the Netherlands. A deferred cost of reinsurance of EUR/uni00A0360 million was recognized with regard to this reinsurance contract, which will be amortized over the duration of the underlying insurance contracts.\n\nIn 2020, a model change and updated parameters regarding education and mortality experience factors in Aegon the Netherlands led to a decrease in the deferred cost of reinsurance of EUR/uni00A0214 million, which is included in the line Other.\n\n## 28 Other assets and receivables\n\n|                                            | Note   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Real estate held for own use and equipment | 28.1   | 472    | 489    |\n| Receivables                                | 28.2   | 6,826  | 6,656  |\n| Accrued income                             | 28.3   | 1,356  | 1,442  |\n| Right-of-use assets                        | 28.4   | 211    | 255    |\n| At December 31                             |        | 8,865  | 8,842  |\n\n## 28.1 Real estate held for own use and equipment\n\n| Total real estate held for own use and equipment   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| General account real estate held for own use       |    209 |    208 |\n| Equipment                                          |    263 |    281 |\n| At December 31                                     |    472 |    489 |",

None of the intangible assets have titles that are restricted or have been pledged as security for liabilities.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, all intangible assets have a finite useful life and are amortized accordingly. VOBA and future servicing rights are amortized over the term of the related insurance contracts, which can vary significantly depending on the maturity of the acquired portfolio./uni00A0The amortization is based on either the expected future premiums, revenues or the expected gross profit margins, which for the most significant blocks of business ranges between 50 and 80 years. Future servicing rights are amortized over a period of 10 to 30 years of which 13 years remain at December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A015 years). Software is generally depreciated over an average period of 3 to 5 years (no changes compared to 2019).\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe goodwill balance has been allocated across the cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies inherent in the goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment both annually and when there are specific indicators of a potential impairment. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal for a cash-generating unit. The operating assumptions used in all the calculations are best estimate assumptions and based on historical data where available.\n\nThe economic assumptions used in all the calculations are based on observable market data and projections of future trends. All the cash-generating units tested showed that the recoverable amount was higher than their carrying values, including goodwill. A reasonably possible change in any key assumption is not expected to cause the carrying value of the cash-generating units to exceed its recoverable amount.",

Value in use calculations of Aegon Americas have been actuarially determined based on business plans covering a period of typically three years and pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates. Based on the value in use tests, goodwill in the Americas for the group of annuities cash-generating units (2020: EUR/uni00A0116 million: 2019: EUR/uni00A0127 million) and the retirement plans cash-generating unit (2020: EUR/uni00A052 million: 2019: EUR/uni00A056 million) remain unchanged from prior year except for the impact of currency translation adjustments. The value in use tests assume business plans covering a period of 3 years further extrapolated to 10 years, where the new business levels for years 4-10 assumed a 0% growth rate (2019:/uni00A00%). The pre-tax adjusted discount rate was 7.6% for both annuities and retirement plans.\n\nFor Aegon the Netherlands, goodwill was allocated to Robidus - a cash generating unit whose value in use exceeds its carrying value. The value in use calculations were based on business plans covering a period of five years, pre-tax discount rate of 7.6%, post-tax discount rate of 7.2%, and terminal growth rate at 1%. The goodwill arises mainly from new customers, future software platform developments, synergies, and assembled workforce.\n\n## 30 Shareholders' equity\n\nIssued share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of Aegon N.V.\n\n|                                        | Note   | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Share capital - par value              | 30.1   | 320     | 323     | 322     |\n| Share premium                          | 30.2   | 7,160   | 7,213   | 7,487   |\n| Total share capital                    |        | 7,480   | 7,536   | 7,808   |\n| Retained earnings                      |        | 11,124  | 11,262  | 10,304  |\n| Treasury shares                        | 30.3   | (181)   | (281)   | (337)   |\n| Total retained earnings                |        | 10,943  | 10,981  | 9,966   |\n| Revaluation reserves                   | 30.4   | 7,480   | 5,873   | 3,435   |\n| Remeasurement of defined benefit plans | 30.5   | (2,534) | (2,397) | (1,850) |\n| Other reserves                         | 30.6   | (553)   | 456     | 149     |\n| Total shareholders' equity             |        | 22,815  | 22,449  | 19,507  |",

To the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities, income would be reduced. Furthermore, if these higher claims were part of a permanent trend, Aegon may be required to change best estimate assumptions for future claims which could increase the required reserves for these future claims, which could reduce income. In addition, certain acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force have been recorded as assets on the statement of financial position and are being amortized into the income statement over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these policies (such as future claims, investment income and expenses) are not realized, the amortization of these costs could be accelerated and may even require write offs should there be an expectation of unrecoverability. This could have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSources of underwriting risk include policyholder behavior (such as lapses, surrender of policies or partial withdrawals), policy claims (such as mortality, longevity or morbidity) and expenses. For some product lines, Aegon is at risk if policy lapses increase as sometimes Aegon is unable to fully recover upfront expenses in selling a product despite the presence of commission recoveries or surrender charges and fees. There are also products where Aegon is at risk if lapses decrease, for example where this would result in a higher utilization rate of product guarantees. For mortality and morbidity risk, Aegon sells certain types of policies that are at risk if mortality or morbidity increases, such as term life insurance and accident insurance, Aegon also sells certain types of policies that are at risk",

Aegon is also at risk if expenses are higher than the expenses assumed beforehand by management and that were priced into the products.\n\nAegon monitors and manages its underwriting risk by underwriting risk type. Attribution analysis is performed on earnings and reserve movements in order to understand the source of any material variation in actual results from what was expected. Aegon's units also perform experience studies for underwriting risk assumptions, comparing Aegon's experience to industry experience as well as combining Aegon's experience and industry experience based on the depth of the history of each source to Aegon's underwriting assumptions. Where policy charges are flexible in products, Aegon uses these analyses as the basis for modifying these charges, with a view to maintain a balance between policyholder and shareholder interests. Aegon also has the ability to reduce expense levels over time, thus mitigating unfavorable expense variation.\n\nSensitivity analysis of net income and shareholders' equity to various underwriting risks is shown in the table that follows. Aegon's best estimate assumptions already include expected future developments and the sensitivities represent an increase or decrease of lapse rates, mortality rates and morbidity rates, compared to Aegon's best estimate assumptions. These underwriting sensitivities were run using a permanent shock applied to all of Aegon's products, exposed to an increase and to a decrease in the rates. The table below indicates that the morbidity sensitivity has the largest impact and in aggregate, Aegon is exposed to a decrease in mortality rates.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of net income and shareholders' equity to changes in various underwriting risks\n\n|                                 | 2020                     | 2020          | 2019                     | 2019          |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| Estimated approximate effect    | On shareholders'  equity | On net income | On shareholders'  equity | On net income |\n| 20% increase in lapse rates     | (151)                    | 156           | 152                      | 143           |\n| 20% decrease in lapse rates     | 47                       | (157)         | (169)                    | (156)         |\n| 5% increase in mortality rates  | 52                       | 344           | 261                      | 192           |\n| 5% decrease in mortality rates  | (217)                    | (354)         | (322)                    | (240)         |\n| 10% increase in morbidity rates | (225)                    | (235)         | (370)                    | (376)         |\n| 10% decrease in morbidity rates | 134                      | 140           | 191                      | 196           |\n\nAegon the Netherlands partially hedges and reinsures the risk of future longevity increases in the Netherlands.\n\n## 34.2 Insurance contracts for general account\n\n|                                         | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Life insurance                          | 109,062 | 109,310 |\n| Non-life insurance                      |         |         |\n| - Unearned premiums and unexpired risks | 6,117   | 6,002   |\n| - Outstanding claims                    | 2,120   | 2,417   |\n| - Incurred but not reported claims      | 881     | 772     |\n| Incoming reinsurance                    | 3,965   | 4,385   |\n| At December 31                          | 122,146 | 122,885 |\n\n|                                 | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Non-life insurance:             |        |        |\n| - Accident and health insurance | 8,887  | 8,955  |\n| - General insurance             | 231    | 235    |\n| Total non-life insurance        | 9,118  | 9,190  |",

The LAT deficit was negatively impacted by the impact of lower interest rate of EUR/uni00A01.5 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01.3 billion) and adverse credit spread movements (widening mortgage spreads, tightened liquidity premium) of EUR/uni00A00.3 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.8 billion). This was partly offset by other favorable impacts (model and assumptions updates and portfolio changes) totaling EUR/uni00A01.0 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.2 billion negative).\n\nAs a result of the current deficit, changes in the LAT of Aegon the Netherlands, triggered by up or down movements in interest rates, are directly recognized in the income statement./uni00A0However, net income is less sensitive to interest rate movements as the results from interest rate hedging are also recognized in net income.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of the current negative LAT deficit position, results are volatile due to changes in credit spreads as these are not hedged. Please find below the estimated sensitivities on shareholders' equity and on net income, for up and down shocks for credit spreads, mortgage spreads for the bond and mortgage portfolio and liquidity premium shocks for general account insurance liabilities.\n\n| Sensitivity analysis of net income and shareholders' equity   | Estimated approximate effects  on net income   | Estimated approximate effects  on shareholders' equity   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                                                          |                                                |                                                          |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads                | (185)                                          | (1,998)                                                  |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads              | 172                                            | 1,873                                                    |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                   | (449)                                          | (449)                                                    |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                 | 476                                            | 477                                                      |\n| Shift up 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                   | 162                                            | 159                                                      |\n| Shift down 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                 | (164)                                          | (161)                                                    |\n| 2019                                                          |                                                |                                                          |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads                | (205)                                          | (2,386)                                                  |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads              | 198                                            | 2,117                                                    |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                   | (440)                                          | (440)                                                    |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                 | 467                                            | 467                                                      |\n| Shift up 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                   | 104                                            | 101                                                      |\n| Shift down 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                 | (105)                                          | (103)                                                    |",

Financial guarantees: these guarantees are treated as bifurcated embedded derivatives, valued at fair value and presented as derivatives (refer to note 2.9 and note 44 Fair value);\n- b.  Total return annuities: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts because they are presented and valued at fair value together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19);\n- c. Life contingent guarantees in the United States: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, presented and valued in accordance with insurance accounting together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19); and\n- d.  Minimum investment return guarantees in the Netherlands: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, valued at fair value and presented together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19 and note 44 Fair value).\n\nIn addition to the guarantees mentioned above, Aegon has traditional life insurance contracts that include minimum guarantees that are not valued explicitly; however, the adequacy of all insurance liabilities, net of VOBA and DPAC, and including all guarantees, are assessed periodically (refer to note/uni00A02.19).\n\n## a. Financial guarantees\n\nIn the United States and in the United Kingdom, a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) is offered directly on some variable annuity products Aegon issues and is also assumed from a ceding company. Variable annuities allow a customer to provide for the future on a tax-deferred basis and to participate in equity or bond market performance. Variable annuities allow a customer to select payout options designed to help meet the customer's need for income upon maturity, including lump sum payment or income for life or for a period of time. This benefit guarantees that a policyholder can withdraw a certain percentage of the account value, starting at a certain age or duration, for either a fixed period or during the life of the policyholder.\n\nIn the Netherlands, individual variable unit-linked products have a minimum benefit guarantee if premiums are invested in certain funds. The sum insured at maturity or upon the death of the beneficiary has a minimum guaranteed return (in the range of 3% to 4%) if the premium has been paid for a consecutive period of at least ten years and is invested in a mixed fund and/or fixed-income funds. No guarantees are given if the invested amount is in equity only.",

The decreased account value in 2020 was mainly driven by foreign currency translation differences, partly offset by/uni00A0decreasing interest rates and rising equity markets.\n\nAegon Americas mitigates the exposure from the elective guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider issued with a ceding company's variable annuity contracts. The rider is essentially a return of premium guarantee, which is payable over a period of at least 14 years from the date that the policyholder elects to start withdrawals. At contract inception, the guaranteed remaining balance is equal to the premium payment. The periodic withdrawal is paid by the ceding company until the account value is insufficient to cover additional withdrawals. Once the account value is exhausted, Aegon pays the periodic withdrawals until the guaranteed remaining balance is exhausted. At December 31, 2020, the reinsured account value was EUR/uni00A01.7/uni00A0billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01.8 billion) and the guaranteed remaining balance was EUR/uni00A00.8 billion (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01.1 billion).\n\nThe GMWB rider Aegon assumed from the ceding company is accounted for as a derivative and is carried in Aegon's statement of financial position at fair value. At December 31, 2020, the contract had a value of EUR/uni00A046/uni00A0million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A037 million). Aegon entered into a derivative program to mitigate the overall exposure to equity market and interest rate risks associated with the reinsurance contract. This program involves selling equity futures contracts and equity total return swap contracts (S&P 500, Midcap, Russell 2000, and the MCSI EAFE index in accordance with Aegon's exposure) to mitigate the effect of equity market movement on the reinsurance contracts and the purchase of interest rate swaps, treasury futures and treasury forwards to mitigate the effect of movements in interest rates on the reinsurance contracts.\n\nAegon the Netherlands provides guarantees to its customers on expiry date for certain insurance contracts. In order to mitigate the risks related to the guarantees Aegon the Netherlands has setup a hedging program. Aegon the Netherlands does not use reinsurance in order to mitigate risks related to insurance contracts with a guarantee component./uni00A0\n\n## b. Total return annuities\n\nTotal Return Annuity (TRA) is an annuity product in the United States which provides customers with a pass-through of the total return on an underlying portfolio of investment securities (typically a mix of corporate and convertible bonds) subject to a cumulative minimum guarantee. Both the assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, however, due to the minimum guarantee not all of the changes in the market value of the asset will be offset in the valuation of the liability. This product exists for the fixed annuity line of business and represents a closed block.\n\nThe fixed annuities product balance as of December 31, 2020, amounted to EUR/uni00A0186/uni00A0million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0234 million).\n\n## c. Life contingent guarantees in the United States\n\nCertain variable insurance contracts in the United States also provide guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB). Under a GMDB, the beneficiaries receive the greater of the account balance or the guaranteed amount upon the death of the insured. The net amount at risk for GMDB contracts is defined as the current GMDB in excess of the capital account balance at the reporting date.",

The guaranteed amount is calculated using the total deposits made by the contract holder, less any withdrawals and sometimes includes a roll-up or step-up feature that increases the value of the guarantee with interest or with increases in the account value.\n\nThe additional liability for guaranteed minimum benefits that are not bifurcated are determined each period by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The estimates are reviewed regularly and any resulting adjustment to the additional liability is recognized in the income statement. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range of stochastic scenarios. Where applicable, the calculation of the liability incorporates a percentage of the potential annuitizations that may be elected by the contract holder.\n\nThe following table provides information on the liabilities for guarantees for minimum benefits that are included in the valuation of the host contracts:\n\n|                                          | 2020     | 2020     | 2020      | 2019          | 2019          | 2019      |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|\n|                                          | GMDB  1) | GMIB  2) | Total  4) | GMDB  1)      | GMIB  2)      | Total  4) |\n| At January 1                             | 448      | 686      | 1,133     | 519           | 906           | 1,425     |\n| Incurred guarantee benefits  5)          | 144      | 44       | 189       | (27)          | (210)         | (238)     |\n| Paid guarantee benefits                  | (61)     | (34)     | (95)      | (53)          | (27)          | (81)      |\n| Net exchange differences                 | (43)     | (57)     | (100)     | 10            | 17            | 27        |\n| At December 31                           | 488      | 638      | 1,127     | 448           | 686           | 1,133     |\n|                                          | GMDB  1) | GMIB 2)  |           | GMDB  1) , 3) | GMIB  2) , 3) |           |\n| Account value  6)                        | 52,481   | 5,337    |           | 54,411        | 5,331         |           |\n| Net amount at risk  7)                   | 919      | 542      |           | 1,268         | 688           |           |\n| Average attained age of contract holders | 70       | 72       |           | 70            | 71            |           |\n\n- 4 Balances are included in the insurance liabilities on the face of the statement of financial position; refer to note 34 Insurance contracts.\n- 5 Incurred guarantee benefits mainly comprise the effect of guarantees from new contracts, releases related to expired out-of-the-money guarantees and value changes as a consequence of interest movements during the reporting year.\n- 6 Account value reflects the actual fund value for the policyholders.\n- 7 The net amount at risk is defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments available to the contract holder determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess of the current account balance.\n\n## d. Minimum investment return guarantees in the Netherlands\n\nThe traditional life and pension products offered by Aegon in the Netherlands include various products that accumulate a cash value. Premiums are paid by customers at inception or over the term of the contract. The accumulation products pay benefits on the policy maturity date, subject to survival of the insured. In addition, most policies also pay death benefits if the insured dies during the term of the contract. The death benefits may be stipulated in the policy or depend on the gross premiums paid to date. Premiums and amounts insured are established at inception of the contract. The amount insured can be increased as a result of profit sharing, if provided for under the terms and conditions of the product. Minimum interest guarantees exist for all generations of traditional accumulation products written. Older generations contain a 4% guarantee; in 1999 the guarantee decreased to 3% and in 2013 the guarantee decreased to 0%.\n\nThe traditional group pension contracts offered by Aegon in the Netherlands include large group insurance contracts that have an individually determined asset investment strategy underlying the pension contract. The guarantee given is that the profit sharing is the maximum of 0% and the realized return on an asset portfolio specified in the policy conditions, adjusted for technical interest rates ranging from 3% to 4%. If the adjusted return is negative, the 0% minimum is effective, but the loss in any given year is carried forward to be offset against any future surpluses within the contract period. In general, a guarantee is given for the life of the underlying employees so that their pension benefit is guaranteed. Large group contracts also share technical results (mortality risk and disability risk). The contract period is typically five years and the premiums are fixed over this period.\n\nThese guarantees are valued at fair value and are included as part of insurance liabilities with the underlying host insurance contracts in note/uni00A034 Insurance contracts.",

For further details refer to note/uni00A044 Fair value.\n\nFor equity volatility, Aegon uses a term structure assumption with market-based implied volatility inputs for the first five years and a long-term forward rate assumption of 25% thereafter. The volume of observable option trading from which volatilities are derived generally declines as the contracts' term increases, therefore, the volatility curve grades from implied volatilities for five years to the ultimate rate. The resulting volatility assumption in year 20 for the S&P 500 index (expressed as a spot rate) was 22.6% at December 31, 2020, and 21.1% at December 31, 2019. Correlations of market returns across underlying indices are based on historical market returns and their inter-relationships over a number of years preceding the valuation date. Assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, such as lapses, included in the models are derived in the same way as the assumptions used to measure insurance liabilities.\n\nThese assumptions are reviewed at each valuation date, and updated based on historical experience and observable market data, including market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. Disclosure on interest rate risk, including interest rate risk sensitivity is included in note/uni00A04 Financial risks.\n\nAegon utilizes different risk management strategies to mitigate the financial impact of the valuation of these guarantees on the results including asset and liability management and derivative hedging strategies to hedge certain aspects of the market risks embedded in these guarantees.\n\nGuarantees valued at fair value contributed a net gain before tax of EUR/uni00A0539/uni00A0million (2019:/uni00A0gain of EUR/uni00A0424 million) to earnings. The main drivers of this gain before tax are a/uni00A0fair value gain on hedges related to the guarantee reserves of EUR/uni00A03,199 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01,840 million gain),/uni00A0a gain of EUR/uni00A0380 million related to an increase in equity markets (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01,585 million gain), a gain of EUR/uni00A0234/uni00A0million related to widening own credit spread (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A042 million gain) and other and DPAC offset contributed a gain of EUR/uni00A0305 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0273 million gain). These gains are partly offset by negative results related to decreases in risk free rates of EUR/uni00A03,775 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03,281 million loss) and/uni00A0a loss of EUR/uni00A0134 million related to increases in equity volatility (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A012 million gain).\n\nGuarantee reserves increased by EUR/uni00A03,230 million in 2020 (2019:/uni00A0increase of EUR/uni00A01,937 million) to EUR/uni00A012,875 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A09,645 million).",

Capital funding includes debt securities that are issued for general corporate purposes and for capitalizing its business units. Capital funding is part of the Company's total capitalization that is used for financing its subsidiaries and the cash held at the holding company. Operational funding includes debt securities that are issued for financing of dedicated pools of assets.

This is partly offset by an increase in other mortgage loan funding of EUR/uni00A00.7 billion and the issuance of a covered bond in the Netherlands of EUR/uni00A00.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2019, the operational funding decreased by EUR/uni00A02.7 billion mainly due to the early redemption of a USD 1.54 billion Variable Funding Surplus Note (EUR/uni00A01.4 billion), following a restructuring of this financing transaction in the US. In addition, a further decrease was driven by the redemption of 'SAECURE 14' of EUR/uni00A00.9 billion and the pay down of FHLB advances of EUR/uni00A01.7 billion. This was partly offset by an increase in other mortgage loan funding of EUR/uni00A00.5 billion, the issuance of EUR/uni00A0500 million senior non-preferred notes with a coupon of 0.625%, and a transaction under the Dutch SAECURE program/uni00A0('SAECURE 18') to sell Class A mortgage backed securities (RMBS).

The following sections contain a general description of the plans in each of these subsidiaries and a summary of the principal actuarial assumptions applied in determining the value of defined benefit plans.\n\n## Aegon USA\n\nAegon USA has defined benefit plans covering substantially all its employees that are qualified under the Internal Revenue Service Code, including all requirements for minimum funding levels. The defined benefit plans are governed by the Board of Directors of Transamerica Corporation. The Board of Directors has the full power and discretion to administer the plan and to apply all of its provisions, including such responsibilities as, but not limited to, developing the investment policy and managing assets for the plan,",

The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's eligible annual compensation. The plans provide benefits based on a traditional final average formula or a cash balance formula (which defines the accrued benefit in terms of a stated account balance), depending on the age and service of the plan participant. The defined benefit plans have a deficit of EUR/uni00A0436 million at December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0388 million deficit).\n\nInvestment strategies are established based on asset and liability studies by actuaries which are updated as they consider appropriate. These studies, along with the investment policy, assist to develop the appropriate investment criteria for the plan, including asset allocation mix, return objectives, investment risk and time horizon, benchmarks and performance standards, and restrictions and prohibitions. The overall goal is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for the present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. Aegon believes that the asset allocation is an important factor in determining the long-term performance of the plan. The plan uses multiple asset classes as well as sub-classes to meet the asset allocation and other requirements of the investment policy, which minimizes investment risk. From time to time the actual asset allocation may deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges due to different market performance among the various asset categories. If it is determined that rebalancing is required, future additions and withdrawals will be used to bring the allocation to the desired level.\n\nAegon USA maintains minimum required funding levels as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. If contributions are required, the funding would be provided from the Company's general account assets. Pension plan contributions were not required for Aegon USA in 2020 or 2019. However, with the Aegon N.V. Management Board approval of a proposal from Transamerica Corporation, Transamerica Corporation made/uni00A0a pension plan contribution of EUR/uni00A0223 million/uni00A0in September 2019 that was over and above the minimum required funding levels as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. In 2020,/uni00A0Transamerica Corporation did not make a pension plan contribution.\n\nAegon USA also sponsors supplemental retirement plans to provide senior management with benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits. The plans are unfunded and are not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. The supplemental retirement plans are governed by either Transamerica Corporation, or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Transamerica Corporation. Transamerica Corporation, or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the full power and discretion to apply all of the plan's provisions, including such responsibilities as, but not limited to, interpret the plan provisions, to make factual determinations under the plan, to determine plan benefits, and to comply with any statutory reporting and disclosure requirements. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's eligible annual compensation. The plans provide benefits based on a traditional final average formula or a cash balance formula (which defines the accrued benefit in terms of a stated account balance), depending on the age and service of the plan participant. The company funds the benefit payments of the supplemental retirement plans from its general account assets. The unfunded amount related to these plans, for which a liability has been recorded, was EUR/uni00A0249 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0272 million unfunded).\n\nAegon USA provides health care benefits to retired employees through continuation of coverage primarily in self funded plans, and partly in fully insured plans, which are classified as unfunded per IAS 19 financial guidance. The postretirement health care benefits under the Plans are administered by Transamerica Corporation, which has delegated the claims administration to thirdparty administrators. Aegon USA maintains two plans which provide continuation of coverage for retiree medical benefits. For each plan, Aegon USA has the fiduciary responsibility to administer the plan in accordance with its terms, and decides questions related to eligibility and determines plan provisions and benefit amounts.\n\nUnder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Aegon USA has the fiduciary responsibility to monitor the quality of services provided by the third-party claims administrator and to replace the third-party administrator if needed. In addition, Aegon USA has the fiduciary obligation to interpret the provisions of the plans, and to comply with any statutory reporting and disclosure requirements. Finally, Aegon USA reviews the terms of the plans and makes changes to the plans if and when appropriate. Aegon USA funds the benefit payments or premium payments of the post-retirement health care plans from its general account assets. The postretirement health benefit liability amounted to EUR/uni00A0214 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0217 million).\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 12.9 years (2019:/uni00A012.6 years).",

The defined benefit plans are subject to Dutch Pension regulations and governed by the Board of Directors of Aegon the Netherlands. The Board of Directors has the full power and discretion to administer the plan including developing investment policy and managing assets for the plans (although these assets do not qualify as 'plan assets' as defined by IFRS), deciding questions related to eligibility and benefit amounts, and any disputes that may arise from plan participants and for complying with the plan provisions, and legal requirements related to the plan and its operation. Aegon the Netherlands runs, in principle, full actuarial and investment risk regarding the defined benefit plans. This includes the risks of low interest rates, low returns and increased longevity. A part of this risk can be attributed to plan participants by lowering indexation or by increasing employee contributions.",

Insurers are subject to prudential supervision pursuant to the Financial Supervision Act (Wet/uni00A0op het financieel toezicht / Wft).\n\nInvestment strategies are established based on asset and liability studies. The overall goal is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for the present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk. These studies use for example return objectives and various investment instruments. Investment restrictions are updated regularly and they result in asset allocation mix and hedges.\n\nAs at December 31, 2019, Aegon the Netherlands amended the defined benefit pension plan for their own employees. As of January 1, 2020, the defined benefit pension plan is closed for new members and there will be no further accrual of benefits to existing members. Entitlements before January 1, 2020, will remain unchanged and the indexation for those accruals will remain in force./uni00A0\n\nThe contributions to the retirement benefit plan of Aegon the Netherlands are paid by both the employees and the employer, with the employer contribution being variable 1 . The benefits covered are retirement benefits, disability, death and survivor pension. The defined benefit plans were unfunded by EUR/uni00A03,658 million at December 31, 2020. (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A03,413 million). The defined benefit plans are largely backed by investment, although these assets do not qualify as 'plan assets' as defined by IFRS. The average remaining duration of the defined benefits obligation is 22.5 years (2019:/uni00A021.9 years).\n\nAegon the Netherlands also has a post-retirement medical plan that contributes to the health care coverage of employees and beneficiaries after retirement. For this plan, Aegon the Netherlands has the responsibility to administer the plan in accordance with its terms, and decides on questions related to eligibility and determines plan provisions and benefit amounts. In addition, Aegon the Netherlands has the obligation to interpret the provisions of the plans, and to comply with any statutory reporting and disclosure requirements. Finally, Aegon the Netherlands reviews the terms of the plans and makes changes to the plans if and when appropriate. The liabilities related to these other post-employment benefit plans are fully unfunded and amount to EUR/uni00A061 million at December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A065 million).

The scheme closed to new entrants a number of years ago and closed to future accrual on March 31, 2013. Aegon UK now offers a defined contribution pension scheme to all employees.\n\nThe pension scheme is administered separately from Aegon UK and is governed by Trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the pension scheme members.\n\nThe pension scheme Trustees are required to carry out triennial valuations on the scheme's funding position, with the latest valuation being as at March 31, 2019. As part of this triennial valuation process, a schedule of contributions is agreed between the Trustees and Aegon UK in accordance with UK pensions legislation and guidance issued by the Pensions Regulator in the UK. The schedule of contributions includes deficit reduction contributions to clear any scheme deficit. Under IAS 19, the defined benefit plan has a surplus of EUR/uni00A043 million at December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A01 million surplus)./uni00A0During 2020, EUR/uni00A054 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A083 million) of contributions were paid into the scheme.\n\nThe investment strategy for the scheme is determined by the trustees in consultation with Aegon UK. Currently 30% of assets are invested in growth assets (i.e. primarily equities) and 70% are income and liability driven investments where the investments are a portfolio of fixed interest and inflation-linked bonds and related derivatives, selected to broadly match the interest rate and inflation profile of liabilities.\n\nUnder the scheme rules, pensions in payment increase in line with the UK Retail Price Index, and deferred benefits increase in line with the UK Consumer Price Index. The pension scheme is therefore exposed to UK inflation changes as well as interest rate risks, investment returns and changes in the life expectancy of pensioners.\n\nThe scheme purchased a buy-in policy in the name of the Trustee to cover full scheme benefits for a group of pensioners in 2019. The liability (and matching asset) calculated on the year end assumptions has been included in the funded position as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 22.0 years (2019:/uni00A021.6 years).",

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognized within the statement of financial position.\n\n|                    | Target allocation of plan assets for retirement  benefit plans for the next annual period is:   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Equity instruments | 29.5%                                                                                           |\n| Debt instruments   | 70.5%                                                                                           |\n\n## All other operating segments\n\nBusinesses included in all other operating segments mostly operate defined contribution plans.

The key capital management priority is to ensure adequate capitalization to cover Aegon's obligations towards its policyholders and debtholders while providing sustainable dividends to shareholders. This priority is accomplished by allocating capital to products that offer high growth and return prospects./uni00A0\n\n## Management of capital\n\nDisciplined risk and capital management support Aegon's decisions in deploying the capital that is generated in the Company's businesses and that is provided for by investors. Aegon balances the funding of new business growth with the funding required to ensure that its obligations towards policyholders and debtholders are always adequately met, and providing for a sustainable dividend to shareholders.\n\nAegon's goal for both its operating units and for the Aegon group as a whole is to maintain a strong financial position and to be able to sustain losses from extreme business and market conditions.       Aegon's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework ensures that the Aegon Group and its operating companies are adequately capitalized and that obligations towards policyholders are always adequately met. Embedded in this larger framework is Aegon's capital management policy. The update in 2020 simplified the policy while ensuring that strong capital positions are maintained at the Group and in the units. Aegon's capital management framework is based on adequate capitalization of its operating units, Cash Capital at Holding and leverage.\n\nAegon manages capital in the operating units to their respective operating levels, sufficient to absorb moderate shocks and pay sustainable remittances to the Group, and above their minimum dividend payment levels. Cash Capital at Holding is maintained within an operating range of EUR/uni00A00.5 - 1.5 billion and covers holding expenses, near-term dividends, and contingencies, such as potential recapitalization of units. Furthermore, Aegon aims to reduce its gross financial leverage from the current level of EUR/uni00A06.0 billion to the range of EUR/uni00A05.0 - 5.5 billion over the period of 2021 to 2023. This reduction of leverage will strengthen the balance sheet, reduce Aegon's risk profile and therefore make Aegon more resilient.\n\nThe frequent monitoring of actual and forecasted capitalization levels of its underlying businesses is an important element in Aegon's capital framework in order to actively steer and manage towards maintaining adequate capitalization levels.\n\n## Aegon Group Solvency Ratio\n\nTo calculate its Group Solvency Ratio, Aegon applies a combination of the Group consolidation methods available under Solvency II: the Accounting Consolidation (AC) and Deduction & Aggregation (D&A) based methods. Solvency II capital requirements are mainly used/uni00A0for the European Economic Area (EEA)-based insurance and reinsurance entities, applying the AC method. Local requirements are/uni00A0used for insurance and reinsurance entities in (provisionally) equivalent third-country jurisdictions. Since January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union. Absent any regulatory guidance to the contrary, Aegon's UK insurance subsidiaries will continue to be included in the Group Solvency II calculation in accordance with Solvency II standards, including Aegon's approved Partial Internal Model. For more details, reference is made to the section 'Regulation and Supervision'. On July 11 2020, DNB/uni00A0published industry-wide guidelines regarding the treatment of banks in Group Solvency II calculation. As a consequence, Aegon/uni00A0has included Aegon Bank in the calculation of its Group Solvency on December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Group Solvency II ratio is calculated as the ratio between the Eligible Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). The Eligible Own Funds equal to the Available Own Funds after applying any Own Funds eligibility restrictions.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group SCR is calculated based on Solvency II Partial Internal Model (PIM), which includes the SCR of AC entities, the D&A entities and the Other Financial Sector entities (including Aegon Bank). The SCR amount (or 100% Solvency II ratio) reflects a level of Eligible Own Funds that enables insurance and reinsurance entities to absorb significant losses (1-in-200 year events) and gives reasonable assurance to policyholders and beneficiaries that payments will be made as they fall due. On December 31, 2020, Aegon's estimated capital position was:\n\n|                         | December 31, 2020  1)   | December 31, 2019 2)   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| Group Own Funds         | 18,582                  | 18,470                 |\n| Group SCR               | 9,473                   | 9,173                  |\n| Group Solvency II ratio | 196%                    | 201%                   |\n\n- 1 The Solvency II ratios are estimates, are not final until filed with the respective supervisory authority.\n- 2 For 2019, the Group Solvency II ratio excludes Aegon Bank. The 2019 Group Solvency II ratio including Aegon Bank is 198% (Own Funds: EUR 19,207 million; SCR: EUR 9,707 million).\n\nAegon Group Eligible Own Funds amounted to EUR/uni00A018,582 million on December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A018,470 million 1 ). The increase of EUR/uni00A0112 million in Own Funds since December 31, 2019, was mostly driven by the positive impact from expected return on inforce business and the inclusion of Aegon Bank. The positive impact was partly offset by unfavorable market impacts triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, reflected by a sharp decrease in interest rates, compounded by negative credit variances partly caused by widening of mortgage spreads.\n\nAegon's Group PIM SCR amounted to EUR/uni00A09,473 million on December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A09,173 million 2 ). The SCR increased by EUR/uni00A0300 million since December 31, 2019 and was mainly due to new business strain and the inclusion of Aegon Bank, which was partly offset by the release of in-force SCR. As a result of the above changes in Eligible Own Funds and PIM SCR, the Group Solvency II ratio declined by 5%-points to 196% in 2020.\n\n## Minimum regulatory requirements\n\nInsurance laws and regulations in local regulatory jurisdictions often contain minimum regulatory capital requirements. For insurance companies in the European Union, Solvency II formally defines a lower capital requirement, being the Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR). An irreparable breach of the MCR would lead to a withdrawal of the Company's insurance license. Similarly, for the US insurance entities the withdrawal of the insurance license is triggered by a breach of the 100% Authorized Control Level (ACL), which is set at 50% of the Company Action Level (CAL).\n\nWith the introduction of Solvency II for EEA countries, Aegon views the higher capital requirement, 100% of the SCR, as the level around which EU supervisors will formally require management to provide regulatory recovery plans. For the US insurance entities this is viewed at 100% CLA.\n\nDuring 2020, the Aegon Group and the regulated entities within the Aegon Group that are subject to regulatory capital requirements on a solo-level continued to comply with the solvency requirements.\n\n## Capital quality\n\nAegon's capital consists of 3 Tiers as an indication of its quality, with Tier 1 capital ranking the highest. The Available Own Funds is an estimate, has not been filed with the regulator and is subject to supervisory review. It is to be noted that the Group Own Funds do not include any contingent liability potentially arising from unit-linked products sold, issued or advised on by Aegon in the Netherlands in the past as the potential liability cannot be reliably quantified at this point.\n\n- 1 This 2019 published Group Own Funds excludes Aegon Bank. The 2019 Group Own Funds including Aegon Bank is EUR 19,207 million.\n- 2 This 2019 published Group SCR excludes Aegon Bank. The 2019 Group SCR including Aegon Bank is EUR 9,707 million.",

The change in Solvency II revaluations per December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is mainly driven by lower interest rates during 2020, increasing the revaluation reserves in Aegon US. The Solvency II revaluations and reclassification can be grouped into four categories:\n\n- \u25a0 Items that are not recognized under Solvency II. The most relevant examples of this category for Aegon include Goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC)/uni00A0and other intangible assets (EUR 1,989 million negative, 2019: EUR 1,932/uni00A0million negative);\n- \u25a0 Items that have a different valuation treatment between IFRS-EU and Solvency II. Solvency II is a market consistent framework hence all assets and liabilities are to be presented at fair value while IFRS-EU also includes other valuation treatments in addition to fair value. The most relevant examples of this category for Aegon Group include loans and mortgages, reinsurance recoverables, and technical provisions. The revaluation difference stemming from this category amounted to EUR 2,878 million positive (2019: EUR 2,753/uni00A0million positive) compared to the IFRS-EU Statement of Financial Position;\n- \u25a0 The Net Asset Value of subsidiaries that are included under the D&A method (on provisional equivalence or Standard Formula basis) in the Group Solvency II results. The revaluation difference stemming from this category amounted to EUR 6,942/uni00A0million negative (2019: EUR 5,655/uni00A0million negative) compared to the IFRS-EU Statement of Financial Position, where the revaluation reserves increased in Aegon US mainly driven by lower interest rates during 2020;\n- \u25a0 Reclassification of subordinated liabilities of EUR 3,366 million negative (2019: EUR 3,372 negative).\n\nThe transferability restrictions reflect the restrictions on Tier 1 unrestricted Own Funds as a consequence of the RBC CAL conversion methodology as described above.\n\nThe availability adjustments are changes to the availability of Own Funds of Aegon Group in accordance with Solvency II requirements. Examples include the adjustments for subordinated liabilities, ring-fenced fund, treasury shares and foreseeable dividend.\n\nFinally, the fungibility restrictions limit the availability of Own Funds on Aegon Group level as prescribed by Supervisory Authorities. These limitations refer to charitable trusts in the Americas for which the local Supervisory Authority could limit the upstream of capital to the Group and therefore are excluded for Solvency II purposes.\n\n## Capital leverage\n\nAegon's total capitalization reflects the capital employed in the business units and consists of shareholders' capital and total gross financial leverage. Aegon assesses its gross financial leverage position based on various leverage metrics, including the gross financial leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing total financial leverage by total capitalization. Aegon defines total financial leverage as debt or debt-like funding issued for general corporate purposes and for capitalizing Aegon's business units. Total financial leverage includes hybrid instruments, in addition to both subordinated and senior debt. Aegon's total capitalization comprises the following components:\n\n- \u25a0 Shareholders' equity excluding revaluation reserves/uni00A0based on IFRS as adopted by the EU;\n- \u25a0 Non-controlling interests and Long Term Incentive Plans not yet vested; and\n- \u25a0 Total financial leverage.",

In case of negative balances for individual reserves legally to be retained, no distributions can be made out of retained earnings to the level of these negative amounts. Total distributable items under Dutch law amounted to EUR/uni00A012,797 million as at December 31, 2020 (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A013,556 million).

Based on the capitalization level of the operating units, local insurance supervisors are able to restrict and/or prohibit the transfer of remittances to the holding company. In addition, the ability of operating units to pay remittances to the holding company can be constrained by the requirement for these operating units to hold sufficient shareholders' equity as determined by law. The capitalization level and shareholders' equity of the operating units can be impacted by various factors (e.g. general economic conditions, capital market risks, underwriting risk factors, changes in government regulations, and legal and arbitrational proceedings). To mitigate the impact of such factors on the ability of operating units to transfer funds, Aegon establishes an operating level of capital in each of the units, 150% SCR for Solvency II units and 400% RBC CAL in the US, which includes additional capital in excess of regulatory capital requirements. Aegon manages capital in the units to this operating level over-the-cycle.\n\n## 44 Fair value\n\nThe estimated fair values of Aegon's assets and liabilities correspond with the amounts that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of investments and derivatives. In the absence of an active market, the fair value of investments in financial assets is estimated by using other market observable data, such as corroborated external quotes and present value or other valuation techniques. An active market is one in which transactions are taking place regularly on an arm's length basis. Fair value is not determined based upon a forced liquidation or distressed sale.\n\nValuation techniques are used when Aegon determines the market is inactive or quoted market prices are not available for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect Aegon's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). These inputs are developed based on the best information available.\n\nAegon employs an oversight structure over valuation of financial instruments that includes appropriate segregation of duties. Senior management, independent of the investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies. For fair values determined by reference to external quotation or evidenced pricing parameters, independent price determination or validation is utilized to corroborate those inputs. Further details of the validation processes are set out below.\n\nValuation of assets and liabilities is based on a pricing hierarchy, in order to maintain a controlled process that will systematically promote the use of prices from sources in which Aegon has the most confidence, where the least amount of manual intervention exists and to embed consistency in the selection of price sources. Depending on asset type the pricing hierarchy consists of a waterfall that starts with making use of market prices from indices and follows with making use of third-party pricing services or brokers.",

Gains and losses are recorded in the line item Results from financial transactions of the income statement.\n- 2 Total gains and losses are recorded in line items: Gains / (losses) on revaluation of available-for-sale investments, (Gains) / losses transferred to the income statement on\n- disposal and impairment of available-for-sale investments and Changes in revaluation reserve real estate held for own use of the statement of other comprehensive income.\n- 3 Total gains / (losses) for the period during which the financial instrument was in Level III.\n\nDuring 2020, Aegon transferred certain financial instruments from Level II to Level III of the fair value hierarchy. The reason for the change in level was that the market liquidity for these securities decreased, which led to a change in market observability of prices. Prior to transfer, the fair value for the Level II securities was determined using observable market transactions or corroborated broker quotes respectively for the same or similar instruments. The amount of assets and liabilities transferred to Level III was EUR/uni00A042 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0263 million). Since the transfer, all such assets have been valued using valuation models incorporating significant non market-observable inputs or uncorroborated broker quotes.\n\nSimilarly, during 2020, Aegon transferred EUR/uni00A0710 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0517 million) of financial instruments from Level III to other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The change in level was mainly the result of a return of activity in the market for these securities and that for these securities the fair value could be determined using observable market transactions or corroborated broker quotes for the same or similar instruments.",

For Level III unquoted shares,/uni00A0the net asset value can be considered the best approximation to the fair value. Net asset value is the value of an\n\nentity's assets minus the value of its liabilities and may be the same as the book value or the equity value of the entity./uni00A0 Also for unquoted shares, the fair value may be estimated using other methods, such as observations of the price/earnings or price/ cash flow ratios of quoted companies considered comparable to the companies being valued. Valuations are adjusted to account for company-specific issues and the lack of liquidity inherent in an unquoted investment. Adjustments for lack of liquidity are generally based on available market evidence. In addition, a variety of other factors are reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, current operating performance, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment./uni00A0\n\nAvailable-for-sale shares include shares in a Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) for an amount of EUR/uni00A093 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A091 million), which are reported as part of the line-item Net asset value. A FHLB has implicit financial support from the United States government. The redemption value of the shares is fixed at par and they can only be redeemed by the FHLB.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThe fair values of debt securities are determined by management after taking into consideration several sources of data. When available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its debt securities. As stated previously, Aegon's valuation policy utilizes a pricing hierarchy which dictates that publicly available prices are initially sought from indices and third-party pricing services. In the event that pricing is not available from these sources, those securities are submitted to brokers to obtain quotes, the majority of which are non-binding. As part of the pricing process, Aegon assesses the appropriateness of each quote (i.e. as to whether the quote is based on observable market transactions or not) to determine the most appropriate estimate of fair value.\n\nWhen broker quotes are not available, securities are priced using internal cash flow modeling techniques. These valuation methodologies commonly use the following inputs: reported trades, bids, offers, issuer spreads, benchmark yields, estimated prepayment speeds, issue specific credit adjustments, indicative quotes from market makers and/or estimated cash flows.\n\nTo understand the valuation methodologies used by third-party pricing services Aegon reviews and monitors the applicable methodology documents of the third-party pricing services. Any changes to their methodologies are noted and reviewed for reasonableness. In addition, Aegon performs in-depth reviews of prices received from third-party pricing services on a sample basis. The objective for such reviews is to demonstrate that Aegon can corroborate detailed information such as assumptions, inputs and methodologies used in pricing individual securities against documented pricing methodologies. Only third-party pricing services and brokers with a substantial presence in the market and with appropriate experience and expertise are used.\n\nThird-party pricing services will often determine prices using recently reported trades for identical or similar securities. The third-party pricing service makes adjustments for the elapsed time from the trade date to the reporting date to take into account available market information. Lacking recently reported trades, third-party pricing services and brokers will use modeling techniques to determine a security price where expected future cash flows are developed based on the performance of the underlying collateral and discounted using an estimated market rate.\n\nPeriodically, Aegon performs an analysis of the inputs obtained from third-party pricing services and brokers to ensure that the inputs are reasonable and produce a reasonable estimate of fair value. Aegon's asset specialists and investment valuation specialists consider both qualitative and quantitative factors as part of this analysis. Several examples of analytical procedures performed include, but are not limited to, recent transactional activity for similar debt securities, review of pricing statistics and trends and consideration of recent relevant market events. Other controls and procedures over pricing received from indices, third-party pricing services, or brokers include validation checks such as exception reports which highlight significant price changes, stale prices or unpriced securities. Additionally, Aegon performs back testing on a sample basis. Back testing involves selecting a sample of securities trades and comparing the prices in those transactions to prices used for financial reporting. Significant variances between the price used for financial reporting and the transaction price are investigated to explain the cause of the difference.\n\nCredit ratings are also an important consideration in the valuation of securities and are included in the internal process for determining Aegon's view of the risk associated with each security. However, Aegon does not rely solely on external credit ratings and there is an internal process, based on market observable inputs, for determining Aegon's view of the risks associated with each security.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAegon's portfolio of private placement securities (held at fair value under the classification of available-for-sale or fair value through profit or loss) is valued using a matrix pricing methodology. The pricing matrix is obtained from a third-party service provider and indicates current spreads for securities based on weighted average life, credit rating, and industry sector. Each month, Aegon's asset specialists review the matrix to ensure the spreads are reasonable by comparing them to observed spreads for similar bonds traded in the market. Other inputs to the valuation include coupon rate, the current interest rate curve used for discounting and a liquidity premium to account for the illiquid nature of these securities. The liquidity premiums are determined based upon the pricing of recent transactions in the private placements market; comparing the value of the privately offered security to a similar public security. The impact of the liquidity premium for private placement securities to the overall valuation is insignificant.\n\nAegon's portfolio of debt securities can be subdivided into Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), Commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMBS), Asset-backed securities (ABS), Corporate bonds and Government debt. Below relevant details of the valuation methodologies for these specific types of debt securities are described.\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities\n\nValuations of RMBS, CMBS and ABS are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis. Valuations per asset type are based on a pricing hierarchy which uses a waterfall approach that starts with market prices from indices and follows with third-party pricing services or brokers. The pricing hierarchy is dependent on the possibilities of corroboration of the market prices. If no market prices are available, Aegon uses internal models to determine fair value. Significant inputs included in the internal models are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Market standard models may be used to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each transaction. The most significant unobservable input is the liquidity premium which is embedded in the discount rate.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nValuations of corporate bonds are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis. The pricing hierarchy is dependent on the possibility of corroboration of market prices when available. If no market prices are available, valuations are determined by a discounted cash flow methodology using an internally calculated yield. The yield is comprised of a credit spread over a given benchmark. In all cases the benchmark is an observable input. The credit spread contains both observable and unobservable inputs. Aegon starts by taking an observable credit spread from a similar bond of the given issuer, and then adjust this spread based on unobservable inputs. These unobservable inputs may include subordination, liquidity and maturity differences. The weighted average credit spread used in valuation of corporate bonds has decreased to 2.4% (December 31, 2019: 2.5%).\n\n## Government debt\n\nWhen available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its government debt investments. When Aegon cannot make use of quoted market prices, market prices from indices or quotes from third-party pricing services or brokers are used.\n\n## Money market and other short-term investments and deposits with financial institutions\n\nThe fair value of assets maturing within a year is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amount adjusted for credit risk where appropriate. Credit risk adjustments are based on market observable credit spreads if available, or management's estimate if not market observable.\n\n## Tax credit investments\n\nThe Level III fair value of tax credit investments is determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation technique. This valuation technique takes into consideration projections of future capital contributions and distributions, as well as future tax credits and the tax benefits of future operating losses. The present value of these cash flows is calculated by applying a discount rate. In general, the discount rate is determined based on the cash outflows for the investments and the cash inflows from the tax credits and/or tax benefits (and the timing of these cash flows). These inputs are unobservable in the market place. The discount rate used in valuation of tax credit investments has increased to 6.6% (December 31, 2019: 6.5%).\n\n## Investment funds: Real estate funds, private equity funds and hedge funds\n\nThe fair values of investments held in non-quoted investment funds are determined by management after taking into consideration information provided by the fund managers. Aegon reviews the valuations each month and performs analytical procedures and trending analyses to ensure the fair values are appropriate. The net asset value is considered the best valuation method that approximates the fair value of the funds.",

For fixed interest mortgage loans, the market rate is adjusted for expenses, prepayment rates, lapse assumptions (unobservable inputs), liquidity and credit risk (market observable inputs). An increase in expense spread, prepayment rates and/or prepayment assumptions, would decrease the fair value of the mortgage loan portfolio.\n\nThe fair value of floating interest rate mortgage loans, policy loans and private placements used for disclosure purposes is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amount, adjusted for changes in credit risk. Credit risk adjustments are based on market observable credit spreads if available, or management's estimate if not market observable.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWhere quoted market prices are not available, other valuation techniques, such as option pricing or stochastic modeling, are applied. The valuation techniques incorporate all factors that a typical market participant would consider and are based on observable market data when available. Models are validated before they are used and calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual experience and comparable market prices.\n\nFair values for exchange-traded derivatives, principally futures and certain options, are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Fair values for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments represent amounts estimated to be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these instruments. These derivatives are valued using pricing models based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, directly observed prices from exchange-traded derivatives, other OTC trades, or external pricing services. Most valuations are derived from swap and volatility matrices, which are constructed for applicable indices and currencies using current market data from many industry standard sources. Option pricing is based on industry standard valuation models and current market levels, where applicable. The pricing of complex or illiquid instruments is based on internal models or an independent third party. For long-dated illiquid contracts, extrapolation methods are applied to observed market data in order to estimate inputs and assumptions that are not directly observable. To value OTC derivatives, management uses observed market information, other trades in the market and dealer prices.\n\nSome OTC derivatives are so-called longevity derivatives. The payout of longevity derivatives is linked to publicly available mortality tables. The derivatives are measured using the present value of the best estimate of expected payouts of the derivative plus a risk margin. The best estimate of expected payouts is determined using best estimate of mortality developments. Aegon determined the risk margin by stressing the best estimate mortality developments to quantify the risk and applying a cost-of-capital methodology. Depending on the duration of the longevity swaps either the projected mortality development or discount rate are the most significant unobservable inputs.\n\nAegon normally mitigates counterparty credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements where practical and in ISDA master netting agreements for each of the Group's legal entities to facilitate Aegon's right to offset credit risk exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives attributable to changes in counterparty credit risk were not significant.\n\n## Embedded derivatives in insurance contracts including guarantees\n\nBifurcated guarantees for minimum benefits in insurance and investment contracts are carried at fair value. These guarantees include Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) in the United States and United Kingdom which are offered on some variable annuity products and are also assumed from a ceding company; minimum investment return guarantees on insurance products offered in the Netherlands, including group pension and traditional products; variable annuities sold in Europe.\n\nSince the price of these guarantees is not quoted in any market, the fair values of these guarantees are based on discounted cash flows calculated as the present value of future expected payments to policyholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the guarantees. Given the complexity and long-term nature of these guarantees which are unlike instruments available in financial markets, their fair values are determined by using stochastic models under a variety of market return scenarios. A variety of factors are considered, including own credit spread, expected market rates of return, equity and interest rate volatility, correlations of market returns, discount rates and actuarial assumptions. The most significant unobservable factor is own credit spread. The weighted average own credit spread used in the valuations of embedded derivatives in insurance contracts increased to 0.25% (2019:/uni00A00.24%).\n\nThe expected returns are based on risk-free rates. Aegon added a premium to reflect the credit spread as required. The credit spread is set by using the Credit default swap (CDS) spreads of a reference portfolio of life insurance companies (including Aegon), adjusted to reflect the subordination of senior debt holders at the holding company level to the position of policyholders at the operating",

Aegon's assumptions are set by region to reflect differences in the valuation of the guarantee embedded in the insurance contracts.\n\nAegon extrapolates yield curves beyond market observable maturities. The discount rates converge linearly in 10 years to an Ultimate Forward Rate. In the Netherlands, the ultimate forward rate is 3.65% from the last liquid point. In 2020, Aegon changed its ultimate forward rate in the US from 4.25% to 3.55%. The uniform last liquid point for all Aegon's major currencies (EUR, USD and GBP) is set at 30 years.\n\nSince many of the assumptions are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the liability valuation, the liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to note/uni00A036 Guarantees in insurance contracts for more details about Aegon's guarantees.\n\n## Real estate\n\nValuations of Level III investments in real estate and real estate held for own use are conducted in full by independent external appraisers at least every three to five years and reviewed at least once a year by qualified internal appraisers to ensure the value correctly reflects the fair value at the reporting date. Appraisals are different for each specific local market, but are based on market guidelines such as International Valuation Standards, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice or guidelines issued by the Investment Property Databank. Valuations are mostly based on active market prices, adjusted for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific property. If such information is not available, other valuation methods are applied, considering the value that the property's net earning power will support, the value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties and the current cost of reproducing or replacing the property. Discount rates used in the valuation of real estate reflect the risk embedded in the projected cash flows for the asset being valued. Capitalization rates represent the income rate for a real estate property that reflects the relationship between a single year's net operating income expectancy and the total property price or value. For property held for own use, appraisers consider the present value of the future rental income cash flows that could be achieved had the real estate been rented to a third party.\n\n## Trust pass-through securities and subordinated borrowings\n\nTrust pass-through securities and subordinated borrowings are either carried at fair value (if they are designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) or amortized cost (with fair value being disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). For the determination of the fair value of these instruments, the level hierarchy as described by IFRS-EU is used. The preferred method of obtaining the fair value of the fair value option bonds is the quoted price (Level I). In case markets are less liquid or the quoted prices are not available, an internal model is used, based on parameters which are market observable (Level II) such as credit spreads and issuer yield curves and unobservable market inputs (Level III) such as an illiquidity discount and credit quality adjustments. Aegon uses a discounted cash flow method including yield curves such as deposit rates, floating rates, 3-month swap rates, and the US Treasury yield curve. In addition, Aegon includes own credit spread based on Aegon's credit default swap curve./uni00A0The trust past-through securities have been classified asLevel III of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nInvestment contracts issued by Aegon are either carried at fair value (if they are designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) or amortized cost (with fair value being disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). These contracts are not quoted in active markets and their fair values are determined by using valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow methods and stochastic modeling or in relation to the unit price of the underlying assets. All models are validated and calibrated. A variety of factors are considered, including time value, volatility, policyholder behavior, servicing costs and fair values of similar instruments.\n\nSimilar to embedded derivatives in insurance contracts, certain investment products are not quoted in active markets and their fair values are determined by using valuation techniques. Because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows, stochastic or similar techniques under a variety of market return scenarios are often used. A variety of factors are considered, including expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market returns, discount rates and actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe expected returns are based on risk-free rates, such as the current London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap rates/uni00A0and associated forward rates, the/uni00A0Overnight Index Swap (OIS) curve or the current rates on local government bonds. Market volatility assumptions for each underlying index are based on observed market implied volatility data and/or observed market performance. Correlations of market returns for various underlying indices are based on observed market returns and their inter-relationships over a number of years preceding the valuation date. Current risk-free spot rates are used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process.",

Over the course of the multi-year contract, Transamerica will pay approximately USD 390 million to LTCG. These fees represent compensation for administering Transamerica's long term care product line including policyholder service, claims processing and care management. The agreement also contains a termination clause in which case Transamerica - subject to certain limitations - agrees to compensate LTCG, on a specified schedule, for early termination.\n\nAffiliates of Transamerica Corporation entered into a series of agreements with affiliates of Tata Consultancy Services Limited ('TCS') to administer the Company's US life insurance, voluntary benefits, and annuity business lines. The collaboration enables Transamerica to accelerate the enhancement of its digital capabilities and the modernization of its platforms to service its customers in all lines of business. Over the course of the multi-year contract, Transamerica will pay more than USD 2 billion to TCS. These fees represent compensation for administering Transamerica's over 10 million policies and are driven by both new business and policies already in force. In addition, this commitment includes remaining transition and conversion charges of approximately USD 49 million (period 2021-2022) as well as administrative, IT and finance service fees which are contingent on TCS meeting specified milestones in the underlying agreement with Transamerica. The agreement also contains a termination clause in which case Transamerica - subject to certain limitations - agrees to compensate TCS, on a specified schedule, for early termination.\n\nIn November 2018, Aegon UK announced an extended partnership with Atos BPS Ltd (Atos) to service and administer its Existing Business (non-Platform customers).

Although uncertainties are provided for adequately in the tax position, the ultimate outcome of the tax audits of litigation may result in an outcome that differs from the amounts provided for.\n\nInsurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities are routinely subject to litigation, investigation and regulatory activity by various governmental and enforcement authorities, individual claimants and policyholder advocate groups in the jurisdictions in which Aegon does business, including the United States, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom. These actions may involve issues including, but not limited to, employment or distribution relationships; operational and internal controls and processes; investment returns; sales practices; transparency and adequacy of product disclosures including regarding initial costs, ongoing costs, and costs due on policy surrender as well as changes to costs over time; environmental and climate change related matters; competition and antitrust matters; data privacy; information security; intellectual property; and anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and economic sanctions compliance.\n\nGovernment and regulatory investigations may result in the institution of administrative, injunctive or other proceedings and/ or the imposition of monetary fines, penalties and/or disgorgement as well as other remedies, sanctions, damages and restitutionary amounts. Regulators may also seek changes to the way Aegon operates. In some cases, Aegon subsidiaries have modified business practices in response to inquiries.\n\nCustomers of certain Aegon products bear significant investment risks with respect to those products, which are affected by fluctuations in equity markets as well as interest rate movements. When investment returns disappoint, are volatile or change due to changes in the market or other relevant conditions, customers may threaten or bring litigation against Aegon. Disputes and investigations initiated by governmental entities and private parties may lead to orders or settlements including payments or changes to business practices even if Aegon believes the underlying claims are without merit./uni00A0\n\nThe existence of potential claims may remain unknown for long periods of time after the events giving rise to such claims. Determining the likelihood of exposure to Aegon and the extent of any such exposure may not be possible for long periods of time after Aegon becomes aware of such potential claims. Litigation exposure may develop over long periods of time; once litigation is initiated, it may be protracted and subject to multiple levels of appeal, which can lead to significant costs of defense, adverse publicity and other constraints.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts under claims of bad faith, which can result in tort, punitive and/or statutory damages. Damages alleged may not be quantifiable or supportable, or may have no relationship to economic losses or final awards. As a result, Aegon cannot predict the effect of litigation, investigations or other actions on its business./uni00A0",

Plaintiffs generally allege that the increases were made to recoup past losses rather than to cover the future costs of providing insurance coverage. Aegon's subsidiary in the US has agreed to settle two such class actions that had been venued in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The settlement in the first case, approved in January 2019,arose from increases implemented in 2015-2016. Over 99% of affected policyholders participated in that settlement. While less than 1% of policyholders opted out of the settlement, they represent approximately 43% of the value of the settlement fund. The individual opt-out cases and disputes are ongoing. Resolution of this class action ended a number of other related cases, including other federal and state class actions. In the second case, Aegon's subsidiary agreed to settle a class action lawsuit arising out of MDR increases in 2017 and 2018. The court approved that settlement on September/uni00A016,/uni00A02020. Opt-outs in this case represent less than 7% of the value of the settlement fund. On October/uni00A015,/uni00A02020, two opt-out policyholders whose objections to the settlement were overruled by the trial court filed an appeal. The appeal has delayed implementation of the settlement. The settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs, although Aegon continues to hold a provision for these policyholders. In the only individual case against Aegon's subsidiary to reach trial (in 2017), a jury found that a 2013 increase to a certain group of policies was improper. The jury verdict was affirmed on appeal, which ended the case. At this time it is impracticable for Aegon to quantify a range or maximum liability or the timing of the financial impact, if any, of the remaining MDR increase related litigation, as the potential financial impacts are dependent both on the outcomes of court proceedings and future developments in financial markets and mortality. If decided adversely to Aegon, these claims could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations, and financial position.\n\nUnclaimed property administrators and state insurance regulators performed examinations and multi-state examinations of the life insurance industry in the United States, including certain of Aegon's subsidiaries. Aegon subsidiaries, like other major US insurers, entered into resolutions with state treasurers and insurance regulators regarding unclaimed property and claims settlement practices. As of December 2020, there remained a provision of USD 6 million for unclaimed property obligations, which is management's best estimate of the still-outstanding exposure. The final amount may vary based on subsequent regulatory review.\n\nAegon's US-based subsidiaries may face employment-related lawsuits from time to time. For example, several US-based Aegon subsidiaries have been named in a class action alleging that the business model for a part of the business inappropriately characterizes distributors as independent contractors instead of employees. Depending on the outcome, these lawsuits, along with similar claims against other companies and regulatory action could result in significant settlements or judgments, and could necessitate a change in the distribution model, which would be costly and could have a material impact on the financial results for that part of the Aegon US business.\n\nA former subsidiary of Transamerica Corporation was involved in a contractual dispute with a Nigerian travel broker that arose in 1976. That dispute was resolved in Delaware court for USD 235 thousand plus interest in 2010. The plaintiff took the Delaware judgment relating to the 1976 dispute to a Nigerian court and alleged that it was entitled to approximately the same damages for 1977 through 1984 despite the absence of any contract relating to those years. The Nigerian trial court issued a judgment in favor of the plaintiff of the alleged actual damages as well as pre-judgment interest of approximately USD 120 million. On appeal this decision was reversed on procedural grounds and remanded back to the trial court which ruled to dismiss the case; however, the Plaintiff appealed the trial court's ruling. The appeal is still pending. Aegon has no material assets located in Nigeria.\n\nIn Poland, owners of unit-linked policies continue to file claims in civil court against Aegon over fees payable upon purchase or surrender of the product. Plaintiffs claim that these fees are not contractually supported. Aegon faces a significant number of these cases. For reasons of commercial necessity as well as at the instigation of the regulatory authorities, Aegon decided to modify the fee structure. As of 2020, a provision of EUR/uni00A010 million remains, which represents management's best estimate of the exposure. The final amount may vary based on regulatory developments and the outcome of litigation.\n\nIn the Netherlands, unit linked products ('beleggingsverzekeringen') have been controversial and the target of litigation since at least 2005. Allegations include excessive cost, unfair terms, inadequate disclosure, and failure to perform as illustrated. Consumer groups have formed to address these issues and initiate mass claims against insurers. Regulators as well as the Dutch Parliament have been involved ever since, with the principal goal of achieving an equitable resolution. Aegon has made improvements across its product lines, including after settlements reached in 2009 with Stichting Woekerpolis and Stichting Verliespolis. Aegon also decided to reduce",

In September 2014, consumer interest group Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl filed a claim against Aegon in court. The claim related to a range of unit linked products that Aegon sold in the past, including Aegon products involved in the earlier litigation. The claim challenges a variety of elements of these products, on multiple legal grounds, including allegations made previously. In June 2017 (and revised in December 2017), the court issued a verdict which upheld the principle that disclosures must be evaluated according to the standards at the time when the relevant products were placed in-force. Most of the claims of Vereniging Woekerpolis. nl were dismissed under this standard, although the court found that Aegon did not adequately disclose certain charges on a limited set of policies. The district court did not decide on the reasonableness of the cost levels and whether the previous compensation arrangements provide sufficient compensation. This court decision has been appealed by both parties. The Court of Appeal has stayed the proceedings and indicated to decide on March 30, 2021 on the continuation of the proceedings. Aegon expects the claims and litigation on unit linked products to continue for the foreseeable future. Developments in similar cases against other Dutch insurers currently before regulators and courts may also affect Aegon. At this time, Aegon is unable to estimate the range or potential maximum liability. There can be no assurances that these matters, in the aggregate, will not ultimately result in a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.\n\nSecurities leasing products ('aandelenlease producten') have also been the subject of litigation in the Netherlands. Although sales of securities leasing products ended more than a decade ago, litigation relating to these products has resurfaced. In 2016, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a securities leasing product sold by one of Aegon's competitors. It decided that the financial institution was liable if a broker ('remisier') that advised on the sale of the institution's products was not properly licensed. In July 2016, consumer interest group Stichting Platform Aandelenlease filed a claim against Aegon Bank regarding securities leasing product Sprintplan. In October 2017, the district court of The Hague ruled in favor of Aegon that the Sprintplan liability had been conclusively determined in earlier proceedings and there were no grounds to hold further collective proceedings. The plaintiff appealed. In February 2020, the Court of Appeal rejected all claims filed by Platform Aandelenlease against Aegon Bank. This ruling has become final.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Aegon is also involved in claims for compensation and the cancellation or nullification of contracts concerning the Vliegwiel product, a variation on securities leasing products. Currently, proceedings are pending before the Dutch courts and the Financial Services Complaints Authority ('Klachteninstituut Financi\u00eble Dienstverlening'), with numerous cases having been initiated by Leaseproces B.V. In December 2020 Aegon reached an agreement on a settlement with Leaseproces B.V. for those customers with Vliegwiel and Sprintplan products who are represented by Leaseproces B.V. The settlement is subject to conditions precedent and further operational details have yet to be agreed. Execution of the settlement is expected in 2021. Aegon has taken a provision for the settlement. However, the outcome of the settlement and any (potential) legal proceedings in relation to Vliegwiel and Sprintplan products is uncertain, and therefore Aegon is unable to estimate a potential maximum liability at this time. There can be no assurances that this matter will not ultimately result in a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.\n\n## 46 Transfers of financial assets\n\nTransfers of financial assets occur when Aegon transfers contractual rights to receive cash flows of financial assets or when Aegon retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the transferred financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in that arrangement.\n\nIn the normal course of business Aegon is involved in the following transactions:\n\n- \u25a0 Transferred financial assets that are not derecognized in their entirety:\n- \u25a0 Securities lending; whereby Aegon legally (but not economically) transfers assets and receives cash and non-cash collateral. The transferred assets are not derecognized. The obligation to repay the cash collateral is recognized as a liability. The non-cash collateral is not recognized in the statement of financial position; and\n- \u25a0 Repurchase activities; whereby Aegon receives cash for the transferred assets. The financial assets are legally (but not economically) transferred, but are not derecognized. The obligation to repay the cash received is recognized as a liability.\n- \u25a0 Transferred financial assets that are derecognized in their entirety and Aegon does not have a continuing involvement (normal sale);\n- \u25a0 Transferred financial assets that are derecognized in their entirety, but where Aegon has a continuing involvement;\n- \u25a0 Collateral accepted in the case of securities lending, reverse repurchase agreement and derivative transactions; and\n- \u25a0 Collateral pledged in the case of (contingent) liabilities, repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions.\n\nThe following disclosures provide details for transferred financial assets that are not derecognized in their entirety, transferred financial asset that are derecognized in their entirety, but where Aegon has a continuing involvement and assets accepted and pledged as collateral.",

The assets are transferred in return for cash collateral or other financial assets. Non-cash collateral is not recognized in the statement of financial position. Cash collateral is recorded on the statement of financial position as an asset and an offsetting liability is established for the same amount as Aegon is obligated to return this amount upon termination of the lending arrangement. Cash collateral is usually invested in pre-designated high quality investments. The sum of cash and non-cash collateral is typically greater than the market value of the related securities loaned.

As shown in the second column there are no financial assets and liabilities offset in 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe line Derivatives includes derivatives for general account and for account of policyholder.\n\nAegon mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements, where practical, and in ISDA master netting agreements for each of the Aegon's legal entities to facilitate Aegon's right to offset credit risk exposure. The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aegon or its counterparty. Transactions requiring Aegon or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of over-the-counter derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and credit swaps. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard long-term borrowing, derivative, securities lending and securities borrowing activities, as well as requirements determined by exchanges where the bank acts as intermediary.\n\n## 48 Business combinations Acquisitions\n\n## 2020\n\nOn July 30, 2020, Aegon announced the completion of the expansion of its partnership with Santander in Spain. This follows the agreement signed on July 3, 2018 between Aegon and Banco Santander to expand their life and non-life insurance partnership, following Banco Santander's acquisition of Banco Popular./uni00A0Aegon's insurance joint ventures with Banco Santander in Spain completed the acquisition of the in force term life policies previously sold through Banco Popular branches as well as the right to write new term life and selected lines of non-life policies through the former Banco Popular branches now owned by Banco Santander. The transaction was closed following satisfaction of all closing conditions, including the termination of existing alliances of Banco Popular. For its 51% stake in the expansion of the joint venture with Banco Santander, Aegon paid an upfront amount of EUR/uni00A0187 million - lower than the EUR/uni00A0215 million communicated in July 2018 mainly due to the results of the in-force portfolio which accrued to Santander till closing. Furthermore, the/uni00A0previously agreed contingent payment of up to EUR/uni00A075 million is due in 2024, subject to the performance of the partnership.",

This will result in an increase in IFRS equity of EUR/uni00A0505 million, of which EUR/uni00A0362 million is recognized as a book gain based on the balance sheet position on June 30, 2020, excluding transaction costs. The transaction is subject to regulatory and antitrust approvals customary for transactions of this nature and is expected to close in the course of 2021.\n\nOn October 9, 2020, Aegon announced the sale of Stonebridge, a UK-based provider of accident insurance products. The net proceeds of approximately GBP 60 million (EUR/uni00A065 million) consist of the purchase price and dividends related to the transaction, and exclude a contingent consideration of up to GBP 10 million. The proceeds are equal to one times Stonebridge's Solvency II Own Funds at yearend 2019. The sale was completed on February 28, 2021 and had no material impact on Aegon's capital position and results.\n\nOn January 29, 2020, Aegon completed the sale of its 50% stake in the variable annuity joint ventures in Japan. The sale was announced on May 17, 2019. The total cash proceeds are EUR/uni00A0153 million (JPY 18.75 billion). The divestment had no material impact on Aegon's capital position and led to an IFRS gain of EUR/uni00A053 million.

As a consequence of the transaction, annual income before tax and underlying earnings before tax decreased. In 2018, the underlying earnings before tax of the combined operations amounted to EUR/uni00A017 million.\n\n## 2018\n\nOn April 3, 2018, Aegon completed the sale of Aegon Ireland plc to Athora Holding Ltd. agreed to on August 9, 2017. The net proceeds of the transaction amounted to GBP 177 million (EUR/uni00A0202 million). The divestment led to a book loss of GBP 81 million (EUR/uni00A093 million), reported in note/uni00A017 Other charges. This divestment had no material impact on underlying earnings before tax going forward. Upon disposal, an amount of GBP 31 million (EUR/uni00A036 million) related to the foreign currency translation and net foreign investment hedging reserve has been reclassified from Other Comprehensive Income into the income statement.\n\nOn August 7, 2018, Aegon agreed to divest the last substantial block of its US life reinsurance business to SCOR Global Life.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAegon has significant operations in the Americas, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. To be able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence over the consolidated financial statements, we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in the section 'The scope of our group audit'. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group and by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the group financial statements as set out below.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We determined our group materiality based on Adjusted Shareholders' Equity since we believe that this metric has become the most relevant and suitable benchmark to determine our overall materiality, as we have set out in the section 'Materiality'. In particular, we considered where management made important judgments, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.\n\nIn Note 3 'Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies', the Group describes the areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement in the valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts and the valuation of certain Level 3 investments, we considered these matters as key audit matters as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report. Furthermore, we identified uncertainties in policyholder claims and litigation as a key audit matter.\n\nIn identifying these key audit matters we also considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical estimates and assumptions, taking into account the estimation uncertainty as a result of the global pandemic. Based on that assessment, the meetings that we had with Aegon's key management in various operating units and procedures we performed during our audit, we identified the risk of impairment of assets as a new key audit matter compared to previous year. We refer to the separate section on key audit matters for further details.\n\nGiven the importance of information technology (IT) for the Group and hence for our audit of the financial statements, we have, to the extent relevant to our audit, paid specific attention to the IT dependencies and IT general controls, which comprise the policies and procedures to ensure reliable automated processing of information used for financial reporting purposes, and relevant application controls.\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams at both group (consolidation) and component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a complex financial conglomerate, such as Aegon N.V. This includes industry expertise in life and non-life insurance, banking and asset management. We included experts and specialists in the areas of risk assurance (IT), tax services, actuarial services, global human resource services, valuation services for certain types of assets (e.g. complex financial instruments and real estate) and forensic experts in our team.\n\nThe outline of our audit approach was as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u25a0 Overall materiality: EUR 115 million.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u25a0 We conducted audit work in the segments Americas, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, International (Spain, Hungary and Asia) and Holding.\n- \u25a0 Virtual site visits were conducted to the United States, the Netherlands, United/uni00A0Kingdom, Hungary, Spain, Hong Kong and global Asset Management. For the segment Holding, we performed the audit work ourselves.\n- \u25a0 Audit coverage: 98% of consolidated revenue, 99% of consolidated total assets and/uni00A0100% of consolidated profit before tax.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u25a0 Valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts.\n- \u25a0 Valuation of certain Level 3 investments.\n- \u25a0 Impairments of assets.\n- \u25a0 Uncertainties in policyholder claims and litigation.",

As a basis for our judgment   we used 0.75% of the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Rationale for benchmark  applied   | We used the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity, as disclosed in Note 43 of the financial statements, as the primary  benchmark, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements.  Adjusted Shareholders' Equity is defined as IFRS-EU Shareholders' Equity minus revaluation reserves (i.e. the  volatile effect of unrealized gains/losses on available for sale investments) plus non-controlling interests and  long-term incentive plan not yet vested (which are immaterial to the calculation). In previous years we used a  normalized, 3 years average profit before tax as benchmark for determining our overall materiality. We believe  that Adjusted Shareholders' Equity has become a more relevant and suitable benchmark to determine our overall  materiality due to the increasing focus of stakeholders (e.g. regulators, rating agencies and shareholders) on  capital generation in combination with the nature of the Group's business and the volatility of earnings. Adjusted |\n| Component materiality              | To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgment, allocate materiality that is less than our  overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between EUR 15 million and  EUR 100 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nWe also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgment, are material for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above EUR/uni00A06 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A04 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## The scope of our group audit\n\nAegon N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The Group is structured predominantly along geographical lines as described in Note 5, 'Segment information' in the financial statements. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Aegon N.V.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at the component level by the Group engagement team and by each component auditor.\n\nThe group audit primarily focused on the significant components: Americas, the Netherlands and United Kingdom. We subjected these components to audits of their complete financial information, as these components are individually financially significant to the Group. Additionally, we selected Aegon Spain, Aegon Hungary, two operating entities in Asia and Holding for audit of specified balances to achieve appropriate coverage on financial line items in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures for Holding were performed by the Group engagement team.\n\nIn total, in performing these procedures and excluding our group analytical procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:",

For those remaining components we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those components.\n\nWhere component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe issued instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included amongst others our risk analysis, materiality and scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified (including the risk of fraud), the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We also included specific requirements in our instructions to the component auditors to understand and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the risks arising from working in a remote environment. We discussed the risk assessment and audit approach with each of the component teams. This particularly concerned the risk of fraud, revenue recognition, significant estimates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the risk assessment. We developed an oversight strategy for each component based on its significance and/or risk characteristics to the Group. This strategy included procedures such as regular virtual meetings and virtual site visits and discussions with component auditors to challenge and review significant audit matters and judgments including the review of selected working papers via remote access to our component teams audit files. Furthermore, we had individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams during the year and upon conclusion of their work. During these calls, we discussed the significant accounting and audit issues identified by the component auditors, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the audit procedures performed in this respect, their reports, the findings of their procedures and other matters, which could be of relevance for the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Furthermore, we analyzed the reports received from the component auditors and attended the virtual closing meetings.\n\nNext to the meetings with the component teams, we also had virtual meetings with various members of the local Aegon management team of the main components. During these meetings, we discussed the business developments, including the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and working in a remote environment had on processes and controls in order to obtain a good understanding as a group audit team of the local situation and the local impact of the pandemic. Based on the discussions we had with our component teams, the review of their work we performed and the discussions we had with local Aegon management, we assessed that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including working in a remote environment, on the effective operation of controls relevant for our audit was limited and did not lead to an increased audit risk. The majority of the Group's day to day accounting and operational processes were already performed electronically and had the ability to be performed remotely, so the transition to a remote working environment did not cause significant change or disruption to related controls.\n\nThe Group also monitors their third-party service providers for any indications of issues or changes in the control environment. In the US, staff of the company assisted in the execution of controls at a third party service provider to make sure all controls were executed timely. In addition, management has a monitoring process in place to assess any changes at service organizations. Based on the procedures we performed over these controls no findings were noted that impacted our audit approach.\n\nFurthermore, we have been proactive in discussing our expectations with the Group regarding access to information, obtaining and retaining audit evidence and the use of technology to facilitate walkthroughs and other audit procedures. We considered whether we would require audit evidence of a different nature or form than originally planned, which might affect our consideration of its relevance and reliability. We have noticed no instances where we had to perform additional procedures to support the relevance and reliability of the audit evidence provided to us.\n\nThe group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation and financial statement disclosures.",

We refer to the sections 'Our business environment', 'Nonfinancial policies, procedures and outcomes' and 'Risk management' (the last two as part of section 'Safeguarding value creation') of the integrated annual report where the Executive Board included their perspectives on the risk of fraud and section 'Report of the Supervisory Board' as part of section 'Safeguarding value creation' of the integrated annual report where the Supervisory Board reflects on this assessment.\n\n## Risk of fraud\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption. Together with our forensic specialists, we evaluated the fraud risk factors to consider and evaluated whether those factors indicated a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We also considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the control environment in our fraud risk assessment. Considering the identified fraud risk indicators, the potential risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic such as pressure on earnings and ineffective monitoring of controls were already identified. Therefore, we concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic and the remote working environment did not lead to the identification of additional fraud risk factors.\n\nAs in all our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks, tested high-risk manual journal entries and evaluated key estimates and judgments for bias by management, taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We refer to the key audit matter section where we included examples of our approach related to areas of higher risk due to accounting estimates where management makes significant judgments.\n\nWe have performed an assessment of matters reported on the (Group's) whistleblowing procedures with the entity and results of management's investigation of such matters.",

This includes the consideration whether there is a need for the recognition of a provision or a contingent liability disclosure on the future outcome of legal or regulatory processes.\n\nIn line with Standard 250 we made in our audit approach a distinction between those laws and regulations which:\n\n- \u25a0 Have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. For this category, in line with the requirements as included in Standard 250, we obtained sufficient audit evidence regarding compliance with the provision of those laws and regulations; and\n- \u25a0 Do not have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, but where compliance may be fundamental to the operating aspect of the business, to the Group's ability to continue its business or to avoid material penalties. For this category, we performed specific procedures to identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nWe identified that the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations relates mainly to the laws and regulations which have an indirect impact on the financial statements, such as anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, regulations linked to the operating licenses for the group's activities (insurance, asset management, banking) including Solvency II in Europe and Risk-Based Capital (RBC) in the US.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.\n\nWe addressed the key audit matters in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide separate opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any comment or observation we made on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.\n\nThe key audit matters described below are mostly related to the nature of the Group and are therefore expected to occur year over year. We took the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic into consideration in the audit procedures we performed on the existing key audit matters. These are described in more detail in the individual key audit matters below. However, given the significance of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the economic impacts but also the new strategy presented by the Group in December 2020, we gave significant additional attention to the risk of impairment of assets, which we included as a separate and new key audit matter compared to last year.\n\nFinancial information",

This testing is done to verify that the valuation of these assets and liabilities are adequate as compared to the expected future contractual cash flows. Consistent with common practice in the insurance industry, Aegon uses valuation models to support the calculations of the insurance contract liabilities. The complexity of the models may give rise to errors as a result of inadequate/incomplete data or design or application of the models. Models considered more complex and/or requiring significant judgment in the setting of assumptions are those in respect of the guarantees associated with universal life and annuities along with long-term care in the Americas and the corporate pension guarantees in the Netherlands.\n\nThe main assumptions used in measuring the DPAC and VOBA and the liabilities for insurance contracts relate to mortality, morbidity, investment return, future expenses, surrender, lapse, utilization rates and, for embedded derivatives, own credit spread. In addition, Aegon the Netherlands adjusts the outcome of the liability adequacy test for the difference between the fair value and the book value of mortgage loans. The fair value of mortgages loans is determined using significant assumptions that require judgment, including prepayment rate and lapse assumptions. Given the magnitude of the insurance contract liabilities and the sensitivities as explained in Note 34 'Insurance contracts', a change in assumptions (especially mortality and morbidity) could have a significant effect on net income and shareholders' equity.\n\nDuring 2020, Aegon continued a multi-year review of their actuarial models with focus on those considered medium and high risk. Model updates in combination with the Group's actuarial and economic assumptions update resulted in a EUR/uni00A0580 million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0196 million) pre-tax charge for the year as explained in Note 5 'Segment information'.\n\nOur audit focused on the application valuation models and the judgments applied in the assumption setting process, taking into account the uncertainty, complexity and subjectivity related to this. We assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the actuarial process that were relevant for the purpose of our audit, including management's process for setting economic and actuarial assumptions, controls over management's actuarial analyses including estimated versus actual results and experience studies, controls over data integrity and change management for internally operated valuation models (including Aegon's model validation process) and controls over the valuation of mortgage loans.\n\nWe performed audit procedures over the complex valuation models and the model updates to determine the appropriateness of those. We tested the impact of model updates against supporting evidence. For the models used, we tested the completeness and accuracy of key data underlying the development of the aforementioned significant assumptions, as well as actuarial judgments applied, which may vary depending on the product and/or the specifications of the product, and the compliance of the models with the applicable accounting standards. We evaluated the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions, taking also into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on assumed future expenses, surrender and utilization rates and investment return. In our assessment we considered the risk of management bias in setting these significant assumptions. Based on our procedures we found these assumptions to be reasonable and appropriate.\n\nIn respect of DPAC and VOBA, we tested the capitalization during the period and evaluated the appropriateness of the main assumptions used in determining the estimated gross profit patterns which are the basis for the periodic amortization. Our work on the liability adequacy test included assessing the reasonableness of the projected cash flows and challenging the main assumptions adopted in the context of both the Group's and industry experience, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and specific product features, as well as reconciliations to supporting audit information. The quality of previous years' assumptions is assessed by the analyses of the actual versus expected developments. We also evaluated the different market return scenarios that management used for measurement purposes by performing audit procedures on historical experience. Where expert judgment was used, we challenged management on the judgment applied and the use of alternative scenarios. Based on our procedures performed, we found that the assumptions set by management and the different scenarios used were supported by available audit information and are within a range we consider acceptable based on the Group's and industry experience.\n\nIn respect of mortgage loans in Aegon the Netherlands, we evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of the fair value of the portfolio by independently developing a range of acceptable outcomes and comparing management's estimate to the independently developed ranges. Developing the independent estimate involved utilizing a range of available market inputs and assumptions and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management.\n\nWe also evaluated whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and in accordance with IFRS-EU. We found the disclosures to be appropriate in this context.",

These estimations involve significant judgment by management and have a higher potential risk to be affected by error or management bias. Therefore, these areas are considered a key audit matter.\n\nOur focus considered both the positions that are presented at fair value on the balance sheet and those positions carried at amortized cost on the balance sheet but for which fair value is required to be disclosed. The risk is considered higher for investments traded in the absence of an active market as the fair value of those instruments is estimated by using other market observable data, such as corroborated external quotes and present value or other valuation techniques using unobservable data.\n\nThe models that are utilized in the assessment of impairments on structured securities are complex and dependent on assumptions such as prepayments, severities, and Constant Default Rate vectors. The significant inputs used in valuing real estate are monthly rent rolls, capital expenditure budgets provided by the asset manager, and discount rates and capitalization rates obtained from outside parties. In addition, real estate properties are valued using industry standard models and sales comparison based on the type of property.\n\nGiven the nature of certain inputs/rates utilized and valuation methodology employed, the valuation of real estate has a high estimation uncertainty and a change in assumptions could have a significant effect on net income and shareholders' equity.\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the valuation of Level 3 debt securities and investments in real estate, including controls over the development of the model and significant unobservable inputs, as well as management's determination and approval of assumptions and methodologies used in model-based calculations and real estate appraisals, controls over data integrity and change management for internally operated valuation models and management's review of valuations provided by external experts or data vendors, in addition to the evaluation of management's procedures to assess service organization reports over real estate investments. Based on this work we found that we, to the extent relevant for our audit, could rely on these controls.\n\nWe performed retrospective testing where possible to assess the quality of previous estimates and assumptions. We performed substantive audit procedures to supplement procedures over internal control testing. These procedures included, among others, developing an independent estimate of the value for a sample of investments by obtaining independent pricing from third party vendors, if available. Also, on a sample basis for certain Level 3 investments, we evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate by developing an independent range of prices utilizing a range of prices and comparing management's estimate to the independently developed ranges. Developing the independent estimate involved utilizing a range of available market inputs and assumptions and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management.\n\nWe assessed pricing models and the underlying methodologies against industry practice and valuation guidelines. We used real estate valuation experts to assess on a sample basis the fair value of properties as determined by management and as reported by outsourcing parties based on available market information. Based on our procedures we considered that the valuation of these investments was within the bandwidth that we consider acceptable.\n\nWe also evaluated whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and in accordance with IFRS-EU. We found the disclosures to be appropriate in this context.\n\nFinancial information",

Furthermore, the Group presented a new strategy at the end of 2020, that is expected to have an impact on the future earnings capacity of some of its activities.\n\nThese developments lead to additional risks and uncertainties in respect of the assets of the group and can result in a situation where an impairment exists.\n\nThe Group has capitalized goodwill from prior acquisitions where a risk exists that these are no longer supported by future cash flows from the related cash generating units.\n\nIn respect of debt instruments, these risks and uncertainties include the risk that an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer and the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated. For available for sale equity instruments also a market value that is prolonged and/or significantly lower than the cost of these instruments also is considered a trigger for impairment.\n\nThe Group possesses several office buildings as part of Property, plant and equipment. The experience with the pandemic forced working remote solutions also result in a different view on the 'office of the future'. This can be a trigger for a decrease in value of these properties.\n\nAny of these situations could result in a charge against the income statement to the extent of the impairment charge recorded. Given the uncertainties, a change in assumptions, credit characteristics or economic outlook can have a significant effect on net income and shareholders' equity. Therefore, we considered these areas a key matter for our audit, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Uncertainties in policyholder claims and litigation.\n\nRefer to Note 45 'Commitments and contingencies'.\n\nThe insurance industry continues to face consumer activism and regulatory scrutiny over product design and selling practices. The Group has encountered claims and litigations in this respect. Depending on the actual legal position and expectations from management, claims, including litigation related, are either provided for as a liability or reflected as contingent liabilities in the notes to the financial statements based on the criteria as outlined in IAS 37. The Group uses internal and external legal experts where applicable to evaluate its legal positions. Given the uncertainty and judgment in this area in terms of valuation and presentation and disclosure, this area is subject to the risk of understatement of recorded liabilities and incomplete disclosure of contingent liabilities. Therefore, we determined this as a key audit matter.\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to impairment testing on financial and non-financial assets, including controls over the development of models and significant inputs, as well as management's determination and approval of assumptions and methodologies used in calculations and controls over data integrity. Based on this work we found that we, to the extent relevant for our audit, could rely on these controls.\n\nWe have performed substantive testing procedures over the impairment testing on goodwill where we assessed management's assumptions and focused mostly on the forward looking assumptions like expected growth rates and discount rates which are key to the outcome of the/uni00A0impairment test. Our procedures on goodwill were focused on Aegon US and Aegon The Netherlands which constitutes the main goodwill balance./uni00A0In the US we assessed how the impact of/uni00A0the strategic announcement to close new business for variable annuities was included in the projected future cash flows. Based on that assessment and based on audit procedures on anticipated growth rates and discount rate, we concluded that there was sufficient headroom and that the goodwill attributed to this business was recoverable and that no impairment had to be recognized./uni00A0In the Netherlands, we evaluated the performance of the underlying business and identified a limited impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Cash Generating Unit the goodwill relates/uni00A0to. Based on our audit procedures we concur with the positions taken by management in respect of impairments.\n\nFor financial debt instruments we assessed if there was objective evidence of credit events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset which had a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows, taking into account the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these procedures performed we found no such instances where a material impairment on financial debt instruments was required. For equity instruments we evaluated whether there were significant or prolonged declines in fair value below initial cost, which require an impairment that cannot be reversed. Based on our testing we concur with the recorded impairment charge.\n\nFor the buildings included in the real estate held for own use and equipment category, we evaluated the external appraisal that was executed by Aegon and we took into account the anticipated fact that the remote working situation is expected to remain in the future to a certain extent and the plans that management has with the excess building capacity. We assessed the reasonableness of these plans and assumptions and the impact on the fair value of these properties and potential impairment.\n\nWe also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on impairments and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are adequate and in accordance with IFRS-EU. We found the disclosures to be appropriate in this context.\n\nWe gained an understanding of the policyholders' claims and litigations through discussions with management including the general legal counsel.\n\nWe have tested the effectiveness of controls relating to management's evaluation of policyholder claims and litigation contingencies, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating lawyers' letters to the extent considered necessary for our audit. For all (potential) material claims, we tested the underlying facts and circumstances considered and assessed the best estimate of outflows as determined by the Group.\n\nWe tested that the Group has properly reflected the claims and litigations in either the provisions or the contingent liabilities by assessing these against the criteria in IAS 37. In this respect we assessed whether the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, if it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nWe also evaluated whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and in accordance with IFRS-EU. We found the disclosures to be appropriate in this context.\n\nV",

Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.\n- \u25a0 Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u25a0 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u25a0 Concluding on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u25a0 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nConsidering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

At the same date, there were 2,098,114,300 common shares and 571,795,040 common shares B issued. Of the issued common shares, 291,145,638 common shares and 558,910,640 common shares B were held by Vereniging Aegon and 1,061,820 common shares were held by Aegon's subsidiaries.\n\nAll of Aegon's common shares and common shares B are fully paid and not subject to calls for additional payments of any kind. All of Aegon's common shares are registered shares. Holders of shares of New York registry hold their common shares in the registered form issued by Aegon's New York transfer agent on Aegon's behalf. Shares of New York registry and shares of Netherlands registry are exchangeable on a one-to-one basis and are entitled to the same rights, except that cash dividends are paid in US dollars on shares of New York registry.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 254 million common shares were held in the form of New York Registry shares. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 13,232 record holders of Aegon's New York Registry shares resident in the United States.\n\n## Vereniging Aegon\n\nVereniging Aegon is the continuation of the former mutual insurer AGO. In 1978, AGO demutualized and Vereniging AGO became the only shareholder of AGO Holding N.V., which was the holding company for its insurance operations. In 1983, AGO Holding N.V. and Ennia N.V. merged into Aegon N.V.. Vereniging AGO initially received approximately 49% of the common shares and all of the preferred shares in Aegon, giving it voting majority in Aegon. At that time, Vereniging AGO changed its name to Vereniging Aegon.\n\nThe purpose of the Association is a balanced representation of the direct and indirect interests of Aegon and of companies with which Aegon forms a group, of insured parties, employees, shareholders and other related parties of these companies./uni00A0Influences that threaten the continuity, independence or identity of Aegon, in conflict with the aforementioned interests will be resisted as much as possible.\n\nIn accordance with the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement, Vereniging Aegon had certain option rights on preferred shares to prevent dilution of voting power as a result of share issuances by Aegon. This enabled Vereniging Aegon to maintain voting control at the General Meeting of Shareholders of Aegon. In September 2002, Aegon effected a capital restructuring whereby Vereniging Aegon's ownership interest in Aegon's common shares decreased from approximately 37% to approximately 12% and its aggregate ownership interest in Aegon's voting shares decreased from approximately 52% to approximately 33%.\n\nIn May 2003, Aegon's shareholders approved certain changes to Aegon's corporate governance structure, introducing a second class of preferred shares. Both classes of preferred shares had a nominal value of EUR/uni00A00.25 each. The voting rights pertaining to the preferred shares were adjusted accordingly to 25/12 vote per preferred share. However, in May 2003, Aegon and Vereniging Aegon also entered into a Preferred Shares Voting Agreement, pursuant to which Vereniging Aegon agreed to exercise one vote only per preferred share, except in the event of a 'Special Cause', as defined below. At that time Aegon and Vereniging Aegon amended the option arrangements under the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement so that, in the event of an issuance of shares by Aegon, Vereniging Aegon could purchase as many class B preferred shares as would enable Vereniging Aegon to prevent or correct dilution to below its actual percentage of voting shares, to a maximum of 33%.\n\nOn February 15, 2013, Aegon and Vereniging Aegon entered into an agreement to simplify the capital structure of Aegon and to cancel all of Aegon's preferred shares, of which Vereniging Aegon was the sole owner. The execution of this agreement was subject to the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders of Aegon. This approval was granted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2013.\n\nThe simplified capital structure entailed, but was not limited, to the conversion of all outstanding preferred shares A and B, with a nominal value of EUR/uni00A00.25 each, into a mix of common shares and common shares B, with a nominal value of EUR/uni00A00.12 each. The financial rights attached to a common share B were determined at 1/40 th of the financial rights attached to a common share.\n\nThe simplified capital structure also entailed the amendment of the Voting Rights Agreement between Aegon and Vereniging Aegon, known as the Preferred Shares Voting Agreement before May 2013. As a matter of Dutch corporate law, the shares of both classes offer equal full voting rights, as they have equal nominal values (EUR/uni00A00.12). The amended Voting Rights Agreement ensures that",

This means that in the absence of a Special Cause Vereniging Aegon may cast one vote for every common share it holds and one vote only for every 40 common shares B it holds. As Special Cause qualifies the acquisition of a 15% interest in Aegon, a tender offer for Aegon shares or a proposed business combination by any person or group of persons, whether individually or as a group, other than in a transaction approved by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. If, in its sole discretion, Vereniging Aegon determines that a Special Cause has occurred, Vereniging Aegon will notify the General Meeting of Shareholders and retain its right to exercise the full voting power of one vote per common share B for a limited period of six months.\n\nThe simplified capital structure also included an amendment to the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement between Aegon and Vereniging Aegon. Following this 2013 amendment, Vereniging Aegon's call option relates to common shares B.

Aegon USA is designated as a core market, with its businesses organized into Financial Assets and Strategic Assets. Brazil is designated as a growth market.\n\nSeveral Aegon USA product lines are considered Financial Assets and will be closed for new sales. These are traditional, interest ratesensitive living benefits and death benefits, currently available with variable annuities (VA), standalone individual LTC, and fixed indexed annuities. Aegon USA will cease new sales of standalone products in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nStrategic Assets are where Aegon USA is positioned for a greater potential for an attractive return on capital and growth. In Workplace Solutions, Aegon USA will continue to operate in the large market for retirement plans and enhance its focus on small to mid-size organizations and on employee benefits, stable value solutions and Transamerica Advice Center (TAC) businesses. Workplace Solutions will also continue to provide value-added services, such as Managed Advice\u00ae and its proprietary investment solutions. In Individual Solutions, Aegon USA will focus on select life and investment products, including the sale of term life insurance, final expense whole life insurance, and indexed universal life insurance, and select mutual funds and individual retirement products, like accumulation VAs with limited interest rate sensitivity.\n\n## Overview of sales and distribution channels\n\nAegon USA offers its products and services through affiliated and non-affiliated distributors to meet customer needs and provides guidance to Aegon USA customers. Workplace Solutions supports individuals primarily through their employers as customers, Individual Solutions supports individual customers and investors.\n\n## Workplace Solutions\n\nThrough Workplace Solutions, Aegon USA distributes its products and services through independent financial advisors, benefits consultants, and insurance agents as well as through an affiliated team of experienced registered representatives, investment advisor representatives, and licensed insurance agents.\n\n## Individual Solutions\n\n## Wholesale distribution\n\nThrough its Individual Solutions business line, Aegon USA offers annuities, investments (mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs)), life insurance and LTC insurance products through agreements with independent broker-dealers, banks, wirehouses, independent financial planners, and independent insurance producers. Annuity and investment products are also offered through institutions, including large broker-dealer research and advisory platforms, and registered investment advisors.\n\nAdditionally, Aegon USA offers protection products through third-party distribution outlets known as brokerage general agents, direct marketers, and independent marketing organizations. These products are predominantly non-registered products sold through independent insurance producers. This channel offers life insurance (term life, universal life, index universal life, and whole life insurance), LTC insurance and supplemental health products and services through approximately 51,000 independent brokerage distributors and financial institutions. Effective October 2020, Aegon USA no longer sells Medicare Supplement products and services in this channel.\n\n## Retail distribution\n\nAegon USA's retail affiliate distribution group, Transamerica Financial Network (TFN), provides advice and guidance to individuals to meet their protection and investment needs. TFN consists of World Financial Group Insurance Agency (WFGIA), Transamerica Agency Network (TAN) and Transamerica Financial Advisors, Inc. (TFA).

Life products include term life (TL), universal life (UL), variable universal life (VUL), index universal life (IUL), and whole life insurance (WL).\n\n## Term life insurance\n\nTL insurance provides protection for a stated period of time. Benefits are paid to policy beneficiaries in the event of the death of the insured during a specified period. Living benefit riders that provide accelerated benefits for critical illnesses or chronic conditions are available on term insurance.\n\n## Universal life insurance\n\nUL insurance is flexible permanent life insurance that offers death benefit protection together with the potential for cash value accumulation. After the first few years, there is usually no set premium. The policyholder can adjust the frequency and amount of premium payments, as long as sufficient premiums are accumulated in the policy's account value to cover charges in the month that follows, which are called 'monthly deductions'. Any changes in the monthly deduction rate reflect Aegon USA's current expectations with respect to future policy performance. At any time, the policy owner can see the maximum monthly deduction rate that can be charged. Some versions of this product have 'secondary guarantees.' These maintain life insurance coverage when the cash value is insufficient, as long as the customer pays a specified minimum premium.\n\n## Variable universal life insurance\n\nVUL insurance is permanent life insurance that offers both a death benefit and cash value accumulation potential with financial market participation. The premium amount for VUL insurance is flexible and may be changed by the policyholder within contract limits. Coverage amounts may change as well. The investment feature usually includes 'sub-accounts,' which provide exposure to investments, such as stocks and bonds. This exposure increases cash value return potential, but also the risk of additional premium requirements or lower coverage amounts in comparison with a traditional, non-variable life insurance policy. Aegon USA did not actively market VUL insurance in 2020 but may do so in the future.\n\n## Index universal life insurance\n\nIUL insurance provides permanent death benefit protection and cash value accumulation with flexible premium payments. What distinguishes it from other types of permanent life insurance is the way in which interest earnings are credited. Net premiums may be allocated to either a fixed account or indexed accounts. Indexed accounts credit interest based in part on the performance of one or more market indices. The credited interest is based on the index, but with a floor and a cap. IUL offers both market-paced growth potential in the indexed accounts and downside protection. It is an alternative to traditional UL - for which interest is credited at a fixed rate - and VUL, in which the cash value is directly exposed to market fluctuations. LTC riders and other living benefit riders are available./uni00A0\n\n## Whole life insurance\n\nWL insurance provides permanent death benefit protection provided that the required premiums are paid, while accumulating cash values based on statutory requirements. Premiums are generally fixed and usually payable over the life of the policy. Final Expense WL provides coverage for funeral and burial related costs.\n\n## Accident & Health\n\nAegon USA offers supplemental health insurance and LTC insurance.\n\n## Supplemental health insurance\n\nSupplemental health insurance products include accidental death and dismemberment, accidental injury, cancer, critical illness, disability, hospital indemnity, Medicare Supplement, retiree medical, dental, vision, and supplemental medical expense indemnity. Disability and vision are third-party products.\n\nA number of these products provide policyholders with lump sums or specified payments if these policyholders are hospitalized, injured, or diagnosed with a critical illness. Others pay benefits for specific medical expenses and treatments, or cover deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance amounts not covered by other health insurance.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term care insurance\n\nLTC insurance products are a category of health insurance and provide benefits to policyholders that require qualified LTC services when they are unable to perform two or more specified activities of daily living or develop a severe cognitive impairment. LTC insurance helps protect against the high cost of LTC services, and it may also help families better manage the financial, health and safety issues associated with LTC. Aegon USA's LTC product is offered as a rider to certain life insurance products/uni00A0and as a standalone product. Aegon USA has made the decision to stop new sales of these products and intends to cease such sales in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n## Mutual Funds and ETFs\n\nMutual funds are professionally managed investment vehicles comprised of pooled money invested by numerous individuals or institutions. Such funds are invested in various underlying security types such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other securities. Aegon USA offers mutual funds that are focused on several different asset classes, including US equity, global/international equity, fixed income, money markets and alternative investments, as well as asset allocation and target-date funds with combined equity and fixed income strategies. Aegon USA mutual funds utilize the portfolio management expertise of asset managers across the industry in a sub-advised platform, using managers both affiliated with and not affiliated with Aegon. These managers are subject to a rigorous selection and monitoring due diligence process conducted by Transamerica Asset Management.\n\nETFs are a pooled investment vehicle for individual and institutional investors that combine some of the features of a mutual fund with the flexibility of allowing investors to trade throughout the day on an exchange. Aegon USA offers a suite of managed-risk passive ETFs that seek to track the S&P Managed Risk 2.0 Indices marketed under the name DeltaShares. This Managed Risk strategy is applied to US Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, International Developed Equity and Emerging Market Equity Indices.\n\n## Variable Annuities\n\nVAs allow the policyholder to accumulate assets for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and to participate in equity or bond market performance. Additional insurance guarantees, which are offered through riders, can be added to VAs, including guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDBs) and guaranteed living benefits (GLBs). GMDBs provide a guaranteed benefit in the event of death. GLBs are intended to provide a measure of protection against market risk while the annuitant is alive. Different forms of GLBs are offered, such as guaranteeing an income stream for life and/or guaranteeing principal protection. Aegon USA will cease new sales of traditional VAs with interest rate-sensitive living and death benefit riders in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n## Fixed Annuities\n\nFixed annuities allow the policyholder to accumulate assets for retirement on a tax-deferred basis through periodic interest crediting and principal protection. Aegon USA has de-emphasized traditional fixed deferred annuities and is only marketing new sales through the Transamerica Advice Center/uni00A0(TAC). The traditional fixed deferred annuity book is, according to plan, continuing to reduce over time. Aegon USA historically offered a fixed-index annuity that may credit interest based, in part, on the percentage change in the value of the selected index account option(s) at the start and end of the crediting period. A fixed account option was also available. Additional guarantees, which were offered through riders, can be added to fixed-index annuities, including GLBs. Aegon USA will cease new sales of fixed indexed annuities in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n## Retirement Plans and IRAs\n\nComprehensive and customized retirement plan services are offered to employers across the entire range of defined benefit, defined contribution, non-qualified deferred compensation, and multiple employer plans (MEPs). Services are also offered to individuals rolling over funds from other qualified retirement funds or IRAs.\n\nRetirement plan services, including administration, recordkeeping and related services are offered to employers of all sizes and to plans across all market segments. Aegon USA also works closely with plan advisors and third-party administrators to serve their customers. Transamerica Retirement Solutions is a top-ten defined contribution record-keeper in the United States based on number of plan participants 1 .\n\nPlan sponsors have access to a wide array of investment options. Depending on the product chosen by the plan sponsor, unrestricted access to all publicly available investments can be offered. Certain smaller plans have access to hundreds of investment choices from more than 40 investment advisory companies.",

Managed Advice\u00ae is a managed account option that plan sponsors can make available to participants that provides investment advice to participants using the plan's slate of funds.\n\nFor individual plan participants in transition due to a job loss or change or planned retirement, services and products include IRAs, advisory services, and annuities as well as access to other financial insurance products and resources.\n\n## Stable Value Solutions\n\nAegon USA's Stable Value Solutions business offers synthetic guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) primarily to tax-qualified institutional entities such as 401(k) plans and other retirement plans and college savings plans. A synthetic GIC 'wrapper' is offered around fixed income invested assets, which are owned by the plan and managed by the plan or a third-party money manager hired by the plan. A synthetic GIC is typically issued with an evergreen maturity and may be terminated under certain conditions. Such a contract helps to reduce fluctuations in the value of the wrapped assets and provides book value withdrawals for plan participants.\n\n## Brazil\n\nAegon's business in Brazil consists of a 50% interest in Mongeral Aegon Seguros e Previd\u00eancia S.A., a Brazilian independent life insurer. Mongeral Aegon Group's activities include a life insurance and pension company, an asset management company, a multi-sponsored pension fund, a liabilities management company for pension funds, and a longevity institute. Mongeral Aegon Group and Bancoob (Banco Cooperativo do Brasil) own Sicoob Seguradora de Vida e Previd\u00eancia (Sicoob), a life insurance and pensions company that provides life insurance and pension products via the Sicoob system. The joint venture distributes products through Sicoob. Bancoob is a private commercial bank owned by the credit cooperative entities affiliated with the Sicoob system. Sicoob represents a key distribution channel for Mongeral Aegon Group, which already serves over 4 million customers nationwide through over 4,000 brokers.\n\n## Mexico\n\nBeginning in 2017, Akaan Transamerica, Aegon's joint venture in Mexico, offered a wide variety of mutual funds and investment solutions. In 2019, Aegon USA made the strategic decision to wind down this joint venture as the business had not performed according to expectations. The wind down of the joint venture was completed in 2020.\n\n## Run-off businesses\n\nRun-off businesses include results related to the run-off of the remaining institutional spread-based business, structured settlements blocks of business, the life reinsurance business and the bank-owned and corporate-owned life insurance (BOLI/COLI) business in the United States./uni00A0The size of these remaining blocks is small and in 2021 this segment, along with all other business, will be included as part of the main lines of business in underlying earnings. Please refer to Note 5 Segment Information for further information on Aegon USA's run-off businesses.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe US marketplace is highly competitive. Aegon USA's competitors include other large insurance carriers, in addition to certain banks, securities brokerage firms, investment advisors, and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products, annuities and mutual funds.\n\nIn individual life insurance, leading competitors include Pacific Life, Lincoln National, Prudential Financial, John Hancock, National Life, Nationwide, and AIG. Mutual of Omaha is the primary competitor for sales of individual LTC insurance through the brokerage channel. Competitors for supplemental health include a wide range of companies and company types based on the nature of the coverage including Aflac, MetLife, Colonial Life, Allstate, Unum, and Guardian Life.\n\nAegon USA's primary competitors in the VA market are Jackson National, Prudential Financial, Lincoln National, AIG, Nationwide, and Equitable.\n\nThe largest competitors in the mutual fund market include Vanguard, Fidelity, American Funds, T. Rowe Price, J.P. Morgan, and BlackRock.\n\nIn the defined contribution plan administration market, Aegon USA's largest competitors (based on assets under administration) are Fidelity, Empower, Principal Financial, TIAA, Voya, Vanguard, Alight, and BofA Securities. Aegon USA's largest competitors in the defined benefit segment are Alight, Willis Towers Watson, Conduent, Fidelity, Aon, Mercer, and Milliman.",

Some activities, products and services are also subject to federal regulation.\n\n## State insurance regulation\n\nThe Aegon USA insurance companies are licensed as insurers and are regulated in each US state and jurisdiction in which they conduct insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies but has a shared purpose in terms of the protection of policy and contract holders. The insurance regulators in each state carry out their mission by providing oversight in the broad areas of market conduct and financial solvency regulation.\n\nAegon USA's largest insurance company is domiciled in the State of Iowa, and the Iowa Insurance Division exercises principal regulatory jurisdiction over it. This regulation includes implementation and enforcement of standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves and capital, and reinsurance. The state of Iowa is Aegon USA's designated lead state, giving Iowa a coordinating role in the collective supervision of Aegon USA's insurance entities.\n\nIn the areas of licensing and market conduct, states grant or revoke licenses to transact insurance business, regulate trade, advertising and marketing practices, approve policy forms and certain premium rates, review and approve products and certain rates prior to sale, address consumer complaints, and perform market conduct examinations on both a regular and targeted basis.\n\nIn the area of financial regulation, state regulators implement and supervise statutory reserve and capital requirements, including minimum risk-based capital solvency standards. Insurance companies are also subject to extensive reporting, investment limitations, and required approval of significant transactions. State regulators, by law, conduct extensive financial examinations every three to five years.\n\nState regulators have the authority to impose a variety of corrective measures, including revoking licenses, for failure to comply with applicable regulations. All state insurance regulators are members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a non-regulatory industry association that works to achieve uniformity and efficiency of insurance regulation across the United States and US territories.\n\nU.S. state regulators have recently updated certain prudential requirements. The solvency framework for variable annuities was updated to better reflect risks and hedging activities. Aegon USA adopted the new framework in 2019 for most legal entities and in 2020 for a legal entity domiciled in New York. Aegon USA is also subject to principle-based reserving requirements for life insurance, which were implemented for a block of term insurance in 2017 (during the three year transition period) and for all new business on January 1, 2020.\n\nEmerging state issues that may impact Aegon USA include a project by the NAIC to develop macroprudential measures and NAIC projects to update capital charges for asset default risk, mortality risk and longevity risk that could impact required capital. The NAIC is also finalizing a group capital measure that could be applied, at the discretion of the Iowa Insurance Division, to Aegon USA's insurance operations.\n\nIn 2017, the NAIC approved amendments to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act. Among other things, the amendments (where adopted) bring health maintenance organizations (HMO) into the life and health guaranty association system and adjust guaranty fund assessments for future LTC-related insolvencies so that 50% of such assessments will come from life/annuity accounts, with the other 50% from the combined health/HMO accounts. These amendments must be adopted into law in each state before becoming effective in each such state. To date, approximately 20 states have adopted the amended model.\n\nIn February 2020, the NAIC approved an extensive update to its long-standing Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation. The result is a revised, consumer-focused set of standards and practices that elevate consumers' best interests as the core component of all annuity recommendations and sales. Currently, Iowa and Arizona have passed the revised Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation, effective January 1, 2021.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Federal regulation of financial services and health insurance\n\nAlthough the insurance business is primarily regulated at the state level, many federal laws and initiatives impact the insurance sector in such areas as the regulation of financial services, derivatives, retirement plans, securities products, health care, taxes, information security and privacy. Regulation of financial services has increased as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, which also created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR). The FIO is authorized to review the insurance market in the United States and report to Congress, and the OFR conducts research into financial services, including insurance, in support of such oversight. In addition, the FIO is authorized to establish US insurance policy in international matters.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board also has supervision of systemically important insurers and insurers that own a federally insured bank or thrift (Savings & Loan Associations). Aegon USA is not currently subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.\n\n## Information security and privacy regulation\n\nAegon USA's businesses are regulated with respect to information security, data breach response, privacy, and data use at both the federal and state levels. At the federal level, various Aegon USA companies are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), among other laws. At the state level, Departments of Insurance and Financial Services typically administer a series of privacy and information security laws and regulations that impact several Aegon USA businesses. Following a series of high profile data breaches and data exploitation events at various companies that attracted substantial media attention, numerous US regulators and legislators are currently proposing or have already passed additional legal requirements with respect to information security and privacy. These include but are not limited to the California Consumer Protection Act and the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Rule. Additional laws and regulations with respect to these topics are also anticipated to be promulgated and to go into effect in the coming years.\n\n## Securities regulation\n\nSeveral Aegon USA subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and aspects of states' securities and other laws. Variable insurance policies, certain annuity contracts and registered investment companies (mutual funds) offered by Aegon USA are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC and aspects of states' securities laws. Certain separate accounts of Aegon USA insurers that offer variable life insurance and certain annuities, and interests under these annuity and insurance policies are registered and subject to SEC regulation. The distribution and sale of variable products, mutual funds, and other securities by affiliate and non-affiliate broker-dealers are regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). A number of Aegon USA companies are also registered as investment advisors and subject to SEC regulation or operate under registrations or exemptions from registration as commodity pool operators or Commodities Trading Advisors, regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association.\n\nAegon USA also owns or manages other investment vehicles that are exempt from registration but may be subject to other requirements of those laws, such as anti-fraud provisions and the terms of applicable exemptions.\n\nOn June 30, 2020, the SEC's Regulation Best Interest (Regulation BI) went into effect. Regulation BI establishes a 'best interest' standard of conduct for broker-dealers and associated persons when making a recommendation to a retail customer and requires them to clearly identify any potential conflicts of interests with those products. The rule also requires broker-dealers and investment advisors to provide a brief relationship summary, Form CRS, to retail investors./uni00A0The rule is applicable to certain Aegon USA broker-dealers and investment advisors.\n\nIn addition, since the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule was vacated, several states have moved forward with developing standard of conduct rules and proposals. New York, Nevada, and Massachusetts have enacted best interest rules, and other states, including New Jersey, have proposed their own fiduciary regulation. The financial services industry continues to operate under heightened scrutiny and increased regulation in various jurisdictions. Aegon USA, like other businesses in the financial services industry, is routinely examined and receives requests for information from the SEC, FINRA, state regulators and others in connection with examinations and investigations of its own companies and third-party or unaffiliated insurers, broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies and service providers relating to certain historical and current practices with respect to these and other matters. Some of those inquiries have led to investigations, which remain open, or have resulted in fines, corrective actions, or restitution. Aegon USA continues to cooperate with these regulatory agencies. In certain instances, Aegon USA modified business practices in response to those inquiries or findings.",

Aegon USA also administers pension benefits distributed upon termination of defined benefit plans. These products and services are generally subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) (certain government and church plans are exempt from ERISA) and the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) for which the US Department of Labor (DOL) and the US Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have regulatory jurisdiction, respectively.\n\nThe Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019, better known as the SECURE Act, was signed into law on December 20, 2019./uni00A0The legislation facilitates the use of MEPs, of which Aegon USA is a leading provider, as well as expands the safe harbor for automatic enrollment in plans, and reduces the burden of offering annuities either as an in-plan investment option or as the form of distribution from a plan. The SECURE Act expands retirement coverage to long-time, part-time workers and 'gig economy' workers who may not otherwise have access to tax-deferred retirement savings, as well as increases the age for 'required minimum distributions' from tax deferred accounts from 70 \u00bd to 72. The SECURE Act also accelerates distributions from inherited defined contribution plan accounts and IRAs to offset the cost of the other provisions. Separately, many states have also sought to open their plans to non-government workers who do not have access to an employer retirement savings plan.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide over $2 trillion in economic relief to address the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Among its many provisions were several allowing individuals impacted by COVID-19 to withdraw or borrow funds from their qualified retirement plans without incurring an early withdrawal penalty (income taxes on withdrawals would still be owed).\n\n## Federal tax treatment of insurance companies and their products and plans\n\nAlthough the insurance business is regulated at state level, the US federal tax treatment of life insurers, life insurance, pension and annuity products is governed by the US federal tax code. Provisions that increase the taxation of life insurers, as well as remove or decrease the value of tax incentives for life insurance, pensions and annuity products - considered alone and relative to other investment vehicles - have been proposed in prior Administrations' federal budgets and by the US Congress. These initiatives may also come in the form of regulatory changes, including regulations that could limit the ability of US companies to deduct interest expense on financing provided by a non-US affiliate. Executive Administration budget proposals and legislative proposals must be enacted by Congress and signed by the President before they become law. Regulatory proposals are subject to public review and comment. The risk of tax law changes is heightened when additional revenue is sought to reduce the federal deficit or to pay for other tax law changes, such as lower tax rates. All such legislative and regulatory proposals have the potential to change the tax obligations of life insurers as well as modify the tax incentives for short- and long-term savings products. Such changes, if enacted, would have a direct impact on the cost and competitiveness of life insurance, annuity and pension products sold to ensure Americans' financial and retirement security.",

All business lines use an intermediary channel, which focuses on independent brokers in different market segments in the Netherlands. In recent years, Aegon the Netherlands/uni00A0began investing heavily in online capabilities to support customers and intermediaries, which has enabled us to achieve an enhanced digital self-service experience.\n\nFor the Knab brand, Aegon Bank uses the direct and online channels to help its customers make smart financial decisions. It does this by giving them a clear overview of their finances, and helps them by proactively offering products and services to assist them in achieving their financial goals. In 2020, Aegon Bank took the decision that it will migrate all products and customers to the Knab brand in 2021. The distribution of the products (under the Knab brand) via intermediaries will continue, but will also be done via direct and online channels.",

This means that the focus is on capital optimization and cost reduction to maximize return on capital.\n\n## Pensions\n\nInterest rates have been low for an extended period of time, creating a shift from Defined Benefit (DB) pension plans to DC pensions plans./uni00A0This year, fundamental changes were made to the Dutch pension system. These include that from 2026 onward, new pension accrual is only allowed in DC schemes. As Aegon the Netherlands offers DC schemes through a separate legal entity - Aegon Cappital the consequence for Aegon Levensverzekering is that all of its Group pension products will become closed books.\n\nIn anticipation of these changes, Aegon the Netherlands proactively decided to stop offering Group pension DB products to new clients in 2021. Renewals of existing contracts are still possible, but only if the renewal facilitates the existing clients in their transition to DC no later than 2026. In addition, Aegon Levensverzekering remains open for risk insurance and annuities that are closely linked to DC schemes. More detail on annuities is provided further below.\n\nThe Group DB products that remain on the balance sheet of Aegon Levensverzekering are as following:\n\n- \u25a0 Separate account group contracts with individually determined asset investment strategies, profit sharing and guarantees;\n- \u25a0 DB contracts with profit sharing based on a pre-determined interest rate;\n- \u25a0 Traditional variable unit-linked products;\n- \u25a0 DB subscriptions; and\n- \u25a0 DB contracts without profit sharing.\n\nIn the list above the last two products were still sold in 2020 while the others were already closed for new clients. In each product group there are also contracts with a future due date, as a result of premiums that are still being paid. In addition, indexations remain possible for all of these products, while for some products, additional funds need to be contributed.\n\n## Annuities\n\nThe most actively sold products in this category are simple payout annuities and variable annuities. These products are linked to DC schemes in which participants build up their capital and are obliged, by law, to purchase an annuity at the pension date. Participants can choose between a guaranteed annuity - where all risks are borne by Aegon the Netherlands - or a variable annuity without investment guarantees, where all risks are borne by the participant. Given that a significant shift has been observed to DC schemes, these annuities are a natural driver of growth as they provide a solution for the payout phase. Annuity insurance also includes older products with guaranteed interest rates and profit sharing for which no new business is written.\n\n## Risk insurance\n\nThis category mainly includes the survivor's pension insurance sold as a rider to DC pension schemes. Premiums are paid by the employer and the product pays benefits to the spouse/children in the event of the death of the insured.\n\n## Endowment insurance\n\nEndowment insurance includes several products that accumulate a cash value. Premiums are paid at inception or over the term of the contract. These products pay benefits on the policy maturity date, subject to survival of the insured. Most policies also pay death benefits should the insured die during the term of the contract. Death benefits may be stipulated in the policy or depend on the gross premiums paid to date. Premiums and amounts insured are established at inception of the contract. The amount insured can be increased as a result of profit sharing, if provided for under the terms and conditions of the product.\n\nMinimum interest guarantees exist for all generations of endowment insurance products written, except for universal life products, for which premiums are invested solely in equity funds. Older generation products contained a 4% guarantee when sold. In 1999, the guarantee for new products decreased to 3%. In 2013, the guarantee on new products was reduced to 0% and in 2019 the guarantee was ended. The sale of these products ended several years ago.\n\n## Term and whole life insurance\n\nTerm life insurance pays out death benefits should the insured die during the term of the contract. Whole life insurance pays out death benefits in the event of death, regardless of when this occurs. Premiums and amounts insured are established at inception of the contract and are guaranteed. The amount insured may be adjusted at the request of the policyholder. Term life insurance policies",

Part of the whole life insurance portfolio has profit-sharing features, which are based on external indices or the return of related assets. In the first quarter of 2020, Aegon the Netherlands stopped offering these products.\n\n## Non-life\n\n## Accident and Health\n\nAegon the Netherlands offers disability and sick leave products to employers that covers these payments for employees not covered by social security, where the employer bears the risk. In addition, for some forms of disability, employers can choose to use the social security system to insure these risks or opt out and seek private insurance. Private insurance appeals to employers, as it helps reduce absenteeism and disability thanks to better reintegration efforts.\n\nFor individuals, Aegon the Netherlands offers a disability product mainly targeted at the growing self-employed market.\n\n## Property and Casualty\n\nAegon the Netherlands has focused exclusively on retail lines in general insurance, offering products in the segments of property, motor, travel, legal assistance, private liability claims, pet insurance, and injury. The ambition for the P&C retail segment is to provide the best digital servicing in the Dutch market while building long-lasting relationships with customers and distribution partners.\n\nThrough the service concepts, Aegon the Netherlands supports intermediaries with excellent digital processes to help their customers in the most optimal way, by stimulating performance at sustainable levels for customers, intermediaries, and the insurer, while also protecting the health of the supply chain. In addition to the intermediary market, Aegon the Netherlands has further developed digital and online capabilities, especially as the direct market has sustained a sizable share in the overall distribution in the past years, especially for the Motor segment. The direct market includes sales via Aegon's own website and affiliates, as well as through aggregator websites.\n\n## Banking\n\nIn 2019, Aegon announced the integration of the Aegon Bank and Knab operations under the Knab brand. By integrating both operations and rationalizing product offerings, it was determined that costs would be reduced, operations would be more efficient, and governance would have a unified approach./uni00A0In 2020, preparations and migration began and is due to be completed in 2021. During this period, customers and products of the Aegon Bank brand will be migrated to the Knab brand. Aegon Bank continues to service Aegon Netherlands' variety of pension offerings with its banking products like savings accounts and investments, but under the Knab brand. In 2020, the banking arm of Aegon was/uni00A0classified as a Strategic Asset within Aegon the Netherlands and forms the gateway to individual retirement solutions. In total, our banking solutions are offered to our 540,000 active Dutch customers and small-scale enterprises who bank with us./uni00A0Knab is a fully online digital bank that went live in 2012.\n\nThe Bank focuses on customers whose income and wealth are in the mid-market range and offers both savings and investment products. The main focus of savings is on 'Banksparen' products. 'Banksparen' is a tax-deferred savings product in which cash amounts are deposited in a 'locked' bank account. The amount saved is available for withdraw after a certain period for specific purposes; such as a supplementary pension or paying off a mortgage. This product is predominantly sold via independent financial advisors who remain a very important distribution channel.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nInvestment contracts are investment products that offer returns and generate fee income from the performance of the investments.\n\n## Services Business\n\n## Mortgage loans\n\nAegon the Netherlands offers mainly annuity/linear residential mortgages, while also catering to consumers requiring interest only loan-parts. Mortgage loans are originated both as investments for Aegon the Netherlands' insurance and bank entities as well as distributed to third-party investors. Such investors are provided access to this high-quality asset class through the Aegon Dutch Mortgage Fund, SAECURE (Aegon's Dutch residential mortgage-backed securities program), covered bond program, and various bespoke structures to tailor to investors' needs. Investors value our mortgage offering for their attractive spread and low credit-loss experience through disciplined conservative underwriting. Consumers and independent financial advisors choose Aegon mortgages for the high quality of service, reliable performance, and accessibility through the economic cycle. During 2020, total mortgage assetsunder-administration grew to over EUR/uni00A050 billion.",

Aegon Cappital offers DC pension schemes in a standardized subscription-based model to small and medium enterprises and customized contracts for medium-to-large corporations. The model enables employers to choose from a variety of contribution tables and social security offsets, while remaining flexible for regulatory changes, such as changes in pension age or fiscal contribution limits. Savings premiums are invested in life cycle funds by Aegon Investment Management B.V..\n\nAegon Cappital is one of the largest pension premium institutions ('PPIs') in the Netherlands and benefits considerably from economies of scale. The low interest rate environment, and the fundamental changes of the Dutch pension system as of 2026, will result in a continued shift to DC schemes.\n\nPPIs cannot bear any investment or insurance risks on their offerings due to regulatory requirements. The schemes include disability or life insurance which are offered by partners Aegon Levensverzekering, Aegon Schadeverzekering and Elips Life AG, and an optional guaranteed interest rate during the accumulation phase offered by partner Aegon Levensverzekering. Apart from operational and regulatory risk, Aegon Cappital runs no other risk.\n\n## TKP Pensioen, Robidus and Nedasco\n\nTKP Pensioen is a top three player in the Dutch market for pension administration. TKP Pensioen administers pension rights for several large company and industry pension funds, as well as other pension providers such as a premium pension institution. Their clients - 3.8 million participants and 76,000 employers - rely on TKP Pensioen for correct and timely pension payments, and clear and accessible pension information and communication, from the mandatory pension statements to customer contact and digital customer services.\n\nRobidus Groep advises corporations on the risks and associated costs under Dutch social security legislation and provides corporations and insurance companies with claims management and outsourcing solutions to manage these issues. It operates as an independent organization within Aegon the Netherlands.\n\nNedasco is an intermediary service provider that is mainly active in non-life business domains.\n\n## Competition\n\nAegon the Netherlands faces strong competition in all markets from insurers, banks, investment companies and pension funds. Its main competitors are Allianz Benelux, ASR and NN Group.\n\nThe company has been a key player in the total life market for many years and was ranked third in 2019 based on gross premium income. The life insurance market in the Netherlands comprises pensions and life insurance. The top five life insurance companies in the Netherlands by gross premium income accounted for almost 90% of total premium (Individual Life and Pension) income in 2019. Aegon the Netherlands is the second largest insurance company in the pensions market. Aegon the Netherlands is one of many insurers in the non-life market, where in 2019, ten companies accounted for 80% of the total premium income. In terms of premium income, Aegon the Netherlands' non-life market share is around 2%, making it the ninth largest company in the market.\n\nIn the mortgage loans market, Aegon the Netherlands held a market share of almost 8% based on new sales in 2019, making it the fifth largest mortgage loan provider in the market. Rabobank, ABN AMRO, and ING Bank are the largest mortgage loan providers in the market, but their market share is under pressure, because of a shift to fixed rates for longer periods. Competition is still increasing from foreign competitors and capital from pension funds.\n\nAegon the Netherlands' share is growing in the market for Dutch household savings. In 2019, its market share was more than 3%, which is relatively small in comparison to the top three which are Rabobank, ING and ABN AMRO.\n\nVarious legal and regulatory changes have had an impact on demand for insurance products in the Dutch market. This is especially true in the life insurance market, where the tax deductibility of certain products has been reduced, leading to a shift to bank-saving products. Moreover, volatility in economic and financial markets has meant that customers are more reluctant to commit themselves to long-term contracts. These changes have resulted in more competition, greater focus on competitive prices, improved customer service and retention, and product innovation.\n\nIn the pensions market the defined contribution (PPI) segment is set to grow further due to the fundamental changes of the Dutch pension system as of 2026 and the demand for transparent and cost-effective pension products.

Aegon the Netherlands has identified this market as an opportunity for growth and intends to maintain its leadership position with Aegon Cappital.\n\n## Regulation and supervision\n\n## General\n\nRegulation of the financial sector in the Netherlands is included in the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht or Wft). The Wft embeds the cross-sectorial functional approach within the Dutch supervisory system. The supervision of financial institutions pursuant to the Wft rests with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM).\n\nThe DNB is responsible for prudential supervision, while the AFM supervises the conduct of business of financial institutions, and the conduct of business on financial markets. The aim of the DNB's prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial institutions and contribute to the stability of the financial sector. Regarding banks, the DNB undertakes its supervisory role, in particular with respect to prudential supervision, together with the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nThe AFM's conduct of business supervision focuses on ensuring orderly and transparent financial market processes, integrity in relations between market parties, and due care in the provision of services to customers.\n\nThe Dutch supervisory authorities have several formal tools to exercise their supervisory tasks. These tools include the authority to request information, if this is necessary for the purpose of prudential supervision, and the power to issue formal instructions to financial institutions, to impose fines, or to publish sanctions. The DNB, as prudential supervisory authority, can, under certain circumstances, require a recovery plan, a short-term financing plan, appoint a trustee, draw up a transfer plan or (ultimately) withdraw the license of a financial institution.\n\nThe Dutch Data Protection Authority (Dutch DPA) supervises processing of personal data in order to ensure compliance with laws that regulate such use. The tasks and powers of the Dutch DPA are described in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), supplemented by the Dutch Implementation Act of the GDPR.\n\n## Financial supervision of insurance companies\n\nThe Solvency II framework consists of an EU Directive and has consequently been transposed into the Wtf.\n\nThe following insurance entities of Aegon the Netherlands are subject to prudential supervision of the DNB:\n\n- \u25a0 Aegon Levensverzekering;\n- \u25a0 Aegon Schadeverzekering;\n- \u25a0 Aegon Spaarkas.\n\nAn insurance company is neither permitted to conduct both life insurance and non-life insurance business within a single legal entity (except for reinsurance), nor to carry out both insurance and banking activities within the same legal entity. Within Aegon the Netherlands, Aegon Levensverzekering, and Aegon Spaarkas conduct life insurance activities. Aegon Schadeverzekering conducts non-life insurance activities. Prudential supervision is exercised by the home state supervisory authority (DNB in the Netherlands).\n\n## Solvency II/uni00A0\n\nThe Solvency II framework is described in more detail in the section 'Regulation and supervision' of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report 2020.\n\nAegon the Netherlands uses a partial internal model (PIM) to calculate the solvency position of its life insurance activities under Solvency II. The calculation includes the use of the volatility adjustment (VA), but does not include the use of any transitional measures. The initial internal model of Aegon the Netherlands was approved on November 26, 2015, by the supervisor, the DNB, as part of the Internal Model Application Process./uni00A0Following the Internal Model Application Process, Aegon the Netherlands made several major changes to its PIM, the latest in 2020, all of which have been approved by the DNB. In 2020 Aegon the Netherlands included the Deterministic Adjustment (DA) in the PIM. The DA is a mechanism that corrects for the well-documented mismatches that exists between the EIOPA VA and the actual assets that Aegon the Netherlands invests in. These mismatches create non-economic volatility in the Solvency II position of Aegon the Netherlands which is a strategic risk for Aegon and ultimately the policyholders. The goal of the DA therefore is, to reduce the Solvency II ratio volatility due to basis risk between the EIOPA VA reference portfolio and Aegon the Netherlands's own assets. Basis risk arises due to the absence of mortgages in the EIOPA reference portfolio and the relatively high allocation to peripheral sovereigns and corporates compared to the portfolio of Aegon the Netherlands./uni00A0",

The ECB may give instructions to the DNB in respect of Aegon Bank or even assume direct supervision over the prudential aspects of Aegon Bank's business. Pursuant to the banking supervision by the DNB, Aegon Bank is (among others) required to file monthly, quarterly, and yearly regulatory reports as well as audited Financial Statements. Aegon Bank is subject to Basel requirements in the Capital Requirements Regulation ('CRR') and the Capital Requirement Directive ('CRD'), as implemented in the Netherlands in the Wft. The CRD and CRR include requirements with respect to the quality and quantity of capital, as well as a liquidity framework. According to the EU Banking Reforms, competent authorities remain responsible for monitoring leverage policies and processes of individual institutions and may impose additional measures to address risk of excessive leverage, if warranted.\n\nBased on the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process ('SREP'), the DNB sets Aegon Bank's minimal capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nThe Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive ('BRRD'), as implemented in the Netherlands in the Wft, and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation ('SRM Regulation') form the European framework for recovery and resolution for (among others) ailing banks, certain investment firms and their holding companies. The BRRD provides for early intervention measures that may be imposed by the DNB in respect of Aegon Bank in the event that its financial condition is deteriorating./uni00A0It also allows the DNB under certain circumstances to write down or convert relevant capital instruments in a specific order. Were Aegon Bank to fail or be likely to fail and the other resolution conditions were also met, the DNB would be able to place Aegon Bank under resolution. As part of the resolution scheme that could be adopted by the DNB, it may decide to apply certain resolution tools and exercise its powers pursuant to the implemented BRRD in order to give effect to such resolution tools.\n\nPursuant to the SRM Regulation and the BRRD, Aegon Bank is at all times required to meet a minimum amount of own funds and eligible liabilities ('MREL'), expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities and own funds. The DNB will set a level of minimum MREL on a bank-by-bank basis based on assessment criteria due to be set out in technical regulatory standards.\n\nIn 2019, a comprehensive package of banking reforms to increase the resilience of EU institutions known as the 'EU Banking Reforms' entered into force (which included changes to the CRD, the BRRD and the SRM Regulation). Most rules start to apply mid-2021. Prior to this in 2017, the Basel Committee published the finalized Basel III reforms (informally known as 'Basel IV') to improve the global regulatory framework, with a proposed implementation from January 2023 onwards. The Reforms includes stricter rules for internal models, a capital floor, and revisions to the standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and the credit valuation adjustment specified at a counterparty level ('CVA').",

It was registered as a public limited company at the beginning of December 1998. The leading operating subsidiaries, which all operate under the Aegon brand, are:\n\n- \u25a0 Aegon Investment Solutions Ltd.;\n- \u25a0 Scottish Equitable plc;\n- \u25a0 Cofunds Ltd.; and\n- \u25a0 Aegon Investments Ltd.\n\n## Overview of business Lines\n\nAegon UK has successfully transformed from a traditional 'insurer,' competing with the likes of Prudential and Royal London to a modern fee-based investment management platform competing with businesses such as Transact and Willis Towers Watson.\n\nOver the last five years the UK business has focused on transforming and scaling its platform business. Aegon UK has done so through organic growth and the acquisition of Cofunds retail savings platform, and BlackRock's large employer Workplace pension business, and by disposing of non-core business lines, such as the disposal in 2017 of the Annuity portfolio, whilst progressing the outsourcing of service and administration for its traditional insurance company products. On October 9, 2020 Aegon announced an agreement to sell Stonebridge International Insurance Limited (SIIL). The cash proceeds amounted to GBP 6.9 million, with the potential for a further GBP 7 million in deferred consideration, depending on EEA policy transfers. The transaction agreements were signed on October 8, 2020 and the divestment and legal completion was completed on February 28,/uni00A02021.\n\nThe platform business is responsible for propositions sold through the Financial Adviser and Workplace channels, together with protection products and an institutional trading platform business. The Financial Adviser and Workplace channels are supported by an investment solutions capability which allows customers to invest in Aegon UK funds. This capability is well established within the Workplace channel with plans to significantly grow within the Financial Adviser channel.\n\nIt is positioned for growth, given the participation in the Workplace pensions and Financial Advisor markets, which are forecast to grow at 9.4%/uni00A0and 12%/uni00A0over the next 5/uni00A0years respectively./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe traditional insurance company products are managed for value and are older products that are no longer actively marketed to new customers. However, new assets are accumulated as customers pay into existing policies, or as new employees join older Workplace schemes. In July 2019, Aegon UK completed the outsourcing of service and operations tasks to Atos with a 15-year contract to service and administer its traditional insurance company products, thereby improving the profitability of this business line. This builds on the existing relationship, which has seen Atos successfully administer over 400,000 protection policies since 2016.",

The platform is designed to work for customers throughout their life as needs evolve by providing a comprehensive range of products and funds, moving with them each time they change employers and allow them to link in with different advisers./uni00A0\n\nThis gives Aegon UK the ability to support customers throughout their life journey unlike the majority of its competitors.\n\nIn addition, Aegon UK also participates in the protection and institutional trading platform markets.\n\n## Financial Adviser channel\n\nThe Financial Adviser channel provides financial advisers and other institutions access to long-term savings and retirement products, through an open architecture investment platform. It aims to capitalize on the strong demand for advice, especially within the growing affluent population nearing and in retirement.\n\nAegon UK offers a comprehensive proposition allowing advisers to manage their client's long-term investment through a wide range of tax wrappers (Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP), Individual Savings Account (ISA), General Investment Account (GIA)) investing in a choice of over 4,500 funds and equity trading. Aegon UK also offers its own investment solutions to advisers.\n\nAegon UK provides a technology platform that supports advisers and their customers in managing their finances and integrates into the back office of the adviser. The aim is to create a primary platform relationship, which positions Aegon UK to receive the majority of new business flows from the adviser partner. An example being the partnership agreed with leading wealth/Workplace advisory firm LEBC in 2019 that has delivered significant additional flows in 2020.\n\nAegon UK partners with, around 4,500/uni00A0advisers across a wide range of business models. These range from the world's largest building society, Nationwide, to leading wealth management firms such as Chase De Vere, financial services networks such as Quilter and execution-only brokers.\n\nAn important dimension of the Nationwide partnership is the inclusion of Aegon Investment Limited funds. This model was successfully extended in 2020 with the launch of an equivalent range of funds for Financial Advisers as Aegon UK builds out its investment solutions capability.\n\n## Workplace channel\n\nThe Workplace channel provides UK-based employers with Workplace pensions and savings schemes. It allows Aegon UK to participate in the strong growing auto-enrolment market, cost effectively acquiring individual customer relationships.\n\nAegon UK now has a market-leading position covering all major Workplace savings products and participates in both the small and medium-sized (SME) and large employer segments. A key driver of growth is in the Mastertrust product, the fastest growing sector of the UK DC market, where Aegon UK has an established and market leading offering.\n\nAegon UK works with leading employee benefits consultants and corporate advisers to provide a Workplace savings platform to employers such as WH Smith, EasyJet and Skanska. This combines its core pension capabilities with ISA and GIA, allowing employees to maximize their savings whilst employed and then take the product with them when they leave or if they should choose to take regulated advice in the future.\n\nAt the heart of this is Aegon UK's employee digital portal, which provides tools to enable employees to make better informed decisions. It also links into the wider engagement activities such as seminars in the workplace, and online innovations such as the launch of digital personalized summaries and an app that seeks to encourage customers to consolidate monies held elsewhere and increase their savings.\n\nAegon UK's proposition extends to include a range of tools to assist employers with their governance responsibilities: auto enrolment functionality and member insights tool to enable them to effectively manage their pension schemes.",

The target market is wealthier customers over the age of 40, where Aegon UK's underwriting expertise helps it to provide a customer-centric proposition.\n\nThis also provides a strong overlap with the target customers for Aegon UK's Financial Adviser and workplace platform and the advisers who help them, giving the opportunity to leverage opportunities to cross-sell.\n\nIn addition, Aegon UK offers a range of protection products for small to medium-sized companies that wish to insure key personnel, complementing the core Workplace channel.\n\n## Institutional channel\n\nAegon UK also participates in the institutional market in two distinct areas where capability is provided to other parties who provide policy administration to the end-client:\n\n- \u25a0 An institutional trading platform which powers 27 of the UK's leading platforms, wealth management firms and investment houses (e.g. Brooks MacDonald, Charles Stanley) and administers a total of GBP 58 billion assets; and\n- \u25a0 An investment-only proposition for Workplace pension schemes, which provides access to insured funds for approximately 155/uni00A0clients who represent GBP 7/uni00A0billion assets under administration.\n\n## Competition\n\nAegon UK is well positioned for growth, possessing a market leading position in markets with strong growth potential. There are a diverse range of competitors in the markets in which Aegon UK operates, and market dynamics are continuing to evolve.\n\nAegon UK encounters different competition in each of its core markets but is unique in the way it supports intermediaries wishing to operate across channels providing an end-to-end customer experience./uni00A0\n\nIn the Financial Adviser market, Aegon UK competes with the likes of Fidelity, Transact and Quilter with the objective being to become 'primary platform' for the intermediary.\n\nIn the Workplace market, Aegon UK competes with the likes of Aviva and Willis Towers Watson to provide employee benefits, engagement and scheme governance.\n\n## Regulation and supervision\n\nAll relevant Aegon UK companies based in the UK are either: authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the PRA; or authorized and regulated by the FCA, dependent on firm type.\n\nThe PRA is responsible for the prudential regulation of deposit takers, insurers and major investment firms. The FCA is responsible for regulating firms' conduct in retail and wholesale markets. It is also responsible for the prudential regulation of those firms that do not come under the PRA's remit.\n\nThe Aegon Master Trust is subject to regulatory oversight by the Pensions Regulator following industry changes to authorize Master Trusts and implement revised regulatory powers.\n\nThe UK vote on June 23, 2016 to leave the European Union (EU) has implications for financial services companies in the UK. Much of our financial regulation applicable in the UK derives from EU legislation and this remains in force/uni00A0as the UK has on shored this and any new regulations will be embedded using the Financial Services and Markets Act going forward. Through the Brexit deal negotiated by the UK Government, a planned Memorandum of Understanding on financial services is due to be in place by the end of the first quarter of 2021. This will set the future direction of travel for cooperation between the UK and other European countries.",

Firms were encouraged to review their arrangements to address the evolving situation while managing the risks to their employees, customers and the impact on the market. Aegon UK put in place measures to allow a regular review of changes to aid customers, and their regulatory impacts and this continues into 2021.\n\n## Financial supervision of insurance companies\n\nScottish Equitable plc is authorized by the PRA and is subject to prudential regulation by the PRA and conduct regulation by the FCA. Every life insurance company licensed by and/or falling under the supervision of the PRA must file audited regulatory reports on at least an annual basis. These reports, primarily designed to enable the PRA to monitor the solvency of the insurance company, include a (consolidated) balance sheet, a (consolidated) income statement, a breakdown of the Solvency Capital Requirements, extensive actuarial information, and detailed information regarding the investments of the insurance company. The PRA's regulatory reporting is based on a single entity focus, and is designed to highlight risk assessment and risk management.\n\n## Regulatory Solvency Requirements\n\nThe European Union Insurance Directives referred to collectively as Solvency II were incorporated into UK law with effect from January 1, 2016./uni00A0Under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018, following completion of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, the UK has adopted Solvency II regulations and Binding Technical Standards into UK law, with the power to amend these as appropriate for the UK legal environment. Temporary Transitional Powers are in place under which certain provisions of EU regulations will continue to apply until March 31, 2022. Consequently, at present the UK continues to adopt regulatory solvency requirements which are closely aligned to those under Solvency II./uni00A0Life insurance companies are required to maintain Own Funds which are sufficient to withstand a 1-in-200 shock on a 1-year value at risk basis subject to certain absolute minimum requirements.\n\nSince the introduction of Solvency II on January 1, 2016, Scottish Equitable plc has been using a Partial Internal Model (PIM) to calculate the solvency position. The internal model was approved in December 2015, by the College of Supervisors as part of the Internal Model Approval Process, with an additional Major Model Change approved in July 2017, which added Currency Risk and Operational Risk into the Internal Model./uni00A0Following the end of the Brexit transition period, the PRA has deemed the existing PIM to be approved for the calculation of the solo regulatory solvency requirements of Scottish Equitable plc\n\nIn addition, Scottish Equitable plc uses the Matching Adjustment in the calculation of the technical provisions for its annuities, and uses the Volatility Adjustment in the calculation of the technical provisions for the With-Profits business with investment guarantees. Following the sale of the majority of its annuity business in 2017, Scottish Equitable plc no longer uses the transitional measures on technical provisions.\n\n## CRD IV\n\nThe Capital Requirements (Country by Country Reporting) Regulations 2013 ('CRD IV') came into force on January 1, 2014. These require credit institutions and investment firms, as defined within the directive, which are regulated under CRD IV, to 'disclose annually, specifying by Member State and by third country in which it has an establishment, the following information on a consolidated basis for the financial year: name(s), nature of activities and geographical location; turnover; number of employees on a full time equivalent basis; profit or loss before tax; tax on profit or loss; public subsidies received'.\n\nCofunds Ltd and Aegon Investment Solutions Ltd are regulated by the FCA and maintain a capital framework in line with CRD IV. The information required by the legislation is published on Aegon's websites.\n\nAegon Investments Limited is a BIPRU firm, is regulated by the FCA and must maintain a capital framework in line with the FCA Handbook requirements./uni00A0\n\nIn conjunction with the FCA, the investment related companies within the Aegon UK group will in future be subject to consolidated reporting under CRD IV. This applies the same principles and rules under CRD IV to the consolidated group of entities.\n\nThe Investment Firm Regulation (IFR) and Investment Firm Directive (IFD) are replacing the CRR framework in the EU for investment firms. The FCA will publish the UK equivalent version of these requirements, with a target implementation date of January 1, 2022. These requirements cover capital, liquidity, reporting and disclosure and remuneration and work is underway to prepare for this change.",

The Asian business operates two joint ventures in India and China and several wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Transamerica Life (Bermuda) Ltd. (TLB), serving the affluent segment, and Aegon Insights 1 , independent direct marketing organization in Asia Pacific.\n\nThe history of the region dates to 1980, when Aegon first entered the Spanish insurance market. The activities in Spain (and eventually Portugal) have developed largely through distribution partnerships with major Spanish banks, Banco Santander S.A. and Liberbank S.A. Spain and Portugal are now one of the core growth markets of Aegon Group. In 1992, Aegon purchased the majority stake in Hungary's former state-owned insurance company, \u00c1llami Biztos\u00edt\u00f3. It expanded in Central & Eastern Europe (CEE) in the 2000s. The operations in Asia were established in 2003, starting with a JV in China. Transamerica Life (Bermuda) Ltd. (TLB) was established in 2005 and its full-service branches opened in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2006. In 2008, the joint venture in India was formed.\n\nIn November 2020, Aegon announced an agreement to sell its Central and Eastern European operations (Poland, Romania, Turkey, and Hungary) to Vienna Insurance Group, as part of its strategy to focus on key markets, simplify the footprint, and strengthen the balance sheet. The closing of the deal is expected in the course of 2021.\n\n## Organizational structure\n\nThe key lines of business within the region are Spain and Portugal, Hungary, TLB, and China. The remaining business units are grouped in one category for reporting purposes.

The strategy is to invest in digital distribution platforms, particularly in Asia, to build distribution capabilities for the future.\n\n## Spain and Portugal\n\nOn December 19, 2012, Aegon Espa\u00f1a and Banco Santander S.A., the largest financial institution in Spain, signed a partnership agreement (joint venture) to distribute certain types of insurance products through Banco Santander's network of branches. This joint venture was effectively created and the transaction closed on June 4, 2013. On December 31, 2014, Aegon Espa\u00f1a entered into a similar partnership in Portugal with Banco Santander and Santander Totta Seguros S.A., a Portuguese insurance company, part of the Santander International group.\n\nIn Spain and Portugal, the life insurance (mainly pure risk) and health products are sold by Santander Life Insurance and Reinsurance, whereas the non-life insurance (mainly accident, home, unemployment, disability, critical illness and funeral) products are sold by Santander General Insurance and Reinsurance Company. Both entities in Spain and Portugal are joint venture entities where Aegon owns 51%.\n\nAnother of Aegon's bancassurance partners in Spain, Liberbank, S.A., has a nationwide presence with a special focus on retail markets in several regions (Asturias, Cantabria, Castilla La Mancha and Extremadura). Liberbank distributes life insurance products through local branches. The distribution agreement is a joint venture between the Life and Pensions, Insurance and Reinsurance company of Liberbank, S.A. and Aegon Espa\u00f1a, both parties holding equal ownership stakes.\n\nOn July 10, 2020, Aegon and Banco Santander completed the acquisition of the in force term life policies previously sold through Banco Popular branches, following Banco Santander's acquisition of Banco Popular. The joint venture also acquired the right to write new term life and selected lines of non-life policies through the former Banco Popular branches now owned by Banco Santander.\n\nAegon Espa\u00f1a's own distribution channel offers life, health insurance and pension products. It is comprised of a network of brokers and agents, accounting for approximately 80% of the total sales of the fully owned subsidiary, while the remaining 20% of the total sales is generated by the direct channel.\n\n## Central & Eastern Europe\n\nDistribution channels in Central & Eastern Europe are dominated by historically strong tied and external agency or brokers. The tied network is particularly strong in Hungary, Turkey, and Poland./uni00A0In Hungary, there were approximately 1.700 tied agents by end of 2020./uni00A0Turkey's tied network was comprised of over 660 agents, while Poland maintained a network of over 200 closely affiliated agents. Turkey, Hungary 1 and Poland generate more than 50% of their sales from these networks.\n\nOther distribution channels include bank partners (in Romania and Turkey) and the direct online channel (gaining traction in Turkey). In July 2020, Romania's distribution partnership with Banca Transilvania (BT) has been renewed for another five years, ensuring access to one of the largest bank distribution channels in the country.\n\nAs COVID-19 took its toll on sales, agent support schemes were rapidly designed and launched to protect the income and loyalty of the productive agents, such as income guarantee schemes or commission loans.\n\n## TLB and Aegon Insights\n\nTLB distributes its products to high-net-worth customers through targeted distribution relationships with selected local and international brokers, as well as through bancassurance channels./uni00A0From its strong market position in the Universal Life insurance space in Hong Kong and Singapore, the company is now diversifying into other product segments such as Indexed Universal Life (IUL).\n\nAegon Insights is a marketing, distribution and administration services business operating in Asia Pacific. It primarily worked with local insurers to develop tailored solutions to the specific needs. The revenue is generated through reinsurance arrangements and fee income. With changes in consumer preferences, in 2017 Aegon made the strategic decision to discontinue Aegon Insights' new business acquisition, while continuing to provide services to the existing customer base in Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Japan.",

Protection business, pursued both in Spain and Portugal, includes primarily life, health, accident, and disability covers, distributed through the JVs and Aegon/uni00A0Espa\u00f1a's own channels. These products can typically be complemented with critical illness, income protection and other riders.\n\nIn Hungary, Aegon offers primarily savings products, both unit-linked and traditional, which are frequently accompanied with riders. Next to the main coverage, these riders provide customers with additional financial support in the event of an accident, disability or hospitalization./uni00A0Similarly, in Poland Aegon focuses on unit-linked as well as traditional life products.

In Turkey, Aegon focuses on Return on Premium (ROP) and savings life products, available in USD.\n\nIn Asia, Aegon provides a broad range of life insurance products, including unit-linked, universal life, and traditional life products.\n\nTLB's core product is Universal Life (UL), denominated in USD, designed to meet the needs of high-net-worth individuals, supporting estate and business planning by providing life protection and helping to preserve and accumulate wealth. In addition to UL, Term Life products are also offered with financial protection at a guaranteed level rate for up to thirty years. To further diversify the Company's product range, TLB developed an indexed Universal Life (IUL) product for launch in Singapore and Bermuda.\n\nIn China, whole-life critical illness products are key products for many channels, such as agency, broker etc. Other products, such as participating annuity and endowment (via agency), whole life insurance products (via agency, brokers) and protection with return of premium (via direct marketing) are also offered./uni00A0Regular premium whole-life insurance and single premium endowment are the key products offered in the bancassurance channel, while the/uni00A0digital channel is currently focused on offering protection products, such as term life.\n\nIn India, Aegon Life offers Group term plans, individual term plans, traditional participating and non-participating savings products, and unit-linked life insurance plans.\n\n## Health insurance\n\nHealth insurance is primarily offered as riders on life insurance policies in Spain and China and as a standalone health insurance in Turkey and Spain.",

Aegon THTF's market share among foreign-invested companies was 1.81% in terms of total premium.\n\n## India: Aegon Life\n\nThere were 24 licensed life insurers in India at the end of September/uni00A02020. While the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India continues to maintain a dominant share of new business premiums (both individual and group), private sector companies have grown only modestly to obtain more than 61% of the individual recurring new business premiums written (April 2020 to September 2020).

The local subsidiaries of both Sun Life and Manulife, in addition to domestic insurers such as AIA, Great Eastern Life, Singapore Life, Generali, AXA, and FWD, are however increasingly developing competitive offerings for this market segment.\n\n## Regulation and supervision\n\n## SEE\n\nIn the European Union, a single insurance company may only be licensed for and conduct either a life insurance business or a nonlife insurance business, not both. In Hungary, however, insurance companies established before 1995 are exempt from this rule. This exemption therefore applies to Aegon Hungary, which is a composite insurance company.\n\nState supervision and oversight of the insurance industry is conducted by the following bodies and institutions:\n\n- \u25a0 General Directorate of Insurance and Pension Funds (DGSFP) (Spain);\n- \u25a0 The Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority (ASF) (Portugal);\n- \u25a0 The Central Bank of Hungary (MNB) (Hungary);\n- \u25a0 Financial Supervisory Authority (KNF) (Poland);\n- \u25a0 Authority for Financial Supervision (ASF) (Romania); and\n- \u25a0 Insurance and Private Pension Regulatory and Supervisory Board's (IRSB) (Turkey).\n\nThe authorities mentioned above promote consumer protection and have the right to investigate prudential activities and conduct, financial position and solvency, and compliance with all relevant laws.\n\nThe foundation and operations of voluntary pension funds are regulated in Hungary by the country's Voluntary Mutual Pension Funds Act (XCVI. 1993). Activity in this area is also supervised by the MNB. In Romania, the private and voluntary pension system is regulated and supervised by the Authority for Financial Supervision (ASF). The mandatory pension system is subject to the Privately Administered Pension Funds Act (411/2004) and the voluntary pension system is subject to the Voluntary Pension Law (204/2006), both complemented by individual regulations (as secondary legislation). In Poland, this activity is supervised by the KNF and governed by the Organization and Operation of Pension Funds Act. In Turkey, the voluntary pension funds are under the supervision of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and the companies are subject to Individual Retirement Saving and Investment System Law No. 4632 and Insurance Law No. 5684. In Spain, the pension system is supervised by DGSFP and governed by Law on Pension Funds and Plans approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2002, of November 29, 2002, and its implementing regulations.\n\n## China: Aegon THTF\n\nChina's insurance industry is regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC). In 2020, the main work focus of the CBIRC is to prevent risks and stabilize development. Therefore, the Committee has strengthened the supervision and management from the product side to the sales side. It includes clarifying the new rules of product development and design, strengthening the management of sales/uni00A0personnel, introducing the traceability requirements of Internet insurance and, promoting the digital return visit.\n\nEffective February 1 st , 2021, 91 life insurance companies are divided into two groups for the regulatory supervision - 39 insurers are under the direct supervision of the CBIRC and 52 are under the territorial supervision of the local bureaus of CBIRC.

In July 2020, Aegon Investment Management (Shanghai) Ltd. was set up as a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise in Shanghai, China to provide products and services to Chinese customers.\n\nIn November 2020, Aegon announced an agreement to sell its Central and Eastern European operations (Poland, Romania, Turkey, and Hungary) to Vienna Insurance Group, as part of its strategy to focus on key markets, simplify the footprint, and strengthen the balance sheet./uni00A0The asset management division (Aegon Hungary AM Company Zrt. - Assets under Management EUR/uni00A01.89 billion) is included in this transaction. The closing of the deal is expected in the course of 2021.\n\nIn December 2019, Aegon Asset Management launched its integrated global growth initiative to establish a globally integrated structure. This involved simplification of the operating model which featured regional executive committees and to create a global operational management board (Global Board). Aegon Asset Management also has a Fiduciary Services and Multi-Manager business in the Netherlands. The AAM/uni00A0investment teams are organized into four investment platforms for which AAM/uni00A0is globally competitive and within which AAM/uni00A0has unique, differentiated capabilities. These platforms are Fixed Income, Real Assets, Equities and Multi-Asset & Solutions. Each investment platform is led globally by a chief investment officer that sits on the Global Board of AAM. Strategic direction and global oversight of business performance is executed by this Global Board, which has both global and local roles and responsibilities. This board is supported by several sub committees. Members of the Global Board are appointed by Aegon N.V.. The Risk Advisory Committee and Remuneration Committee support Aegon's oversight of Aegon Asset Management.\n\n## Overview of sales and distribution channels\n\nAegon Asset Management utilizes both institutional and wholesale distribution channels which combine a global perspective with a focus on local relationships in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

The main sources for this include third-party business where Aegon Asset Management distributes its investment strategies directly to its clients. The wholesale businesses typically sell collective investment vehicles (mutual funds) to customers through wholesale distributors and independent intermediaries. The asset classes are fixed income, equities, real assets and multi-asset & solutions with fund performance is usually measured against a benchmark or peer group. The institutional businesses typically sell its services to large insurance companies or pension funds. Aegon Asset Management manages a full range of asset classes, and manages the funds against objectives, targets and risk profiles agreed with clients. Aegon Asset Management offers both absolute and relative return products.\n\nAlso third-party business is sourced through relationships with its affiliates where Aegon Asset Management manages funds for Aegon insurers and retirement companies. These funds have various legal structures and performance is usually measured against a benchmark or peer group. The main asset classes include fixed income, equities, real estate, and multi-asset.",

These assets are managed to match the insurers' liabilities. As a rule, general account assets are managed in a closed architecture structure, and the main asset classes are fixed income and mortgage loans. Furthermore, Aegon Asset Management manages the general account derivatives book of Aegon Netherlands.\n\n## Competition\n\nAegon Asset Management competes with other asset management companies to acquire business from open-architecture Aegon insurance units and third parties.\n\nIn the United States, Aegon Asset Management focuses on offering investors fixed income, equity and real estate related strategies. It works directly with pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, endowments, and foundations as well as investment consultants within the institutional market. In the wholesale market, Aegon Asset Management works as a sub-advisor with its insurance company affiliates and other partners to offer competitive and relevant strategies for its client base. It also works with investment consultants and other partners to offer products to third-party institutions. Primary competitors in the United States include AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, Invesco, JP Morgan, Legg Mason, Principal, PIMCO and PGIM.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Aegon Asset Management provides a wide range of investment strategies and solutions to institutional and wholesale clients, and through its affiliated insurance company to retail clients. In the third-party institutional market, it competes with domestic and global asset managers as well as with fiduciary and balance sheet managers. Competition continues to be strong in the institutional market due to both the ongoing consolidation of pension funds and the growing service requirements of pension fund clients. Primary competitors in the Netherlands include BlackRock, JP Morgan, NN Investment Partners, Robeco and Kempen.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Aegon Asset Management focuses on offering investors fixed income, equities, real estate, and multi-asset strategies. It serves institutional clients and their advisors and is active in the wholesale market. Primary competitors in the UK include Ashmore, BlackRock, Henderson Global Investors and Standard Life Aberdeen.\n\nAegon Asset Management also distributes to third party investors, including wholesale and institutional clients in Asia through its Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo offices, in Brazil through Aegon's JV partner Mongeral and in the DACH region, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Nordics.\n\nIn mainland China, Aegon Industrial Fund Management Company focuses on Chinese equity, fixed income, and money market strategies. It competes against a wide range of local based asset managers including Alibaba's Yuebao fund, China Universal Asset Management, E Fund Management, Fullgoal Fund Management, and Yinhua Fund Management.\n\nIn France, La Banque Postale Asset Management competes for private investors through La Banque Postale's/uni00A0retail banking network, representing LBPAM and Aegon Asset Management strategies. In the institutional market, it also offers investment strategies from Aegon Asset Management to compete for affiliate and thrid-party insurance and pension clients with large local asset managers and specialized international competitors. In France, primary competitors include Amundi Asset Management, AXA Investment Management, BNP Paribas Investment Partners and Natixis Global Asset Management.\n\n## Regulation and supervision\n\nRegulation of asset management companies in general differs to that of insurers. Aegon Asset Management's global holding company, Aegon Asset Management Holding B.V., is authorized to hold substantial holdings in several EU investment firms. Local operating entities are regulated by their local regulators, most notably the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) (conduct of business supervision) and the DNB (prudential supervision) for Dutch-based entities, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for Aegon Asset Management UK plc, and the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for the US-based entities. Aegon Asset Management UK is also regulated by the SEC for its activities in the US market. From a regulatory perspective, the asset management activities of the US-based entities of Aegon Asset Management in the United States do not fall directly under the responsibility of Aegon Asset Management Holding B.V., as these entities are subsidiaries of Transamerica Corporation.\n\n## MiFID II\n\nMIFID II requirements became effective for Aegon Asset Management as of January 3, 2018, and the Company adheres to the regulation. In line with most of its peers, the European Aegon Asset Management entities (Aegon Investment Management B.V. and Aegon Asset Management UK plc) decided in principle to pay external research costs by their own means.",

Others may arise from external factors, such as developments in financial markets, the business and/or political environment, economic trends, politics and regulations. Any of the risks described below, whether internal or external, may materially and adversely affect the Company's operations, its earnings, the value of its investments, the sale of certain products and services or its ability to fulfil its obligations in respect of securities issued or guaranteed by it. The market price of Aegon securities could decline due to any of the risks described in this section and investors could lose some or all of the value of their investments. Additional risks of which Aegon is not presently aware could also materially and adversely affect its operations and share price. The business of an international financial services group such as Aegon is inherently exposed to risks that may only become apparent with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nThe next section groups the risk factors into different categories based on the origin of the risk, while recognizing that the identified risk factor can have broader consequences, including developments in financial markets (included under financial risks) can impact policyholder behavior (included under underwriting risk). The categories used are: 1) financial risks, 2) underwriting risks, 3) operational risks, 4) political, regulatory and supervisory risks, and 5) legal and compliance risks. Within each category the most material risk factors have been presented first.\n\nThe described risk factors are those relating to Aegon's businesses, and to Aegon's securities, including its common shares, of which Aegon is aware and which it considers material. Furthermore, described risk factors may affect Aegon's businesses and operations in normal market circumstances, as well as in periods of significant economic uncertainty, when those risks may be more acute.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, the risk factors cover the following topics in the designated category;\n\n- 1. Financial risks\n- \u25a0 Interest rate volatility, and/uni00A0sustained low or negative interest rate levels may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and shareholders' equity.\n- \u25a0 Rapidly rising interest rates may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and available liquidity.\n- \u25a0 Disruptions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions may affect, and could have materially adverse effects on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n- \u25a0 Illiquidity of certain investment assets may prevent Aegon from selling investments at fair prices in a timely manner.\n- \u25a0 Declines in value and defaults in Aegon's debt securities, private placements and mortgage loan portfolios held in Aegon's general and separate accounts, or the failure of certain counterparties, may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and shareholders' equity.\n- \u25a0 A decline in equity markets may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and shareholders' equity, sales of savings and investment products, and the amount of assets under management.\n- \u25a0 A downturn in the real estate market may adversely impact valuations and cash flows.\n- \u25a0 The default of a major market participant may disrupt the markets and may affect Aegon's business, financial condition, liquidity, operations and prospects.\n- \u25a0 Reinsurers to which Aegon has ceded risk may fail to meet their obligations.\n- \u25a0 A downgrade in Aegon's ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect relationships with distributors, and negatively affect Aegon's results.\n- \u25a0 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect Aegon's financial condition and reported results of operations.\n- \u25a0 Aegon may be unable to manage Aegon's risks successfully through derivatives.\n- \u25a0 Valuation of Aegon's investments, allowances and impairments is subjective, and discrepant valuations may adversely affect Aegon's results of operations and financial condition.\n- 2. Underwriting risks\n- \u25a0 Underwriting risk relates to the products sold by Aegon insurance entities and includes policyholder behavior (such as lapses or surrender of policies), policy claims (such as mortality and morbidity) and expenses./uni00A0The underwriting process requires, among others, the setting of assumptions. Aegon's reported results of operations and financial condition may be affected by differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserve assumptions both due to incurred gains/losses and from potential changes in best estimate assumptions that are used to value insurance liabilities.\n- \u25a0 Changes in assumptions, estimations, judgments are subjective, and discrepant valuations of DPAC and value of business acquired may adversely affect Aegon's results of operations and financial condition.\n- \u25a0 Certain of Aegon's products have guarantees that may adversely affect its results, financial condition or liquidity.",

Risks relating to Aegon's common shares\n- \u25a0 Aegon's share price could be volatile and could drop unexpectedly, and investors may not be able to resell Aegon's common shares at or above the price paid.\n- \u25a0 Aegon and its significant shareholders may offer additional common shares in the future, and these and other sales may adversely affect the market price of the outstanding common shares.\n- \u25a0 Vereniging Aegon, Aegon's major shareholder, holds a large percentage of the voting shares and therefore has significant influence over Aegon's corporate actions.\n- \u25a0 Currency fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of Aegon's common shares and the value of any cash distributions made.\n- \u25a0 Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities (or other securities that permit or require Aegon to satisfy its obligations by issuing common shares) that Aegon may issue could influence the market price for Aegon's common shares.\n\n## Financial risks\n\n## Interest rate volatility and sustained low or negative interest rate levels may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and shareholders' equity.\n\nAegon is exposed to interest rate risk as both its assets and liabilities are sensitive to movements in long- and short-term interest rates as well as to changes in the volatility of interest rates.\n\nDuring periods of decreasing interest rates, sustained low or even negative interest rates, as experienced in recent years, Aegon may not be able to preserve margins due to the existence of minimum interest rate guarantees and minimum guaranteed crediting rates provided in policies. Also, investment earnings may be lower because the interest earnings on new fixed-income investments are likely to have declined with the market interest rates. A prolonged low or even negative interest rate environment may also result in a lengthening of maturities of the policyholder liabilities from initial estimates, due to lower policy lapses and longer duration of annuities. In this context, negative interest rates have comparable but larger impacts than low but positive rates.\n\nIn-force life insurance and annuity policies may be relatively more attractive to consumers due to built-in minimum interest rate guarantees, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features and a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force year-to-year. The majority of assets backing the insurance liabilities are invested in fixed-income securities.\n\nAegon manages its investments and derivative portfolio, considering a variety of factors, including the relationship between the expected duration of its assets and liabilities. However, if interest rates remain low or even negative, the yield earned upon reinvesting interest payments from current investments, or from their sale or maturity, may decline. Reinvestment at lower yields may reduce the spread between interest earned on investments and interest credited to some of Aegon's products and accordingly net income may decline. In addition, borrowers may prepay or redeem fixed maturity investments or mortgage loans in Aegon's investment portfolio in order to borrow at lower rates. Aegon can lower crediting rates on certain products to offset the decrease in spread. However, its ability to lower these rates may be limited by contractually guaranteed minimum rates or competition.\n\nDepending on economic developments, interest rates for securities with shorter maturities may remain at low or even negative levels for a prolonged period. In such an environment, an anchored expectation of low inflation or deflation could further push down the longer end of the interest rate curve which could have significant implications for Aegon's operations and financial results.\n\nThe profitability of Aegon's spread-based businesses depends, among other things, upon the ability to manage interest rate risk. Aegon may not be able to successfully manage interest rate risk or the potential negative impact of this risk.\n\n## Rapidly rising interest rates may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and available liquidity.\n\nIn periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may and usually do increase. Premiums in flexible premium policies may decrease as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This activity may result in cash payments by Aegon requiring the sale of invested assets at a time when the prices of those assets are affected adversely by the increase in market interest rates. This may result in realized investment losses.\n\nThese cash payments to policyholders also result in a decrease in total invested assets and net income. Early withdrawals may also require accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC), which in turn reduces net income.",

This is inconsistent with the IFRS-EU accounting on much of Aegon's liabilities, where corresponding economic gains from higher interest rates do not affect shareholders' equity or income in the shorter term. Over time, the short-term reduction in shareholders' equity and income due to rising interest rates would be offset in later years, all else being equal.\n\nIncreased withdrawals and the need to post margin in relation to interest rate swaps if rates rise rapidly would put a strain on Aegon's available liquidity.\n\n## Disruptions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions may affect, and could have materially adverse effects on, Aegon's businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n\nAegon's results of operations and financial condition may be materially affected from time to time by uncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in general economic conditions, such as economic growth, levels of unemployment, consumer confidence, inflation and interest rate levels in the countries in which Aegon operates. The global financial crisis has shown that financial markets can experience extreme volatility and disruption.\n\nAny disruptions or downturns in the global financial markets or general economic conditions may result in reduced demand for Aegon's products as well as impairments and reductions in the value of the assets in Aegon's general account, separate account, and company pension schemes, among other assets. Aegon may also experience a higher incidence of claims and unexpected policyholder behavior such as unfavorable changes in lapse rates. Aegon's policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums, which may impact Aegon's businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and Aegon cannot predict with any certainty if or when such actions may occur.\n\nGovernmental action in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere to address any of the above may impact Aegon's businesses. Aegon cannot predict the effect that these or other government actions as well as actions by the European Central Bank (ECB) or the US Federal Reserve may have on financial markets or on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Illiquidity of certain investment assets may prevent Aegon from selling investments at fair prices in a timely manner.\n\nAegon must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term cash demand under normal circumstances, as well as in crisis situations. Liquidity risk is inherent in many of Aegon's businesses. Each asset purchased and liability (e.g., insurance product) sold has unique liquidity characteristics. Some liabilities can be surrendered, while some assets, such as privately placed loans, mortgage loans, real estate and limited partnership interests, are to some degree illiquid. In depressed markets, Aegon may be unable to sell or buy significant volumes of assets at quoted prices.\n\nAny security Aegon issues in significant volume may be issued at higher financing costs if funding conditions are impaired. The necessity to issue securities can be driven by a variety of factors; for instance, Aegon may need liquidity for operating expenses, debt servicing and the maintenance of capital levels of insurance subsidiaries. Although Aegon manages its liquidity position for extreme events, including greatly reduced liquidity in capital markets, if these conditions were to persist for an extended period of time, Aegon may need to sell assets substantially below the prices at which they are currently recorded to meet its insurance obligations.\n\nAegon makes use of bilateral and syndicated credit facilities to support repayment of amounts outstanding under Aegon's commercial paper programs and to serve as additional sources of liquidity. An inability to access these credit facilities, for example due to noncompliance with conditions for borrowing or the default of a facility provider under stressed market circumstances, could have an adverse effect on Aegon's ability to meet liquidity needs and to comply with contractual and other requirements.\n\nMany of Aegon's derivatives transactions require Aegon to grant collateral against declines in the fair value of these contracts. Volatile financial markets may significantly increase requirements to grant collateral and adversely affect its liquidity position. Further, a downgrade of Aegon's credit ratings may also result in additional collateral requirements.",

Aegon also considers credit risk to include spread risk, that is, the value of a bond declines due to a general widening of credit spreads. For general account products, Aegon typically bears the risk for investment performance equaling the return of principal and interest on fixed income instruments. Aegon is exposed to credit risk on its general account fixed-income portfolio (debt securities, mortgages, small and medium sized entities (SME) & consumer loans and private placements), over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and reinsurance contracts. In addition, financial institutions acting as a counterparty on derivatives may not fulfill their obligations. Default by issuers and counterparties on their financial obligations may be due to, among other things, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, market downturns or operational failures, and the collateral or security they provide may prove inadequate to cover their obligations at the time of the default. Losses in excess of predicted losses due to any such default or series of defaults by issuers or counterparties may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and financial position.\n\nAdditionally, Aegon is indirectly exposed to credit risk on the investment portfolios underlying separate account liabilities. Changes to credit risk can result in separate account losses, which increase the probability of future loss events. In the United States and the Netherlands for instance, separate account products can include guarantees which protect policyholders against some or all of the downside risks in their separate account portfolio. Reduced separate account values also decrease fee income and may accelerate deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) amortization. Reconsideration of assumptions might also affect the DPAC amortization schedule. These factors may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and financial position.\n\nAegon's investment portfolio includes Dutch government bonds, US Treasury, agency and state bonds, other government-issued securities and corporate bonds. Especially in a weak economic environment Aegon may incur significant investment impairments due to defaults and overall declines in the capital markets. Defaults or other reductions in the value of these securities and loans may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## A decline in equity markets may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and shareholders' equity, sales of savings and investment products, and the amount of assets under management.\n\nAegon and its customers run the risk that the market value of its equity investments declines. Exposure to equity markets exists in both assets and liabilities. Asset exposure exists through direct equity investment where Aegon bears all or most of the volatility in returns and investment performance risk. Equity market exposure is also present in policyholders' accounts for insurance and investment contracts (such as variable annuities, unit-linked products, and mutual funds) where funds are invested in equities. Although most of the risk remains with the policyholder, guarantees within certain products may transfer some or all of this risk to Aegon. Lower investment returns also reduce the asset management fee that Aegon earns on the asset balance in these products, and prolonged investment under-performance may cause existing customers to withdraw funds and potential customers not to grant investment mandates.\n\nSome of Aegon's insurance and investment contract businesses have minimum return or accumulation guarantees, which require Aegon to establish reserves to fund these future guaranteed benefits when equity market returns do not meet or exceed these guarantee levels. Aegon's reported results under IFRS-EU, are also at risk if returns are not sufficient to allow amortization of DPAC, which may impact the reported net income as well as shareholders' equity. Volatile or poor market conditions may also significantly reduce the demand for some of Aegon's savings and investment products, which may lead to lower sales and net income.\n\n## A downturn in the real estate market may adversely impact valuations and cash flows.\n\nAegon's investment portfolio has a large exposure to the residential real estate market in the Netherlands through the residential mortgages sourced by Aegon and the AMVEST funds. As an indication, at year-end 2020 Aegon's general account investments in real estate and mortgages in the Netherlands accounted for around 21% of total general account investments. Risks for Aegon the Netherlands include lower returns or valuation losses on its mortgage portfolio, lower margins due to higher prepayment in the mortgage portfolio in the event of lower interest rates and increased payment defaults.",

This may cause market declines or volatility. Such a failure may lead to a chain of defaults that may adversely affect Aegon and Aegon's contract counterparties. In addition, such a failure may impact future product sales as a potential result of reduced confidence in the insurance industry. The default of one or more large international financial institutions, which may result in disruption or termination of their cash, custodial and/or administrative services, may also have a material adverse impact on Aegon's ability to run effective treasury and asset management operations.\n\nEven the perceived lack of creditworthiness of a government or financial institution (or a default by any such entity) may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults. This risk is sometimes referred to as 'systemic risk' and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing members or futures commissions merchants, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which Aegon interacts on a daily basis and financial instruments of governments which Aegon invests in. Systemic risk could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's ability to raise new funding and on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or prospects.\n\n## Reinsurers to which Aegon has ceded risk may fail to meet their obligations.\n\nAegon's insurance subsidiaries cede premiums to other insurers under various agreements that cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, on a co-insurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess basis. The purpose of these reinsurance agreements is to spread the risk and minimize the effect of losses. The amount of each risk retained depends on an evaluation of the specific risk, which is subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum limits based on the characteristics of coverage. Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse for the ceded amount in the event a covered claim is paid. However, Aegon's insurance subsidiaries remain liable to their policyholders for ceded insurance if any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed by it. A bankruptcy or insolvency or inability of any of Aegon's reinsurance counterparties to satisfy its obligations may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's financial position and results of operations.\n\n## A downgrade in Aegon's ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect relationships with distributors, and negatively affect Aegon's results.\n\nClaims-paying ability and financial strength ratings are factors in establishing the competitive position of insurers. A rating downgrade (or a change in outlook indicating the potential for such a downgrade) of Aegon or any of its rated insurance subsidiaries may, among other things, materially increase the number of policy surrenders and withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their policies. Aegon cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions Aegon may take in response to the actions of rating agencies. As with other companies in the financial services industry, Aegon's ratings may be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency.\n\nWithdrawals by policyholders may require the sale of invested assets, including illiquid assets, at a price that may result in realized investment losses. These cash payments to policyholders would result in a decrease in total invested assets and a decrease in net income. Among other things, early withdrawals may also cause Aegon to accelerate amortization of DPAC, reducing net income.\n\nAegon has experienced downgrades and negative changes to its outlook in the past and may experience rating and outlook changes in the future. A downgrade or potential downgrade, including changes in outlook, may result in higher funding costs and/or affect the availability of funding in the capital markets. In addition, a downgrade may adversely affect relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of Aegon's products and services, which may negatively impact new sales and adversely affect Aegon's ability to compete. A downgrade of Aegon's credit ratings may also affect its ability to obtain reinsurance contracts at reasonable prices or at all.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect Aegon's financial condition and reported results of operations.\n\nAs an international group, Aegon is subject to foreign currency translation risk. Foreign currency exposure also exists when policies are denominated in currencies other than Aegon's functional currency. Currency risk in the investment portfolios backing insurance and investment liabilities is managed using asset liability matching principles. Assets allocated to equity are kept in local currencies to the extent shareholders' equity is required to satisfy regulatory and Aegon's self-imposed capital requirements. Therefore, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect the level of Aegon's consolidated shareholders' equity as a result of translation of the equity of Aegon's subsidiaries into euro, Aegon's reporting currency. Aegon holds the remainder of its capital base (capital securities,",

This balancing is intended to mitigate currency translation impacts on equity and leverage ratios. Aegon may also hedge the foreign exchange component of expected dividends from its principal business units that maintain their equity in currencies other than the euro.\n\nTo the extent the foreign exchange component of expected dividends is not hedged, or actual dividends vary from expected, Aegon's net income and shareholders' equity may fluctuate. As Aegon has significant business segments in the Americas and in the United Kingdom, the principal sources of exposure from currency fluctuations are from the differences between the US dollar and the euro and between the UK pound and the euro. Aegon may experience significant changes in net income and shareholders' equity because of these fluctuations.\n\n## Aegon may be unable to manage risks successfully through derivatives.\n\nAegon is exposed to changes in the fair value of its investments, the impact of interest rate, equity markets and credit spread changes, currency fluctuations and changes in mortality and longevity. Aegon uses common financial derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts, to hedge some of the exposures related to both investments backing insurance products and Company borrowings. Aegon may not be able to manage the risks associated with these activities successfully through the use of derivatives. In addition, a counterparty may fail to honor the terms of its derivatives contracts with Aegon. Clearing members and clearing houses may terminate their derivatives contracts with Aegon. Aegon's inability to manage risks successfully through derivatives, a counterparty's failure to honor Aegon's obligations or the systemic risk that failure is transmitted from counterparty to counterparty may each have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Valuation of Aegon's investments, allowances and impairments is subjective, and discrepant valuations may adversely affect Aegon's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe valuation of many of Aegon's financial instruments is based on methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to different interpretations. Changes to investment valuations may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on certain investments and other assets is subjective and based on assumptions, estimations and judgments that may not reflect or correspond to Aegon's actual experience, any of which may materially impact Aegon's results of operations or financial position.\n\n## Underwriting risks\n\nUnderwriting risk relates to the products sold by Aegon insurance entities and incudes policyholder behavior (such as lapses or surrender of policies), policy claims (such as mortality and morbidity) and expenses. The underwriting process requires, among other things, the setting of assumptions. Aegon's reported results of operations and financial condition may be affected by differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserve assumptions both due to incurred gains/losses and from potential changes in best estimate assumptions that are used to value insurance liabilities.\n\nThere is a risk that the pricing of Aegon's products turns out to be inadequate if the assumptions used for pricing do not materialize. Aegon's earnings depend significantly on the extent to which actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting the prices for Aegon's products and the extent to which the established technical provisions for insurance liabilities, both under IFRS and Solvency II reporting, prove to be sufficient. If actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities, Aegon's income would be reduced. Furthermore, if less favorable claims experience became sustained, Aegon may be required to change its best estimate assumptions with respect to future experience, potentially increasing the technical provisions for insurance liabilities, which may reduce Aegon's income and solvency ratio. In addition, certain acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force have been recorded as assets on the balance sheet and are being amortized into income over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these policies (such as future claims, investment income and expenses) are not realized, the amortization of these costs may be accelerated and may require write-offs should there be an expectation that the costs are not fully recoverable. This may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSources of underwriting risk include policyholder behavior (such as lapses or surrender of policies), policy claims (such as mortality and morbidity) and expenses. For some product lines, Aegon is at risk if policy lapses increase, as sometimes Aegon is unable to fully recover up-front sales expenses despite the presence of commission recoveries or surrender charges and fees. In addition, some policies have embedded options which at times are more valuable to the client if they stay (lower lapses) or leave (higher lapses), which may result in losses to Aegon's businesses. Aegon sells certain types of policies that are at risk if mortality or morbidity increases, such",

Aegon also sells certain other types of policies, such as annuity products, that are at risk if mortality decreases (longevity risk). For example, certain current annuity products, as well as products sold in previous years, have seen their profitability deteriorate as longevity assumptions have been revised upward. If the trend toward increased longevity persists, Aegon's annuity products may continue to experience adverse effects due to longer expected benefit payment periods. Aegon is also at risk if expenses are higher than assumed.\n\n## Changes in assumptions, estimations, judgments are subjective, and discrepant valuations of DPAC and value of business acquired may adversely affect Aegon's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in assumptions, estimations, judgments or actual experience may require Aegon to accelerate the amortization of DPAC and value of business acquired, establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, or recognize impairment of other assets, any of which may materially adversely affect Aegon's results and financial condition.\n\n## Certain of Aegon's products have guarantees that may adversely affect its results, financial condition or liquidity.\n\nCertain products, particularly Aegon's variable annuity products and defined benefit pension business in the Netherlands, include death benefit guarantees, guarantees of minimum surrender values or income streams for stated periods or for life, which may be in excess of account values. These guarantees are designed, among other things, to protect policyholders against downturns in equity markets and interest rates. As a result, a drop in the value of underlying assets or more volatile markets could result in an increase in the valuation of Aegon's liabilities associated with these products. An increase in these liabilities may decrease its net income. Aegon uses a variety of hedging and risk management strategies to mitigate these risks. However, these strategies may not be fully effective.\n\n## Restrictions on underwriting criteria and the use of data may affect Aegon's ability to do business, its financial position or financial results.\n\nSome jurisdictions impose restrictions on particular underwriting criteria, such as gender or race, or use of genetic test results, for determination of premiums and benefits of insurance products./uni00A0Such restrictions, now or in the future, could adversely impact Aegon's operations or financial results. Further developments in underwriting, such as automation and use of additional types and sources of data, may also be affected by future regulatory developments regarding privacy and other restrictions with respect to the use of personal data.\n\n## Aegon regularly develops new financial products to remain competitive in its markets and to meet the expectations of its customers. If customers do not achieve expected returns on those products, Aegon may be confronted with litigation and negative publicity.\n\nAegon may face lawsuits from customers and experience negative publicity if Aegon's products fail to perform as expected, regardless of the suitability of products for customers or the adequacy of the disclosure provided to customers by Aegon and by the intermediaries who distribute Aegon's products. New products that are less well understood and that have less of a performance track record may be more likely to be the subject of such lawsuits. Any such lawsuits may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations, corporate reputation and financial condition.\n\n## Reinsurance may not be available, affordable, or adequate to protect Aegon against losses.\n\nAs part of Aegon's overall risk and capital management strategy, Aegon purchases reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by Aegon's various business segments. Market conditions beyond Aegon's control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection Aegon purchases. In addition, interpretations of terms and conditions may differ over time from anticipated coverage as contracts extend for decades, which may lead to denials of coverage and potentially protracted litigation, the eventual outcome of which may be uncertain.\n\n## Catastrophic events, which are unpredictable by nature, may result in material losses and abruptly and significantly interrupt Aegon's business activities.\n\nAegon's operating results and financial position may be adversely affected by volatile natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, cyber-crime, riots, fires and explosions, pandemics, and other catastrophes. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposure. Aegon is also",

Aegon can be impacted through for instance higher mortality rates in the countries in which it operates and through lower sales and higher lapses on its products due to limitations on customer interactions, pressure on customer income and increased uncertainty. Such events may lead to considerable financial losses to Aegon's businesses. These catastrophic events may also lead to adverse market movements which increase the adverse impacts to Aegon's financial position. For instance, prices and credit quality of investments can be impacted. In addition, monetary policy measures from central banks can result in lower interest rates. Furthermore, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, civil unrest, military actions, and fires may disrupt Aegon's operations and result in significant loss of property, key personnel, and information about Aegon and its clients. If its business continuity plans have not included effective and sufficient contingencies for such events, Aegon may also experience business disruption and damage to corporate reputation and financial condition for a substantial period of time.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Competitive factors may adversely affect Aegon's market share.\n\nCompetition in Aegon's business segments is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, claims paying ability, ratings, and name recognition. Aegon faces intense competition from a large number of other insurers, as well as noninsurance financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual customers, employers, other group customers, agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Consolidation in the global financial services industry can enhance the competitive position of some of Aegon's competitors by broadening the range of their products and services and increasing their distribution channels and their access to capital. In addition, development of alternative distribution channels for certain types of insurance and securities products, including use of digital technologies and platforms, may result in increasing competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. Traditional distribution channels are also challenged by the ban on sales-based commissions in some countries. These competitive pressures may result in increased pricing pressures on a number of Aegon's products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share. This may harm Aegon's ability to maintain or increase profitability.\n\nAdverse market and economic conditions can be expected to result in changes to the competitive landscape. Financial distress experienced by financial services industry participants as a result of weak economic conditions and newly imposed regulations may lead to acquisition opportunities. Additionally, the competitive landscape in which Aegon operates may be affected by governmentsponsored programs or actions taken in response to, for instance, dislocations in financial markets. Aegon's ability or that of Aegon's competitors to pursue such opportunities may be limited due to lower earnings, reserve increases, capital requirements or a lack of access to debt capital markets and other sources of financing. Such conditions may also lead to changes by Aegon or Aegon's competitors in product offerings and product pricing that may affect Aegon and Aegon's relative sales volumes, market shares and profitability.\n\n## Aegon may have difficulty managing its expanding operations, and Aegon may not be successful in acquiring new businesses or divesting existing operations.\n\nOver time, Aegon has made a number of acquisitions and divestments around the world and it is possible that Aegon may make further acquisitions and divestments in the future. Acquisitions and divestments involve risks that may adversely affect Aegon's operating results and financial condition. These include: the potential diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; difficulties in assimilating or disentangling operations, technologies, products and personnel; significant delays in completing the integration of disentangling operations; the potential loss of key employees or customers; and potential losses from unanticipated litigation and tax and accounting issues. In addition, expansion into new and emerging markets may involve heightened political, legal and regulatory risks, such as discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls.\n\nAegon's acquisitions may result in additional indebtedness, costs, contingent liabilities, and impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Acquisitions may also have a dilutive effect on the ownership and voting percentages of existing shareholders. Divestments of existing operations may result in Aegon assuming or retaining certain contingent liabilities. Aegon may not be able to divest assets within the time or at the price planned. All of these factors may adversely affect Aegon's businesses, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that Aegon will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or buyers for operations to be divested or that Aegon will properly value acquisitions or divestments. Aegon is unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate or buyer for operations to be divested will become available, or the likelihood that any transaction will be completed once negotiations have commenced.",

Distributors may elect to reduce or terminate their distribution relationship with Aegon due to adverse developments in its (or their) business. Further, key distribution partners may also merge or change their business models in ways that affect how Aegon's products are sold, or new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of its current distribution efforts.\n\nWhen Aegon's products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, Aegon may not always be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite its significant training and compliance programs. If Aegon's products are distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, Aegon may suffer reputational and other harm to its business.\n\n## Aegon may be unable to adapt to and apply new technologies.\n\nNew technologies are transforming the insurance industry. New technologies include but are not limited to communication channels, automation, artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain. These technologies are changing the way insurance is distributed and sold. They are also changing the way insurers manage their businesses and the skills they need in their workforces. Furthermore, the new technologies are influencing customer and consumer demands. Technology makes it easier to move into new markets. This increases competition, not just among peers, but also from new competitors and disruptors. An inability to adapt quickly enough to and apply these new technologies may impact Aegon's competitive position, and its ability to maintain profitability, and may adversely affect Aegon's future financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFailure of data management and governance can result in regulatory and reputational risk as well as missed business opportunities.\n\nData is essential for Aegon's operational performance. However, much of the data held by Aegon is subject to various legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions. To be able to benefit from the data Aegon holds, areas like data management and governance are of key importance. Most internal processes and customer interactions are dependent on accessible, reliable, and compliant data practices and operations. If Aegon fails to adequately execute on these obligations, there are potential legal, regulatory, contractual and reputational risks. Aegon also must endeavor to obtain adequate data rights to be able to execute on its business strategy. Failure to do so will expose it to additional legal risks, including litigation risks./uni00A0\n\n## Aegon may be impacted by epidemics or pandemics.\n\nAegon is exposed to the risk of an epidemic or a pandemic - such as Asian Flu, SARs or COVID-19 - occurring in one or more of the countries in which it operates or globally. As with other catastrophic events, Aegon can be impacted through, for instance, higher mortality rates in the countries in which it operates and through lower sales, higher lapses on products or arrears on contractual payments by customers with respect to policies and mortgage loans. Such impacts can be due to, for instance, limitations on customer interactions, economic hardship, pressure on customer income, increased loans or withdrawals and increased uncertainty. The impacts can be larger where the epidemic or pandemic leads to adverse market movements - prices and credit quality of investments and defaults on investments - and monetary policy measures resulting in lower interest rates. If the health of a significant number of employees or key functions is compromised or internal controls need to be executed in an atypical way, these could have an impact on core business processes, service levels to customers, and the effectiveness of the control environment. In addition, Aegon faces additional operational risks related to prolonged and expanded working from home/remote working by Aegon's workforce, such as additional remote access to company information which could increase information security risk. Also, Aegon can be impacted via its relationships with third parties. These third parties can also be impacted by an epidemic or pandemic with knock-on impacts on Aegon. The described risks may directly or indirectly impact Aegon's financial health and its ability to generate capital in the medium to long term.\n\n## Aegon may not be successful in managing its exposure to climate risk and adequately adapting investment portfolios for the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nClimate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope and severity of potential impacts. Climate risks can be grouped into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks relate to losses from overall climate changes (i.e. changing weather patterns and sea level rise) and acute climate events (i.e. extreme weather and natural disasters). These physical risks impact property & casualty (P&C) insurance, but also life insurance, for instance through higher-than-expected mortality rates. Losses can also follow from credit risk and collateral linked to Aegon's mortgage portfolio. Aegon is exposed to mortality risk and mortgage",

Beyond insured losses, climate change may have disrupting and cascading effects on the wider economy.\n\nTransition risks are those arising from the shift to a low-carbon economy. These risks are a function of policy and regulatory uncertainty, including political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Transition risks can affect the value of assets and investment portfolios. Furthermore, Aegon may be unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. Linked to both the physical and the transition risks, there could also be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks. The risks can relate both to Aegon and the companies in which it invests.\n\nGiven the significant uncertainties related to climate change impacts and its long-term nature, it cannot be ruled out that climate change may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Aegon's risk management policies and processes may leave the Company exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk events, adversely affecting its businesses, results, and financial condition.\n\nAegon has devoted significant resources to the implementation and maintenance of a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework in all aspects of the business. Nevertheless, it is possible that risks present in its business strategies and initiatives are not fully identified, monitored, and managed or that risks are not properly measured. Risk measurements make use of historic and public data that may be inaccurate or may not predict future exposures.\n\n## Failure of Aegon's information technology or communications systems may result in a material adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and corporate reputation.\n\nAny failure of or gap in the systems and processes necessary to support complex transactions and avoid and/or detect systems failure, fraud, information security failures, processing errors, cyber intrusion, loss of data and breaches of regulation may lead to a materially adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and corporate reputation. In addition, Aegon must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance its existing systems in order to keep pace with applicable regulatory requirements, industry standards and customer preferences. If Aegon fails to maintain secure and well-functioning information systems, Aegon may not be able to rely on data for product pricing, compliance obligations, risk management and underwriting decisions. In addition, Aegon cannot assure investors or consumers that interruptions, failures or breaches in security of these processes and systems will not occur, or that if they do occur, that they can be timely detected and remediated. The occurrence of any of these events may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## A computer system failure or security breach may disrupt Aegon's business, damage Aegon's reputation and adversely affect Aegon's operational results, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nAegon relies heavily on computer and information systems and internet and network connectivity to conduct a large portion of its business operations. This includes the need to securely store, process, transmit and dispose of confidential information, including personal information, through a number of complex systems. In many cases this also includes transmission and processing to or through commercial customers, business partners, (semi-) governmental agencies and third-party service providers. The introduction of new technologies, computer system failures, cyber-crime attacks or security or data privacy breaches may materially disrupt Aegon's business operations, damage Aegon's reputation, result in regulatory and litigation exposure, investigation and remediation costs, and materially and adversely affect Aegon's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nThe information security risk that Aegon faces includes the risk of malicious outside forces using public networks and other methods, including social engineering and the exploitation of targeted offline processes, to attack Aegon's systems and information. It also includes inside threats, both malicious and accidental. For example, human error, unauthorized user activity and lack of sufficiently automated processing can result in improper information exposure or use. Aegon also faces risk in this area due to its reliance in many cases on third-party systems, all of which may face cyber and information security risks of their own. Third-party administrators or distribution partners used by Aegon or its subsidiaries may not adequately secure their own information systems and networks or may not adequately keep pace with the dynamic changes in this area. Potential bad actors that target Aegon and its applicable third parties may include, but are not limited to, criminal organizations, foreign government bodies, political factions, and others.\n\nIn recent years information security risk has increased sharply due to a number of developments in how information systems are used by companies such as Aegon, but also by society in general. Threats have increased as criminals and other bad actors become more",

At the same time companies increasingly make information systems and data available through the internet, mobile devices or other network connections to customers, employees and business partners, thereby expanding the attack surface that bad actors can potentially exploit.\n\nLarge, global financial institutions such as Aegon have been, and will continue to be, subject to information security attacks for the foreseeable future. The nature of these attacks will also continue to be unpredictable, and in many cases may arise from circumstances that are beyond Aegon's control. Especially if and to the extent Aegon fails to adequately invest in defensive infrastructure, timely response capabilities, technology, and processes or to effectively execute against its information security strategy, it may suffer material adverse consequences.\n\nTo date the highest impact information security incidents that Aegon has experienced are believed to have been the result of e-mail phishing attacks targeted at Aegon's business partners and commercial customers. This in turn led to unauthorized use of valid Aegon website credentials to engage in fraudulent transactions and improper data exfiltration. Additionally, Aegon has also faced other types of attacks, including but not limited to other types of phishing attacks and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as well as certain limited cases of unauthorized internal user activity, including activity between different Aegon country units. Although to Aegon's knowledge these events have thus far not been material in nature, Aegon management recognizes the need to establish and maintain adequate information security systems that are capable of addressing the possibility of these types of attacks, as well as for the possibility of more significant and sophisticated information security attacks, in the future. There is no guarantee that the measures that Aegon takes will be sufficient to stop all types of attacks or mitigate all types of information security or data privacy risks.\n\nAegon maintains cyber liability insurance to help decrease the financial impact of cyber-attacks and information security events, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy; however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all applicable losses that Aegon may suffer.\n\nA breach of data privacy or security obligations may disrupt Aegon's business, damage Aegon's reputation and adversely affect financial conditions and results of operations.\n\nPursuant to applicable laws, various government agencies and independent administrative bodies have established numerous rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information and other confidential information held by Aegon. For example, certain of Aegon's businesses are subject to laws and regulations enacted by US federal and state governments, the EU or other non-US jurisdictions and/or enacted by various regulatory organizations relating to the privacy and/or information security of the information of customers, employees or others. For example:\n\n- \u25a0 Effective May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in the EU. Compared to the previous directive, the GDPR, among other things, increased compliance obligations, impacted Aegon's businesses' collection, processing and retention of personal data, reporting of data breaches, and provides for significantly increased penalties for non-compliance. Also, in several jurisdictions in the Asia region where Aegon has activities, new privacy and information security laws have been enacted or existing legislation has been updated.\n- \u25a0 The New York Department of Finance Services (NYDFS), pursuant to its cybersecurity regulation, requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including certain Aegon subsidiaries, to, among other things, satisfy an extensive set of minimum information security requirements, including but not limited to governance, management, reporting, policy, technology and control requirements. Other states have adopted similar cybersecurity laws and regulations.\n- \u25a0 Numerous other US laws also impose various information security and privacy related obligations with respect to various Aegon subsidiaries operating in the US, including but not limited to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related state laws (GLBA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), among many others.\n\nOther legislators and regulators with jurisdiction over our businesses are considering or have already enacted enhanced information security risk management and privacy rules and regulations. A number of Aegon's subsidiaries are also subject to contractual restrictions with respect to the information of our clients and business partners.\n\nAegon, and numerous of its systems, employees and business partners have access to, and routinely process, the personal information of consumers and employees. Aegon relies on a large number of processes and controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information and other confidential information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, Aegon, its systems, employees and business partners. It is possible that an Aegon employee, business partner or system could, intentionally or unintentionally, inappropriately disclose or misuse personal or confidential information. Aegon's data or data in its possession could also be the subject of an unauthorized information security attack. If Aegon fails to maintain adequate processes and controls or if Aegon or its business partners fail to comply with relevant laws and regulations, policies and procedures, misappropriation",

Such control inadequacies or non-compliance could cause disrupted operations and misstated or unreliable financial data, materially damage Aegon's reputation or lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or civil or criminal penalties or (class action) litigation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, Aegon analyzes personal information and customer data to better manage its business, subject to applicable laws and regulations and other restrictions. It is possible that additional regulatory or other restrictions regarding the use of such techniques may be imposed. Additional privacy and information security obligations have been imposed by various governments with jurisdiction over Aegon or its subsidiaries in recent years, and more such obligations are likely to be imposed in the near future across Aegon's operations. Such restrictions and obligations could have material impacts on Aegon's business, financial conditions and/ or results of operations.\n\n## Inaccuracies in econometric, financial, or actuarial models, or differing interpretations of underlying methodologies, assumptions and estimates, could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAegon uses econometric, financial, and actuarial models to measure and manage multiple types of risk, to price products and to establish and assess key valuations and report financial results. All these functions are critical to Aegon's operations. Aegon has a model risk management framework in place to manage modelling risk. If, despite this framework, models, their underlying methodologies, assumptions and estimates, or their implementation and monitoring prove to be inaccurate, this could have an adverse effect on Aegon's business, financial condition, and results.\n\nMany of Aegon's business units offer investment products that utilize quantitative models, algorithms or calculations that could experience errors or prove to be incorrect, incomplete or unsuccessful, resulting in losses for clients who have invested in such products and possible regulatory actions and/or litigation against Aegon and/or its affiliates.\n\nAegon's business units may utilize quantitative models, algorithms or calculations (whether proprietary or supplied by third parties) (Models) or information, or data supplied by third parties (Data) for the management of, or to assist in the management of, investment products offered to clients. Examples of such investment products include volatility controlled funds, mutual funds, separately managed accounts, and other types of advisory accounts. Models and Data are used to construct sets of transactions and investments, to provide risk management insights, and may be used to assist in hedging investments. If Models and Data prove to be incorrect or incomplete, any decisions made, in whole or part, in reliance thereon expose the investment product to additional risks. For example, by utilizing Models or Data, certain investments may be bought at prices that are too high, certain other investments may be sold at prices that are too low, or favorable opportunities may be missed altogether. Similarly, any hedging based on faulty Models and Data may prove to be unsuccessful. The applicable investment product bears the risk that Models or Data used will not be successful and the product may not achieve its investment objective.\n\nModels can be predictive in nature. The use of predictive Models has inherent risks. For example, such Models may incorrectly forecast future behavior, leading to potential losses on a cash flow and/or a mark-to-market basis. In addition, in unforeseen or certain low-probability scenarios (often involving a market disruption of some kind), such Models may produce unexpected results, which can result in losses for an investment product. Furthermore, the success of relying on or otherwise using Models depends on a number of factors, including the validity, accuracy and completeness of the Model's development, implementation and maintenance, the Model's assumptions, factors, algorithms and methodologies, and the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical or other Data.\n\nModels rely on, among other things, correct and complete Data inputs. If incorrect Data is entered into even a well-founded Model, the resulting information will be incorrect. However, even if Data is input correctly, Model prices may differ substantially from market prices, especially for securities with complex characteristics. Investments selected with the use of Models may perform differently than expected as a result of the design of the Model, inputs into the Model or other factors. Additionally, if investment products offered by Aegon's affiliates experience Model errors or use erroneous Data, this could result in regulatory actions and/or litigation brought against Aegon and/or its affiliates.",

Aegon outsources certain information technology, finance and actuarial services, investment management services and policy administration operations to third party providers and may do so increasingly in the future. If Aegon fails to maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or if third party providers do not provide the core administrative, operational, financial, and actuarial services Aegon requires and anticipates, or perform as contracted, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffer an information security or data privacy breach, Aegon may not realize the productivity improvements or cost efficiencies or customers might experience lower service levels. In addition, Aegon may not be able to find an adequate alternative provider, and instead experience financial loss, reputational harm, operational difficulties, increased costs, a loss of business and other negative consequences, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's results. In addition, Aegon's reliance on third party providers does not relieve Aegon of its responsibilities and requirements. Any failure or negligence by such third-party providers in carrying out their contractual duties may result in Aegon being subjected to liability and litigation. Any litigation relating to such matters could be costly and time-consuming, and the outcome would be uncertain. Moreover, any adverse publicity arising from such litigation, even if the litigation is not successful, could adversely affect Aegon's reputation and distribution of its products. Finally, Aegon's ability to receive services from third party providers based in different countries might be impacted by political instability, cultural differences, regulatory requirements or policies inside or outside of the countries within which Aegon has operations. As a result, Aegon's ability to conduct its business might be adversely affected\n\n## Aegon may be unable to attract and retain personnel who are key to the business.\n\nAs a global financial services enterprise, Aegon relies, to a considerable extent, on the quality of local management and personnel in the various countries in which Aegon operates. The success of Aegon's operations is dependent, among other things, on Aegon's ability to attract and retain highly qualified professional personnel. Competition for key personnel in most countries in which Aegon operates is intense. Aegon's ability to attract and retain key personnel is very much dependent on the competitiveness of the compensation package for employees in the market in which it competes.\n\nAs a part of the governmental response in Europe and, to a certain extent, the United States to the financial crisis in 2008, there have been various legislative initiatives that have sought to give guidance or regulate the structure of remuneration for personnel, in particular senior management, with a focus on performance-related remuneration and limiting severance payments. With differences in interpretation of these regulations by local regulators on how the guidelines need to be applied, as well as the question of whether they apply to insurance industries at all, these restrictions create an uncertain playing field and may adversely affect Aegon's ability to compete for qualified employees, as well as Aegon's ability to transfer employees between regions.\n\n## Political, Regulatory and Supervisory\n\nAegon may be required to increase its technical provisions and/or hold higher amounts of regulatory capital as a result of changes in the regulatory environment or changes in rating agency analysis, which may impact Aegon's financial position and/ or decrease Aegon's returns on its products.\n\nPrudential regulatory requirements such as with respect to the calculation of technical provisions, capital requirements, the eligibility of own funds as such and the regulatory treatment of investments may change, which could require Aegon to increase technical provisions, hold higher amounts of regulatory capital and subject it to more stringent requirements with respect to investments and/ or own funds. Important examples include changes to applicable capital requirements by the European Union and/or the interpretation thereof by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in the US or US state regulators or local regulators in jurisdictions in which Aegon operates. Aegon cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, may have on its businesses, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nPrudential regulatory requirements may not only apply to the individual entities in the Aegon Group but may additionally apply at Group level or apply to part of the Group. Consequently, those requirements may have different, and more or less meaningful, impact depending on their scope. Important examples of such requirements are Solvency II group supervision and consolidated requirements",

Changes to prudential regulatory requirements may have an impact on Aegon's competitive position versus companies that are not subject to these or similar requirements at Group level. As an example, as part of the Solvency II group calculation, Aegon applies a specific methodology for its US insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries at Group level, in addition to the requirements to which these subsidiaries are subject under their local prudential regime. This methodology is approved by Aegon's group supervisor, De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. (DNB), but remains subject to periodic review. Changes to this methodology might have an impact on Aegon's capital position, as calculated under Solvency II group requirements and/or the manner in which DNB otherwise exercises group supervision on Aegon, for example through more stringent requirements with respect to intra-group transactions, risk concentrations and reporting.\n\nThere are several important regulatory standards with respect to capital adequacy that apply to Aegon and are subject to change, which changes could impact Aegon's financial position and results:\n\n- \u25a0 A further review of the Solvency II framework, referred to as the Solvency II 2020 review. EIOPA has recently published an extensive technical advice to the European Commission in the form of an opinion/uni00A0on a broad range of topics within the Solvency II framework. This opinion on the 2020 review of Solvency II forms important input for the European Commission in the preparation of its formal proposal for amendments to the Solvency II Directive and Solvency II Delegated Regulation, that is expected to be published in the second half of 2021. The impact on Aegon's financial position and results depends on the extent to which the EIOPA advice will be embraced by the European Commission and the European co-legislators;\n- \u25a0 The NAIC's requirements with respect to risk-based capital. The NAIC continues to review the risk-based capital (RBC) charges for invested assets. Additionally, the NAIC has an ongoing project to review longevity risk. These initiatives or other regulatory changes to capital factors may lead to higher risk-based capital requirements. In addition, the NAIC formed the Group Capital Calculation (E) Working Group charged with constructing a US group capital calculation (GCC) using an RBC aggregation approach that would be used by regulators as a monitoring tool. The results of the GCC could impact the translation of RBC in the Group capital ratio for the United States; and\n- \u25a0 US state insurance regulators' perspectives on the use and value of captive insurance companies. Aegon utilizes affiliated captive insurance companies to manage risks of various insurance policies issued before the adoption of principle-based reserves, including universal life with secondary guarantees and level term life insurance. These structures have been utilized to finance regulatory reserves. To the extent that state insurance regulations restrict or require insurers to restate the valuation of the assets used to finance these structures, this could increase costs or reduce available capital.\n\nIn addition to requirements imposed by regulatory and/or supervisory authorities, rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses, thus requiring additional capital for Aegon's regulated subsidiaries for Aegon Group and/ or its regulated subsidiaries to maintain their desired credit ratings.\n\nThe application of these capital standards and changes thereto could adversely affect Aegon's ability to compete with other insurers that are not subject to those capital requirements. These requirements may also lead Aegon to engage in transactions that affect capital and constrain Aegon's ability to pay dividends or repurchase its own shares. Furthermore, such requirements may constrain Aegon's ability to provide guarantees and may increase the cost to Aegon of offering certain products, resulting in price increases, discontinuance of offering of certain products or reducing the amount of risk Aegon takes on. Aegon may consider structural and other business alternatives in light of requirements or standards applicable with respect to systemic entities or activities, of which the impact on shareholders cannot be predicted. For further detail on developments in these areas, we refer to the section ''Regulation and supervision'' of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report 2020.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards may affect Aegon's reported results, shareholders' equity and dividend.\n\nAegon's financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS-EU. Any future changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on Aegon's reported results, financial condition, shareholders' equity and dividend. This includes the level and volatility of reported results and shareholders' equity. New accounting standards that are likely to have a significant impact on Aegon's reported results, financial condition and shareholders' equity include, but are not limited to, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts.\n\nThe IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in July 2014, which was endorsed by the European Union in November 2016. The IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts in May 2017. IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4, which was intended as an",

In June 2020, the IASB decided, application subject to EU endorsement process, to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 (and also extend the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 in IFRS 4 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023).\n\nAn implementation project was started soon after the publication of the new Standard. It is expected that the impact of the initial application on Aegon's financial statements will be significant.\n\n## Local statutes, regulators, and decisions of supervisory and other authorities may limit the ability of Aegon's subsidiaries to pay dividends to Aegon N.V., thereby limiting Aegon's ability to make payments on debt obligations.\n\nAegon's ability to make payments on debt obligations and pay operating expenses is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries, in particular, but not limited to, the operating companies in the US, the Netherlands, and the UK. Most of these subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions that can limit the payment of dividends. In addition, local regulators in the countries where Aegon operates, supervisory and other authorities (such as EIOPA or the European Systemic Risk Board) may decide to impose or advise on further restrictions to dividend payments, or discourage such payments, specifically in exceptional and unpredictable economic circumstances. This may affect Aegon's ability to satisfy its debt obligations or pay its operating expenses.\n\n## Risks of application of intervention measures may adversely affect Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.\n\nThe Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers ('R&R Act') allows DNB to intervene in situations where a Dutch insurer or reinsurer is faced with financial difficulties. The powers under the R&R Act may also extend to the level of the Group and to entities, other than insurance or reinsurance entities in the Netherlands, which are part of the Group, such as Aegon N.V.\n\nIn addition, the R&R Act allows DNB to require a Dutch insurance or reinsurance company or a group to remove, ex ante, material impediments to effective resolution of a Dutch insurance or reinsurance undertaking (such as the revision of financing arrangements, the reduction of exposures, the transfer of assets, the termination or limitation of business activities, or the prohibition on starting certain business activities, changing the legal or operational structure of the Group, or securing certain critical business lines). The use of this tool may adversely affect Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.\n\nThe EIOPA opinion on the 2020 review of Solvency II, referred to above, includes advice to the European Commission to include provisions, relating to minimum harmonization of recovery and resolution regime within the European Union, in the formal proposal for amendments to the Solvency II framework, expected to be published in the 2 nd half of 2021. This might lead to the introduction of intervention tools, similar to those included in the R&R Act, in other EU member states in which Aegon's subsidiaries are active.\n\nFurthermore, to parts of the Aegon Group, in particular Aegon Bank N.V., the framework of the EU Directive on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive') is applicable. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive contains provisions that where both Aegon Bank N.V. and Aegon N.V. fail or are likely to fail, could be applied to mixed financial holding companies such as Aegon N.V., including the right of bail-in of creditors.\n\nLastly, when the stability of the financial system is threatened by the condition of a financial institution the Dutch Minister of Finance may intervene immediately, in which case legal or statutory provisions, applicable to the financial institution, might be superseded. The intervention measures available to the Minister of Finance include, in particular, the right to expropriate assets of the financial institution, as well as securities and/or other financial instruments issued by or with the cooperation of the financial institution. The exercise of this power may significantly impact the rights of the owners or holders of these assets, securities and/or financial instruments.\n\nThere is a risk that the possible exercise of powers, or any perceived exercise of powers, by DNB or the Ministry of Finance could have a material adverse effect on the performance by the failing institution, including Aegon, of its obligations (of payment or otherwise) under contracts of any form, including the expropriation, write-off, write-down or conversion of securities such as shares and debt obligations issued by the failing institution. The R&R Act and the regime of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive are described in more detail in the section 'Regulation and supervision' of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report 2020.\n\nThe United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ('Brexit') may affect Aegon's results and financial condition.",

The post-Brexit relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom is governed by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This Agreement does not include material arrangements relating to financial services. The European Union and the United Kingdom intend to agree upon a memorandum of understanding by March 2021 to establish the framework for regulatory cooperation in financial services, covering, among other things, transparency and appropriate dialogue in the process of adoption, suspension and withdrawal of equivalence decisions in the area of financial services. As the Transition Period only ended recently and with a significant lack of clarity around the way in which the provision of financial services between the European Union and the United Kingdom will be regulated, Aegon could be adversely impacted by unexpected developments and market developments, any of which could reduce the value or results of Aegon's operations, in particular Aegon's operations in the United Kingdom. Aegon could also be adversely impacted should Brexit result in the United Kingdom moving away from European Union legislation such as, but not limited to, Solvency II regulations and financial services legislation.\n\n## Legal and Compliance\n\nThe outcome of legal and arbitration proceedings and regulatory investigations and actions may adversely affect Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.\n\nAegon faces significant risks of litigation as well as regulatory investigations and actions relating to its and its subsidiaries' businesses as well as Aegon's compliance with regulations applicable to it as a corporate entity.\n\nInsurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities are routinely the subject of litigation, investigation and regulatory activity by various governmental and enforcement authorities, individual claimants, and policyholder advocate groups in the jurisdictions in which Aegon does business, including the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. These actions may involve issues including, but not limited to, employment or distribution relationships; operational and internal controls and processes; investment returns; sales practices; claims payments and practices; transparency and adequacy of product disclosures including regarding initial costs, ongoing costs, and costs due on policy surrender as well as changes to costs over time; environmental and climate change related matters; competition and antitrust matters; data privacy; information security; and intellectual property.\n\nAegon entities are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including for example the US Bank Secrecy Act, the Dutch Anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act (Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme), UK Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Act, European Anti-Money Laundering Directives, or other regulations and these require us to develop and implement customer identification and risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report suspicious activity, and maintain certain records. Further, Aegon entities are required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions programs, including for example ones administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, HM Treasury or the Council of EU that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected persons, governments, and in certain circumstances, countries. Changes in, or violations of, any of these laws or regulations may require additional compliance procedures, or result in enforcement proceedings, sanctions or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, financial condition and result of operations.\n\nAegon entities may be subject to anti-bribery legislation such as the Foreign Corruption and Practices Act in the US, the UK Bribery Act, Dutch anti-bribery provisions and other regulations. Any violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws by Aegon, its employees, subsidiaries or local agents, could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\n\nGovernment and regulatory investigations may result in the institution of administrative, injunctive, or other proceedings and/ or the imposition of monetary fines, penalties and/or disgorgement as well as other remedies, sanctions, damages and restitutionary amounts. Regulators may also seek changes to the way Aegon operates. In some cases, Aegon subsidiaries have modified business practices in response to inquiries.\n\nCustomers of certain of Aegon's products bear significant investment risks with respect to those products which are affected by fluctuations in equity markets as well as interest rate movements. When investment returns disappoint, are volatile, or change due to changes in the market or other relevant conditions, customers may threaten or bring litigation against Aegon.\n\nThe existence of potential claims may remain unknown for long periods of time after the events giving rise to such claims. Determining the likelihood of exposure to Aegon and the extent of any such exposure may not be possible for long periods of time after Aegon becomes aware of such potential claims. Litigation exposure as well may develop over long periods of time; once litigation is initiated,",

Damages alleged may not be quantifiable or supportable or may have no relationship to economic losses or final awards. As a result, Aegon cannot predict the effect of litigation, investigations or other actions on its business.\n\nSeparate from financial loss, litigation, regulatory action, legislative changes or changes in public opinion may require Aegon to change its business practices, which could have a material adverse impact on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Disputes and investigations initiated by governmental entities and private parties may lead to orders or settlements, including payments or changes to business practices, even if Aegon believes the underlying claims are without merit.\n\nSeveral US insurers, including Aegon subsidiaries, have been named in class actions, as well as individual litigation, relating to increases in monthly deduction rates (MDR) on universal life products. Plaintiffs generally allege that the increases were made to recoup past losses rather than to cover the future costs of providing insurance coverage. Aegon's subsidiary in the US has agreed to settle two such class actions that had been venued in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The settlement in the first case, approved in January 2019, arose from increases implemented in 2015-2016. Over 99% of affected policyholders participated in that settlement. While less than 1% of policyholders opted out of the settlement, they represent approximately 43% of the value of the settlement fund. The individual opt out cases and disputes are on-going. Resolution of this class action ended a number of other related cases, including other federal and state class actions. In the second case, Aegon's subsidiary agreed to settle a class action lawsuit arising out of MDR increases in 2017 and 2018. The court approved that settlement on 16 September 2020. Opt-outs in this case represent less than 7% of the value of the settlement fund. On 15 October 2020, two opt-out policyholders whose objections to the settlement were overruled by the trial court filed an appeal. The appeal has delayed implementation of the settlement./uni00A0The settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs, although Aegon continues to hold a provision for these policyholders. In the only individual case against Aegon's subsidiary to reach trial (in 2017), a jury found that a 2013 increase to a certain group of policies was improper. The jury verdict was affirmed on appeal, which ended the case.\n\nIn addition, insurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities may face lawsuits that threaten their business models. For example, several US-based Aegon subsidiaries are defendants in a class action alleging that the business model improperly characterizes distributors as independent contractors instead of employees. Depending on the outcome, this lawsuit, along with similar claims against other companies, as well as regulatory action, could necessitate a change in the business model and/or could result in a significant settlement or judgment.\n\nIn the Netherlands, unit linked products (beleggingsverzekeringen) have been controversial and the target of litigation since 2005. Allegations include excessive cost, unfair terms, inadequate disclosure, and failure to perform as illustrated. Consumer groups have formed to address these issues and initiate mass claims against insurers. Regulators as well as the Dutch Parliament have been involved ever since, with the principal goal of achieving an equitable resolution. Aegon has made improvements across its product lines, including after settlements reached in 2009 with Stichting Woekerpolis and Stichting Verliespolis. Aegon also decided to reduce future policy costs for the large majority of its unit-linked portfolio. Some of the unit linked products are still involved in ongoing litigation. In September 2014, consumer interest group Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl filed a claim against Aegon in court. The claim related to a range of unit linked products that Aegon sold in the past, including Aegon products involved in the earlier litigation. In June 2017, the court issued a verdict which upheld the principle that disclosures must be evaluated according to the standards at the time when the relevant products were placed in-force. Most of the claims of Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl were dismissed under this standard, although the court found that Aegon did not adequately disclose certain charges on a limited set of policies. The district court did not decide on the reasonableness of the cost levels and whether the previous compensation arrangements provide sufficient compensation. This court decision has been appealed by both parties. The Court of Appeal has stayed the class action proceedings during the preliminary proceedings at the Supreme Court in another class action of Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl against another insurance company. Aegon expects the claims and litigation, whether collective or on an individual basis and in court or through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, on unit linked products to continue for the foreseeable future. Developments in similar cases against other Dutch insurers currently before regulators and courts may also affect Aegon.\n\nLawsuits have also been brought against providers of securities leasing products (aandelenlease producten). Although sales of securities leasing products ended more than a decade ago, litigation relating to these products has resurfaced. In 2016, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a securities leasing product sold by one of Aegon's competitors. It decided that the financial institution was liable if a broker (remisier) that advised on the sale of the institution's products, was not properly licensed. It also",

In July 2016, consumer interest group Stichting Platform Aandelenlease filed a mass claim against Aegon Bank regarding securities leasing product Sprintplan. In October 2017, the district court of The Hague ruled in favor of Aegon that the Sprintplan liability had been conclusively determined in earlier proceedings and there were no grounds to hold further collective proceedings. The plaintiff appealed. In February 2020, the Court of Appeal rejected all claims filed by platform Aandelenlease against Aegon Bank. Platform Aandelenlease confirmed that it will not appeal the ruling of the Court of Appeal which makes the ruling of the Court of Appeal final.\n\nIn the Netherlands Aegon is also involved in claims for compensation and the cancellation or nullification of contracts concerning the Vliegwiel product, a variation on securities leasing products Currently, proceedings are pending before the Dutch courts and the Financial Services Complaints Authority ('Klachteninstituut Financi\u00eble Dienstverlening'), with numerous cases having been initiated by Leaseproces B.V. In December 2020 Aegon reached an agreement on a settlement with Leaseproces B.V. for those customers of Vliegwiel and Sprintplan products who are represented by Leaseproces B.V. The settlement is subject to conditions precedent and further operational details have yet to be agreed. Execution of the settlement is expected in 2021.\n\nThere can be no assurances that these matters will not ultimately result in a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, and financial position. For additional information on proceedings in which Aegon is involved, refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements, note/uni00A045 'Commitments and contingencies' of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report 2020.\n\n## Changes in government regulations in the jurisdictions in which Aegon operates may affect profitability and operating models.\n\nAegon's regulated businesses, such as insurance, banking, and asset management, are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The primary purpose of such regulation is to protect clients of these operating companies (e.g. policyholders), rather than holders of Aegon shares, capital securities and debt instruments. Changes in existing laws and regulations may affect the way in which Aegon conducts its businesses, including its relationship with distributors of its products and other third parties and the structure of its relationship with employees. These changes may evolve over time and be open to interpretation through judicial and enforcement action. Such changes may also affect/uni00A0the profitability of its businesses and the products it offers. Additionally, the laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may impose greater restrictions on Aegon's financial flexibility and operations or may result in higher costs to operate than currently is the case, including but not limited to financial and accounting requirements; information security, data privacy, transfer, storage, and usage requirements; modeling and other actuarial requirements and standards; investments, reserves, and financial management.\n\nAegon may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to its businesses and legal entities. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws and regulations may result in restrictions on Aegon's ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which Aegon operates and may result in fines and other sanctions, which may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, financial position or results of operations.\n\nCertain key regulatory proposals that could materially impact Aegon's financial condition and results of operations are described below.\n\nRegulatory changes include preventive and corrective supervisory measures that aim to address macro-prudential concerns, referred to in the Holistic Framework for Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector, as adopted by the IAIS in November 2019. Aegon was designated a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII) by the FSB in 2015. The FSB, in consultation with the IAIS, has decided to suspend G-SII identification as from the beginning of 2020 and in November 2022 will, based on the initial years of implementation of the holistic framework, review the need either to discontinue or re-establish an annual identification of G-SIIs.\n\nIn addition, the ComFrame, which was adopted in November 2019 by the IAIS, establishes minimum supervisory standards and guidance on the effective group-wide supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) and builds on the IAIS Insurance Core Principles (a set of principles that is applicable to all insurers). Therefore, IAIGs may be subject to additional standards that other insurers or other insurance groups are not subject to.\n\nOn May 12, 2020, DNB announced, in line with expectations due to Aegon's former designation as a G-SII, that it has identified Aegon as one of the two IAIGs in the Netherlands, based on the size and international activities of the Aegon group.",

Furthermore, such requirements may constrain Aegon's ability to provide guarantees and increase the cost to Aegon of offering certain products resulting in price increases, leading to the discontinuance of offering of certain products or reducing the amount of risk Aegon takes on. Aegon may consider structural and other business alternatives in light of requirements or standards applicable with respect to systemic entities or activities, of which the impact on shareholders cannot be predicted.\n\nAs referred to above, the Solvency II 2020 review covers a broad range of topics of the Solvency II framework. Aegon's insurance subsidiaries, as well as Aegon at Group level is subject to the Solvency II framework. If the technical advice, provided to the European Commission through the EIOPA Opinion on the 2020 review of Solvency II is taken over by the European Commission and the European co-legislators to a significant extent and without material changes, the amendments to the Solvency II framework may have a significant impact on the activities, profitability and financial position of Aegon and Aegon's subsidiaries in the European Union.\n\nIn the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) adopted in 2010 has been challenged in whole or in part since its adoption. Changes to the PPACA and to other laws and regulations impacting the US health insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's financial condition, results of operations, and competitive position. The extent to which employers or individuals may discontinue their purchase of supplemental health insurance products as a result of any such changes may significantly impact Aegon USA's supplemental health insurance products business. The extent of any such changes or the corresponding impact on Aegon USA's supplemental health insurance business cannot be determined at this time.\n\nOn June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (Regulation BI), a new rule requiring broker-dealers and investment advisers to recommend only those financial products to their customers that are in their customers' best interest, and to clearly identify any potential conflicts of interest and financial incentives the broker-dealer may have in connection with the sale of such products. In addition, since the Department of Labor (DOL) Fiduciary Rule was vacated in July 2018, several states have moved forward with developing their own similar rules and proposals, which in some instances substantially broaden the standard of care traditionally owed by broker-dealers and/or insurance agents to their clients. The Biden Administration has indicated an interest in revisiting fiduciaryrelated issues but has not yet made any proposals.\n\nThe foregoing regulations and proposed regulations, along with any future regulations by the federal government and/or states that impose new, heightened, conflicting or differing standards of care or restrictions on broker-dealers, insurance agents, or advisers, could have a material impact on annuity sales and, as applicable, life insurance sales.\n\nChanges in pension and employee benefit regulation, social security regulation, financial services regulation, taxation and the regulation of securities products and transactions may adversely affect Aegon's ability to sell new policies or claims exposure on existing policies.\n\nThe introduction of state-run retirement programs for private-sector employees in the United States could directly compete with private-market retirement plans. More than 30 US states have considered legislation that would establish state-run plans but fewer than 10 states have enacted legislation, and among those, even fewer have actually implemented them. Federal ERISA law raises questions as to whether such plans are pre-empted by ERISA.\n\nIn general, changes in laws and regulations may materially increase Aegon's direct and indirect compliance costs and other ongoing business expenses and have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## Tax risks may adversely affect Aegon's businesses and profitability.\n\nAegon is subject to the substance and interpretation of tax laws in all countries in which Aegon operates or invests. The majority of tax risks relate to both Aegon's products and its businesses, that would materialize due to (i) changes in tax laws, (ii) changes in interpretation of tax laws, (iii) later jurisprudence or case law, or (iv) the introduction of new taxes or tax laws. These tax risks include for example the risk of changes in tax rates, changes in loss carry-over rules and changes in customer taxation rules.\n\nTax risks also include the risk of consequences arising from failure to comply with procedures required by tax authorities. Failure to manage tax compliance risks could potentially leads to inaccurate, incomplete, or untimely tax returns. Materialization of those risks would lead to non-compliance, and potentially increased tax charges, penalties, and interest. Failure to manage reporting risks, may lead to tax positions in financial reporting that do not represent a true and fair view.",

This permits, for example, the build-up of earnings on gross premium amounts with deferred taxation, if any, when the accumulated earnings are actually paid to our customers. Legislators have, from time to time, considered legislation that may make Aegon's products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate this deferral of taxation. This may have an impact on insurance products and sales.\n\nOverall, tax risks may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, profits, capital, and financial condition.\n\n## Judgments of US courts may not be enforceable against Aegon in Dutch courts.\n\nThere is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Judgments of US courts, including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the US federal securities laws, may not be enforceable in Dutch courts. Therefore, Aegon's investors that obtain a judgment against Aegon in the United States may not be able to require Aegon to pay the amount of the judgment unless a competent court in the Netherlands gives binding effect to the judgment, or, if possible, the US investor has brought a successful original action in a Dutch court. Therefore, investors are required to undertake more action in order to enforce a US court judgment than in relation to any US counterparty.\n\n## Aegon may not manage risks associated with the reform and replacement of benchmark rates effectively.\n\nAegon recognizes that the reform of IBORs (Interbank Offered Rates) and any transition to replacement rates entail risks for all our businesses across our assets and liabilities. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 Legal risks, as Aegon is required to make changes to documentation for new and existing transactions, such as funding instruments issued with an IBOR reference and derivatives held with an IBOR reference;\n- \u25a0 Financial risks, arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark rates, such as derivatives and floating rate notes, issued by, or invested in by Aegon;\n- \u25a0 Pricing risks, as changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some funding instruments or investments;\n- \u25a0 Operational risks, due to the potential requirement to adapt informational technology systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes; and\n- \u25a0 Conduct risks, relating to communication with potential impact on Aegon's customers, and engagement during the transition period.\n\nVarious supranational institutions, central banks, regulators, benchmark administrators and industry working groups play a role in the benchmark reform and the preparation for the replacement of IBORs./uni00A0Although a lot of work has been done, there is still significant uncertainty around liquidity development, and the timetable and mechanisms for implementation, including application of spread adjustments to the alternative reference rates. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would affect Aegon. However, the implementation of alternative reference rates may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, financial condition, customers, and operations.\n\n## Aegon may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\n\nAegon relies on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws to establish and protect Aegon's intellectual property. Third parties may infringe on or misappropriate Aegon's intellectual property, and it is possible that third parties may claim that Aegon has infringed on or misappropriated their intellectual property rights. Any resulting proceedings in which Aegon would have to enforce and protect its intellectual property or defend itself against a claim of infringement of a third party's intellectual property, may require significant effort and resources and may not prove successful. As a result of any proceeding in which Aegon would have to enforce and protect its intellectual property, Aegon may lose intellectual property protection, which may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, financial condition and Aegon's ability to compete and pursue future business opportunities. As a result of any proceeding in which Aegon would have to defend itself against a claim of infringement of a third-party's intellectual property, Aegon may be required to pay damages and provide injunctive relief, which may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.",

As a result of these factors, investors may not be able to resell their common shares at or above the price paid for them. In particular, the following factors,\n\nin addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a material impact on the market price of Aegon's common shares:\n\n- \u25a0 Investor perception of Aegon as a company;\n- \u25a0 Actual or anticipated fluctuations in Aegon's revenues or operating results;\n- \u25a0 Announcements of intended acquisitions, disposals or financings, or speculation about such acquisitions, disposals or financings;\n- \u25a0 Changes in Aegon's dividend policy, which may result from changes in Aegon's cash flow and capital position;\n- \u25a0 Sales of blocks of Aegon's shares by significant shareholders, including Vereniging Aegon;\n- \u25a0 A downgrade or rumored downgrade of Aegon's credit or financial strength ratings, including placement on credit watch;\n- \u25a0 Potential litigation or regulatory actions involving Aegon or the insurance industry in general;\n- \u25a0 Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities research analysts;\n- \u25a0 Fluctuations in capital markets, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity markets;\n- \u25a0 The performance of other companies in the insurance sector;\n- \u25a0 Regulatory developments in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and other countries in which Aegon operates;\n- \u25a0 International political and economic conditions, including the effects of terrorist attacks, military operations and other developments stemming from such events, and the uncertainty related to these developments;\n- \u25a0 News or analyst reports related to markets or industries in which Aegon operates; and\n- \u25a0 General insurance market conditions.\n\n## Aegon and its significant shareholders may offer additional common shares in the future, and these and other sales may adversely affect the market price of the outstanding common shares.\n\nAegon may decide to offer additional common shares in the future, for example, to strengthen Aegon's capital position in response to regulatory changes or to support an acquisition.\n\nAn additional offering of common shares by Aegon, the restructuring of Aegon's share capital, the sales of common shares by significant shareholders, or the public perception that an offering or such sales may occur, may have an adverse effect on the market price of Aegon's common shares.\n\n## Vereniging Aegon, Aegon's major shareholder, holds a large percentage of the voting shares and therefore has significant influence over Aegon's corporate actions.\n\nVereniging Aegon holds 32.6% of Aegon's voting shares. For details on the shareholding of Vereniging Aegon, its developments, the Amended 1983 Merger Agreement and the Voting Rights Agreement, please see the section Major shareholders on pages 343-345.\n\nFollowing the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement between Aegon N.V. and Vereniging Aegon, Vereniging Aegon has a call option on common shares B, which Vereniging Aegon may exercise to keep or restore its total stake at 32.6%, irrespective of the circumstances which cause the total shareholding to be or become lower than 32.6%.\n\nAs a matter of Dutch corporate law, common shares and common shares B offer equal full voting rights, as they have equal nominal values (EUR/uni00A00.12). The financial rights attached to a common share B are 1/40 of the financial rights attached to a common share. The Voting Rights Agreement between Aegon N.V. and Vereniging Aegon ensures that under normal circumstances, i.e. except in the event of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon will no longer be able to exercise more votes than is proportionate to the financial rights represented by its shares. This means that in the absence of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon will cast one vote for every common share it holds and one vote only for every 40 common shares B. It is at the sole discretion of Vereniging Aegon if a Special Cause has occurred. A Special Cause includes the acquisition of a 15% interest in Aegon N.V., a tender offer for Aegon N.V. shares or a proposed business combination by any person or group or persons, whether individually or as a group, other than in a transaction approved by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In the event of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon's voting rights will increase to 32.6% for up to six months. Consequently, Vereniging Aegon may have substantial influence on the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.",

In addition, Aegon declares cash dividends in euros, but pays cash dividends, if any, on Aegon's New York registry Shares in US dollars based on an exchange rate set the business day following the shareholder meeting approving the dividend. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the US dollar value of any cash dividends paid.\n\n## Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities (or other securities that permit or require Aegon to satisfy its obligations by issuing common shares) that Aegon may issue could influence the market price for Aegon's common shares.\n\nIn April 2019, Aegon issued EUR/uni00A0500 million Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities ('PCCS'). Upon the occurrence of a conversion trigger event the PCCS will be converted into common shares of the Company at the prevailing conversion price. A conversion trigger event, shall occur if at any time: (i) the amount of eligible own funds items eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement is equal to or less than 75% of the Solvency Capital Requirement; (ii) the amount of own fund items eligible to cover the Minimum Capital Requirement is equal to or less than the Minimum Capital Requirement; (iii) in case the Minimum Capital Requirement is an event, such event occurs; or (iv) a breach of the Solvency Capital Requirement has occurred and such breach has not been remedied within a period of three months from the date on which the breach was first observed. The conversion price was set at EUR/uni00A02.994 per common share and will be adjusted upon occurrence of dilutive events like stock splits, extraordinary dividends or stock dividends, rights issues and others. A reduction of the conversion price will result in an increase in the number of common shares to be issued.\n\nThe PCCS and other convertible securities may influence the market for Aegon's common shares. For example, the price of Aegon's common shares may become more volatile and may be depressed by the issue of common shares upon conversion of the PCCS and/or any convertible securities or by the acceleration by investors of any convertible securities (or other such securities) that Aegon may have issued. Negative price developments may also result from hedging or arbitrage trading activity by holders of such convertible securities that may develop involving such convertible securities (or other such securities) and Aegon's common shares.

Aegon's Executive Board may determine the dividend payment date and the dividend record date for the common shares, which may vary for the various kinds of registered shares. Aegon's Executive Board, with the approval of Aegon's Supervisory Board, may also determine the currency or currencies in which the dividends will be paid. Aegon may make one or more interim distributions to the holders of common shares.\n\nAegon aims to pay out a sustainable dividend to allow equity investors to share in Aegon's performance, which can grow over time if Aegon's performance so allows. Aegon's plans for returning capital to shareholders are based on the actual and expected capital position of its operating units, the expected levels of capital generation and free cash flow and the expected allocation of capital to invest in Aegon's strategy and in the quality of its balance sheet. After investment in new business to generate organic growth, capital generation in Aegon's operating subsidiaries is available for distribution to the holding company, while maintaining a capital and liquidity position in the operating subsidiaries in line with Aegon's capital management and liquidity risk policies/uni00A0in addition to adhering to local regulatory and statutory requirements and restrictions.\n\nAegon uses cash flows from its operating subsidiaries to pay unallocated holding expenses, including funding costs. The remaining cash flow is available to execute Aegon's strategy and to fund dividends on its shares, subject to maintaining the Holding's capital and liquidity in line with its capital management and liquidity risk policies./uni00A0Aegon's Executive Board takes into account the actual and expected capital position of its operating units, Cash Capital at Holding balances, leverage ratios and strategic considerations when declaring or proposing dividends on common shares. Depending on circumstances, future prospects and other considerations, Aegon's Executive Board has discretion to deviate from the aforementioned capital and liquidity measures.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Aegon would expect to declare an interim dividend when announcing Aegon's second quarter results and to propose a final dividend at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for approval. Dividends would normally be paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. The relative value of cash and stock dividends may vary. Stock dividends paid may, subject to capital management and other considerations, be repurchased in order to limit dilution.\n\nWhen determining whether to declare or propose a dividend, Aegon's Executive Board balances prudence versus offering an attractive return to shareholders. This is particularly important during adverse economic and/or financial market conditions. Furthermore, Aegon's operating subsidiaries are subject to local insurance regulations that could restrict dividends to be paid to the Company. There is no requirement or assurance that Aegon will declare and pay any dividends.\n\nHolders of common shares historically have been permitted to elect to receive dividends, if any, in cash or in common shares. For dividends, which holders may elect to receive in either cash or common shares, the value of the stock alternative may differ slightly from the value of the cash option. Aegon pays cash dividends on shares of New York registry in US dollars through Citibank, N.A., Aegon's NYSE paying agent, based on the foreign exchange reference rate (WM/Reuters closing spot exchange rate fixed at 5.00 pm Central European Summer Time ('CEST')) on the business day before the US-ex dividend day.\n\n## The offer and listing\n\nThe principal market for Aegon's common shares is Euronext Amsterdam, where they are listed under the symbol 'AGN'. Aegon's common shares are also listed on NYSE New York under the symbol 'AEG'. Aegon's common shares B are not listed to trade on any securities market.\n\nOn Euronext Amsterdam only Euronext registered shares may be traded, and on NYSE New York only New York Registry Shares may be traded.",

Dividends which have not been claimed within five years lapse to Aegon;\n- \u25a0 Each currently outstanding share is entitled to one vote except for shares held by Aegon as treasury stock. There are no upward restrictions;\n- \u25a0 However, under normal circumstances, i.e. except in the event of a Special Cause, based on the Voting Rights Agreement, Vereniging Aegon will not be able to exercise more votes than is proportionate to the financial rights represented by its shares. This means that in the absence of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon may cast one vote for every common share it holds and one vote only for every 40 common shares B it holds. As Special Cause qualifies the acquisition of a 15% interest in Aegon N.V., a tender offer for Aegon/uni00A0N.V. shares or a proposed business combination by any person or group of persons, whether individually or as a group, other than in a transaction approved by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. If, in its sole discretion, Vereniging Aegon determines that a Special Cause has occurred, Vereniging Aegon will notify the General Meeting of Shareholders and retain its right to exercise the full voting power of one vote per common share B for a limited period of six months;\n- \u25a0 All shares have the right to participate in Aegon's net profits. Net profit is the amount of profits after contributions, if any, to a reserve account;\n- \u25a0 In the event of liquidation, all shares have the right to participate in any remaining balance after settlement of all debts;\n- \u25a0 The General Meeting of Shareholders may, at the proposal of the Executive Board, as approved by the Supervisory Board, resolve to reduce the outstanding capital either by (i) repurchasing shares and subsequently canceling them, or (ii) by reducing their nominal share value;\n- \u25a0 There are no sinking fund provisions;\n- \u25a0 All issued shares are fully paid-up; so, there is no liability for further capital calls; and\n- \u25a0 There are no provisions discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of shares as a result of such shareholder owning a substantial number of shares.\n\n## Differences between common shares and common shares B\n\n- \u25a0 The common shares are listed; the common shares B are not listed;\n- \u25a0 The financial rights attaching to a common share B are one-fortieth (1/40th) of the financial rights attaching to a common share; and\n- \u25a0 A repayment on common shares B needs approval of the holders of common shares B.\n- \u25a0 A transfer of common shares B requires approval of the Supervisory Board of Aegon N.V..",

The resolution requires a majority of the votes cast at the meeting in order to pass.

Notice must be given no later than 42 days prior to the date of the meeting.

This section does not address all US Federal income tax matters that may be relevant to a particular holder. Each investor should consult their tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences of an investment in the common shares. This section does not address tax considerations for holders of common shares subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Financial institutions;\n- \u25a0 Insurance companies;\n- \u25a0 Dealers or traders in securities or currencies;\n- \u25a0 Tax-exempt entities;\n- \u25a0 Regulated investment companies;\n- \u25a0 Persons that at any time hold the common shares as part of a 'hedging' or 'conversion' transaction or as a position in a 'straddle' or as part of a 'synthetic security' or other integrated transaction for US Federal income tax purposes;\n- \u25a0 US expatriates and former citizens or former/uni00A0residents of the United States;\n- \u25a0 Persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the stock being taken into account in an applicable financial statement;\n- \u25a0 Holders that own (or are deemed to own for US Federal income tax purposes) 10% or more of the voting shares of Aegon;\n- \u25a0 Partnerships, or arrangements treated as partnerships for US tax purposes, or pass-through entities or persons who hold common shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities; and\n- \u25a0 Holders that have a 'functional currency' other than the US dollar.\n\nFurther, this section does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or the indirect effects on the holders of equity interests in a holder of common shares. This section also does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any taxation jurisdiction other than the Federal income tax laws of the US Federal government.\n\nThis section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, US Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations, in each case as in effect and available on the date of this Annual Report. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a 'US holder' is a beneficial owner of common shares that is, for US Federal income tax purposes:\n\n- \u25a0 A citizen or individual resident of the United States;\n- \u25a0 A corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States (including the District of Columbia);\n- \u25a0 An estate, the income of which is subject to US Federal income taxation regardless of its source;\n- \u25a0 A trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more US persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of such trust.\n\nA non-US holder is a beneficial owner of common shares that is neither a US holder nor an entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf an entity treated as a partnership for US Federal income tax purposes holds common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding common shares and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the US Federal income tax consequences to them.",

The term 'qualifying profits' includes anticipated profits that have yet to be realized./uni00A0\n\n## US residents\n\nResidents of the United States that qualify for and comply with the procedures for claiming benefits under the Convention between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United States of America for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income 1992 (the US/NL Income Tax Treaty) may, under various specified conditions, be eligible for a reduction of the Dutch dividend withholding tax rate from 15% to 5% if the resident of the United States is a company which holds directly at least 10% of the voting power in Aegon. The US/NL Income Tax Treaty provides, subject to certain conditions, for a complete exemption from, or refund of, Dutch dividend withholding tax for dividends received by exempt pension trusts and exempt organizations, as defined therein.\n\n## Beneficial owner\n\nA recipient of proceeds from Aegon common shares will not be entitled to any exemption, reduction, refund or credit of Dutch dividend withholding tax if such recipient is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such proceeds. The recipient will not be considered the beneficial owner of these proceeds, if, in connection with such proceeds, the recipient has paid a consideration as part of a series of transactions in respect of which it is likely:\n\n- \u25a0 That the proceeds have in whole or in part accumulated, directly or indirectly, to a person or legal entity that would: (i) as opposed to the recipient paying the consideration, not be entitled to an exemption from dividend withholding tax; or (ii) in comparison to the recipient paying the consideration, to a lesser extent be entitled to a reduction or refund of dividend withholding tax; and\n- \u25a0 That such person or legal entity has, directly or indirectly, retained or acquired an interest in Aegon common shares or in profit sharing certificates or loans, comparable to the interest it had in similar instruments prior to the series of transactions being initiated.\n\n## US tax treatment of distributions\n\nThe gross amount of any distribution (including any amounts withheld in respect of Dutch withholding tax) actually or constructively received by a US holder with respect to common shares will be taxable to the US holder as a dividend. Such dividends will not qualify for the dividends received deduction otherwise allowable to corporations. The amount of any distribution of property other than cash will be the fair market value of that property on the date of distribution.\n\nCertain 'qualified dividend income' received by certain non-corporate US holders is taxed at a maximum income tax rate of 20% under current law. Only dividends received from US corporations or from a 'qualified foreign corporation' and on shares held by a non-corporate US holder for a minimum holding period (generally, 61 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the exdividend date) can qualify for this reduced rate. Aegon is eligible for benefits under the comprehensive income tax treaty between the Netherlands and the US; therefore, Aegon should be considered a 'qualified foreign corporation' for this purpose. Accordingly, dividends paid by Aegon to non-corporate US holders on shares held for the minimum holding period may qualify for a reduced income tax rate. Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the applicable tax rate.\n\nIn addition, US holders receiving dividends may be subject to a net investment income tax (NIIT). The NIIT is a 3.8% tax on the lesser of net investment income or the amount of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) that is over a threshold amount based on filing status (USD 250,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding applicability of the NIIT.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nDistributions paid in currency other than US dollars (a 'foreign currency'), including the amount of any withholding tax thereon, must be included in the gross income of a US holder in an amount equal to the US dollar value of the foreign currency calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. This is the case regardless of whether the foreign currency is converted into US dollars. If the foreign currency is converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, a US holder generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend. If the foreign currency received in the distribution is not converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, a US holder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its US dollar value on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the foreign currency will be treated as ordinary income or loss.\n\nDividends received by a US holder with respect to common shares will be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, any Dutch income tax withheld on dividends may be deducted from taxable income or credited against a US holder's Federal income tax liability. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for the US foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to 'passive category income' and 'general category income'. Dividends distributed by Aegon generally will constitute 'passive category income', or, in the case of certain US holders, 'financial services income', which is treated as general category income. Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.\n\nThe amount of the qualified dividend income paid by Aegon to a US holder that is subject to the reduced dividend income tax rate and that is taken into account for purposes of calculating the US holder's US foreign tax credit limitation must be reduced by the 'rate differential portion' of such dividend. Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the implications of the rules relating to qualified dividend income on the calculation of US foreign tax credits under their particular circumstances.\n\nIn general, upon making a distribution to shareholders, Aegon is required to remit all Dutch dividend withholding taxes to the Dutch tax authorities. The full amount of the taxes so withheld should (subject to certain limitations and conditions) be eligible for the US holder's foreign tax deduction or credit as described above. Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the general creditability or deductibility of Dutch withholding taxes.\n\nAegon generally affords shareholders an option to receive dividend distributions in cash or in stock. A distribution of additional common shares to US holders with respect to their common shares that is made pursuant to such an election will generally be taxable in the same manner as a cash dividend under the rules described above.\n\n## Sale or other disposition of shares\n\nUpon the sale or exchange of common shares, a US holder will generally recognize gain or loss for US Federal income tax purposes on the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized from such sale or exchange and the tax basis in those common shares. This gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss and will generally be treated as from sources within the United States. Investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the treatment of capital gains (which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income for taxpayers who are individuals, trusts or estates that have held the common shares for more than one year) and capital losses (the deductibility of which is subject to limitations).\n\nIn addition, US holders with capital gains may be subject to a NIIT. The NIIT is a 3.8% tax on the lesser of net investment income or the amount that is over a threshold amount based on filing status (USD 250,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding applicability of the NIIT.\n\nIf a US holder receives foreign currency upon a sale or exchange of common shares, gain or loss, if any, recognized on the subsequent sale, conversion or disposition of such foreign currency will be ordinary income or loss, and will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. However, if such foreign currency is converted into US dollars on the date received by the US holder, the US holder generally should not be required to recognize any gain or loss on such conversion.\n\n## Passive foreign investment company considerations\n\nBased on the nature of Aegon's gross income, the average value of Aegon's gross assets and the active conduct of Aegon's insurance business, Aegon does not believe that it could be classified as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). If Aegon were treated as a PFIC in any year during which a US holder owns common shares, certain adverse tax consequences could apply. Investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to any PFIC considerations.",

Non-US holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the US Federal income tax consequences of dividends received on, and any gain realized from the sale or exchange of, the common shares.\n\n## US withholding and information reporting\n\nBackup withholding and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments on the common shares and to proceeds of a sale or redemption of the common shares to US holders made within the United States. Aegon, its agent, a broker, or any paying agent, as the case may be, may be required to withhold tax from any payment that is subject to backup withholding if a US holder fails to furnish the US holder's taxpayer identification number, fails to certify that such US holder is not subject to backup withholding, or fails to otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain US holders are not subject to the backup withholding and information reporting requirements.\n\nUS and non-US holders may also be subject to withholding and/or reporting to the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) if they do not provide required documentation and certifications to the appropriate reporting agent. When documentation and certifications are required, they will generally be requested by the appropriate reporting agent.\n\nBackup withholding and withholding under FATCA are not additional taxes. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a US holder or a non-US holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such holder's US Federal income tax liability provided that the required information is furnished to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Investors should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and withholding under FATCA.\n\nIndividual US holders may be required to report to the IRS certain information with respect to their beneficial ownership of certain foreign financial assets, such as the common shares, if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds USD 50,000 and the assets are not held through a US financial institution. US holders who fail to report required information could be subject to substantial penalties. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the information reporting rules to their particular circumstances.",

(PwC) has served as Aegon's independent public accountant for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, for which audited financial statements appear in this Annual Report.\n\nThe following table presents the aggregate fees for services rendered by PwC in 2020, 2019 and/uni00A02018.\n\n## Fees independent public accountant\n\n| in EUR million     |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Audit fees         |     34 |     32 |     37 |\n| Audit-related fees |      5 |      6 |      2 |\n|                    |     40 |     38 |     39 |\n\nAudit fees consist of fees billed for the annual financial statement audit (including quarterly reviews), subsidiary audits, equity investment audits and other procedures required to be performed by the independent auditor to be able to form an opinion on Aegon's consolidated financial statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit or quarterly review. They also include fees billed for other audit services, which are those services that only the external auditor reasonably can provide, and include statutory audits or financial audits for subsidiaries or affiliates of the Company and services associated with SEC registration statements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other documents issued in connection with securities offerings.\n\nAudit-related fees consist of fees billed for audit-related services including assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of Aegon's financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. Audit-related services include, among others, assurance services to report on internal controls for third parties, due diligence services pertaining to potential business acquisitions/dispositions; accounting consultations related to accounting, financial reporting or disclosure matters not classified as 'Audit services'; assistance with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting guidance from rulemaking authorities; financial audits of employee benefit plans; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with internal control reporting requirements.\n\n## Audit Committee pre-approval policies and procedures\n\nAegon's Audit Committee is responsible, among other matters, for the oversight of the external auditor. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy regarding pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services provided by Aegon's independent auditors (the Preapproval Policy).\n\nUnder the Pre-approval Policy, proposed services either:\n\n- \u25a0 May be pre-approved by the Audit Committee without consideration of specific case-by-case services (general pre-approval); or\n- \u25a0 Require the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee (specific pre-approval). Appendices to the Pre-approval Policy (that are adopted each year) set out the audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have received general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. All other audit, audit-related, tax and other services must receive specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee.\n\nFor the period 2018 to 2020, all services provided to Aegon by its independent public accountant were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the Pre-approval Policy.",

COVID-19 social distancing requirements limited volunteering opportunities in 2020.\n- 3 Responsible Investment Solutions (RIS) are investment strategies that go beyond ESG integration to pursue competitive financial returns by incorporating specific ESG or sustainability criteria. In 2019, Aegon AM formalized its responsible investment principles and developed a common terminology. AM's responsible investment solutions span four key categories: exclusions, best-in-class, sustainability-themed and impact investments. This AuM reporting methodology was updated in 2019 and is reflected in the data shown on this page.\n- 4 Please note, there is often no direct correlation between tax reported on earnings for any given year and amounts paid or received in tax. Part of the explanation for this is that certain tax-deductible items are not recognized in the Company's profit & loss statement but directly in equity. Additionally payments and refunds for prior years can impact the amounts paid or received in the current year. The US corporate income tax refund is related to refundable minimum tax credits generated in prior years. Furthermore, the 2020 US tax liability will be satisfied entirely by losses carryforwards and tax credits, including low income housing tax credits.\n- 5 GHG emissions have been calculated based on energy consumption and air travel for the US, the UK and the Netherlands, and extraolated to cover the headcount of our remaining in-scope business units. Under the market-based calculation methodology prescribed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, electricity consumption in the US has been accounted as zero-carbon through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). A significant proportion of electricity consumed in the UK and the Netherlands is procured on a 'green tariff' basis which has also been accounted as zero-carbon. Aegon's operations in US, UK and the Netherlands have been carbon neutral since August 2016 through offsetting our remaining market-based GHG emissions by supporting projects in Brazil, China and Turkey. These offset projects were selected in partnership with ClimateCare.\n- 6 Measurements for previous years not comparable due to change in scope; see Integrated Annual Report 2019 for details of historical measurement.\n- 7 Aegon calculation.

To these ends, this constitutes an integrated report, and has been prepared in accordance with the standards of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Integrated Reporting Framework.\n\nAegon supports the objectives of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and we continue to use those in defining our nonfinancial reporting at a granular level.\n\nWe are also integrating the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting framework herein.\n\nThe basis of preparation for the financial information can be found in note 2 Significant accounting policies on page 159.\n\n## Content and approval\n\nNon-financial content is based on aggregated data collected and reported by Aegon businesses. Content is reviewed by subject matter experts at Corporate Center, as well as the Company's Management and Supervisory Boards before publication.\n\nAegon has not sought external assurance for the non-financial information in this report. This is to allow for further progression in the enhancement of our non-financial data collection and reporting processes.\n\n## Reporting scope and boundaries\n\nNon-financial data in this report covers the full-year 2020 (January-December), unless otherwise stated. All necessary notes, explanations and definitions are provided in the text or accompanying tables. The scope of our non-financial reporting is determined by two factors:\n\n- 1.  The relative size of our businesses and;\n- 2.  The potential impact on overall Group performance or strategy.\n\nConsequently, we focus reporting on our four largest operating segments (Americas, the Netherlands, UK and Asset Management), and include other fully-owned businesses as practicable. We have not included divested businesses, as well as all joint ventures and associates in which Aegon does not have a majority shareholding. For a more detailed overview, see page 425.\n\nAegon reports impact on both its business and its immediate stakeholders (customers, employees, business partners and investors). Where possible, the Company also includes secondary impacts on society, for example local economies, communities and public services.\n\n## Materiality principle\n\nAegon applies the principle of materiality to determine the content and scope of its integrated Annual Report. For non-financial data, the report focuses on information elated to topics the Company believes have, or will have, a significant long-term impact on its profitability, operations or reputation (i.e. the prospects for successful and continued long-term value creation). The principle of materiality applies to both Aegon's own businesses and to the Company's relations with its main stakeholders (see Reporting scope by operating segment, page 425). In determining materiality, Aegon takes into account numerous, wide-ranging factors which may affect our value creation, and as such our long-term growth and returns to investors. This includes potential risks, impact on earnings, brand, reputation, strategy, customer loyalty and recruitment.\n\nMaterial topics are identified through Aegon's 'Business Environment Scan' (BES) process, the aim of which is to identify topics, including opportunities and new and developing challenges, which could have significant impact on value creation and Aegon's financial strength, competitive position or reputation. The scan provides for continued refinement of Aegon's assessment of movement in the opportunities and challenges of the macro-economic environment as they present to the specifics of our business operations.\n\nThe BES is performed on a two-yearly basis with annual updates for significant changes. Topic identification, mapping and selection are based on desk research, interviews with experts and management judgment.",

Our strategy helps us address the material topics that are important to our customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders; this strategy will also strengthen our ability to create long-term value. Aegon has selected six global non-financial indicators; these will be used to assess progress against specific aspects of the Company's strategy (see page 22).\n\n## Additional non-financial data\n\nIn addition to the data in this report, Aegon collects other non-financial data. This includes data on working conditions, use of social media in customer support, consumption of energy and greenhouse gas emissions etc. Further details may be found on the Company's website (aegon.com).",

Mitigating climate change, including the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is a major global challenge. Aegon believes that governments, companies, and investors have a responsibility to mitigate climate change and its impacts, and facilitate a transition to a climateresilient economy.\n\nThe present disclosure builds on earlier disclosures made since 2017. It is made on behalf of Aegon N.V., a global leader in investment, protection, and retirement solutions, as both an asset owner and an asset manager.\n\nSimilar to previous years, it follows the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure's (TCFD) four-pillar framework to facilitate disclosure. Aegon strives to continuously enhance its reporting and business practices and welcomes feedback from stakeholders on the appropriateness and relevance of this disclosure.\n\n## Governance\n\nGlobal governance for responsible business and investment topics is coordinated by the Responsible Business and Investment Committee (RBIC). The RBIC meets quarterly to review and discuss topics of importance to Aegon as a whole - including climate change. The RBIC advises the Executive Board and Management Board. It is chaired by the CEO of Aegon Americas",

The CCWG is tasked with evaluating new climate developments affecting investment, insurance, and our other business activities, and recommending further action when necessary.\n\nThe CCWG meets at least quarterly. It is chaired by a member of Aegon Asset Management's Responsible Investment team and comprises representatives from different functional areas across the Company, including investment portfolio risk management, operational and underwriting risk management, investment analysis, corporate strategy and sustainability, public affairs, and responsible investment.\n\nClimate-related issues assessed as relevant or material by the CCWG are presented to the RBIC through regular reporting. The CCWG also coordinates specific climate-related insight and analysis for the RBIC, including understanding the carbon footprint of investments and providing expert subject matter review of the Aegon N.V. Responsible Investment Policy.\n\n## Strategy\n\nAegon is committed to a responsible way of doing business and seeks to meet the increasing expectations of multiple stakeholders - investors, but also customers, employees, business partners and the wider community. Our Responsible Business vision is to provide financial security and well-being for individuals: a thoughtful approach to secure retirement and healthy aging in our society, and make a lasting contribution to a healthy environment.\n\n## Risks\n\nAegon undertakes a biennial Business Environment Scan to identify macro-economic opportunities and challenges expected to be of high likelihood of occurring and high impact to our business. For 2020 the scan included consideration of climate change and the loss of biodiversity. While direct physical risks from environmental catastrophes and loss of biodiversity to Aegon are expected to be limited, we expect to be exposed to regulatory risks associated with new and emerging market requirements. As a result, we seek to further embed climate and environmental considerations into our business and investment decisions - both to avoid damaging the planet and to safeguard our reputation. See the Business Environment Scan itself for further discussion.\n\nFor our life insurance business, most of our liabilities are exposed to mortality and morbidity rates, both the current levels and the uncertainty around how they will develop over the coming decades. An important driver when assessing the value of our liabilities is how past increases in longevity are extrapolated into the future. Climate change will play a role in this, however there\n\nare many other factors that are expected to be more immediately influential, for example: the current COVID-19 pandemic, medical advancements, limits to human biology and changes in lifestyle. It should also be noted that the relationship between mortality and morbidity and climate change is complex, and the direction of the impact can also vary geographically. Furthermore, it is also expected that climate change will have a relatively lower impact on longevity and health of the insured population compared to the general population, as this group is more affluent and is more likely to be able to better adapt to changing conditions. Taking all this into consideration, Aegon follows widely adopted industry methods where the extrapolation of future longevity is performed solely based on past experiences of mortality and morbidity rates, without separately modelling each of the underlying drivers like climate change.\n\nIn contrast, our investments are exposed to both physical and transition risks. While we expect the transition risks associated with policy and market actions intended to mitigate climate change to be most salient in the near term, the value of our holdings can reasonably be expected to be influenced by both over time. However, previous scenario analysis has shown that our relatively high allocation to fixed income, including government bonds, should limit our overall exposure.\n\nFor our property and casualty (P&C) business, we expect a more direct impact from climate change through, for example, higher claim frequencies arising from an increase in extreme weather events. However, prices for P&C insurance are set in advance for much shorter periods than for life insurance. Prices are determined by closely monitoring past claim frequencies and adjusting the premiums over time while maintaining an adequate level of expected profitability. As a result, it can be reasonably expected that climate change impacts will be gradually considered and reflected in adjusted premiums as the physical consequences of an increase in global temperatures become apparent.\n\n## Case study: Climate risk in the Dutch General Account\n\nAegon Netherlands performed an assessment on the impact of climate change on the General Account asset values and the increase and timing of life and non-life insurance claims. The assessment distinguished between physical risks that arise from more frequent and severe climate events and transitional risks that stem from the process of societal and governmental adjustment towards a net zero carbon economy. In terms of physical risk, while the majority of Aegon Netherlands' investments are in Western Europe and the US - two regions less vulnerable to the impact from physical climate risk - significant mortgage and real estate holdings in the Netherlands does increase the overall exposure to flood risk. While exposure to transition risk is in part determined by the extent to which investments are made in energy intensive sectors such as energy or industry, it is also reasonable to expect some transition risk from non-sustainable real estate exposure - including mortgages. It is the Dutch government's ambition to improve the sustainability of the local housing stock by encouraging all",

If the government decides to expedite implementation of supporting legislation, this could potentially result in lower rated real estate losing market value, thereby increasing the risk associated with a large mortgage portfolio.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nAs an investor, Aegon has an important role to play in supporting the climate transition. By making climate-smart investment choices, Aegon can contribute to a cleaner, healthier environment as well as provide our clients with opportunities to minimize their own climate impacts. Climate change continues to be a focus of Aegon's investment strategy and is guided by our Responsible Investment Policy.\n\n## Case study: Aegon UK Net Zero Commitment\n\nIn early 2021, Aegon UK publicly committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions in their default solutions by 2050 with the aim of exploring the feasibility of reducing them by half by 2030. As a workplace pension provider, Aegon UK is seeking to take a more active position in addressing climate change while supporting the UK Government's own 2050 net zero ambition. To get started on meeting the commitment, Aegon UK has begun working with HSBC Global Asset Management on the creation of solutions that invest in businesses with strong ESG characteristics. The investment philosophy core to these solutions are the 'three t's' which are embedded into the stock selection process. The three t's focus on the targets the chosen ESG index (FTSE Developed ESG Low Carbon Emissions Select Index) has in regard to the parent index. The three targets are: a 20% improvement in ESG rating; a 50% reduction in carbon emissions intensity; and a 50% reduction in fossil fuel reserves intensity. The process also includes a number of exclusions, including specific thermal coalbased exclusions.\n\n## Case study: Aegon Asset Management Ethical Equity\n\nLaunched in 1989, the Aegon Ethical Equity fund is one of the oldest and largest ESG investment offerings in the UK market. The fund is a concentrated portfolio (currently 63 holdings) of UK stocks that excludes companies engaged in unethical activities and integrates ESG considerations in bottom-up analysis. In order to ensure that the ethical exclusions remain appropriate to meet client objectives, the management team formally reviews the ethical criteria every two years through feedback from investors and their advisers. As a result of the last client survey in 2019, the move was made to exclude all firms involved in activities commonly held to be environmentally unsound, in breach of internationally recognized conventions on biodiversity, or in energy intensive industries not tackling climate change - effectively excluding fossil fuel companies from the investible universe of the fund. Although the strategy does not employ an explicit thematic approach to investment selection outside of the pre-defined ethical exclusions, climate change is naturally an important factor for many of the companies considered. Current climaterelated investments include companies involved in renewable\n\nenergy, social and environmental infrastructure, and sustainable materials.\n\n## Case study: ABN AMRO Aegon Global Impact Equities\n\nThe ABN AMRO Aegon Global Impact Equities fund offers a focused portfolio of 40-80 high quality companies with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. The portfolio invests in listed companies globally, including in emerging markets and across sectors. The investment process combines top-down quantitative elements with bottom-up research, including impact assessments and ESG research. The fund deploys an investment approach combining exclusions, positive screening and impact investing. Detailed net impact analysis is undertaken as part of the stock picking process, which aims to identify and invest in companies providing products and services that capitalize on long-term sustainability trends. Climate change is naturally a crucial factor for many of the companies considered; global emissions must quickly decline for the world to stay below its Paris Agreement limits, which will create risks for some companies but opportunities for others. Current climate-related investments include companies involved in renewable energy production and its supply chain, sustainable manufacturing technologies, energy efficiency, building insulation, and the circular economy.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## Identification and Management\n\nClimate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope and severity of potential impacts. 2020 saw no material changes to the overall climate risk identification, assessment and evaluation processes described in previous years' disclosures.\n\n## Case study: Climate Scenarios in ORSA\n\nIn anticipation of future regulation, representatives from the Climate Change Working Group worked with the Risk function to revise and improve a climate change chapter for the Aegon N.V. 2020 Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). In addition to refreshing the content to reflect the latest developments in climate science and regulation, we also undertook an initial look at the potential financial impact of climate scenarios on our investment portfolios. While the specific numerical results quickly illustrated that further investigation and refinement of macroeconomic and portfolio scenario data is required, the overall outcome was encouraging and demonstrated that existing financial risk management processes and tools were fit to analyze climate risk.\n\n## Active Ownership\n\n## Engagement with Corporates\n\nAs an institutional investor, Aegon expects investee companies to work towards reducing their environmental impact. Aegon engages with the companies it invests in both individually and collectively through networks to encourage better climate-related",

The report highlighted the commitment to climate-aligned voting by Aegon Asset Management in the Netherlands on behalf of its clients as one of only three asset managers to vote 100% in favor of climate action-oriented shareholder resolutions. This is illustrative of Aegon's overall commitment to climate action, recognizing both the need for strong concerted action to address the climate crisis as well as the multiple approaches available for investors to affect change.\n\n## Engagement with Policymakers\n\nAegon acknowledges the importance and necessity of government action in addressing climate change. Engagement with policymakers is critical to shaping Aegon's investment environment, and Aegon works independently and in collaboration with industry groups to engage on key climate issues.\n\nAt the European level, Aegon supports the goals of the European Commission's Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth and recognizes the important role that financial actors play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Both individually and through trade groups, Aegon's Government and Policy Affairs team and climate experts have engaged with officials and contributed to consultations on the corresponding sustainable taxonomy and ESG disclosure regulations, the incorporation of sustainability risks into the Solvency II regulatory regime, and the development of standards for the reporting of non-financial information. Aegon has also continued to advocate for action to complete the Capital Markets Union to unlock capital from institutional and cross-border investors to fund sustainable transition projects in Europe.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\n## Own Operations\n\nAegon measures and reports annually on its operational carbon footprint. Our main operations (US, Netherlands, UK and Asset Management) have been carbon neutral since 2016 by reducing their facility-level emissions and supporting offset projects in cooperation with the NGO ClimateCare. In 2019, we extended\n\nthe scope of our offsetting to cover all of our wholly-owned operations. An overview of our total operational emissions can be found in the non-financial data tables (pages 418-422).\n\n## Case study: Aegon Netherlands targets\n\nIn line with obligations under the Dutch National Climate Agreement and the Spitsbergen Ambition, Aegon Netherlands is focusing efforts on measuring and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its business activities. Our operations in the Netherlands have set themselves a target of reducing the per-employee CO2 emissions by at least 50% by 2030 against 2018 levels. We aim to achieve this via multiple measures including improving the energy efficiency of our buildings, making greater use of technology to reduce business travel, and providing employees with more sustainable commuting options.\n\n## Investments and Holdings\n\nIn 2018 we began to measure and report on the carbon footprint of our investments, with a focus on our proprietary investment portfolio in the Netherlands. New for 2020 is the first measurement of our global General Account holdings.\n\nThe figures are representative of the largest asset classes in our global General Account: corporate and sovereign bonds. As a globally diverse investor, the climate impact of our asset mix largely mirrors the regional economies where our business units operate. Business units may provide additional climate disclosure in line with local commitments, requirements and/or regulations.\n\n## Global General Account - Holdings by Asset Class\n\n## Global general account by asset class\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate\n\nSovereign\n\nOther (ABS, etc.)\n\n- Fixed income\n- Other (equity, derivatives, cash, etc.)\n- Mortgages and loans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Aegon calculation.

For sovereign assets, Aegon follows a 'whole economy' approach based on country-level emissions and GDP. Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI) was calculated in line with TCFD recommendations. Carbon Risk for corporate issues is measured using Sustainalytics Carbon Risk Rating, while climate vulnerability for sovereign issues is measured using the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) Country Index.\n\nCarbon footprint metrics are useful for better understanding existing exposure to direct carbon emissions; however, they are only snapshots of performance at a single (past) point in time, and the size of footprint is not necessarily representative of current or future investment risk. Unfortunately, they do not directly capture other climate considerations such as transition or physical risk nor how prepared an issuer may be for the transition to a net zero carbon economy. Reductions in carbon\n\nfootprint or carbon intensity of an investment portfolio may be achieved simply by re-allocating capital to sectors with less direct climate impact - which would not result in any real overall carbon reduction. Furthermore, while exclusionary approaches may be appropriate for activities with no role in a net-zero carbon economy (e.g. thermal coal, oil sands) or as part of specific investment strategies, depriving certain carbon-intensive sectors of capital could limit their ability to reduce emissions - which could be especially harmful to those sectors expected to play a critical role into the future (e.g. steel, cement).\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAegon will seek to continue to improve its climate change strategy, governance, and approach to risk and opportunity measurement and implementation in the coming years. As the Company's experience with climate issues grows, Aegon will look to increase the breadth of disclosures and further incorporate climate considerations across our business as appropriate.\n\noutweighs their financial position.

We will embed in our decision-making environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues/uni00A0relevant to the insurance business.\n- 2.   We will work together with our clients and business partners to raise awareness of ESG issues, manage risk and develop solutions.\n\nFor clients, guided by our overarching Responsible Investment Policy, Aegon Asset Management (AAM) has established a Responsible Investment Framework that reflects these key elements including similar policies put forward by AAM's clients. Our Responsible Investment Framework is structured as follows:\n\n- 1. ESG integration - Material ESG factors are fundamental to our investment decision-making across all AAM portfolios. By integrating ESG considerations into traditional financial analysis, the AAM research team arrives at an independent view of an issuer's fundamentals.\n- 2. Active ownership - We actively engage with investee companies across a wide range of industries to improve their ESG profile and address sustainability issues, often in cooperation with other investors to maximize our influence. We also exercise any shareholder voting rights we have to support our engagement efforts and enhance long-term value creation for all stakeholders.\n- 3. Solutions - AAM provides a range of responsible investment solutions to pursue ESG objectives alongside financial returns. These solutions are categorized into four types: exclusion-based strategies, best-in-class strategies, sustainability-themed strategies, and impact investments.\n\nFor vendors, in 2020, we replaced Aegon's previous Sustainable Procurement Policy with a new Vendor Code of Conduct, which sets out the minimum standards our partners must commit to. This document reflects the consistent approach to responsible business that we aim to foster throughout our organization.\n\nWe have started using SAP Ariba, a vendor lifecycle management platform for registering third parties and monitoring them through data feeds. Moreover, Aegon is an/uni00A0early adopter of Ariba Risk Management technology, which supports our third party risk management processes and enables us to invite vendors to contribute to a risk assessment directly from the Ariba system.\n\nCONTINUED >\n\nESG is integrated in how we operate. Aegon has its Responsible Business and Investment Committee, consisting of relevant Management Board members, Chief Investment Officers and senior management. They discuss ESG matters related to the business and investing on a quarterly basis, and provide advice to Aegon's Executive Board. Additionally, as per our Executive Board's Remuneration Policy, 50% of a member's variable compensation is related to non-financial performance indicators, of which at least one must be ESG-related and clearly support the wider interests of society. New as of January 1, 2021, is the Global Head of Corporate Sustainability function, which was created to further embed ESG into how Aegon operates.\n\nOur public ESG policies and frameworks are available at aegon.com. In 2020, Aegon made a concerted effort to update the Human Rights Statement and the Vendor Code of/uni00A0Conduct, to reflect current best practice.\n\nESG risks are covered by Aegon's risk universe and in 2020 climate risk was more explicitly recognized in the risk universe, given its increasing relevance and the need to manage the impact on Aegon's risk profile. Risk management regularly interacts and cooperates on ESG risks, including climate risk, with the Global Corporate Sustainability Team reporting into the CEO and the Climate Change Working Group (CCWG) of the Responsible Business and Investment Committee chaired by a member of Aegon's Management Board. This is covered in more detail in the Responsible Business section and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section of this report. Of note for 2020 were the recognition of climate change and loss of biodiversity as material topics in the Aegon Business Environment Scan.\n\nThrough our products we offer financial solutions for vulnerable groups in, for example, insurance for people living with HIV in Brazil. We are also working towards more inclusive products via our Qualitative to Quantitative (Q2Q) pilot, which should vastly reduce human bias. From an investment perspective, ESG integration and active ownership are principles we follow across all decisions and portfolios. Aegon Asset Management is a/uni00A0signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nFor more information, please see:\n\nBusiness Environment Scan - page 16; Responsible business at Aegon - page 24; Non-financial policies, procedures and outcomes - page 87; Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework - page 111; Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures page/uni00A0427.",

The EcoVadis  assessment categories are aligned with the standards laid out in our Vendor Code of  Conduct, including key topics such as a supplier's environmental policies and their labor,  human rights, and ethics record. The EcoVadis results can be integrated into our Ariba  platform, creating greater oversight of a vendor's ESG credentials. This partnership  allows us to take a more proactive approach to responsible business. Should the  external assessment reveal that a partner falls short of our expectations, we can work  with them on corrective actions. We believe that this new system for risk management  gives us more comprehensive oversight of our partners' ESG policies, actions, and  results. We are now better able to choose suppliers we can trust, and thus to be a good  corporate citizen, creating sustainable value for the societies we operate in. In 2020,  we/uni00A0decided that we would assess our top 250 vendors by spend (representing 80% of  Aegon's total procurement spend).

We will work together with governments,  regulators and other key stakeholders to promote  widespread action across society on ESG issues. | Aegon has a dedicated Global Government & Public Affairs department, whose aim is to  support regulators and lawmakers. We advocate worldwide for people to have access to  insurance and financial services, for people to be aware of opportunities for flexible  employment in old age and for governments to plan and provide for their citizens in an  age of increasing longevity. Aegon also encourages financial literacy around the world  and engages with individuals and policymakers in service of helping people to achieve  wealth and health wherever we can. Aegon is active in many international projects that  aim to fulfill this goal; for example, an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) working group on the future of work, and the Living, Learning, and  Earning Longer initiative led by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the OECD, and  US-based retirement interest group AARP.

These goals cover poverty reduction, education, gender equality, climate change and health. Behind each of these goals is a series of targets and indicators.\n\nFor our business, we have identified the following targets as strategic:\n\n- \u25a0 SDG1:  No poverty (target 1.2)\n- \u25a0 SDG3:  Good health and well-being (target 3.4)\n- \u25a0 SDG7:  Affordable and clean energy (targets 7.2, 7.3 and 7a)\n- \u25a0 SDG8:  Decent work and economic growth (target 8.10)\n- \u25a0 SDG13: Climate

By doing so, Aegon will attempt to act, where possible, in accordance with the objectives and undertakings agreed in the covenant and will be receptive to commitment, cooperation, and knowledge-sharing during the implementation of the covenant. The covenant is a collaborative initiative of the Dutch government, non-governmental organizations, and Dutch insurers.\n\nThe objective of the covenant is to prevent, mitigate and/or\n\nremediate adverse impacts on stakeholders and the environment, which are caused or contributed by our investee companies. The covenant asks insurance companies to apply investment policies and practices in accordance with the processes and principles of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nAegon N.V.'s Responsible Investment Policy draws heavily on the aforementioned Principles and guidelines. The Policy is instrumental to Aegon's investment practices as are executed by Aegon Asset Management; the Group's global asset manager responsible for managing most of Aegon N.V.'s investments. Aegon Asset Management conducted a global investment screening at the beginning of 2020 to identify investee companies that allegedly breach the Principles and Guidelines, as well as the wider UN Global Compact Principles (or are at risk doing so). On top of this, our screening exercise looked specifically at access-to medicines programs, biodiversity controversies, animal welfare policies, and community rights controversies. Applying these findings, we set the prioritization for our engagement activity, which in 2020 saw Aegon Asset Management start or continue engagements with 75 companies. In most cases, Aegon Asset Management continues the process of engagement until we believe that the portfolio company is aligned with our policies, although exclusion ultimately remains an option.\n\nAs in previous years, good health and well-being (UN Sustainable\n\nDevelopment Goal 3) continues to be one of our focal themes. The outbreak of COVID-19 confirmed our decision to address access to adequate health services and improve access to medicine. To avoid situations in which health emergencies push people into bankruptcy or poverty, we believe it is crucial to strive for universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health. Equally important health issues we address include antimicrobial resistance, better nutrition, and availability of medicine for orphan diseases. Through the engagement activities of Aegon Asset Management, we are addressing the opioid crisis via Investors for Opioid and Pharmaceutical Accountability (IOA) and conducting bilateral engagements with large pharmaceutical companies to improve access to medicine.\n\nMitigating climate change (SDG 13) remains one of our other focus areas, together with clean and affordable energy (SDG 7). Climate change is an inescapable global challenge, representing one of the greatest systemic risks for society. As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the negative effects of global warming are increasingly clear: shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels, frequent and prolonged extreme weather events. All of which have adverse impacts on the livelihoods of many humans and the entire ecosystem. With human activities resulting in about 1\u00b0C of warming to date, achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5\u00b0C-along with the associated Dutch national climate agreement ('Klimaatakkoord') goal of achieving a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 on the way to net zero around 2050-will require focus and dedication. Therefore, we continue to engage with companies in the high-emitting energy, industrial and utility sectors. We must encourage and persuade them to accelerate their journey to net-zero emissions. Not only in the long-term interest of the planet, also because the existence of these companies itself, the jobs they offer, and the future value of our investments are increasingly at risk. Those that do not adapt to this new reality, will eventually be excluded as we phase-out our thermal coal and oil sands investments.\n\nFor more detail on our climate actions, see our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section at page/uni00A0427.

With this consolidation method, diversification benefits in the calculation of capital requirements are allowed.\n\nAcquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. In most cases this includes at least the transfer of risks and rewards related to the acquired business or assets/liabilities.\n\nActuarial funding enables a life insurance company to reduce the size of the unit reserves it holds for unit-linked business to reflect some or all of the unit-linked charges it expects to receive in the future from the units nominally allocated. Actuarial funding is used on those contracts that have surrender penalties and the Company will hold a minimum of the surrender value at all times.\n\nActuarial gains and losses relate to the accounting for post-employment benefit plans. They comprise the effects of experience adjustments and changes in assumptions used to determine the cost of a plan.\n\nAlt-A mortgages relates to a type of US residential mortgage which are securitized home equity loans. Typical Alt-A borrower has a credit score high enough to obtain an: 'A' standing. Alt-A mortgages are primarily backed by loans with fixed interest rates for the entire term of the loan.\n\nAggregation is the methodology by which capital requirements are calculated across different risk groupings, allowing for diversification benefit between the groupings.\n\nAmortized cost is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest rate method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and minus any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectability.\n\nAsset-Backed Securities (ABS) are securities whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or 'backed') by a specified pool of underlying assets.\n\nAssets held by long-term employee benefit funds are part of plan assets. These are assets (other than non-transferable financial instruments issued by the reporting entity) that:\n\n- \u25a0 Are held by an entity that is legally separate from the reporting entity and exists solely to pay or fund employee benefits; and\n- \u25a0 Are available to be used only to pay or fund employee benefits and are not available to the reporting entity's own creditors.\n\nAuthorized Control Level (ACL) is the level US regulators are permitted to seize control of a company.\n\nBifurcation is the measurement and presentation of embedded derivatives separate from the host contracts, as if they were stand-alone derivative financial instruments.\n\nBusiness combination is the bringing together of separate entities or operations of entities into one reporting entity. This can be realized through a purchase transaction or by means of a merger. A business combination involving entities (or operations of entities) under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities (or operations of entities) ultimately are controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the combination, and that control is not transitory.\n\nCompany Action Level (CAL) is the regulatory intervention level at which a company has to submit a plan to its state regulators for the Aegon Americas segment. It is 200% of the Authorized Control Level (ACL) - the level regulators are permitted to seize control of a company. It is a requirement and the most pertinent for measuring risk-based capital (RBC).\n\nCapital funding includes debt securities that are issued for general corporate purposes and for capitalizing our business units. Capital funding is part of the Company's total capitalization that is used for financing our subsidiaries and the cash held at the holding company.\n\nCapitalization is the recognition of a cost as part of the cost of an asset on the statement of financial position.\n\nCash Capital at Holding, which is rather a measure of Holdings liquidity, can be defined as the sum of the Holding company assets, less capital investments, less matched short term assets, less other adjustments. Management of Cash Capital at Holding is based on a similar approach as the management of the Group and Local Unit capitalization, using a range approach and a ladder of intervention to trigger timely conversations and escalating management actions.\n\nCash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\n\nCedant is the policyholder under a reinsurance contract.\n\nClaims settlement expenses are costs incurred in settling a claim. These costs include internal administration and payout costs, but also such items as attorney's fees and investigation expenses.\n\nCollateral is an asset pledged by a borrower to secure a loan and is subject to seizure in the case of default.",

Risk reduction occurs due to the less than perfect correlation among the individual risk exposures in the portfolio, meaning risks will not materialize all at the same time.\n\nEffective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly",
