        "page_content": "## Chairman's statement\n\n## Enabling the world's green transformation\n\nThe decisions our global society takes today, and in the next few years, determine whether we pass a habitable planet on to future generations. Science recommends that we halve global carbon emissions by 2030 to have a chance of limiting the temperature rise to 1.5\u02da C and mitigating the risk of irreversible tipping points in our global ecosystems.\n\nIn 2020, we saw progress. Many governments raised their carbon emission reduction targets and further reinforced their build-out plans for renewable energy production capacity. Several large companies also set targets for their decarbonisation and acted firmly to make their business models more sustainable. Targets and actions by both governments and corporations bode well for our planet, but to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5 \u02da C, even more decisive action is needed.\n\nOur target is to become a fully carbon-neutral company by 2025. In 2020, we continued the build-out of our green power generation capacity both onshore and offshore. We also initiated a range of renewable hydrogen projects. Renewable hydrogen will enable sectors like cement, ammonia, heavy road transport, aviation, and shipping to transition\n\nto fossil-free energy. Like it was for offshore wind, innovation and industrialisation in renewable hydrogen are required to bring down costs, making the new green fuels competitive.\n\nThis year, we divested our downstream retail customer and power distribution businesses, which marks another big step in the renewable energy transformation. Our vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. \u00d8rsted wants to partner with countries and companies, helping them to leave fossil fuels behind, and in 2020, we saw a breakthrough for comprehensive long-term green power purchase agreements.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected everybody in 2020. We are a safety-first company, and during the pandemic, our priority has been the health and well-being of our employees, their families, and the communities which we are a part of. Thanks to our careful and talented staff, \u00d8rsted's operations have remained stable, and our development and construction projects have moved forward according to plan during the pandemic. All employees have adapted impressively to new routines and pushed through with projects, despite sudden and unforeseen obstacles. We will continue to closely follow the situation in the markets where we operate and will continue adhering\n\nto national guidelines and regulations to help minimise the spread of the pandemic and keep our employees and partners safe.\n\nEven in this time of significantly increased global uncertainty, \u00d8rsted's business model has demonstrated its resilience. We were able to raise our financial guidance in March and maintained it throughout the year. EBITDA for the year amounted to DKK 18.1 billion, thereby exceeding our expectations and resulting in a ROCE of 10 %. Profit for the year amounted to DKK 16.7 billion, significantly impacted by the gain from divestment of our power distribution activities. The Board of Directors recommends paying a dividend of DKK 11.5 per share, corresponding to DKK 4.8 billion.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank the employees and management of \u00d8rsted for an outstanding effort during a period of global uncertainty and for keeping us on track towards creating a world that runs entirely on green energy.\n\nI would also like to express special thanks to former CEO Henrik Poulsen for his exemplary leadership in the past eight years during which \u00d8rsted was transformed completely from a financially challenged, regional, fossil-based energy company to a highly profitable global leader in renewable energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur company is stronger than ever and - even more important - has developed a promising platform for continued growth.\n\nWith Mads Nipper on board as our new CEO from this January, we remain as committed as ever to staying at the forefront of the global energy transformation and to offering costeffective green energy solutions and enabling governments and companies to power the world with green energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThomas Thune Andersen Chairman",

        "page_content": "## CEO's review\n\n2020 showed very strong results, both operationally and financially. Although the world is in the midst of a global pandemic crisis, our business model has proved resilient. 2020 also showed great strategic progress.\n\n## Financial results\n\nIn 2020, our operating profit (EBITDA) amounted to DKK 18.1 billion, a 4 % increase compared to last year.\n\nEarnings from our offshore and onshore wind farms in operation increased by 14 %. This was driven by ramp-up of green power generation from Hornsea 1, Borssele 1 & 2, Lockett, Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek and receipt of CfDs of another 400 MW of Hornsea 1 from April. Futhermore, we had higher wind speeds in 2020.\n\nThese positive effects were partly offset by lower earnings from trading related to hedging of our power exposures, which generated very high earnings in 2019, and adverse COVID-19 related impacts. The latter mainly manifested itself in the UK power prices due to a lower demand for electricity. This led to higher balancing tariffs (BSUoS) from National Grid and lower ROC recycle prices. Furthermore, we saw hours with negative prices in the UK from April to July.\n\nWe are on track to meet our target of an average yearly increase in EBITDA from\n\noffshore and onshore wind farms and solar farms in operation of 20 % from 2017 to 2023.\n\nThe divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses resulted in proceeds of DKK 20.5 billion with a gain of DKK 10.9 billion which will be deployed into our global renewable energy build-out plan.\n\nOur green share of heat and power generation continued to increase and reached a new high of 90 %.\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) was 10 % for 2020, in line with our target.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, our Corporate Crisis Management Organisation (CCMO) has met regularly, focusing on the health and safety of our employees and on ensuring business continuity. During 2020, we had 146 confirmed infected colleagues and fortunately no casualties from COVID-19. We continue to do our utmost to keep our colleagues safe across our locations. Our asset base has been fully operational, and we maintained normal availability rates at our offshore and onshore\n\n## Highlights 2020\n\n## Financial/s.ss01\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA) increased by 4 % to DKK 18.1 billion.\n\nEBITDA from offshore and onshore wind farms in operation increased by 14 % to DKK 16.9 billion.\n\n## ROCE was 10 %.\n\n## Op/e.ss01/r.ss01a/t.ss01ion/s.ss01\n\nStable operations throughout the year despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGreen share of heat and power generation increased from 86 % to 90 %.\n\nBorssele 1 & 2, our first Dutch offshore wind farm, was commissioned.\n\nThe onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek were successfully commissioned.\n\nOur Renescience plant in the UK was commissioned.\n\n## Bu/s.ss01in/e.ss01/s.ss01/s.ss01 /d.ss01/e.ss01v/e.ss01lopm/e.ss01n/t.ss01\n\nSigned agreements to farm-down 50 % of the offshore wind farms Greater Changhua 1 and 25 % of Ocean Wind 1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSigned corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs) with TSMC for our offshore wind project Greater Changhua 2b & 4 in Taiwan and with Amazon for Borkum Riffgrund 3 in Germany. The first being the largestever renewable energy CPPA.\n\nWe took FID on the onshore wind farm Western Trail and the Old 300 Solar Center in Texas.\n\nWe acquired and took FID on the solar project Muscle Shoals in Alabama and the onshore wind project Haystack in Nebraska.\n\nWe secured funding for three renewable hydrogen projects, one in the UK, one in Germany, and a joint project consortium in the EU. We also entered into three additional renewable hydrogen partnerships in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, respectively.\n\nWe divested the Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses which resulted in a gain of DKK 10.9 billion.\n\nThe divestment of our LNG business was completed, and an agreement to divest our B2B business in the UK was signed.",

The wind farm deploys 94 Siemens Gamesa 8 MW wind turbines, making it the largest-ever built in the Netherlands, and will supply renewable energy to 1 million households. During the construction of Borssele 1 & 2, we passed a significant milestone by installing \u00d8rsted's offshore wind turbine number 1,500.\n\nIn North America, the 12 MW Coastal Virginia demonstration project, which we have constructed for Dominion Energy as an EPC contractor, was commissioned. The offshore wind farm is the first-ever to receive federal permits and be installed in US federal waters.\n\nWe are installing foundations at our 1,386 MW offshore wind project Hornsea 2 in the UK. At our 900 MW offshore wind project Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan, we are preparing for installation of foundations which will commence in the first quarter of 2021. Both wind farms are expected to be commissioned in 2022 and will become the largest offshore wind farms in their respective regions.\n\nIn December, we signed an agreement to farm down 50 % of the 605 MW offshore wind farm Greater Changhua 1 to CDPQ, a Canadian pension fund, and Cathay PE, a Taiwanese private equity fund. The farm-down is the largest-ever renewable energy M&A\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntransaction in Taiwan and underpins the attractiveness of our offshore wind assets in Asia Pacific.\n\nWe selected Siemens Gamesa as preferred wind turbine supplier for our 900 MW Borkum Riffgrund 3 and 242 MW Gode Wind 3 projects. Subject to final investment decision, both projects will deploy 11 MW wind turbines with 200-metre rotors. In addition, we signed a 10-year corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA) with Amazon to buy 250 MW of the output from Borkum Riffgrund 3. This is our first offshore wind PPA with a global tech company and the largest offshore wind CPPA in Europe.",

TSMC will offtake the full generation from our 920 MW offshore wind farm Greater Changhua 2b & 4, making it the largest-ever renewable energy CPPA. The 20-year fixedprice contract period will start once the wind farm reaches commercial operation, expectedly in 2025 or 2026, subject to grid availability and \u00d8rsted's final investment decision.\n\nIn December, we entered into an agreement with New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) to sell a 25 % ownership interest in our 1.1 GW offshore wind development project Ocean Wind 1. The project is the first large-scale offshore wind farm in New Jersey.\n\nIn March, we entered into an agreement with TEPCO to establish a joint venture company for offshore wind in Japan, with the intention of working towards a joint bid in the first Japanese auction, now expectedly this year.\n\nIn December, we were granted consent to move into the final development phase of\n\nthe offshore wind farm Hornsea 3 by the UK Secretary of State for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. The offshore wind farm has a potential capacity of more than 2.4 GW and is adjacent to our offshore wind farms Hornsea 1 and Hornsea 2, off the East Coast of the UK. With the consent granted, the wind farm will be able to enter the next UK auction round for a contract for difference (CfD), expectedly in 2021.\n\nOur pipeline of US offshore development projects is moving forward, but we are still waiting for the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to decide on the preferred wind farm layout for the buildout of offshore wind for our north-eastern projects in our New England lease areas.\n\nFurthermore, while we are still waiting for clarity concerning the federal permitting process for our projects, there are positive signs that the bottleneck will be resolved imminently. We had expected to receive the 'notices of intent' (NOIs) from BOEM for our advanced-stage development projects\n\nfollowing the release and public comment process regarding the Vineyard Wind Supplemental Environmental Impact Study in 2020. While that did not happen, we are starting to see some promising signs of movement. The timely issuance of the draft 'environmental impact statement' (EIS) on 4 January 2021 for our South Fork project bodes well. So does the announcement of the 'initiation of action notice' (IAN) (a prelude to NOIs issuance) for the Ocean Wind 1 project. All signs from the incoming Joe Biden Administration indicate they will support a timely, predictable permitting regime.\n\nRevolution Wind, Ocean Wind 1, Skipjack Wind, and Sunrise Wind will likely be delayed beyond the previously expected 2023 and 2024 construction years. We have flexibility in the timeline for all four projects, and we have been able to make good progress on other project milestones in the meantime. However, until there is a clear timeline from BOEM, we cannot solidify our construction schedules.\n\nWith regards to South Fork Wind, we remain comfortable with our previously communicated timeline with COD in late 2023.\n\nDespite the permitting delays, we remain confident that we can deliver our US project portfolio with satisfactory value creation, which is supported by the commitment to rapid clean energy deployment from the Joe Biden Administration, the US Treasury's recent announcement of a 10-year continuity safe harbour for offshore wind in addition to a new 30 % ITC level for projects starting construction in 2017-2025, which will help expand tax credit eligibility. We continue to see solid long-\n\nterm growth and value creation potential in US offshore wind.\n\nIn 2020, we made progress towards a greener future based on renewable hydrogen. We continuously pursue opportunities within industrial-scale production of renewable hydrogen, and during 2020 and early 2021, we have secured funding for three projects, one in the UK, one in Germany, and a joint consortium in the EU. We also entered into an additional three partnerships, one in Germany, one in the Netherlands, and one in Denmark.\n\nOur most recent hydrogen partnership was agreed with British energy company bp in November and will comprise a 50 MW electrolyser plant at bp's Lingen Refinery in Germany. The plant is expected to be operational in 2024 and will replace approx. 20 % of the fuel-based hydrogen from the refinery. The project is the first stage towards a long-term ambition to build a capacity of more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen at Lingen. This would replace the entire production of fuel-based hydrogen at the refinery.\n\nFurthermore, we joined forces with Yara, the world's leading fertiliser company, to develop a pioneering project aiming at replacing fossil hydrogen with renewable hydrogen in the production of ammonia with the potential to abate more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\n## Onshore\n\nIn 2020, we saw strong traction in our Onshore business, underpinned by the commissioning of three new wind farms, the acquisitions of two late-stage projects, and the decision to",

        "page_content": "construct another onshore wind farm and a solar farm.\n\nDuring the year, we successfully commissioned the three US onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek, located in Texas, Nebraska, and South Dakota, respectively.\n\nIn July, we acquired the 227 MWac solar project Muscle Shoals in Alabama, US. The project is expected to be commissioned in Q3 this year and will become the largest solar energy asset in the south-eastern US. The project is eligible for 30 % ITC and has a fully contracted 20-year utility PPA. The project further diversifies the geographic footprint of our asset base by establishing a foothold in the rapidly growing south-eastern solar market.\n\nIn September, we took final investment decision on constructing the onshore wind farm Western Trail in Texas. This greenfield project has a capacity of 367 MW and is eligible for 100 % PTC when commissioned, expectedly during Q3 this year.\n\nIn October, we acquired the late-stage 298 MW onshore development project Haystack. The wind project is located very close to our onshore wind farm Plum Creek in Nebraska, also residing in the South-West Power Pool (SPP) area. With the acquisition, we further expanded our footprint into this market which will play an important part in our growth in North America and diversify our portfolio.\n\nIn November, we also took final investment decision on constructing the Old 300 Solar\n\nCenter which is a 430 MWac solar project also located in Texas with 30 % ITC eligibility. We expect Old 300 to be commissioned during Q2 2022.\n\nIn addition, we are currently constructing the combined solar (420 MWac) and storage (40 MWac) project Permian Energy Center in Texas, US. The project is progressing according to plan, and we expect Permian to be commissioned by mid-2021 with 30 % ITC eligibility.\n\nWith the completion of Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek and the addition of Muscle Shoals, Western Trail, Haystack, and Old 300 Solar Center, we now have 3.4 GW of combined onshore wind and solar PV in operation or under construction, and we remain very satisfied with the expansion of our onshore business.\n\n## Markets & Bioenergy\n\nDuring 2020, we continued streamlining our Markets & Bioenergy business.\n\nIn August, we completed the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses to SEASNVE (now Andel). The divestment marks an important strategic milestone for \u00d8rsted, and the proceeds will be deployed into our global renewable energy build-out plan.\n\nIn December, we completed the divestment of our LNG activities to Glencore, and in September, we signed an agreement to divest the vast majority of our UK B2B customer portfolio to Total Gas & Power. We will keep\n\nsome of our strategic long-term partners and customers to whom we deliver risk management products. We expect the transaction to close in Q1 2021.\n\nIn November, we signed a 15-year route-tomarket agreement with SSE Renewables and Equinor to balance power generation from their offshore wind farm Dogger Bank in the UK. The contract is the largest balancing agreement won in a competitive tender process in the UK market. Under the agreement, \u00d8rsted will be responsible for trading and balancing 40 % of the 960 MW generated from the first two phases of the wind farm, when completed in 2026. The agreement will add further scale to our portfolio and underlines our position as a leading green energy trading company in the UK.\n\nIn mid-October, the Renescience wasterecycling plant in Northwich, the UK, was successfully commissioned after passing the final performance test. With the commissioning of Renescience Northwich, we reached another important milestone. We will continue to monitor the plant's performance, while exploring the broader commercial potential of this recycling technology.\n\nIn March, the Copenhagen Maritime & Commercial Court decided to close the action for damages, ruling in \u00d8rsted's favour. The action related to a claimed abuse of a dominant position on the market for wholesale of physical electricity in western Denmark from 2003 to 2006. However, the action will continue in 2021 as the claimants have decided to appeal the case to the Danish Western High Court.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBorssele 1 & 2, near Vlissingen, the Netherlands.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Other significant events\n\nIn 2018, seven bearers of the \u00d8rsted name filed a subpoena to prevent our use of the name. In May 2019, the Copenhagen Maritime & Commercial Court ruled in favour of \u00d8rsted. Following the ruling, the plaintiffs decided to appeal the case. In November 2020, the Danish Supreme Court also ruled in favour of \u00d8rsted, and the case is now closed.\n\nWe are very pleased that the ruling of the Supreme Court upholds our right to use the \u00d8rsted name. It was chosen as a tribute to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, one of the greatest Danish scientists of all time. He discovered electromagnetism 200 years ago and thus laid the foundation for how we produce electricity.\n\nIn December, we received an administrative decision from the Danish Tax Agency requiring Danish taxation of our British offshore wind farms Walney Extension and Hornsea 1. The claim amounted to DKK 5.1 billion, plus interest, in addition to the taxes we have already paid in Denmark. According to the decision, \u00d8rsted is to be taxed in Denmark on the full future value of the two offshore wind farms, despite the fact that they are developed, owned, and operated by British subsidiaries of the \u00d8rsted group and are taxed in the UK. We disagree with the decision which in our view is based on a misconception of the risks and value creation in our business model for developing, constructing, and operating offshore wind farms and have appealed it to the Danish Tax Appeals Agency. Furthermore, we have taken steps to ensure that the Danish\n\nand UK tax authorities initiate negotiations to avoid \u00d8rsted being subjected to double taxation, if necessary, by referring the case to an independent arbitration panel.\n\n## Employees\n\nOur talented people remain the most important assets in \u00d8rsted, and on behalf of the Executive Committee, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank all our employees for the great job they have been doing throughout the year, including how they have all adapted to the new challenges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt is very important for us to attract, develop, and retain the best talent, and we strongly believe in the value of a diverse workforce. We aspire to create an environment where everyone, whatever their personal background, can thrive, perform, and grow. Therefore, we were also pleased to see that the 2020 employee satisfaction survey, People Matter, showed a record-high satisfaction and motivation score of 78 out of 100, placing \u00d8rsted in the top 10 % of our external benchmark.\n\n## New corporate structure\n\nOn 28 January, we announced a change to our organisational structure which will take effect from 4 February.\n\nThe change entails moving from a business unit structure to a more functional structure where the commercially focused functions from the current business units Offshore and Markets & Bioenergy will be brought together\n\nunder the leadership of Martin Neubert who will become CCO, Deputy CEO, and member of the Executive Board.\n\nThe operationally focused functions will be brought together under a new COO as Anders Lindberg has decided to take on a new position outside \u00d8rsted. The COO will report to Mads Nipper.\n\nAs a consequence of the new corporate structure, Morten H. Buchgreitz has decided to leave the company. Both Anders and Morten have done a tremendous job during their tenure in \u00d8rsted, and we owe them great gratitude.\n\nOnshore will remain a separate business unit. The Onshore business differs from the rest of \u00d8rsted when it comes to technological maturity and business model, and we believe that Onshore will be best positioned to realise its full potential as a separate business unit.\n\nWe are making these changes in our organisation to establish an even stronger customer and market focus, to further strengthen the focus on EPC and operations, and to support the scaling of our organisation as we continue our strong growth trajectory in the years to come.\n\nExternally, we will continue to report Offshore and Onshore financials as we do today. This means that Offshore will continue to include our hydrogen activities. Bioenergy, our legacy gas activities, and Renescience will be reported in a separate segment called Bioenergy & Other.\n\n## Concluding remarks from the new CEO\n\nWe are very satisfied with our strategic progress and results in 2020, and I am grateful for the support and professionalism of our customers and partners. I am keenly aware that only together, we can do great things and live up to our high ambitions. We maintain a leading position in a global high-growth market and have built a strong and financially sustainable pipeline, laying the path for future growth.\n\nI am proud of and humbled by the Board of Directors' trust in me to succeed Henrik Poulsen as CEO of \u00d8rsted. Creating a world that runs entirely on green energy is a vision close to my heart. I also want to thank the Executive Committee and all \u00d8rsted employees for a warm welcome.\n\nI am deeply impressed and inspired by the passion and motivation I have encountered throughout the entire company, and it makes me excited for what we can achieve. I am confident that \u00d8rsted can stay a globally leading renewable energy producer, both offshore and onshore. I am convinced that \u00d8rsted, as the world's most sustainable energy company, has the potential to be a global catalyst for systemic change, accelerating the green energy transition and how companies operate.\n\nMads Nipper Group President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, we plan to farm-down a 50 % share of Borssele 1 & 2 around summer. Finally, we will explore the possibility of a farm-down of our solar PV portfolio following the commissioning of Muscle Shoals in Q3. While we have not included any gains from these farm-downs in our guidance, we have assumed a derived reduction in site earnings.\n\nWe had no earnings from new partnership agreements in 2020, while EBITDA from existing partnerships amounted to DKK 1.6 billion. In 2021, EBITDA from existing partnerships is expected to be close to zero.\n\nIn 2020, we divested our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses. These contributed with DKK 0.9 billion to our EBITDA in 2020.\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA), excluding new partnership agreements, is expected to be DKK 15-16 billion in 2021. The outlook is based on the expected development in the business units compared to 2020, as described below.\n\n## Offshore  (excluding new partnership agreements) - lower\n\nEarnings in Offshore (excluding new partnership agreements) are expected to be lower\n\n## EBITDA development 2020-2021 DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Outlook /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf,  DKKbn   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf realised /one.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf realised  excl.

        "page_content": "Expensed project development costs amounted to DKK 1.7 billion in 2020. For 2021, we expect expensed project development costs to be approx. DKK 2.0 billion as a natural consequence of our continued expansion of our footprint.\n\n## Onshore - higher\n\nEarnings from onshore wind and solar farms in operation are expected to increase from ramp-up of generation at Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek (commissioned during 2020) and due to expected commissioning of the new wind farms Western Trail and Haystack, and the solar farms Permian Energy Center and Muscle Shoals during 2021. The latter being net of the assumed reduction in site earnings from the possible farm-down of our solar PV portfolio.\n\nThe increased operational earnings will be partly offset by higher costs related to the strategic expansion of the business and an adverse year-on-year impact from recognition of derivatives.\n\n## Markets & Bioenergy - lower\n\nOur directional guidance for Markets & Bioenergy for 2021 is based on earnings in 2020, excluding the divested Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses. These contributed with DKK 0.9 billion to our EBITDA in 2020.\n\nEarnings in 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure' are expected to be lower than 2020, mainly because the positive effects from revaluation of gas at storage caused by the increasing gas prices, especially during Q4 2020, is expected to partly reverse in 2021.\n\nEarnings from our CHP plants (including ancillary services) are expected to be in line with 2020.\n\n## Gross investments\n\nGross investments for 2021 are expected to amount to DKK 32-34 billion. The outlook reflects a high level of activity in Offshore (Hornsea 2, Greater Changhua 1 & 2a, and our US activities), and Onshore (Western Trail, Haystack, Permian Energy Center, and Old 300 Solar Center).\n\nIn addition to gross investments, significant funds are temporarily tied up in the construction of transmission assets for offshore wind farms in the UK and offshore wind farms for our partners. These funds are a part of our operating cash flow. At the end of 2020, funds tied up in work in progress totalled DKK 9.8 billion. During H1 2021, we expect to divest the Hornsea 1 offshore transmission asset, but we still expect to see a high level of funds tied up in work in progress in 2021 as a result of the continued construction of the transmission assets at Hornsea 2. We expect to divest the Hornsea 2 offshore transmission assets in 2023.\n\n## Ceasing the use of business performance in 2021\n\nWith the implementation of IFRS 9 in 2018, it has become significantly easier to apply IFRS hedge accounting to our commodity hedges. We have concluded that IFRS 9 can replace our business performance principle, and therefore, we will be reporting based on IFRS only from 1 January 2021. This will simplify our reporting and avoid potential conflicts with future reporting requirements for alternative performance measures.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the value of our business performance hedges deferred to a future period amounted to DKK -2.7 billion. This net loss has already been recognised in the income statement under IFRS, as we have not previously applied hedge accounting for these. Consequently, for the period 2021-2025, EBITDA (according to IFRS) will be higher with a similar amount compared to what the business performance EBITDA would have been in the same period if we had continued to report based on this principle.\n\nFor 2021, EBITDA according to IFRS is expected to be DKK 1.1 billion higher than what we would have expected if we had kept reporting according to the business performance principle. The main part of the amount is related to site EBITDA in Offshore. This effect is included in our directional guidance described above.\n\nIn the management's review, part of our interim and annual reports in 2021, we will use business performance as comparable numbers for 2020 for a better like-for-like comparison, while our consolidated financial statements will be reported after IFRS only.\n\nRead more in notes 1.4 and 1.6 on pages 88 and 90, respectively.\n\n## Uncertainties, prices, and hedges\n\nOur offshore wind farms are largely subject to regulated prices, implying a high degree of revenue certainty. This means that we know the price per generated MWh for most wind farms in Denmark and Germany, our first Dutch wind farm as well as the CfD wind farms in the UK. For our British ROC wind farms, we also know the subsidy per\n\ngenerated MWh which we will receive in addition to the market price.\n\nThe part of our generation from offshore and onshore farms and power plants which is exposed to market prices has to a large extent been hedged for 2021. The same applies to our currency risks. The market value of financial hedging instruments relating to our operations and divestments of assets deferred for recognition in EBITDA amounted to DKK 0.1 billion at the end of 2020. This effect is included in the outlook for 2021 (see note 1.6).\n\nThe most significant uncertainty about the operating profit from existing activities in 2021 relates to the size of our power generation which depends on wind conditions, ramp-up of new wind farms, and asset availability.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThe annual report contains forward-looking statements which include projections of our short- and long-term financial performance and targets as well as our financial policies. These statements are by nature uncertain and associated with risk. Many factors may cause the actual development to differ materially from our expectations.\n\nThese factors include, but are not limited to, changes in temperature, wind conditions, wake and blockage effects, precipitation levels, the development in power, coal, carbon, gas, oil, currency, and interest rate markets, changes in legislation, regulations, or standards, the renegotiation of contracts, changes in the competitive environment in our markets, and reliability of supply.

        "page_content": "## A catalyst for change\n\n2020 demonstrated the vulnerability of global society. In the past year, the world was shaken by a global pandemic with more than 80 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 1.8 million lives lost, disrupting all parts of the global economy.\n\nIn parallel with the unprecedented pandemic, 2020 ended as another record-breaking year for climate change as it became the joint hottest year on record and by far the warmest year ever recorded in Europe, while the frequency and severity of extreme weather events continued to increase. In February, the Antarctic hit 20 \u00b0C for the first time ever, and its ice cap shrank to the second-smallest ever. Record-breaking wildfires raged through Australia and the US West Coast, fuelled by longer dry seasons and extreme events like heatwaves. We saw the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, and an unusually heavy monsoon flooding in India and in South and East Asia ruined millions of homes.\n\nThe unprecedented events of 2020 have clearly reinforced the urgency to change the way humanity treats our planet and accounts for environmental and social risks. Climate change threatens to fundamentally change the conditions for life on our planet. The importance of collective action, decision-making based on facts and guided by science, and decisive reactions are more evident than ever. And while it is of essence that the transition to a global green economy happens in balance with our natural environment and societies,\n\nit is critical that we keep momentum. This is a moment for the world to take bold and necessary action. The need to build a more sustainable world has never been stronger.\n\n## How to stay below 1.5 \u00b0C\n\nThe science is clear: We are heading towards an increasingly vulnerable world with complex environmental, health, and economic crises if we do not act now. To meet the 1.5 \u00b0C Paris Agreement goals, humanity must at least halve global carbon emissions during the next ten years.\n\nThe first important stones have been laid to ensure the right conditions for this to happen. Wind and solar PV are today the cheapest sources of new-built generation in at least two-thirds of the world. Since 2012, the cost of electricity from offshore wind has decreased by 66 % and is now lower than electricity generated by nuclear power, coal, or natural gas. So far, 121 countries have committed to net zero emissions by 2050, along with 454 cities and almost 1,400 businesses. Through the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, 33 of the world's largest investors with USD 5.1 trillion of assets under management have agreed on portfolio decarbonisation\n\ntargets to align portfolios with a 1.5 \u00b0C scenario. With the Green Deal, the EU has increased its green ambitions towards 2030, which can help drive further deployment of renewable technologies in the EU.\n\nStill, progress is not happening remotely fast enough to reduce emissions at the necessary\n\n## The EU is defining 'green'\n\nSustainable finance is a critical enabler of the green transformation of industries across the EU and globally. For the energy industry alone, the IPCC estimates a USD 2.4 trillion annual shortfall in clean energy investment through 2035 to meet the 1.5 \u00b0C Paris Agreement goal. Mobilisation and reallocation of institutional and private capital will be necessary to meet this challenge. The global economy remains far from operating at a net-zero level, and emissions are not being reduced by the required volume and pace. At the same time, countries and businesses need to prepare better for a changing climate.\n\nThe EU is preparing a taxonomy to be used as a tool to help plan and report on the transition to an economy that is consistent with the EU's\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npace. Although we saw global carbon emissions fall temporarily in 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdowns and the resulting slowdown of the global economy, these reductions were neither systemic nor sustainable. In fact, supply chain disruptions from COVID-19 temporarily delayed the build-out of renewable energy in the EU energy sector.\n\nenvironmental objectives. Upcoming taxonomy regulation will determine when an economic activity can be considered sustainable.\n\nIn 2018, The European Commission established a technical expert group on sustainable finance which was assigned with developing recommendations on the taxonomy's technical screening criteria for the objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The group's recommendations were presented to the European Commission in March 2020 and generally formed the basis for draft legislation put forward by the Commission in November 2020.\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we plan to align with the taxonomy after the final version is launched by the EU, expectedly in 2021.",

        "page_content": "Limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C will require a structural change of the global energy system as 73 % of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the use of energy, mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels. The 1.5 \u00b0C pathway requires a significant increase in electrification, acceleration of green energy build-out, phasing out of fossil fuels, and increased energy efficiency. The share of electricity in overall energy consumption must increase from about 20 % today to at least 50 % by 2050. The projected rate of the green energy build-out must be more than doubled towards 2030, and coal-fired power generation needs to be phased-out at least three times faster than the projected rate of retirement.\n\nBy a wide margin, climate change is humanity's greatest challenge. Although renewable energy build-out has the risk of impacting land-use and biodiversity, it is critical we keep momentum. The global energy industry has the technologies and capabilities needed to undertake the transformation. Now, it is time to act. It is time to deliver on commitments, to deploy and scale technologies at hand, and to accelerate the transformation to a sustainable society.\n\n## \u00d8rsted wants to be a catalyst for change\n\nOur vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. Every day, we act as a catalyst for the change needed to build a sustainable energy supply. Over the past decade, we have\n\ntransformed our business fundamentally, from being one of the most carbon-intensive utilities in Europe to becoming a renewable energy major and one of the most sustainable companies in the world. We are committed to taking a leading role in the global green energy transformation, and we have set ambitious targets for reducing our carbon footprint.\n\nBy 2025, we aim to be a carbon-neutral company (emission scopes 1 - 2), which we plan to achieve by at least a 98 % reduction in carbon emissions from our energy generation and operations compared to 2006. The remaining less than 2 % will be either eliminated or covered by certified carbon offsets. By 2040, we aim to reach net-zero emissions across our entire value chain (scopes 1 - 3), having a midway target to reduce our scope 3 emissions by 50 % by 2032. Our carbon reduction targets are confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative to be consistent with the reductions required by energy companies to keep global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C and are the most ambitious science-based targets in our sector.\n\nIn 2020, we made significant progress towards these targets with green energy build-out and scaling-up of new technologies, including renewable hydrogen. During the year, we added 1.4 GW of installed renewable energy capacity in onshore and offshore wind, adding up to our total of 11.3 GW.

        "page_content": "## Our contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe year 2020 reinforced the global realisation of people, businesses, and nature being interconnected and interdependent. Experiences of the past year clarified the need to deliver on the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which address the key economic, social, and environmental challenges the world faces and acts as a global framework for achieving a more sustainable future.\n\nWe acknowledge that the resilience and long-term success of \u00d8rsted's business directly depend on us supporting a global society that is in balance with the resources of our planet, protecting natural habitats and local communities as much as economic growth. To sustain our long-term value creation, we ensure that our green energy build-out is executed sustainably through a systematic and programmatic approach to sustainability. We seek to strengthen the positive impacts and to mitigate and avoid potential negative impacts derived from our core business activities and a global green transition.\n\nWith our core business, we aspire to have a transformative impact on SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on climate action. Moreover, we indirectly impact several other SDGs, especially those listed to the right.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCatalysing the green energy transformation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAddressing the sustainability impacts of the green energy transformation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe report on our SDG contributions and impacts and all our 20 sustainability programmes in our sustainability report, orsted.com/sustainability2020. A full ESG data overview and our accounting policies are available in our annual ESG performance report, orsted.com/ESGperformance2020.\n\nTogether, the two reports constitute our annual Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact and comply with the requirements for corporate social responsibility reporting set out in section 99 a of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as section 99 b on gender distribution and section 107 d on diversity at management levels.\n\n(scopes 1 and 2) decreased in 2020 by 11 %. However, 2020 showed an increase in \u00d8rsted's absolute carbon emissions due to a temporary increase in our use of coal of 13 % at our Danish power plants. Our service obligations in Denmark require us to provide ancillary services that help grid operators maintain a reliable electricity system. This sometimes requires the use of coal to ensure a stable supply of energy. Our commitment to end our use of coal by 2023 remains unchanged, and we are on track towards this goal. Until then, however, we may see fluctuations in coal consumption,\n\ndriven by market and weather conditions.\n\nThe next frontier in our journey towards net-zero emissions in our total carbon footprint by 2040 is to gradually phase out our supply of gas from long-term gas contracts and to decarbonise our supply chain. Therefore, we allow existing long-term gas contracts to expire gradually and do not enter into new contracts. Across our supply chain, we are committed to reaching beyond our own emissions and to working with our suppliers to gradually remove carbon emissions. Thus, we encourage our strategic suppliers to: 1) disclose their emissions and set science-based targets aligned with a 1.5 \u00b0C scenario, 2) use 100 % green electricity in the manufacturing of wind turbines, foundations, cables, and substations by 2025, 3) optimise their vessel fleets and develop a roadmap towards powering vessels with renewable energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe launched our supply chain decarbonisation programme a year ago. During this first year, we have focused on building the foundation and management structure to drive our programme and have begun to engage with our strategic offshore wind suppliers on the decarbonisation journey ahead. The offshore wind supply chain today includes carbon intensive activities, particularly the use of energy-intensive construction materials, such as steel, aluminium, and copper, as well as fuel for offshore construction vessels. As part of our dialogue with our top strategic suppliers, including wind turbine, foundation, and cable manufacturers, we support them in building solid and uniform carbon accounting policies and data capture by utilising the CDP reporting framework. Based on this solid foundation, we will work with our suppliers over the coming years to establish emission reduction roadmaps and targets supporting our overall strategic targets.",

Our strategic ambition is to further strengthen our position in North America by building a diverse onshore wind and solar PV portfolio. In addition, we continue to monitor onshore growth opportunities in Europe and Asia Pacific.\n\nWe see increasing political support in Europe for the development of renewable hydrogen. When produced with renewable power, hydrogen offers a solution for decarbonising industries such as ammonia, steel, refining, and\n\nheavy transport where direct electrification is difficult or impossible. However, renewable hydrogen is currently not cost-competitive with fossil-based alternatives. Significant challenges must be overcome to create and scale a hydrogen market, requiring action from both policymakers and companies.\n\n\u00d8rsted has established a pipeline of eight renewable hydrogen projects in Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. In January 2021, we took FID on our first renewable hydrogen project, marking the beginning\n\nof a new phase in \u00d8rsted's green transformation journey. We see growth potential in renewable hydrogen and are pursuing scale-up opportunities as we execute on our pipeline.\n\nOur growth platform in offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar PV, and our growth potential in renewable hydrogen provide a solid foundation for realising our aspiration of becoming a global green energy major.",

        "page_content": "## Our markets and strategy\n\nGlobal demand for renewable energy is increasing. We are wellpositioned to tap into this growth and are on track to maintain our undisputed leadership position in offshore wind as we continue to strengthen our position in onshore wind and solar PV.\n\nGlobal installed renewable capacity is expected to exceed 4 TW in 2030, more than double today's capacity. Offshore wind, onshore wind, and large-scale solar PV are expected to grow towards 2030 by 19 %, 11 %, and 9 % per year, respectively. This reflects increasing demand for electricity worldwide, ambitious government decarbonisation programmes, and the cost-competitiveness of renewable technologies - many of which still have not fully matured.\n\nSo far, renewables have proved resilient to the impacts of COVID-19 compared to other sectors, and long-term capacity forecasts have remained stable. Bloomberg New Energy Finance's (BNEF) post-COVID-19 2030 forecast for renewable capacity fell by just 1 % relative to last year's forecast. In the short term, some delays to renewable energy projects are anticipated; however, growth is expected to resume in 2021 as delayed projects come online. We also see COVID-19 recovery packages adding new impetus to green transitions in some markets. Most notable is the European Commission's EUR 750 billion package which focuses on decarbonising buildings, supporting growth in renewable power, and accelerating investment into renewable hydrogen and clean transport. However, it is currently not possible to know the long-term impact of COVID-19.\n\nAcross our markets, we are experiencing growing demand from companies for corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs). CPPAs\n\n## Global renewable energy capacity by technology 1 GW installed\n\n## CAGR\n\n- 19 % offshore wind\n- 13 % small-scale PV\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 9 % onshore wind\n- 2 % biomass\n- 11 % large-scale PV\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhave long been an important part of doing business in onshore wind and solar PV, and in 2020, we signed over 700 MW of CPPAs with five different customers across four US projects. \u00d8rsted is also playing a key role in developing the global CPPA market for offshore wind, with several landmark agreements in 2020. In July, \u00d8rsted and Taiwan-based TSMC signed a 20-year contract, under which TSMC will offtake the full production of \u00d8rsted's 920 MW offshore wind farm Greater Changhua 2b & 4, making it the world's largest renewables CPPA. In December, we signed a 10-year CPPA with Amazon who will offtake 250 MW of Borkum Riffgrund 3 Offshore Wind Farm's total capacity of 900 MW. This is Europe's largest CPPA to date.\n\nCompetition within the renewables industry is intensifying due to the significant growth opportunities ahead. New competitors have entered the market, oil majors have announced significant renewable energy ambitions, and leading utilities are reshaping and expanding their renewable portfolios. We welcome the increasing involvement of new and existing players as the build-out of renewable energy must accelerate if we are to halve global emissions by 2030 in line with the Paris Agreement. We continue to see many profitable growth opportunities and remain confident that we will meet the strategic ambition set in November 2018 of installing more than 30 GW of renewable capacity by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Excludes solar thermal, geothermal, marine, tidal, and others which combined account for less than 1 % of capacity.\n\nSource: BNEF New Energy Outlook 2019 for pre-COVID-19 2030 forecast and BNEF New Energy Outlook 2020 for 2020 capacity and post-COVID-19 2030 forecast for all technologies except offshore wind.

The UK is our largest market, and we currently operate 15 offshore wind farms in British waters.\n\n## Continental Europe\n\nOffshore wind build-out is expected to accelerate in Continental Europe, driven by the European Commission's European Green Deal and offshore renewable energy strategy. In the latter, the commission has set an objective of installing 60 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and 300 GW by 2050 within the EU 27 to meet the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAt the country level, ambitions are also growing. Denmark, Germany, and Poland raised their renewable and offshore wind targets in 2020. BNEF estimates that European offshore wind capacity will grow from 14 GW today to 64 GW by 2030, exeeding the EU's goal.\n\n\u00d8rsted has a strong position in Continental Europe. We are the largest offshore wind player with a market share of 23 % of installed capacity. Our operating portfolio totals 3.1 GW, and we have been awarded 1.1 GW in Germany. We have a strong market position in all major offshore wind markets in addition to significant partnership experience and an extensive industry network across Continental Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTargets are subject to change and indicate installed capacity, unless otherwise noted.\n\n- /uni00B9 Lithuania has drafted a law to tender 700 MW of offshore wind by 2023.

Asia Pacific has 0.4 GW of installed capacity today, but is expected to reach 36 GW by 2030, mostly driven by build-out in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. Taiwan has met its target of awarding 5.5 GW to be commissioned by 2025 and has released a draft auction guideline for the next 10 GW planned for construction between 2026 and 2035. Japan set new offshore wind targets in December 2020 and is now aiming for 10 GW\n\nby 2030 and 30 to 45 GW by 2040. Achieving these goals would make Japan one of the largest offshore wind markets in the world. South Korea has announced it plans to build 12 GW of offshore wind to reach its aim of 20 % renewables in its energy mix by 2030 and up to 35 % by 2040.\n\n\u00d8rsted is well-positioned to expand in Asia Pacific. We are the number one offshore wind player, excluding mainland China, with 0.1 GW of capacity in operation, 0.9 GW of capacity under construction, and 0.9 GW of capacity awarded.

In July, the European Commission launched the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance with the target of building 6 GW of electrolyser capacity by 2024 and up to 40 GW by 2030. The commission has an ambition of making Europe a global frontrunner within renewable hydrogen, and we expect this ambition to create additional growth opportunities for \u00d8rsted, if policies and regulatory incentives make projects economically viable.\n\nOur pipeline focuses on the application of renewable hydrogen in refinery processes,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nammonia production, and fuel production for trucks, buses, vessels, and planes. With the FID on the H2RES project in January, \u00d8rsted has 2 MW of electrolyser capacity under construction. The facility will produce renewable hydrogen to be used as fuel in road transport and will provide important learnings to help turn Europe's ambitious targets into reality.",

        "page_content": "## Onshore\n\n## The North American onshore wind and solar PV markets\n\nOnshore renewable energy is the largest non-fossil energy source in the world. Onshore wind and large-scale solar PV accounted for 75 % of installed renewable capacity and 77 % of new capacity additions worldwide in 2020.\n\nIn North America, onshore wind is the leading renewable technology. It reached 134 GW of installed capacity by the end of 2020 and is expected to continue growing by 5 % per year towards 2030. Large-scale solar PV comes in second at 57 GW and is expected to accelerate towards 2030 at an annual rate of 10 %. The strong growth in solar PV is fuelled by its ability to cost-effectively replace retiring fossil-fuelled power stations across much of the western, central, and south-eastern US. In addition, companies are signing more solar CPPAs as they look to procure energy from different technologies in order to supply their operations 24/7 with clean energy.\n\n## Our ambition and strategic focus in onshore wind and solar PV\n\nOur Onshore business gained strong traction in 2020. \u00d8rsted is now among the five largest constructors in the US when measured by new capacity additions. Last year, we commissioned the onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek and took final investment decisions on the onshore wind farms Western Trail and Haystack. This makes our onshore wind portfolio one of the fastest growing in the US, and we rank fourth in annual MW installed last year. Furthermore,\n\nthe acquisition of Muscle Shoals and the final investment decision on Old 300 Solar Center strengthened our North American solar PV platform. \u00d8rsted is currently ranked second in the US in terms of large-scale solar PV under construction. Our Onshore portfolio of assets installed and under construction now totals 3.4 GW, of which 2.3 GW is onshore wind and 1.1 GW is solar PV.\n\nWe also have 40 MWac of battery storage under construction in connection with the Permian Energy Center. We view energy storage as a complement to our renewables portfolio, and we continue to pursue storage projects that allow us to optimise our generation assets.\n\nWe are well on track to meet our target of 5 GW of installed capacity by 2025. When the Permian Energy Center comes online this year, we will have established a full-spectrum renewable portfolio in the US, spanning solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind, and battery storage. Our strategic ambition is to build a strong North American position in onshore wind and solar PV. Onshore expansion is also part of our strategy, and we are actively seeking growth opportunities outside North America. Our initial focus is on Europe, but we continue to monitor opportunities in Asia Pacific.\n\nGoing forward, we aim to further diversify our onshore investments across markets and across our portfolio of technologies. This will allow us to offer new, global solutions to customers by taking advantage of complementary generation profiles, while reducing our risk exposure. In addition, we continue driving operational excellence,\n\n## Onshore capacity build-out towards /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/five.tf, MW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconstruction\n\n- 1 Permian Energy Center consists of 420 MWac solar PV capacity and 40 MWac of battery storage.\n\nreducing LCoE, and working to secure tax equity financing for our projects in the medium term.\n\nLong-term, we are focused on securing power purchase agreements to ensure solid economics after the phase out of the production tax credit and the investment tax credit for wind and solar PV projects, respectively. We will also continue developing the capabilities of our US-based trading unit which manages risk and protects the value of our US generation portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 North America includes the US and Canada.

It provides an efficient route-to-market for commodities, including power and green certificates, for \u00d8rsted and for third parties. Furthermore, it manages market risks for \u00d8rsted's generation portfolio. The business unit is also responsible for operating, optimising, and decarbonising our portfolio of CHP plants and for optimising our gas portfolio. Finally, Markets & Bioenergy is responsible for the operation of our waste-recycling plant, Renescience Northwich, which was commissioned in October 2020.\n\nThe variable generation profiles of renewable assets do not always match short-term forecasts, and the difference needs to be balanced as power enters the market. Markets & Bioenergy supports \u00d8rsted's generation activities by providing an efficient route-to-market, including balancing services, and seeks out opportunities to offer these services to third parties.\n\nConstantly fluctuating commodity prices and changing market conditions require strong risk management capabilities to protect the value of \u00d8rsted's generation portfolio. Markets & Bioenergy meets this challenge through the development and deployment of state-ofthe-art risk monitoring and management tools for an expanding set of market risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur portfolio of CHP plants continues to play a critical role in Denmark's heat and power systems and supports the green transformation by providing dispatchable power with a low carbon footprint. We have completed the planned conversions of our coal-fired units to renewable biomass and continue to source third-party certified sustainable biomass in line with Denmark's newly announced regulations. We are targeting full carbon neutrality in our CHP operations by 2025. This includes the planned closure of our last coal-fired power station in Esbjerg, Denmark, in 2023 and the implementation of offset projects for our CHP portfolio's remaining carbon footprint.\n\nNatural gas is a fossil fuel and should be gradually phased out of the energy mix. Consequently, we neither enter into new longterm gas sourcing contracts nor prolong expiring contracts. Our focus is on maximising the value of our legacy natural gas portfolio through trading, contract negotiations, and portfolio optimisation.",

We have invested DKK 50 billion over the course of 2019 and 2020, primarily in Offshore and Onshore construction activities which total DKK 35 billion and DKK 13 billion, respectively.\n\nWe allocate capital according to the following principles in order of priority. First, we adhere to our strong commitment to our credit ratings (BBB+/Baa1). Second, we intend to increase our dividend by a high single-digit rate annually until 2025. Third, we invest in value-creating growth opportunities. Finally, potential excess capital will be returned to our shareholders in the form of additional dividends and/or share buy-backs.\n\nThe uncertainty concerning the economic impact of COVID-19 caused turbulence in financial markets in the spring of 2020. However, \u00d8rsted's conservative approach to liquidity management allowed us to weather\n\nthe crisis, and we completed our scheduled funding activities as planned. In November, we issued 15 billion in NTD-denominated bonds. Furthermore, we completed the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses in August 2020, freeing up DKK 20.5 billion for investment in our growth platform.\n\nSince 2017, all new capital has been issued in a green format in accordance with our Green Finance Framework. With this year's debt issuances, our total outstanding debt, excluding hybrids, amounted to DKK 37.1 billion, of which more than 51 % was issued in a green format.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBurbo Bank Extension, Liverpool Bay, the UK.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our strategic enablers\n\nAchieving our aspiration of becoming a global green energy major requires continuously strengthening our organisation in three key areas: talent, digitalisation, and innovation.\n\n## Talent\n\nTalent has been the cornerstone of \u00d8rsted's transformation, and we will continue needing exceptional people with the right values as we grow our business and expand our geographical footprint. We want to be a global green energy major - powered by talent. Thus, we have a strong focus on employer branding, talent acquisition, inclusion, and well-being as well as the identification, development, and deployment of diverse talent around the world.\n\nIn 2020, we made significant progress on our talent ambition. We improved our positioning in the Universum employer branding rankings for Denmark. For example, \u00d8rsted moved from 25th place in 2018 to seventh place in 2020 for experienced business professionals, with comparable changes in other candidate segments. We were also listed in FastCompany's Best Workplaces for Innovators for the first time the only company with a European HQ in the top 20. As a result of such branding, and with increased focus on recruiting best-in-class, diverse talent, we hired and onboarded over 1,300 new employees around the world.\n\nIn addition, we launched our first Global Learning Week which was accessed by\n\nthousands of employees. Usage of digital learning content in our learning management system has increased more than tenfold since 2018. We also delivered virtual learning programmes for all managers to enable them to support career development in their teams.\n\nFinally, to ensure our culture is inclusive of diversity and supports our global growth, we surveyed all employees to understand their sense of opportunities and challenges in this area. The data gathered informs our focus on ensuring equal opportunities, cultivating psychological safety, and building inclusive virtual workplaces. \u00d8rsted's Executive Committee has set targets for gender balance in all levels of the organisation and for the multicultural mix in our leadership team.\n\n## Digitalisation\n\nDigitalisation is a key enabler of value creation at \u00d8rsted. We systematically deploy a variety of digital technologies to streamline business processes to develop data-driven business cases, to drive state-of-the-art energy market and risk management, and to improve the design, construction, operations, and maintenance of our assets.\n\nFor example, \u00d8rsted is using advanced data analytics and machine learning to achieve operations and maintenance cost reductions as well as annual energy production uplift. Calendar-based maintenance schedules are being substituted for a data-driven  approach. This way, if an asset does not require physical maintenance at the scheduled time and can be inspected remotely, we avoid unnecessary costs.\n\nWe also utilise wind turbine data to continuously correct wind turbine yaw and pitch alignment. When aligned correctly into the wind, a wind turbine produces more electricity and is subject to less wear and tear over time. This increases the lifetime of the asset and reduces the lifetime maintenance cost.\n\nFinally, we utilise algorithm-assisted power market trading in Continental Europe and the UK. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the frequency of trades and a decrease in the average tick size, leading to power trading at super-human speed. Digital capabilities enable us to create value in fast-moving commodity markets by securing good prices for the inherently long position \u00d8rsted has within power generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEast Coast Hub at the Port of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, the UK.",

The willingness to challenge the notion of what is possible and the ability to identify opportunities and to innovate our way around challenges were instrumental in our strategic transformation. These competences are also what allow us to\n\nmaintain our leadership position in the rapidly growing renewables market.\n\nFor example, we spearheaded the first commercial deployment of 66 kV array cables for an offshore asset project in 2020 at our Borssele 1 & 2 Offshore Wind Farm. Previously, 33 kV array cables were considered state-ofthe-art. \u00d8rsted challenged this idea, and we succeeded in marshalling support from our peers and supply chain for the development and implementation of the new cables, reducing losses and ensuring optimal substation design. The next step is the development of 132 kV array cables which will be needed to maximise the potential of the next generation of wind turbines with ratings of 15 MW or more.\n\nIn addition to pushing the boundaries of what is technically feasible, we are rethinking the deployment of renewable generation and transmission assets to support the green transition of Europe's energy system. The Danish parliament has decided to develop an offshore wind hub of 2 GW by 2030 off the coast of Bornholm, a Danish island in the Baltic Sea, with the potential of connecting Denmark, Poland, Sweden, and Germany\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand of supporting the large-scale production of renewable hydrogen. We are engaged in ongoing dialogues with all stakeholders on how to expand the hub's potential and how to ensure timely progress. This new energy hub represents the next step in technological scale and innovation and is key to unlocking the enormous potential of offshore wind.\n\nFinally, we continue to explore new products and technologies, focusing on the development and launch of combined technologies for Power-to-X. In 2020, we joined forces with a group of leading Danish companies, representing both suppliers and buyers of sustainable fuels, in the Green Fuels for Denmark partnership which aims to develop a ground-breaking hydrogen and e-fuels production facility with the first phase in operation as soon as 2023. When fully scaled up by 2030, the project will deliver more than 250,000 tonnes of sustainable fuel every year for buses, trucks, vessels, and planes. Production will be based on a total electrolyser capacity of 1.3 GW, which will likely make it one of the largest facilities in the world of its kind.",

        "page_content": "## Results\n\n## Financial results\n\n## Revenue\n\nPower generation from offshore and onshore wind increased by 35 % and totalled 20.9 TWh in 2020, mainly due to ramp-up of generation from Hornsea 1, Borssele 1 & 2, Lockett, Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek as well as higher wind speeds, mainly in Q1 2020. This was partly offset by periods with negative prices due to a lower demand for electricity driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led us to temporarily shut down generation.\n\nThermal power generation amounted to 4.4 TWh, a 4 % decrease compared to last year due to slightly warmer weather and less favourable market conditions for power generation, partly offset by a higher volume from ancillary services. Heat generation amounted to 6.7 TWh, down 20 % compared to last year, mainly due to a warm first quarter in 2020.\n\nOffshore and onshore wind accounted for 83 % of our total power generation, up 6 percentage points from last year.\n\nRevenue amounted to DKK 52.6 billion. The decrease of 22 % relative to 2019 was primarily due to limited construction works on wind farms for partners, significantly lower gas and power prices relative to last year, lower sales of gas, and lower thermal heat and power generation, partly offset by the increase in wind-based power generation.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA) totalled DKK 18.1 billion compared to DKK 17.5 billion in 2019.\n\nEarnings from offshore and onshore wind farms in operation amounted to DKK 16.9 billion. The 14 % increase relative to 2019 was due to the above-mentioned ramp-up of new wind farms in operation, receipt of CfDs of another 400 MW of Hornsea 1 from April, and higher wind speeds. This was partly offset by adverse COVID-19 impacts of approx. DKK 400 million on especially the UK power market due to a lower demand for electricity, which led to hours with negative prices from April to July, lower ROC recycle prices, and higher balancing tariffs (BSUoS) from National Grid in 2020, and by lower earnings from trading related to hedging of our power exposures which achieved very high results in 2019.\n\nEarnings from construction agreements for partners totalled DKK 1.6 billion compared to DKK 3.8 billion in 2019. In 2020, our earnings from construction agreements mainly related to the lowered assumptions regarding the preferred bidder's expected return requirement on the Hornsea 1 transmission asset, the construction of Coastal Virginia Wind, and minor updates regarding finalised construction projects. In 2019, earnings from construction agreements primarily concerned Hornsea 1.\n\nEBITDA from CHP plants amounted to DKK 1.1 billion, slightly below last year.\n\nThe decrease was mainly due to lower thermal heat and power generation and lower power spreads as well as the reversal of a provision in 2019 of DKK 0.3 billion following the acquittal in the Elsam case. This was partly offset by higher earnings from sale of ancillary services in 2020.\n\nstorage hedges were offset by lower transported and sold volumes due to the shutdown of the Tyra gas field from late 2019 until 2022 as well as a provision for bad debt in our B2B business to cover the extraordinary COVID-19related default risks among our customers.\n\nEBITDA from our gas activities were in line with last year.

Apart from this, there is no difference between business performance and the IFRS results.\n\nEBITDA in accordance with IFRS amounted to DKK 16.6 billion in 2020 against DKK 19.0 billion in 2019. In accordance with the business performance principle, EBITDA was DKK 18.1 billion and\n\nDKK 17.5 billion, respectively. The difference between the two principles was thus DKK -1.5 billion in 2020 against DKK 1.5 billion in 2019.\n\nIn the presentation of the results according to IFRS, we have elected not to apply the provisions on hedge accounting of commodities and related currency exposures. The market value adjustments of these are continuously recognised in the income statement, which means that the IFRS results for the individual years are not comparable. IFRS results do not reflect the commercial risk hedging, according to which the business units and the Group are managed and evaluated. In the management's review, comments are made on business performance only. Read more in note 1.6 and in note 7.",

        "page_content": "## EBIT\n\nEBIT increased by 5 % to DKK 10.5 billion, primarily as a result of the higher EBITDA and no impairment losses in 2020. Depreciation increased due to more wind farms in operation. Impairment losses in 2019 were related to a write-down of our Renescience plant and our 20 MW battery storage project Carnegie Road, both in the UK.\n\n## Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises\n\nGain on divestment of enterprises primarily concerned the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses to SEAS-NVE (now Andel). The transaction resulted in a gain of DKK 10.9 billion.\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nNet financial income and expenses amounted to DKK 2.5 billion compared to DKK 1.1 billion in 2019. The increase was\n\nmainly due to a loss on interest rate swaps in June in connection with early termination of local project financing in the US, negative effects from exchange rate adjustments due to a weakening of GBP, and capital losses on the bond portfolio due to the increasing interest rates.\n\n## Tax and tax rate\n\nTax on profit for the year amounted to DKK 2.1 billion, which was DKK 0.6 billion lower than in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to higher net financial expenses, partly offset by initial recognition of deferred taxes of DKK 1.1 billion related to tax equity at Sage Draw in April, Plum Creek in June, and Willow Creek in September.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 11 %, and it was significantly impacted by the non-taxable gain on the divestment of our Danish power\n\n| Financial /r.ss01/e.ss01/s.ss01ul/t.ss01/s.ss01,  DKKm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf            | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf             | %                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Revenue                                                  | /five.tf/two.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/one.tf    | /six.tf/seven.tf,/eight.tf/four.tf/two.tf  | (/two.tf/two.tf %)          |\n| EBITDA                                                   | /one.tf/eight.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/four.tf   | /one.tf/seven.tf,/four.tf/eight.tf/four.tf | /four.tf %                  |\n| Depreciation                                             | (/seven.tf,/five.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf)    | (/six.tf,/eight.tf/six.tf/four.tf)         | /one.tf/one.tf %            |\n| Impairment reversals (losses)                            | -                                         | (/five.tf/six.tf/eight.tf)                 | n.a.                        |\n| Operating profit (loss) (EBIT)                           | /one.tf/zero.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/six.tf  | /one.tf/zero.tf,/zero.tf/five.tf/two.tf    | /five.tf %                  |\n| Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises                 | /one.tf/zero.tf,/eight.tf/three.tf/one.tf | (/six.tf/three.tf)                         | n.a.                        |\n| Profit (loss) from associates and joint ventures         | /seven.tf                                 | /two.tf                                    | /two.tf/five.tf/zero.tf %   |\n| Net financial income and expenses                        | (/two.tf,/five.tf/two.tf/four.tf)         | (/one.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/five.tf)         | /one.tf/two.tf/two.tf %     |\n| Tax                                                      | (/two.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf)         | (/two.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/six.tf)         | (/two.tf/three.tf %)        |\n| Tax rate                                                 | /one.tf/one.tf %                          | /three.tf/one.tf %                         | (/two.tf/zero.tf %p)        |\n| Profit for the year from continuing operations           | /one.tf/six.tf,/seven.tf/two.tf/seven.tf  | /six.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf            | /one.tf/seven.tf/four.tf %  |\n| Profit for the year from discontinued operations         | (/one.tf/one.tf)                          | (/five.tf/six.tf)                          | (/eight.tf/zero.tf %)       |\n| Profit (loss) for the year                               | /one.tf/six.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/six.tf    | /six.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/four.tf           | /one.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf % |\n\ndistribution, residential customer, and city light businesses mentioned above.\n\n## Profit for the year from continuing operations\n\nProfit for the year from continuing operations totalled DKK 16.7 billion, DKK 10.6 billion higher than in 2019.

        "page_content": "## Cash flows and net debt\n\n## Cash flows from operating activities\n\nCash flows from operating activities totalled DKK 16.5 billion in 2020 compared to DKK 13.1 billion in 2019. The increase of DKK 3.4 billion was mainly due to lower paid taxes in Denmark, tax equity contributions from our partners in the onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek, lower trade receivables due to lower revenue, and the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Walney Extension. This was partly offset by 2019 being positively affected by received milestone payments related to the construction of Hornsea 1 and the divestment of the Race Bank transmission assets.\n\nIn 2020, we had a net cash outflow from work in progress of DKK 1.6 billion. This was mainly due to supplier payments related to the construction of Hornsea 1 for partners and construction of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 2, partly offset by the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Walney Extension.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 27.0 billion against DKK 23.3 billion in 2019. The main investments in 2020 were:\n\n- -  offshore wind farms (DKK 19.5 billion), including Borssele 1 & 2 in the Netherlands, Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan, Hornsea 2 in the UK, and Ocean Wind 1 in the US\n- -   onshore wind and solar farms (DKK 6.6 billion), including Permian Energy Center, Muscle Shoals, Western Trail, Sage Draw, Plum Creek, Willow Creek, and Haystack in the US\n- -  Markets & Bioenergy (DKK 0.7 billion), mainly related to maintenance of the power distribution grid.\n\nCash flow from divestments in 2020 related mainly to the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses. The transaction resulted in proceeds of DKK 20.5 billion. Furthermore, we received minor proceeds regarding the divestment of our 10 MW Oak Solar Farm in New Jersey and our Inbicon production facilities. This was partly offset by a cash outflow in connection with the divestment of the LNG activities of DKK 1.5 billion and compensations paid under our partnership agreements.\n\nCash flow from divestments in 2019 related to the receipt of deferred proceeds from the farm-down of 50 % of Hornsea 1 in 2018 (DKK 1.7 billion) and to the strengthening of our strategic partnership with Eversource, as they became a 50 % partner in our activities in the New England area in February 2019 (DKK 1.4 billion).\n\n## Interest-bearing net debt\n\nInterest-bearing net debt totalled DKK 12.3 billion at the end of 2020 against DKK 17.2 billion at the end of 2019. The DKK 4.9 billion decrease was mainly due to a positive free cash flow of DKK 8.5 billion from continuing operations and a positive cash flow from discontinued operations where we have received deferred proceeds of USD 150 million from INEOS regarding the Oil & Gas divestment in 2017. These positive cash flow effects were only partly offset by dividends and hybrid coupon payments of DKK 5.2 billion.\n\n| Ca/s.ss01h flow/s.ss01 an/d.ss01 n/e.ss01/t.ss01 /d.ss01/e.ss01b/t.ss01,  DKKm

        "page_content": "## Equity and capital employed\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity was DKK 97.3 billion at the end of the year against DKK 89.6 billion at the end of 2019.\n\n## Capital employed\n\nCapital employed was DKK 109.7 billion at 31 December 2020 against DKK 106.8 billion at the end of 2019. The increase was mainly due to investments, partly offset by the divested capital employed regarding the Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses.\n\n## Financial ratios\n\n## Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n\nReturn on capital employed was 9.7 % in 2020 against 10.6 % in 2019. The slight decrease was mainly attributable to the higher average capital employed, only partly offset by higher EBIT.\n\n## Credit metric (FFO/adjusted net debt)\n\nThe funds from operations (FFO)/adjusted net debt credit metric was 48 % at the end of 2020 against 31 % in 2019.\n\n## ESG results\n\n## Green share of heat and power generation\n\nThe green share of heat and power generation amounted to 90 % in 2020, up 4 percentage points compared to last year. The increase mainly came from higher generation from offshore and onshore wind farms due to additional capacity and higher wind speeds. This was partly offset by an increase from ancillary services from our coal-fuelled units as we are legally obliged to deliver these services with the lowest marginal costs.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe greenhouse gas intensity from our heat and power generation and other operating activities (scopes 1 and 2) decreased to 58 g CO2e/kWh in 2020 against 65 g CO2e/kWh in 2019. The emissions per kWh decreased for the same reasons as mentioned above.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain and sales activities (scope 3) decreased by 27 % to 25.3 million tonnes in 2020, driven by a 28 % decrease in gas sales.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2020, we have had 77 total recordable injuries (TRIs), of which 58 injuries were related to our contractors' employees. This was a decrease of 29 injuries compared to 2019, equalling a 27 % reduction. The number of hours worked was 21.5 million hours, 1 % more than in 2019. Consequently, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) over the last year decreased from 4.9 in 2019 to 3.6 in 2020.\n\n## Capital employed, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Offshore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnshore\n\n- Markets & Bioenergy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmazon Wind Farm, Scurry County, Texas, the US.",

the reporting period, as results are adjusted for temporary fluctuations in the market value of contracts (including hedging transactions) relating to other periods. Apart from this, there is no difference between business performance and IFRS results. Read more in note 1.6.\n\nThe EBITDA split between business units in the comparative years 2016-2017 has not been updated to reflect that earnings from trading related to hedging of our power exposures and power portfolio optimisation activities in relation to Offshore are presented in this business unit from 2018 (previously Markets & Bioenergy).",

The lower revenue was mainly driven by significantly lower gas volumes sold and by construction agreements due to divestment of the transmission assets at Race Bank in Q4 2019, partly offset by increase in our windbased power generation.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA) totalled DKK 5.0 billion compared to DKK 4.6 billion in Q4 2019. The increase was mainly driven by ramp-up from new offshore and onshore wind farms in operation, which increased by 9 %, and higher wind speeds. In addition, the divested LNG activities contributed positively year on year as the provision in Q4 2019 was not repeated.\n\nThis was partly offset by lower earnings from trading related to hedging of our power exposure and power portfolio optimisation activities, which had high earnings in Q4 2019, and from our gas portfolio where the net positive effect from revaluation of our gas at storage and storage hedges was higher in Q4 2019 than Q4 2020. Furthermore, EBITDA from partnerships contributed negatively, due to minor updates regarding finalised construction projects. In addition, we had lower earnings\n\nfrom the divested Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses.\n\nWe also saw adverse COVID-19 impacts on especially the UK power market due to a lower demand for electricity, which led to lower ROC recycle prices and higher balancing tariffs (BSUoS) from National Grid.\n\n## Profit from continuing operations\n\nProfit from continuing operations increased by DKK 1.2 billion to DKK 2.2 billion. The increase was mainly due to the higher EBITDA and impairment losses in Q4 2019.\n\n## Cash flows from operating activities\n\nCash flows from operating activities totalled DKK 6.8 billion in Q4 2020 compared to DKK 4.8 billion in Q4 2019. The increase of DKK 1.9 billion was mainly due to lower receivables at the end of 2020 compared to 2019 and an early repayment related to our oil pipe facilities in Q4 2020.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 8.6 billion in Q4 2020. The main investments related to Hornsea 2, Greater Changhua 1 & 2a, Permian Energy Center, Muscle Shoals, Western Trail, and Haystack.\n\nCash flow from divestments was a cash outflow of DKK 1.5 billion and mainly related to the divestment of the LNG activities.\n\n| Financial performance,  DKKm                              | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | Q/four.tf

        "page_content": "## Financial performance\n\n- - business units\n\n## Offshore\n\nPower generation increased by 23 % relative to Q4 2019. The increase was primarily due to ramp-up of generation from Hornsea 1 and Borssele 1 & 2. Wind speeds amounted to a portfolio average of 10.4 m/s which was higher than in Q4 2019, but slightly lower than normal wind speeds (10.5 m/s). Availability ended at 94 %, which was 1 percentage point higher than in Q4 2019.\n\nRevenue from offshore wind farms in operation increased by 8 % due to the abovementioned ramp-up from new wind farms. Revenue from power sales increased by DKK 1.2 billion due to higher power prices and higher volumes sold during the quarter.\n\nRevenue from construction agreements was limited in Q4 2020 and mainly related to the construction of Coastal Virginia Wind. In Q4 2019, it primarily related to the divestment of the transmission assets at Race Bank.\n\nEBITDA increased by DKK 0.1 billion relative to Q4 2019 and amounted to DKK 4.1 billion.\n\nEBITDA from sites, O&M, and PPAs amounted to DKK 5.0 billion, up 7 % compared to Q4 2019, driven by higher generation. The increase was partly offset by adverse COVID-19 impacts and lower earnings from trading related to hedging of our UK energy exposure, which had very high earnings in Q4 2019.\n\nEBITDA from partnerships amounted to DKK -0.1 billion in Q4 2020, mainly due\n\nto minor updates regarding finalised construction projects.\n\n## Onshore\n\nPower generation increased by 84 % relative to Q4 2019. The increase was primarily due to new onshore wind farms in operation (Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek). Wind speeds across the portfolio amounted to 8.0 m/s, which was higher than in the same period last year and a normal fourth quarter (7.7 m/s).\n\nRevenue from wind farms in operation increased by 41 % due to the above-mentioned factors, partly offset by lower prices for the part of the portfolio not covered by PPAs and a lower positive effect from derivate run-offs related to the acquisition of LCE back in 2018.\n\nEBITDA almost doubled to DKK 0.3 billion, primarily due to more wind farms in operation.\n\n## Markets & Bioenergy\n\nRevenue decreased by 40 % and amounted to DKK 5.8 billion compared to Q4 2019. The decrease was mainly due to significantly lower gas and power volumes sold.\n\nEBITDA totalled DKK 0.6 billion in Q4 2020, which was DKK 0.2 billion higher than in Q4 2019.\n\nEBITDA from CHP plants was in line with last year and amounted to DKK 0.3 billion.\n\nEBITDA from Gas Markets & Infrastructure decreased by DKK 0.2 billion and amounted to DKK 0.4 billion. The lower earnings were related to our gas portfolio where the net positive effect from revaluation of our gas at storage and storage hedges was higher in Q4 2019 than Q4 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on quarterly figures for our business units, please go to orsted.com/ financial-reports\n\n| Offshore's results,  DKKm                     | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | %                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Revenue                                       | /one.tf/zero.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf  | /one.tf/zero.tf,/nine.tf/one.tf/three.tf   | (/one.tf %)                 |\n| Sites, O&M, and PPAs                          | /five.tf,/eight.tf/nine.tf/one.tf          | /five.tf,/four.tf/three.tf/seven.tf        | /eight.tf %                 |\n| Power sales                                   | /four.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/three.tf          | /three.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf       | /three.tf/six.tf %          |\n| Construction agreements                       | /one.tf/two.tf/two.tf                      | /two.tf,/zero.tf/one.tf/two.tf             | (/nine.tf/four.tf %)        |\n| Other                                         | /one.tf/eight.tf/three.tf                  | /six.tf/seven.tf                           | /one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf % |\n| EBITDA                                        | /four.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/eight.tf           | /four.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/eight.tf         | /two.tf %                   |\n| Sites, O&M, and PPAs                          | /four.tf,/nine.tf/five.tf/zero.tf          | /four.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/six.tf             | /seven.tf %                 |\n| Construction agreements and  divestment gains | (/one.tf/four.tf/nine.tf)                  | /five.tf/one.tf                            | n.a.                        |\n| Other, incl. project development              | (/six.tf/seven.tf/three.tf)                | (/six.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)                   | /seven.tf %                 |\n| Cash flows from operating  activities         | /seven.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/one.tf            | /three.tf,/five.tf/four.tf/five.tf         | /one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf %    |\n| Free cash flow                                | /one.tf,/three.tf/two.tf/nine.tf           | (/one.tf,/six.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf)         | n.a.                        |\n| Onshore's results,  DKKm                      | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | %                           |\n| Revenue                                       | /one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf                  | /one.tf/two.tf/three.tf                    | /four.tf/one.tf %           |\n| EBITDA                                        | /three.tf/two.tf/four.tf                   | /one.tf/six.tf/five.tf                     | /nine.tf/six.tf %           |\n| Sites                                         | /nine.tf/nine.tf                           | /seven.tf/three.tf                         | /three.tf/six.tf %          |\n| Production tax credits and tax  attributes    | /three.tf/one.tf/four.tf                   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf                     | /five.tf/six.tf %           |\n| Other, incl. project development              | (/eight.tf/nine.tf)                        | (/one.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf)                  | (/one.tf/eight.tf %)        |\n| Cash flows from operating  activities         | /one.tf/three.tf/four.tf                   | (/one.tf/six.tf/zero.tf)                   | n.a.                        |\n| Free cash flow                                | (/two.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/six.tf)          | (/two.tf,/eight.tf/two.tf/two.tf)          | (/nine.tf %)                |\n| Markets & Bioenergy's results                 | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | %                           |\n| DKKm Revenue                                  | /five.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/five.tf         | /nine.tf,/five.tf/six.tf/nine.tf           | (/four.tf/zero.tf %)        |\n| EBITDA                                        | /six.tf/four.tf/three.tf                   | /four.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf                   | /three.tf/one.tf %          |\n| CHP plants                                    | /three.tf/four.tf/six.tf                   | /three.tf/five.tf/four.tf                  | (/two.tf %)                 |\n| Gas Markets & Infrastructure                  | /three.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf                 | /six.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                     | (/three.tf/seven.tf %)      |\n| LNG                                           | -

        "page_content": "We entered into agreements to divest 25 % of Ocean Wind 1 to Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) and 50 % of the project Greater Changhua 1 to CDPQ and Cathay PE.\n\nWe divested the transmission assets of our offshore wind farm Walney Extension.\n\nWe established a joint venture with TEPCO to develop projects on the eastern coast of Japan.\n\nWe have started developing a project in South Korea with a capacity of up to 1.6 GW.\n\nIn renewable hydrogen, we took FID on the H2RES project and secured funding for the OYSTER, Gigastack, and Westk\u00fcste 100 projects.\n\nWe launched three new renewable hydrogen projects: Green Fuels for Denmark and our partnerships with Yara and bp.\n\n## Financial performance 2020\n\nPower generation increased by 27 % relative to 2019, primarily due to ramp-up of generation from Hornsea 1 and Borssele 1 & 2 (in total 1.6 TWh) and higher wind speeds, mainly in Q1 2020. This was partly offset by hours with negative prices from April to July due to a lower demand for electricity driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led us to temporarily shut down generation.\n\nWind speeds were above last year and amounted to a portfolio average of 9.7 m/s, up from 9.2 m/s in 2019 and above a normal wind year (9.3 m/s), mainly due to very strong\n\nwinds in Q1 2020. Availability was 94 %, which was 1 percentage point higher than in 2019.\n\nRevenue decreased by 14 % to DKK 34.5 billion. The decrease compared to 2019 was driven by revenue from construction agreements decreasing by DKK 9.0 billion, primarily due to high activity in 2019 related to the construction of the offshore wind farm Hornsea 1 for partners and the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Race Bank. In 2020, revenue from construction agreements primarily related to the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Walney Extension, construction of Coastal Virginia Wind, and the finalisation of Hornsea 1. This was partly offset by revenue from offshore wind farms in operation increasing by 17 % to DKK 19.4 billion, mainly due to higher generation.\n\nEBITDA decreased by 3 % relative to 2019 and amounted to DKK 14.8 billion.\n\nEBITDA from Sites, O&M, and PPAs amounted to DKK 15.5 billion in 2020. The 13 % increase was primarily due to the above-mentioned ramp-up of Hornsea 1 and Borssele 1 & 2, receipt of CfDs of another 400 MW of Hornsea 1 from April, and higher wind speeds. The increase was partly offset by adverse COVID-19 impacts on especially the UK power market due to a lower demand for electricity, which led to hours with negative prices from April to July, lower ROC recycle prices, and higher balancing tariffs (BSUoS) from National Grid in 2020. Furthermore, we saw lower earnings from trading related to hedging of our UK energy exposure, which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBITDA from 'Sites, O&M, and PPAs' increased by 13 %.\n\n| P/e.ss01/r.ss01fo/r.ss01manc/e.ss01 highligh/t.ss01/s.ss01             |         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf               | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf              | %                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Bu/s.ss01in/e.ss01/s.ss01/s.ss01 /d.ss01/r.ss01iv/e.ss01/r.ss01/s.ss01 |         |                                              |                                             |                            |\n| Decided (FID) and installed  capacity                                  | GW      | /nine.tf./nine.tf                            | /nine.tf./nine.tf                           | /zero.tf %                 |\n| Installed capacity                                                     | GW      | /seven.tf./six.tf                            | /six.tf./eight.tf                           | /one.tf/one.tf %           |\n| Generation capacity                                                    | GW      | /four.tf./four.tf                            | /three.tf./six.tf                           | /two.tf/one.tf %           |\n| Wind speed                                                             | m/s     | /nine.tf./seven.tf                           | /nine.tf./two.tf                            | /five.tf %                 |\n| Load factor                                                            | %       | /four.tf/five.tf                             | /four.tf/two.tf                             | /three.tf %p               |\n| Availability                                                           | %       | /nine.tf/four.tf                             | /nine.tf/three.tf                           | /one.tf %p                 |\n| Power generation                                                       | TWh     | /one.tf/five.tf./two.tf                      | /one.tf/two.tf./zero.tf                     | /two.tf/seven.tf %         |\n| Denmark                                                                |         | /two.tf./two.tf                              | /two.tf./two.tf                             | /zero.tf %                 |\n| United Kingdom                                                         |         | /nine.tf./four.tf                            | /seven.tf./four.tf                          | /two.tf/seven.tf %         |\n| Germany                                                                |         | /two.tf./three.tf                            | /two.tf./two.tf                             | /five.tf %                 |\n| The Netherlands                                                        |         | /one.tf./two.tf                              | -

        "page_content": "had very high earnings in 2019. Excluding earnings previously reported as part of Markets & Bioenergy, EBITDA from Sites, O&M, and PPAs increased by 17 %.\n\nEBITDA from partnerships decreased by DKK 2.2 billion and amounted to DKK 1.6 billion. In 2020, our earnings from construction agreements mainly related to the lowered assumptions regarding the preferred bidder's expected return requirement on the Hornsea 1 transmission asset, the construction of Coastal Virginia Wind, and minor updates regarding finalised construction projects. In 2019, earnings from construction agreements primarily concerned Hornsea 1.\n\nEBITDA from other activities, including project development, amounted to DKK -2.3 billion, in line with last year, and mainly related to our project development activities in the US. Total expensed project development costs amounted to DKK 1.7 billion.\n\nDepreciation increased 11 % and amounted to DKK 6.1 billion. The increase was mainly due to completion of Hornsea 1 and Borssele 1 & 2.\n\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to DKK 10.0 billion, which was DKK 0.7 billion higher than in 2019. The increase was primarily due to less paid tax in 2020 relative to 2019. This was partly offset by funds tied up in work in progress in 2020 versus a release in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, we had a net cash outflow from work in progress of DKK 1.6 billion. This was mainly due to supplier payments related to\n\nthe construction of Hornsea 1 for partners and construction of the offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 2, partly offset by the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Walney Extension.\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 19.5 billion and mainly related to the construction of Borssele 1 & 2, Greater Changhua 1 & 2a, Hornsea 2, and Ocean Wind 1.\n\nCash flow from divestments in 2020 related to compensations paid under partnership agreements. In 2019, cash flow from divestments related to the receipt of deferred proceeds from the 50 % farm-down of Hornsea 1 in 2018 (DKK 1.7 billion) and to the strengthening of our strategic partnership with Eversource, as they became a 50 % partner in our activities in the New England area in the US in 2019 (DKK 1.4 billion).\n\n## Strategic and operational performance 2020\n\nOur Offshore business delivered a strong performance in 2020, despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We commissioned our construction projects on schedule and within budget and achieved a park availability of 93.7 % across the portfolio, with Borssele 1 & 2 delivering a park availability of 97.4 % since May 2020.\n\nIn June, we reached a significant milestone with the installation of \u00d8rsted's offshore wind turbine number 1,500. We are set to more than double our offshore wind capacity in the coming five years, and we are well on track to meet\n\n## Quarterly and annual wind speeds for our offshore wind farms, m/s\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour strategic ambition of 15 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2025. With our current portfolio of projects under construction and awarded, we have nearly reached this target.\n\n## The UK\n\nIn the UK, we are building the offshore wind farm Hornsea 2, which is our construction project most affected by COVID-19. However, we do not expect this to delay commissioning, and we anticipate the project to stay within the budget set at FID. Currently, we are installing foundations and array cables, and we expect the project to be completed in the first half of 2022.\n\nIn April, we signed a 15-year CPPA with Nestl\u00e9 UK who will buy 31 MW of the output of our offshore wind farm Race Bank which has a total capacity of 573 MW. This is \u00d8rsted's largest, long-term, fixed-price CPPA in the UK.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe wind speeds indicate how many metres per second the wind has blown in the areas where we have offshore wind farms. The weighting is based on our generation capacity.\n\nIn December, we were granted consent to move into the final development phase of the offshore wind farm Hornsea 3 by the UK Secretary of State for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. The offshore wind farm has a potential capacity of more than 2.4 GW and is adjacent to our offshore wind farms Hornsea 1 and Hornsea 2, off the east coast of the UK. With the consent granted, the offshore wind farm Hornsea 3 will be able to enter the next UK auction round for a contract for difference (CfD).\n\nFinally, we divested the offshore transmission assets of Walney Extension to Diamond Transmission Partners. The transmission assets were sold for GBP 447 million 100 % basis and included the onshore substation, the export cables, and the offshore substations. In the first half of 2021, we expect to divest the transmission assets of Hornsea 1.",

        "page_content": "## Continental Europe\n\nIn Continental Europe, we commissioned the offshore wind farm Borssele 1 & 2 on time and on budget. Borssele 1 & 2 is currently the largest offshore wind farm in the Netherlands and added 752 MW to our installed capacity.\n\nIn addition, we signed a 10-year CPPA with Amazon who will offtake 250 MW of Borkum Riffgrund 3 Offshore Wind Farm's total capacity of 900 MW. This was our first offshore wind CPPA with a global tech company and the largest offshore wind CPPA in Europe. Furthermore, we selected SGRE as the preferred wind turbine supplier for our projects Borkum Riffgrund 3 and Gode Wind 3. Subject to final investment decisions, which we expect by the end of 2021, assuming the necessary consents are received, the projects will deploy SGRE's 11 MW wind turbine with a 200-metre rotor.\n\n## North America\n\nIn the US, we completed construction of the 12 MW demonstration project Coastal Virginia Wind where we were contracted for EPC by Dominion Energy. The two-wind turbine offshore wind farm was the first to be federally permitted for installation in US waters.\n\nIn the north-eastern US, \u00d8rsted and our partners Eversource and the State of Connecticut reached a final agreement on a harbour development plan for State Pier in New London that will transform the pier into a world-class offshore wind centre.\n\nIn December, we signed an agreement with PSEG which acquired 25 % of the offshore wind farm Ocean Wind 1.\n\nOur offshore wind development pipeline in the US is progressing, but we are still waiting for the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to decide on key aspects related to the permitting process. As a result, the construction start dates for Revolution Wind, Ocean Wind 1, Skipjack Wind, and Sunrise Wind will likely be delayed beyond the expected 2023 or 2024. We have schedule flexibility in all four projects and have been able to make good progress on other project milestones in the meantime. However, until there is a clear timeline from BOEM, we cannot modify the projects' construction schedules. For our project South Fork Wind, we do not expect changes to the timeline or COD, currently scheduled for late 2023.\n\nDespite these permitting delays, we remain confident that we can deliver our US project portfolio with satisfactory returns. This is reinforced by the commitment of the incoming Joe Biden Administration to rapid clean energy deployment as well as the US Treasury's recent announcement of a ten-year continuity safe harbour for offshore wind in addition to a new five-year, 30 % investment tax credit.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nOur construction activities at the offshore wind farm Greater Changhua 1 & 2a are moving forward as planned. Currently, we are preparing for the installation of foundations which will commence in the first quarter of 2021, and we expect commissioning in 2022.\n\nIn December 2020, we entered into an agreement to divest 50 % of Greater Changhua 1 to Canadian pension fund Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ) and Taiwanese\n\nprivate equity fund Cathay PE. The agreement marks a milestone in successfully applying our partnership farm-down model in Asia Pacific.\n\nIn July, we signed a CPPA with Taiwan-based TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor foundry. TSMC will offtake the full production of our 920 MW offshore wind farm Greater Changhua 2b & 4, making it the largest-ever renewable energy CPPA. The 20-year fixedprice contract period will go into effect once Greater Changhua 2b & 4 reaches commercial operation, expected in 2025 or 2026, subject to grid availability and FID by \u00d8rsted.\n\nFurthermore, we signed a 20-year lease with the Port of Taichung and a long-term vessel contract with Ta San Shang Marine Co. Ltd for our offshore wind farms off the coast of Changhua County, enabling construction of the first Taiwan-flagged service operation vessel (SOV). The SOV will use the Port of Taichung as its base where \u00d8rsted's O&M facilities will also be located.\n\nWe also achieved significant progress in Japan in 2020. We entered into an agreement with TEPCO to establish a joint venture company for offshore wind in Japan, with the intention of working towards a joint bid in the first Japanese auction, expectedly in the first half of 2021.\n\nIn 2020, we achieved an important milestone by deploying four floating LiDARs and securing site exclusivity off the coast of Incheon in South Korea. We have begun to collect data for the site, an area with a potential capacity of 1.6 GW of offshore wind.\n\n## Renewable hydrogen\n\nWe have made significant progress on our renewable hydrogen pipeline over the past 18 months. In 2020 alone, we secured funding for two of the projects and launched three new projects together with different consortia. \u00d8rsted's renewable hydrogen pipeline now includes eight projects in Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands, of which half have received funding.\n\nIn January 2021, \u00d8rsted took FID on the demonstration project H2RES which will produce renewable hydrogen for road transport from power generated by \u00d8rsted's two 3.6 MW offshore wind turbines at Aved\u00f8re Holme, Denmark. H2RES will have an electrolyser capacity of 2  MW and is expected to begin production in late 2021, which will make it our first renewable hydrogen project to reach operation. Also in January, the OYSTER project consortium, of which \u00d8rsted is a member, was awarded five million euros from the European Commission's private-public partnership Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH2-JU) to develop a combined wind turbine and electrolyser system to produce renewable hydrogen offshore. The project is planned to run from 2021 to 2024, and we will lead the offshore deployment analysis and feasibility study and contribute to the design of the electrolyser system.\n\nIn August 2020, we secured funding for another two projects. Phase two of the Gigastack project received funds from the UK government, enabling \u00d8rsted and our partners to conduct a front-end engineering design (FEED) study for a 100 MW electrolysis plant which will use electricity from the Hornsea 2 Offshore Wind Farm.

Westk\u00fcste 100 is being developed by a cross-industry consortium of ten companies, including \u00d8rsted, and seeks to decarbonise industrial processes, aviation, construction, and heating through renewable hydrogen. The first phase includes the construction of a 30 MW electrolysis plant and the development of a plan to scale the facility to 700 MW.\n\nLast year also saw the launch of three new renewable hydrogen projects.\n\nIn May, \u00d8rsted and a group of leading Danish companies partnered up to develop an industrial-scale facility in the Greater Copenhagen area to produce e-fuels for road, maritime, and air transport. The partnership, Green Fuels for Denmark, brings together the demand and supply side of sustainable fuels under a vision of building one of the world's\n\nlargest electrolyser and e-fuels production facilities. \u00d8rsted is part of the Europa Seaways consortium led by DFDS, one of our partners in Green Fuels for Denmark, which aims to develop the world's first 100 % hydrogenpowered ferry for DFDS' Oslo-Copenhagen route. In November, we applied for support from the EU Innovation Fund to further progress this project.\n\nIn October, we launched a renewable hydrogen project in the Netherlands together with Yara, the world's leading fertilizer company. The project will include a 100 MW electrolysis plant, producing renewable hydrogen from electricity from \u00d8rsted's offshore wind farms. The renewable hydrogen will replace fossilbased hydrogen in the production of ammonia at Yara's facility in Sluiskil, with the potential of displacing more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year.\n\nFinally, \u00d8rsted and bp agreed in November to develop a renewable hydrogen project at bp's\n\nLingen Refinery in Emsland, Germany. The project includes a 50 MW electrolysis system with the aim of replacing fossil-based hydrogen at the Lingen Refinery. This is the first step towards the project's long-term ambition of building more than 500 MW of electrolyser capacity which could meet the refinery's entire hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future e-fuel production.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial performance 2020\n\nPower generation amounted to 5.7 TWh in 2020, which was a 64 % increase relative to 2019. The increase was due to new wind farms in operation (Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek) and a full year of generation from Lockett. Wind speeds amounted to a portfolio average of 7.6 m/s, up from 7.3 m/s in 2019 and slightly above a normal wind year (7.5 m/s).\n\nRevenue amounted to DKK 0.7 billion, up 9 % from 2019 due to higher generation, partly offset by lower prices for the part of the portfolio not covered by PPAs and a lower positive effect from derivate run-offs related to the acquisition of LCE back in 2018.\n\nEBITDA increased by 44 % and amounted to DKK 1.1 billion, driven by higher generation and related PTCs.\n\nCash flows from operating activities amounted to DKK 3.9 billion, which primarily comprised tax equity contributions from our partners at Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek. In 2019, it primarily comprised a tax equity contribution related to the onshore wind farm Lockett.\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 6.6 billion in 2020 and was related to the construction of Permian Energy Center, Muscle Shoals, Western Trail, Sage Draw, Plum Creek, Willow Creek, and Haystack.\n\nDivestments comprised the sale of Oak Solar Farm in June 2020. In 2019, it primarily comprised a sale and lease-back arrangement for land related to Permian Energy Center.\n\n## Strategic and operational performance 2020\n\nOur Onshore business made significant progress in 2020, taking FID on four projects and commissioning three projects on schedule and within budget, despite adverse COVID-19 impacts across the industry. Operations remained stable throughout the year with high asset availability across our portfolio. A strong pipeline of onshore wind and solar PV projects is being developed and will be matured further in 2021, putting us well on track to achieve our strategic ambition of 5 GW of installed onshore wind and solar PV capacity by 2025.\n\n## Onshore wind\n\nIn April, we commissioned the 338 MW onshore wind farm Sage Draw, our fifth in Texas. With the completion of the 230 MW Plum Creek in Nebraska in June and the 103 MW Willow Creek in South Dakota in September, we expanded our footprint in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), a market which plays an important part of our growth in North America. The commissioning of these wind farms brought our operating portfolio to a total of 1.7 GW. We have received tax equity financing for all three projects which are eligible for the full value of the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC).\n\nIn addition, we supplemented our development activities with the acquisition of Haystack, a 298 MW onshore wind project in Nebraska. The project is adjacent to Plum Creek and will use the same interconnection infrastructure. Haystack is expected to be commissioned in 2021 and is thus expected to be eligible for the full value of the PTC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBITDA increased by 44 %.\n\n| Performance highlights                                        |         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf        | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf            | %                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Business drivers                                              |         |                                       |                                           |                            |\n| Decided (FID) and installed  capacity, onshore wind and solar | GW      | /three.tf./four.tf                    | /two.tf./one.tf                           | /six.tf/three.tf %         |\n| Installed capacity, onshore wind  and solar                   | GW      | /one.tf./seven.tf                     | /one.tf./zero.tf                          | /six.tf/seven.tf %         |\n| Wind speed                                                    | m/s     | /seven.tf./six.tf                     | /seven.tf./three.tf                       | /four.tf %                 |\n| Load factor, onshore wind                                     | %       | /four.tf/five.tf                      | /four.tf/five.tf                          | /zero.tf %p                |\n| Availability, onshore wind                                    | %       | /nine.tf/six.tf                       | /nine.tf/eight.tf                         | (/two.tf %p)               |\n| Power generation                                              | TWh     | /five.tf./seven.tf                    | /three.tf./five.tf                        | /six.tf/four.tf %          |\n| US dollars                                                    | DKK/USD | /six.tf./five.tf                      | /six.tf./seven.tf                         | (/two.tf %)                |\n| Financial performance                                         |         |                                       |                                           |                            |\n| Revenue                                                       | DKKm    | /seven.tf/three.tf/three.tf           | /six.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf                  | /nine.tf %                 |\n| EBITDA                                                        | DKKm    | /one.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/one.tf       | /seven.tf/eight.tf/six.tf                 | /four.tf/four.tf %         |\n| Sites                                                         |         | /four.tf/five.tf/one.tf               | /four.tf/six.tf/six.tf                    | (/three.tf %)              |\n| Production tax credits and tax  attributes                    |         | /one.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/four.tf      | /six.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                   | /six.tf/zero.tf %          |\n| Other, including project  development                         |         | (/three.tf/two.tf/four.tf)            | (/three.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf)              | /five.tf %                 |\n| Depreciation                                                  | DKKm    | (/four.tf/eight.tf/two.tf)            | (/three.tf/five.tf/one.tf)                | /three.tf/seven.tf %       |\n| Impairment losses                                             | DKKm    | -                                     | (/six.tf/eight.tf)                        | n.a.                       |\n| EBIT                                                          | DKKm    | /six.tf/four.tf/nine.tf               | /three.tf/six.tf/seven.tf                 | /seven.tf/seven.tf %       |\n| Cash flows from operating  activities                         | DKKm    | /three.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/one.tf      | /one.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf         | /two.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf % |\n| Gross investments                                             | DKKm    | (/six.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/three.tf)   | (/six.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf)        | /eight.tf %                |\n| Divestments                                                   | DKKm    | /one.tf/one.tf/four.tf                | /two.tf/five.tf/five.tf                   | (/five.tf/five.tf %)       |\n| Free cash flow                                                | DKKm    | (/two.tf,/five.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf)   | (/four.tf,/eight.tf/nine.tf/six.tf)       | (/four.tf/seven.tf %)      |\n| Capital employed                                              | DKKm    | /one.tf/two.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/one.tf,/seven.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf %          |\n\n## Quarterly and annual wind speeds for our onshore wind farms m/s\n\n- 2018 2019 2020\n- Normal wind year\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decrease was mainly driven by a significant drop in average gas and power prices relative to last year as well as lower gas and power volumes sold.\n\nThermal power generation amounted to 4.4 TWh, a 4 % decrease compared to last year due to slightly warmer weather and less favourable market conditions for power generation, partly offset by a higher volume from ancillary services. Heat generation amounted to 6.7 TWh, down 20 % compared to last year, mainly due to a warm first quarter in 2020.\n\nEBITDA amounted to DKK 2.1 billion compared to DKK 1.5 billion in 2019.\n\nEBITDA from CHP plants totalled DKK 1.1 billion in 2020, a slight decrease compared to last year. The decrease was mainly due to lower thermal heat and power generation and lower power spreads as well as the reversal of a provision in 2019 of DKK 0.3 billion following the acquittal in the Elsam case. This was partly offset by higher earnings from sale of ancillary services in 2020.\n\nEBITDA from Gas Markets & Infrastructure amounted to DKK 0.4 billion, in line with last year. Higher earnings from revaluation of our gas at storage and a positive impact from storage hedges was offset by lower transported and sold volumes due to the shutdown of the Tyra gas field from late 2019 until 2023 as well as a provision for bad debt in our B2B business to cover the extraordinary COVID-19-related default risks among our customers.\n\nEBITDA from LNG amounted to DKK 0 billion compared to a loss of DKK 1.0 billion in 2019. Due to the agreement to divest our LNG activities in 2019, we made provisions to offset the negative earnings until the divestment in 2020.\n\nEBITDA from our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses amounted to DKK 0.9 billion in 2020 versus DKK 1.3 billion in 2019. As a result of the divestment in August, earnings in 2020 only included eight months of operations.\n\nWe had no impairment losses in 2020, whereas impairment losses amounted to DKK 0.5 billion in 2019 and were related to a write-down of our Renescience plant in the UK, mainly due to delayed commissioning, increased CAPEX, and changed cost and price estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBITDA increased by 43 %.\n\n| Performance highlights                  |         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf          | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf             | %                           |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Business drivers                        |         |                                         |                                            |                             |\n| Degree days                             | number  | /two.tf,/four.tf/three.tf/two.tf        | /two.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf          | /one.tf %                   |\n| Heat generation                         | TWh     | /six.tf./seven.tf                       | /eight.tf./three.tf                        | (/two.tf/zero.tf %)         |\n| Power generation                        | TWh     | /four.tf./four.tf                       | /four.tf./six.tf                           | (/four.tf %)                |\n| Gas sales                               | TWh     | /nine.tf/zero.tf./three.tf              | /one.tf/two.tf/five.tf./zero.tf            | (/two.tf/eight.tf %)        |\n| Power sales                             | TWh     | /one.tf/one.tf./six.tf                  | /one.tf/four.tf./seven.tf                  | (/two.tf/one.tf %)          |\n| Gas price, TTF                          | EUR/MWh | /nine.tf./three.tf                      | /one.tf/three.tf./five.tf                  | (/three.tf/one.tf %)        |\n| Power price, DK                         | EUR/MWh | /two.tf/six.tf./seven.tf                | /three.tf/nine.tf./two.tf                  | (/three.tf/two.tf %)        |\n| Power price, LEBA UK                    | GBP/MWh | /three.tf/six.tf./eight.tf              | /four.tf/three.tf./six.tf                  | (/one.tf/six.tf %)          |\n| Green dark spread, DK                   | EUR/MWh | (/one.tf/one.tf./two.tf)                | (/two.tf./six.tf)                          | /three.tf/four.tf/one.tf %  |\n| Green spark spread, DK                  | EUR/MWh | (/one.tf./four.tf)                      | /two.tf./zero.tf                           | n.a.                        |\n| Financial results                       |         |                                         |                                            |                             |\n| Revenue                                 | DKKm    | /two.tf/one.tf,/four.tf/two.tf/zero.tf  | /three.tf/two.tf,/eight.tf/one.tf/six.tf   | (/three.tf/five.tf %)       |\n| EBITDA                                  | DKKm    | /two.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/six.tf         | /one.tf,/four.tf/nine.tf/five.tf           | /four.tf/three.tf %         |\n| CHP plants                              |         | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/one.tf           | /one.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/two.tf             | (/four.tf %)                |\n| Gas Markets & Infrastructure            |         | /four.tf/one.tf/one.tf                  | /three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf                  | /five.tf %                  |\n| LNG                                     |         | -

        "page_content": "Cash flow from operating activities amounted to DKK 2.9 billion in 2020. The increase of DKK 1.6 billion was mainly due to lower paid taxes (receipt of on account taxes in 2020 versus payment of taxes on account in 2019), lower trade receivables due to lower revenue, an early repayment related to our oil pipe facilities, and changes in the value of derivatives. This was partly offset by a change in the value of gas at storage.\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 0.7 billion in 2020 and were mainly related to maintenance of the power distribution grid and concluding works related to the bioconversion of Asn\u00e6s Power Station up until inauguration in August.\n\nCash flow from divestments amounted to DKK 19.1 billion in 2020, of which the above-mentioned divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses contributed with\n\nWe run our business on an end-to-end value chain thinking. All activities and earnings that relate to Offshore and Onshore are reported in these segments, even if the daily activities are performed on behalf of the group in Markets & Bioenergy. Therefore, earnings from trading related to hedging of our power exposures and power portfolio optimisation activities in relation to Offshore and Onshore are presented in these business units.\n\nIn 2020, EBITDA of DKK 236 million and DKK 48 million were transferred to Offshore and Onshore, respectively (DKK 725 million and DKK -18 million, respectively, in 2019).\n\nproceeds of DKK 20.5 billion. This was partly offset by a cash outflow in connection with the divestment of the LNG activities of DKK 1.5 billion.\n\n## Strategic and operational performance 2020\n\nIn 2020, we made great strides in the development of our core activities, while continuing to streamline Markets & Bioenergy through divestments.\n\n## Provide and develop a competitive route-to-market\n\nHaving consistently reduced balancing costs over the last few years, we provide an increasingly efficient route-to-market for \u00d8rsted's generation portfolio. In 2020, with the addition of our asset Borssele 1, we grew the portfolio of \u00d8rsted projects under our management to 5.6 GW.\n\nOur balancing services are also an increasingly competitive option for third-party renewable operators. We currently provide balancing services for nearly 600 MW of third-party capacity, and in 2020, we won a major contract with the Dogger Bank Wind Farm, which is currently under construction. We will provide balancing for 40 % of the volume from phases A and B of this project, amounting to 960 MW when fully completed. We also made successful balancing-service bids for onshore third-party renewable projects in the Netherlands and Denmark.\n\n## Spearhead market risk management\n\nOur market trading activities had another strong year in 2020, stemming from the successful hedging and trading of our energy exposures. We have especially benefitted from the flexibility embedded in the contract structures of our north-western European energy portfolio which we leverage to protect and extract value for \u00d8rsted.\n\nAs part of our digital strategy for short-term trading, we rolled out a smart bidding tool which uses a parametric algorithm to automatically trade volumes in small increments and improve the speed of our trade execution. The tool enhances our ability to capture stronger market prices in the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\nOur Chicago-based US trading organisation began commercial operations in early 2020, managing market risk for our US portfolio. The organisation contributes to our ongoing capacity build-out in the US by providing the same risk management and route-to-market services as for our European portfolio.\n\n## Optimise and decarbonise our CHP plants\n\n2020 was a milestone year for our biomass conversion programme. The Crown Prince of Denmark inaugurated the sustainable biomass-fired unit 6 of our Asn\u00e6s Power Station in August, marking the completion of our conversion programme and another step towards the full decarbonisation of our CHP operations in Denmark. Furthermore, we reached our target of sourcing 100 % of our biomass from third-party certified sustainable suppliers. In 2020, Denmark passed new biomass sustainability legislation that is in line with the strict\n\nstandards we already require from our biomass suppliers on replanting of trees, protection of forest biodiversity, and supply chain emissions.\n\nIn addition, we are exploring the potential of carbon capture technology at our biomass-fired CHP plants. Carbon captured from biomass combustion is biogenic and can contribute to negative emissions when stored permanently, or it can be used as a feedstock to produce carbon-neutral products.\n\nThis year saw a temporary increase in our use of coal as a proportion of our overall fuel inputs, stemming from statutory requirements as part of our provision of ancillary services to the Danish power system. Our commitment to phase out coal by 2023 remains unchanged.\n\nBy combining our dispatchable CHP capacity with our offshore wind portfolio in Denmark, we were for the first time able to offer some of our ancillary services as green products. Our offshore wind farm Horns Rev 2 was the first intermittent renewable source to qualify for providing automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR) services in Denmark.\n\n## Optimise our gas portfolio\n\nWith the Danish Undergrund Consortiumowned Tyra gas field in the North Sea shut down for redevelopment until June 2023, we have ensured continuous supply for our Danish and Swedish gas customers by importing piped volumes from Germany. When Tyra reopens, and as domestic biogas production increases, the dependence on imported gas to Denmark will decrease.",

Under the agreement, \u00d8rsted will resell some of the natural gas received from the Danish North Sea as part of our legacy gas purchasing contracts. The agreement reduces our exposure to long-term financial risk in our gas portfolio and supports Poland's decarbonisation agenda. Poland aims to reduce the share of coal in its energy mix from 75 % today to 11-28 % by 2040 by substituting it with renewables and natural gas.\n\nWe developed and launched a first-of-its-kind trading contract for renewable hydrogen certificates in the UK. Specifically targeting the decarbonisation of the transport sector, this contract builds on our other partnerships on renewable hydrogen technology.\n\n## Commercialise Renescience\n\nIn October, we successfully completed the final performance tests and began commercial operations at our Renescience plant in Northwich, the UK. The technology has the potential to significantly increase recycling rates of unsorted household waste and reduce the volumes of waste sent to landfills or incineration. The commissioning of our Northwich plant marks a major milestone, and we continue to explore the broader commercial potential of this technology.\n\n## Deliver on divestments\n\nIn 2020, we continued streamlining Markets & Bioenergy to focus on our growth platform. At the end of July, we divested our energy efficiency consulting business to EBAS. In August, we completed the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses to SEAS-NVE (now Andel), and in December, we completed the divestment of our LNG business to Glencore. Finally, we signed an agreement with Total Gas & Power in September to divest our UK B2B gas and power portfolios.

        "page_content": "## Message from the Chairman\n\nIn the Board of Directors, we firmly believe that good corporate governance and high standards of integrity are fundamental as we continue to develop \u00d8rsted as one of the global leaders in renewable energy.\n\nWe have designed our corporate governance model to support transparency and compliance with regulation and best practice and to support business conduct and decision-making that is agile, efficient, and of high quality. Our corporate governance is supported by a company culture based on high ethical standards and clear values throughout the organisation. It is built on three pillars that are embedded throughout the organisation, from the Board to the individual employee.\n\nFirst, we have designed our management structure to enable the right decision-making power in the right places throughout the organisation. Therefore, we have defined clear roles, responsibilities, and key performance indicators at all levels of the organisation. In the Board, we oversee the overall strategic decision-making in \u00d8rsted, while the Executive Board undertakes the day-today management of the company through the Executive Committee. Our Management Team of approx. 20 senior executives drives the strategic execution of our business plans and promotes a common culture across the company, supported by our wider management system of more than 1,000 managers\n\nacross the company. Each employee across the company has clear targets for how to contribute, including personal development targets and success criteria that link back to our business strategy.\n\nSecond, we want to ensure the right competences to successfully drive our business forward. We spend considerable amounts of time assessing and ensuring that we have the right competences at executive and board levels and attach importance to the members having extensive knowledge and experience covering a wide range of geographies and fields of expertise. Climate action is particularly fundamental to our business strategy of deploying renewable energy, so climaterelated issues are an integral part of board and executive agendas. Therefore, a key set of competences for the Board includes environment, social, and governance (ESG) as this is fundamental for \u00d8rsted's business. For the Executive Board, we have also integrated ESG into their individual incentive schemes.\n\nTo reinforce diversity, we have equal gender representation in the Board as defined by Danish law, and throughout the organisation, we continuously work to promote diversity\n\nthrough the representation of different nationalities, genders, age distribution, and mindsets.\n\nIndividual development is a key driver in helping to ensure that we have the right competences in place. That is why we have built a systematic approach to and culture of continuous development. Our approach warrants personal development, enables nuanced, constructive feedback, and enhances growth opportunities for individuals at all levels of the organisation.\n\nThird, we want to maintain and further cultivate a company culture based on integrity. Integrity is our root and is the first of our five guiding principles. Our culture and focus on integrity are also supported by our policy on good business conduct and a set of internal controls aimed at protecting \u00d8rsted's integrity. We have clear policies, procedures, and guidelines in place to prevent and address potential violations of our policy on good business conduct. We have an Internal Audit function and a whistle-blower scheme where internal and external stakeholders can easily and anonymously report concerns about inappropriate and illegal conduct in the company through an independent third party.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe keep our governance principles under regular review, and we promote compliance internally and with our business partners through our code of conduct and due diligence, training, and reporting of misconduct to support the highest levels of good governance and integrity.\n\nOn the following pages, you can read more about our corporate governance, and how we work with it. I look forward to continuing serving the Board in the coming year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThomas Thune Andersen Chairman",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nOur overall and strategic management of the company is anchored in a board of independent nonexecutive directors appointed by the shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Executive Board, consisting of the CEO and CFO who undertake the day-to-day management of \u00d8rsted through the Executive Committee. None of our executives are members of the Board of Directors. A Management Team consisting of the Executive Committee and senior vice presidents drives strategic development and cultural alignment across the company.\n\n## Our governance model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders and general meeting\n\n\u00d8rsted is a publicly listed company with the Danish State as majority shareholder with 50.1 % ownership. The Danish State exercises its ownership interest in \u00d8rsted in accordance with the ordinary governance set-up in Danish companies where the Board of Directors and the Executive Board are responsible for the management of the company. The Danish State exercises its interest at the general meeting, including through the appointment of professional board members. The Danish State's ownership policy is available here (only in Danish): fm.dk/udgivelser/2015/april/ statens-ejerskabspolitik/.\n\nAll our shareholders may exercise their rights and vote at the general meeting through a one-share-one-vote principle. The general meeting adopts decisions, such as the election of the Board of Directors and the auditor, in accordance with the standard Danish rules. Due to our majority ownership by the Danish State, we have a bespoke quorum requirement, as proposals to amend the Articles of Association or dissolve the company require that the Danish State participates in the general meeting and supports the proposals.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nEach year at the annual general meeting, the shareholders elect six to eight board  members. In addition, our employees may elect members corresponding to half of the board members elected by the general meeting  pursuant to Danish mandatory rules.  Employee elections are held every four years.\n\nFor the time being, our Board of Directors comprises nine members, six members elected by the general meeting and three members elected by the employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the overall management of the company. The Board of Directors lays down the company's strategy and makes decisions concerning major investments and divestments, the capital base, key policies, control and audit matters, risk management, and significant operational issues. You can see the most important tasks in 2020 on the next page.\n\nThe Board monitors and oversees progress related to \u00d8rsted's climate change strategy, including our ambitious net-zero carbon reduction targets for scope 1-3 emissions. We routinely integrate climate change considerations when setting our strategic direction, reviewing\n\nsustainability risks, setting performance objectives, deciding on our capital allocation, and when approving and overseeing major investments, acquisitions, and divestments.\n\nThe Board of Directors conducted its annual board evaluation in November 2020. The basis for the evaluation was a questionnaire that the individual members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee had been asked to complete, and individual interviews conducted by an external advisor. At the evaluation, all members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board expressed that the board is strong, aligned, well-functioning, and possesses the right competencies to govern the company. Moreover, all members found board discussions inclusive and open to the viewpoints of all members. As the company expands to new markets and technologies, there are some development areas that need to be further explored and evaluated, e.g. ensuring that the Board of Directors has the right competency coverage in the long-term and prioritizing succession as a more important part of the board agenda.\n\nThe Board of Directors has prepared an overview of the competences required on the board. The list of required competences can be found at orsted.com/competences-overview.",

        "page_content": "## Committees of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors has appointed two committees from among its members: an Audit & Risk Committee and a Nomination & Remuneration Committee which assist the Board of Directors within selected areas.\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee\n\nDieter Wemmer (Chairman), J\u00f8rgen Kildahl, and Peter Korsholm are the members of the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nThe committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the financial and ESG reporting process (including key accounting estimates and judgements), the liquidity and capital structure development, financial and business-related risks, compliance with statutory and other requirements from public authorities, internal controls as well as IT security in operational and administrative areas as well as cybersecurity.\n\nMoreover, the committee approves the framework governing the work of the company's external and internal auditors (including limits for non-audit services), evaluates the external auditors' independence and qualifications, and monitors the company's whistle-blower scheme.\n\nIn 2020, the committee approved an update of the internal control and WACC frameworks. The committee also reviewed the financial impact of COVID-19 and the divestments of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses, and our LNG activities. Furthermore, it assessed the claim made by the Danish Tax Agency requiring Danish taxation of our British offshore wind farms Walney Extension and Hornsea 1, and it reviewed the progress in IT security.\n\nOur Internal Audit function reports to the Audit & Risk Committee and is independent of our administrative management structures. Internal Audit enhances and protects the organisational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice, and insight. The focus for Internal Audit is auditing and advising on our core processes, governance, risk management, control processes, and IT security.\n\nThe Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for managing our whistle-blower scheme. Internal Audit receives and handles any reports submitted. Our employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistleblower scheme or through our management system. In 2020, four substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistle-blower scheme. Three cases concerned violation of good business conduct policies and one case concerned violation of administrative procedures. The four cases had  consequences for the individuals involved. None of the reported cases were critical to our business and caused no adjustments to our financial results. Whistle-blower cases are taken very seriously, and we continuously enhance the awareness of good business conduct, e.g. through education as well as awareness campaigns, to minimise future similar cases.\n\nYou can read more about the Audit & Risk Committee and the terms of reference for the committee at orsted.com/ audit-risk-committee.\n\n## Nomination & Remuneration Committee\n\nThomas Thune Andersen (Chairman), Lene Skole, and Lynda Armstrong are the members of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe committee assists the Board of Directors in matters regarding the composition, remuneration, and performance of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee.\n\nIn 2020, the committee discussed, among other matters, our increasing global footprint and the impact on our pay mix. It was decided to introduce a higher level of variance within paymix on different markets to be more in line with local market terms.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the EU Shareholder Rights Directive II in Danish legislation, the committee reviewed the remuneration policy for the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, and an updated version of the remuneration policy was subsequently approved by the annual general meeting in March 2020. The committee also spent time on the separate 2019 remuneration report covering the Board of Directors and the Executive Board as the company decided to reflect the new regulatory requirements, which apply from 2020, already in the 2019 reporting.\n\nAdditionally, the committee has reviewed changes in the peer group used for benchmarking \u00d8rsted's relative TSR in the share-based long-term incentive programme. The changes were made to better match \u00d8rsted's current global footprint and business mix and to address the changes in the peer group's business mix and footprint.\n\nFinally, the committee has been engaged in the recruitment of Mads Nipper as new CEO as of 1 January 2021, following Henrik Poulsen's resignation in June 2020.\n\nYou can read more about the Nomination & Remuneration Committee and the terms of reference for the committee at orsted.com/ nomination-remuneration-committee.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and risk management\n\nRisks are a natural and integral part of our business activities, and risk diversification is an important part of \u00d8rsted's strategy. Our risk profile changes continuously. Our aim is to mitigate our risks and reduce them to an acceptable level through risk management.\n\nWe are exposed to several risks in connection with our business activities. In addition to operational, business, and environmental risks, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, and commodity prices as well as credit and insurance risks. The purpose of our risk management is to identify and quantify our risks and decide how best to manage and mitigate them. We assess the extent to which individual risks are acceptable or perhaps even desirable as well as the extent to which these risks can be reduced to ensure an optimum balance between risk and return.\n\nA large part of our earnings is generated from offshore wind, with Continental Europe and the UK being the key contributors. However, with our expansions into the US and Asia Pacific, our future earnings will be spread across more geographical regions and technologies. Therefore, political and other macroeconomic factors play an important role in our risk management. When we invest in new assets and activities or divest assets, the consolidated risks associated with our portfolio changes. Therefore, we assess the impact of a given decision on the portfolio upfront.\n\nWe work systematically with risks. All business units and selected staff functions identify and prioritise business risks. An assessment is made of the potential financial impact of individual risks, and whether they are of a short-term (0-2 years), medium-term (2-5 years), long-term (5+ years), or of recurring nature. All our risks are then consolidated and evaluated at Group level. The ultimate responsibility for all the individual risks rests with a member of the Executive Committee. As for business risks, similar processes are in place for identifying and prioritising risks related to sustainability and legal compliance.\n\nThe top five business risks identified during 2020 are shown to the right where they are illustrated based on their potential impact (post-risk mitigation) on our value and credit metrics over the next years. You can read more about these risks on the following pages.\n\nBrexit is not in itself part of our top five business risks as we do not believe the UK leaving the EU will result in fundamental changes to the UK's energy policy. Announcements by the UK government show that the UK is committed to a clean, renewable energy future, and\n\noffshore wind is the backbone of this green vision. As we have entered 2021 with a signed Brexit agreement, the immediate short-term risk of a sharp GBP depreciation has vanished. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the remaining negotiations, GBP weakness cannot be ruled out over the coming years.\n\nSuch a scenario could result in lower UK power prices than currently observed, but the government-introduced carbon price floor (CPF) will prevent a dramatic decline. These effects are embedded in our second-largest risk in our top five business risks, namely currencies and commodity prices.\n\n## Top /five.tf business risks Effect on our value and credit metric\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQuantification of risks is based on a scenario where the risk occurs with 10 % probability (P90).

        "page_content": "The risks related to sustainability and legal compliance are assessed using different parameters. Hence, we do not show a consolidated picture of our combined risks.\n\nWe are also exposed to risks which have a very small probability of occurring, but which could potentially impact our finances and/or reputation substantially. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- -   fatal  injuries\n- -  1,000-year storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or earthquakes, especially in Taiwan, which may lead to the loss of offshore and onshore wind farms\n- -  broken pipes at the Nybro Gas Treatment Plant in Denmark which may lead to personal injury and damage to the environment\n- -  breakdowns at power plants that may lead to personal injury and loss of assets.\n\nAfter risk-reducing measures are implemented, the Executive Committee assess whether the level of each risk is appropriate, or if it is slightly or significantly higher than the desired level. If the risk level is still too high, further risk-reducing measures are initiated to the extent possible.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nWe address climate-related risks and opportunities as an integral part of our daily business, and we report as recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These risks and opportunities are directly linked to our green vision and strategy. We seek to exploit climate-related opportunities through our development and construction of renewable generation capacity and adjacent sustainable activities. At the same time, we seek to reduce\n\nboth our transitional and physical climaterelated risks in the short, medium, and long term. We do that by, among other things:\n\n- -   encouraging regulators and other public authorities to set ambitious targets for the build-out of renewable capacity and regulatory frameworks which support this\n- -   continuously working to improve the future competitiveness of green technologies, i.e. lowering the levelised cost of electricity (LCoE)\n- -  assessing acute and chronic weather development; especially wind speeds and patterns, but also the temperature and precipitation levels in general\n- -  taking extreme weather conditions and other relevant factors into account when we design and construct our assets.\n\nIn that way, we seek to avoid ending up with stranded assets or assets and activities with a significantly lower value than originally expected.\n\nWhen we prepare business cases for investment in new assets or activities, we take climate-related risks and opportunities into account by assessing the expected changes in the green technology mix. On this basis, we assess the expected derived impact on input and output prices of energy, including the price development of components and services to be used for the construction of these assets as part of our LCoE analysis.\n\nA description of the most significant sustainability risks can be found in our sustainability report.\n\nIn 2019, we concluded a climate scenario analysis, assessing the resilience of our offshore business in two potential scenarios of climate change: a 1.5-2 \u00b0C and 3-4 \u00b0C temperature rise by 2100, respectively. The study was conducted through research, interviews, and workshops and concluded that our offshore business is well positioned to manage climate-related risks of both transitional and physical nature. Please refer to our CDP climate change disclosure for detailed descriptions here.\n\n## Development in risks in 2020\n\nThis year, cybersecurity risks have been elevated into our top five business risks, which means that construction risks have been excluded as a top risk for \u00d8rsted. Additionally, we have seen relative changes between the risks compared to last year's annual report. Inflation and interest rates are considered our number one risk. We have carved out currencies from inflation and interest rates and incorporated it into our second-largest risk alongside commodity prices. The change is motivated by the overlapping mitigation efforts in hedging currency and commodity price risks.\n\nAs the offshore market continues to grow and mature, an increasing number of players have entered the market of renewable energy generation. This has put pressure on prices in auctions and tenders in excess of what can be explained by the LCoE development. Therefore, the risk has been elevated to our third-largest risk.\n\nWe continue to see increased development and construction risks in our US offshore\n\nprojects compared to projects in more mature markets. In 2020, the continued delays in the permitting process from the Bureau of Energy Management (BOEM), the US federal regulator, had an adverse impact on our portfolio. The risk is our fourth-largest.\n\nIn this year's annual report, cybersecurity risks have entered our top five business risks. Major cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, and we see an increasing number of cybercriminals looking to financially harm companies. As we grow into an ever-larger global renewable energy player, the threat of cyberattacks has increased.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected lives, livelihoods, and economies around the world. At \u00d8rsted, we activated our Corporate Crisis Management Organisation (CCMO) on 12 March 2020 to closely monitor developments in the pandemic, enabling us to respond in a timely manner, thereby minimising health and safety risks and ensuring business continuity.\n\nDespite an agile pandemic response system, we have seen adverse impacts of the pandemic, mainly related to our supply chain and the power prices in the markets where we operate. COVID-19-related lockdowns during spring and summer led to risks of delays at some of our offshore construction sites. Due to our experience and the flexibility in our timelines, we have been able to progress on some other project milestones. Therefore, we assess the probability of COVID-19-related risks materialising and causing significant negative impact on \u00d8rsted to be low.",

However, fixed nominal subsidies from wind assets in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands and fixed-price power purchase agreements (PPAs) from assets in the US and Taiwan are exceptions to this, as are fixed nominal cash flows related to debt. We are exposed to inflation risks in these markets where an increase in inflation will adversely impact the expected real value of the revenue.\n\nOur farm-down model of funding future wind farms through divestments is exposed to interest rate risks as wind assets are more attractive to buyers when interest rates are low compared to other financial assets with similar risk profiles.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in interest rates and inflation may adversely impact our earnings and farm-down model, thereby affecting the value of our assets.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nOur inflation and interest rate exposures are managed by matching assets and liabilities in the same currency and with similar payment structures. Hence, our European fixed nominal subsidies are offset by EUR-denominated fixed-rate debt. The risks that arise from Taiwan and US onshore and offshore projects can be reduced by obtaining matching-duration fixedrate debt denominated in the same currency as the revenue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Description\n\nOur main currency exposure relates to GBP due to our substantial investments in offshore wind farms in the UK. However, our recent international expansion has increased our USD and NTD exposure.\n\nWe are primarily exposed to power price risks from the sale of our wind-based power generation in the US, the UK, and Denmark. In addition, we are exposed to risks caused by differences in local node prices and market hub prices in our Onshore business, which impact the realised revenue generation.\n\nTo a lesser extent, we are exposed to oil and gas price risks related to sourcing contracts for gas to oil-indexed prices as well as the sale of gas at fixed prices. Finally, power generation from our CHP plants entails an exposure to power prices and fuel prices. As the green transformation in \u00d8rsted advances, the main fuel at our CHP plants is biomass. The market for biomass has less liquidity than e.g. gas and coal, adding a risk to which we are exposed.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely impact our earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increased competition leading to price pressure\n\n## Description\n\nAs the offshore industry has become more mature and established, competition has increased with new market players entering. The industry is becoming more global, and diversification of developers is increasing. We expect a diversified competitive landscape going forward, including oil majors, utilities, institutional investors, and regional developers.\n\nIn offshore wind, the competitive auction and tender mechanics being implemented across the various regions and markets are also becoming more diversified. While the mature European markets increasingly look to include innovation and system integration (e.g. storage and renewable hydrogen) to play an increasingly important role in auctions and tenders, developing markets in both Europe, the US, and Asia Pacific often emphasise costs and job creation as determination criteria. For offshore wind, this necessitates a flexible approach to remain competitive across the different markets and implies the need to retain strong supplier engagement and cost standardisation.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nThere is a risk that we will not win the targeted capacity in the auctions and tenders in which we participate, or that our value creation from the projects we win ends up being lower than targeted.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe will continue to utilise portfolio-scale advantages and knowhow gained from previously executed projects to develop supply chain solutions and reduce costs and risks in order to maximise our ability to win future projects. Furthermore, early commitments and both global and regional framework agreements are being made to secure capacity.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe hedge currencies and commodity prices for up to five years, and in some cases longer, to reduce cash flow fluctuations. We hedge more of the risk in the first years and less in the later years. This is due to decreasing market liquidity and increasing uncertainty about generated volumes.\n\nOn the medium- to long-term horizon, the currency risk is managed by matching income and liabilities in the same currencies. For our USD and NTD exposures from new markets, we do not have an existing portfolio against which we can net construction payments. Therefore, we seek to hedge the price risk in the near term, while simultaneously hedging a similar, but opposite, exposure in the longer term.\n\nAs an alternative to hedging power, we seek to enter into long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs), under which we sell power from our renewable assets. CPPAs or hedges with a duration of 10-15 years are often a prerequisite for obtaining tax equity partnerships in the US. In addition, CPPAs will be a means to mitigate merchant risk for offshore wind farms to be built without subsidies. Our awarded offshore wind farms situated off the US East Coast are guaranteed a fixed price for a period of approximately 20 years and thus, no additional merchant risk has been introduced.",

Contrary to the EU markets, it is possible in the US to participate in auctions and be awarded projects where consent and/or grid connections are not yet secured. Thus, following an award, project development entails regulatory risks in obtaining key consents as well as securing grid connection(s).\n\nFurthermore, local content requirements and the immature US offshore wind market also lead to increased construction risks in the US, such as the availability of locally manufactured components and harbour facilities.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nTo maintain project schedules, permits, consents, and approvals from federal, state-level, and local authorities must be obtained in due time. Securing sufficient grid connection capacity on time is also key. Delays within these areas can lead to project delays and/or cost overruns which may reduce the value of the projects.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe mitigate the risks by having sufficient float in our project timelines and by proactively engaging with all stakeholders. Furthermore, we secure grid connection capacity through an approach of having multiple points of interconnections available to us in due time relative to wind turbine commissioning. We fulfil part of the local content obligations by investing in harbour infrastructure, thereby also securing critical harbour capacity for staging and load-out of wind turbines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\n## Description\n\nIn recent years, several major cyberattacks have been launched against companies around the world, and we see growth in serious cyber operations in closer proximity to our business presence.\n\nWe assess cybersecurity risks by identifying: 1) protection level and possible residual exploitation scenarios for our systems and processes, 2) threat intelligence on main types of actors and characteristics for intention and capabilities, and 3) financial impact.\n\nCorrespondingly, we have a strong focus on IT security. As we possess critical energy generation capacity and own various types of intellectual property rights, we are a potential target for cyberattacks or industrial espionage.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nMinor digital risk events, such as viruses and attempted break-ins, are everyday risks without significant impact. However, major cyberattacks or events may impact all or part of our shared infrastructure for administrative systems or industrial control systems. For the latter, the impact could range from a single asset to potentially all assets and activities in the company. Cyberattacks of a certain size can be costly if it forces us to shut down operations for a period of time.\n\n## Mitigating initiatives\n\nOur mitigation effort towards cyberattacks is twofold. First, we continually improve our resilience against cyberattacks and other threats across \u00d8rsted through our security programme. This is carried out through workshops across business units to assess the cyber risks. This is combined with an advanced security architecture, spanning the entire company. Second, we are participating in relevant forums across the energy sector to harvest ideas and contribute with information and experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Legal compliance\n\n## Description\n\nRisks associated with legal compliance are assessed based on financial and reputational significance and probability. Our most significant risks are tax law, financial regulations, and tender law. We operate in tax regimes with different tax rules and rates, and our tax affairs span over corporate tax compliance, transfer pricing, and indirect taxes. We are subject to several financial regulations, such as REMIT, MAR, EMIR, Dodd Frank, MiFID, SFTR, and AML1. The financial regulations are relevant for a large part of our activities. Lastly, many of our purchases of goods, services, and work in the EU are subject to EU and local tender rules.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to comply with the above-mentioned rules and regulations may result in severe legal sanctions, such as imprisonment, fines, and damage claims, but also in delays in sourcing processes and subsequent risk of delay of projects.\n\n## Mitigating initiatives\n\nWe are well under way with the implementation of a comprehensive tax control framework and mandatory compliance, including transfer pricing documentation, in line with OECD recommendations and local requirements. This is being prepared on a contemporaneous basis to mitigate our tax risks. We have implemented comprehensive policies, procedures, training, and controls for relevant parts of our business to ensure compliance with financial regulations. To ensure compliance with tender laws, our legal team carries out training courses for procurement teams in basic tender law and practical courses on how to apply the standard tender documents and works closely together with Procurement on major tenders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under business performance, the market value adjustment of our energy hedges where we do not apply IFRS hedge accounting are deferred and recognised in the profit (loss) in the year in which the hedged exposure materialises. Energy hedges comprise hedging of energy and associated currency risks as well as fixed-price physical gas and power contracts. According to IFRS, the market value of energy hedges where we do not apply IFRS hedge accounting are recognised on an ongoing basis in the profit (loss) for the year. The  difference between IFRS and business performance is specified in the 'Adjustments' column. Read more about the business performance principle in note 1.6 'Business performance'.",

The loss of DKK 301 million transferred to the income statement mainly consist of early termination of interests rate swaps related to the termination of the project financing of Block Island.\n\nValue adjustments transferred to the income statement according to the adjustment column amounting to DKK 547 million mainly consist of losses on gas hedges that are recognised in the income statement under business performance, but where the losses under IFRS were recognised in previous periods, as the gains and losses under business performance are deferred to the period to which the hedged exposure relates.\n\n## Exchange rate adjustments:\n\nForeign exchange losses relating to net investments in foreign enterprises amounting to DKK -5,104 million were in 2020 primarily attributable to an decrease of 6 % in the GBP exchange rate and a decrease of 9 % in the USD exchange rate. A large part of the net investments were hedged.",

Trade payables relating to purchases of intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment are not recognised in change in net working capital.\n\n'Change in work in progress' consists of elements in contract assets, contract liabilities, construction management agreements related to construction of offshore wind farms, construction of offshore transmission assets (inventory), and  related trade payables.\n\n'Change in tax equity partner liabilities' relates to cash contributions from tax equity partners and repayment hereof through production tax credits (PTCs) and\n\nother tax attributes to tax equity partners. See also note 4.5 'Tax equity liabilities'.\n\n'Cash flows from investing activities' comprise payments in connection with the purchase and sale of non-current assets and enterprises as well as the purchase and sale of securities that are not recognised as cash and cash equivalents.\n\n'Cash flows from financing activities' comprise changes in the size or composition of equity and loans, including instalments on leases and net proceeds related to interest-bearing tax equity liabilities. Proceeds from raising of short-term repo loans are presented net.\n\nCash flows in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the average exchange rates for the month in question, unless these differ significantly from the rates at the transaction date.",

        "page_content": "## 1.1 Significant changes in the current reporting period\n\nThe financial position and performance of the \u00d8rsted Group was particularly affected by the following events and transactions during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COVID-19\n\n## COVID-19\n\nWe have analysed the impacts that COVID-19 had on our financial reporting. Our operations and financial performance remains very solid despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and we identified no significant impact on our financial reporting in 2020. We did not receive any governmental support in relation to COVID-19.\n\nFor a detailed discussion about the \u00d8rsted Group's performance and financial position, please refer to our management's review on pages 4 to 60.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Divestments/discontinued operations\n\n## Danish power distribution, residential customers, and city light businesses\n\nIn August, we completed the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses to SEAS-NVE (now Andel). The divestment marks an important strategic milestone for \u00d8rsted and completes our portfolio transformation into a global renewable energy company. The transaction resulted in proceeds of DKK 20.5 billion and a gain of DKK 10.9 billion. See note 3.4 'Divestment of enterprises'.\n\n## LNG\n\nIn December, we completed the divestment of our LNG business to Glencore, resulting in a cash outflow of DKK 1.5 billion. See note 3.4 'Divestment of enterprises'.\n\n## UK B2B gas and power portfolio\n\nIn September, we signed an agreement to divest the vast majority of our UK B2B customer portfolio to Total Gas & Power. We will keep some of our strategic long-term partners and customers to whom we deliver risk management products. We expect the transaction to close in Q1 2021.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nAs the remaining selling price regarding the divestment of our Oil & Gas business back in 2017 was received in 2020 from INEOS, we decided to end the reporting on discontinued operations as per 31 December 2020. Remaining provisions regarding tax indemnifications and payments related to the Fredericia stabilisation plant has been transferred to continuing operations at 31 December 2020. See note 3.7 'Discontinued operations'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Cease the use of business performance as of 1 January 2021\n\nWith the implementation of IFRS 9 in 2018, it has become significantly easier to apply IFRS hedge accounting to our commodity hedges. We have concluded that IFRS 9 can replace our business performance principle, and therefore, we will only be reporting based on IFRS from 1 January 2021. Thus, the business performance and adjustment columns will not be included in our financial reporting any more. This will simplify our reporting and avoid potential confilicts with future reporting requirements for alternative performance measures. See notes 1.4 ' Implementation of new standards or changed accounting standards and interpretations' and 1.6 'Business performance' for more information.",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 Basis of preparation\n\nThis section provides an overall description of the accounting policies applied in our consolidated financial statements as well as the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting requirements. We provide a more detailed description of the accounting policies applied in the specific notes. Key accounting estimates and judgements and new and  amended IFRS standards and interpretations are discussed in detail in notes 1.3 'Key accounting estimates and judgements' and 1.4 'Implementation of new or changed accounting standards and interpretations', respectively.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2020 comprise the consolidated financial statements of \u00d8rsted A/S and its subsidiaries (the Group) as well as separate financial statements for the parent company, \u00d8rsted A/S. See page 178 for the parent company's accounting policies.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act (\u00c5rsregnskabsloven).\n\nThe financial statements are presented in million Danish kroner (DKK), unless otherwise stated.\n\n## M/e.ss01a/s.ss01u/r.ss01/e.ss01m/e.ss01n/t.ss01 ba/s.ss01i/s.ss01\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis, except for derivatives, gas in non-Danish storage facilities, financial instruments in the trading portfolio, and carbon emission allowances in the trading portfolio which are measured at market value.\n\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently in the financial year and for the comparative figures.\n\n## Principles for consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of \u00d8rsted A/S (the parent company) and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S. See more in note 8.5 'Company overview'.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a consolidation of the  parent company's and the individual subsidiaries' financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nIntra- group income, expenses, shareholdings, balances, and dividends as well as realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nUnrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of our ownership interest. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains to the extent that there has been no impairment.\n\nEnterprises are accounted for as associates if we hold or have the ability to exercise, directly or indirectly, 20-50 % of the voting rights and do not exercise control. However, we carry out a specific assessment of our ability to exercise influence, including our ability to influence financial and operational decisions and thus our return. Enterprises that satisfy the criteria for joint control are accounted for as investments in joint ventures, unless the nature of the joint arrangement is considered a joint operation, see our key accounting judgement for 'Consolidation method for partnerships' in the next column.\n\nOur shares in joint operations are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the Group's own assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions between fully consolidated enterprises and joint operations is eliminated.\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Consolidation method for partnerships\n\nOn establishment of partnerships and in connection with any restructuring of existing partnerships, we assess whether the structure is a joint arrangement under shared control. For joint arrangements, we subsequently assess whether they are joint ventures or joint operations.\n\nIn assessing joint operations, we look at:\n\n- -   the corporate form of the operation\n- -   whether we are only entitled to the net profit (loss) or to income and expenses resulting from the operation.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the parties buy or are assigned all output, for example the power generated, will lead to the structure being considered a joint operation if we have joint control.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency translation\n\nFor each reporting enterprise in the Group, items are determined in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the  individual reporting enterprise operates (functional currency). Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of each enterprise are accounted for as transactions in foreign currencies and translated on initial recognition at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Exchange differences arising between the exchange rate on the transaction date and on the date of payment are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income or expenses.\n\nReceivables, payables, and other monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and on the date at which the receivable or payable arose is  recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income or expenses.\n\nFor foreign subsidiaries, joint operations, associates, and joint ventures, the statements of comprehensive income are translated at monthly average exchange rates insofar as these do not deviate materially from the actual exchange rates at the transaction dates. Balance sheet items are  translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date.\n\nAll exchange differences are recognised in profit (loss) for the year, except for exchange differences arising on:\n\n- -  translation of the opening equity of these entities at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date\n- -   translation of the statements of comprehensive income of these enterprises from 'the average-for-the-month exchange rates' to 'the exchange rates on the balance sheet/uni00A0date'\n- -   translation of balances accounted for as part of the total net investment\n- -  translation of the portion of loans and derivatives that has been entered into to hedge the net investment in these enterprises, and that provides an effective hedge against corresponding foreign exchange gains (losses) on the net investment in the enterprise.\n\nThe above types of exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. Such exchange rate adjustments are divided between the equity of the parent company and the equity of the non-controlling interests. On full or partial divestment of the net investment, the accumulated exchange rate adjustments are recognised as follows:\n\n- -  Disposal resulting in loss of control: The accumulated exchange rate adjustments, including any associated hedges, are recognised in the profit (loss) for the year if a foreign exchange gain (loss) is realised by\n- the selling enterprise. Any foreign exchange gain (loss) is transferred to the item in which the gain (loss) from the disposal is recognised. The part of the foreign currency translation reserve that relates to noncontrolling interests is not transferred to profit (loss) for the year.\n- -  Disposal not resulting in loss of control: A proportionate share of the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred from the parent company shareholders' share of equity to the minority shareholders' share of equity.\n\nRepayment of balances that are considered part of the net investment does not constitute a partial disposal of the subsidiary.\n\n## European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\nAs we are a Group with securities listed on a regulated market within the EU, we are from 2021 required to prepare our annual report using the XHTML format and to tag the  primary consolidated financial statements using Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). This iXBRL format makes the annual report readable for both human and machines.\n\nThe annual report we submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with some technical files, all included in a ZIP file named ORST-2020-12-31.zip. For convenience, a PDF version of the annual report is published in line with previous years.\n\n## Key definitions:\n\n- -  XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is a text-based markup language used to structure and mark up content such as text, images, and hyperlinks in documents that are displayed as Web pages.\n- -  iXBRL tags (or Inline XBRL tags) are hidden meta-information embedded in the source code of an XHTML document in accordance with the Inline XBRL 1.1 specification, which enables the conversion of XHTML-formatted information into a machine-readable XBRL data record by appropriate software. iXBRL tags shall comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation.\n- -  The tagging process is a process where iXBRL tags are applied to financial statement line items, etc. If a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy is created. Extensions have to be anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n- -  Taxonomy is an electronic dictionary of business reporting elements used to report business data. A taxonomy element is an element defined in a taxonomy that is used for the machine-readable labeling of information in an XBRL data record.",

The estimates and judgements are based on assumptions concerning future developments which affect our application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, sales, costs, cash flows, and related disclosures. Actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated and judgements made, as more detailed information becomes available.\n\nWe regularly reassess these estimates and judgements, based among other things on\n\nhistorical experience, the current situation in the financial markets, and a number of other relevant factors, ie. the update in the annual estimated production.\n\nAccounting estimates, judgements and assump tions which may entail a risk of material adjustments in subsequent years are listed in the table below.\n\nIn addition, we make judgements when we  apply the accounting policies.\n\nReference is made to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates and judgements as well as the assumptions applied.\n\n| Note              | Note                                                   | Key accounting estimates and judgements                                                                                                                                             | Estimate/  judgement   | Impact of accounting  estimates and judgements   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| /one.tf./two.tf   | Basis of preparation                                   | Consolidation method for partnerships                                                                                                                                               | Judgement              |                                                  |\n| /two.tf./two.tf   | Revenue                                                | Assessment of assumptions for recognition of revenue from the  construction of offshore wind farms over time /one.tf Assumptions for the determination of the expected selling pice | Judgement              |                                                  |\n|                   |                                                        | and costs /one.tf                                                                                                                                                                   | Estimate               |                                                  |\n| /two.tf./six.tf   | Other operating income and  expenses                   | Estimates for variable selling price related to divestments of offshore  wind farms and offshore transmission assets                                                                | Estimate               |                                                  |\n| /three.tf./one.tf | Intangible assets, and property,  plant, and equipment | Assumptions used in value-in-use calculations for impairment testing                                                                                                                | Estimate               |                                                  |\n| /three.tf./two.tf | Provisions                                             | Assumptions for provisions                                                                                                                                                          | Estimate               |                                                  |\n| /five.tf./two.tf  | Tax on profit (loss) for the year                      | Estimates regarding recognition of income taxes                                                                                                                                     | Estimate               |                                                  |\n\n- 1 Only relevant for comparatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHornsea 1, off the Yorkshire coast, the UK.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact of accounting estimates and judgements relates to objectivity and business practice.\n\nVery objective/market-conforming Objective/partially conforming Partially subjective/partially distinctive Subjective/distinctive for \u00d8rsted",

We implement new IFRS standards and interpretations from their mandatory effective dates at the latest.\n\nEffective from 1 January 2020, we have implemented the following amendments to standards (IAS and IFRS) and interpretations:\n\n- -  Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material.\n- -  Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business.\n- -  Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\n\nThe adoption of the new and amended standards has not impacted our consolidated financial statements for 2020.\n\n## Cease the use of business performance as of 1 January 2021\n\nWith the implementation of IFRS 9 in 2018, it has become significantly easier to apply IFRS hedge accounting to our commodity hedges. We have concluded that IFRS 9 can replace our business performance principle, for which reason we only will be reporting based on IFRS from 1 January 2021. Thus, the business performance and adjustment columns will no longer be included. This will simplify our reporting and avoid  potential conflicts with future reporting requirements for alternative performance measures.\n\nAmong other things, IFRS 9 has made it easier to apply hedge accounting by the removal of the 80-125 % effectiveness requirement which can be difficult to comply with at all times when we engage in proxy hedging. An  example of proxy hedging is when we hedge our power exposure 4-5 years into the future with gas hedges due to illiquidity in the market for power hedges with this time horison.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the value of our business performance hedges deferred to a future period amounted to a loss of DKK 2,685 million. This loss has already been recognised in the income statement under IFRS, as we have not previously applied hedge accounting for these. Consequently, for the period 2021-2025, EBITDA (according to IFRS) will be higher with a similar amount compared to what the business performance EBITDA would have been in the same period, if we had continued to report based on this principle. See also note 1.6.\n\n## New standards and interpretations\n\nIASB has issued amended standards which have not yet entered into force, and which have consequently not been incorporated into the consolidated financial statements for 2020. None of these amended standards and interpretations are expected to have any significant impact on our financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInstallation of the two wind turbines that form Coastal Virginia Wind, off the coast of Virginia Beach, the US.",

Consequently as of 1 January 2021, we will apply hedge accounting to all commodity hedges and related currency hedges except for hedges related to our gas portfolio which account for approx. 14 % of our total commodity hedges. Until we are ready to apply hedge accounting to these hedges, the change in fair value will be recognised through profit or loss. We expect to implement hedge accounting to hedges in our gas portfolio during the first half of 2021.\n\n## Description of business performance\n\nIn 2011, we introduced an alternative performance measure, business performance, as a supplement to the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The business performance results reflect our internal risk management and show the results for the period under review. Under the business performance principle, the value of the hedging transaction is deferred and recognised for the period in which the hedged risk materialises. This is illustrated in the example overleaf.\n\nOur reason for introducing the business per formance principle was that:\n\n- -  we could not achieve the same timing of recognition of our commercial exposure and hedging contracts in accordance with the IFRS rules, for example with respect to option premiums and certain commercial fixed-price contracts\n- -  there was a high risk that the hedging contracts were not consistent with the IFRS hedge accounting rules, requiring us to recognise the hedging contracts at  market value with value adjustments via the income statement, whereas our commercial exposure is accrued.\n\n| Type of hedging                                                                                                       | IFRS                                                                                                                                                                              | Business performance                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hedging of energy and associated  currency risks as well as fixed-price  physical gas and power contracts             | Market value adjustments of power hedges related  to Onshore are recognised in other comprehensive  income.

The difference between the two performance measures is shown in a separate column, 'Adjustments'.\n\nTwo types of contracts are included in the business performance principle:\n\n- -  Hedging contracts concerning energy and related currencies.\n- -  Commercial contracts concerning energy recognised at market value (typically fixedprice physical gas and power contracts).\n\nWhen we use hedging instruments which do not fully correspond to the underlying risk, any difference between the hedging instruments and the underlying risk is recognised immediately in the income statement. See note 7.3 ' Energy trading portfolio'. The accounting treatment under business performance is other wise identical to the accounting treatment under IFRS. Our assets, liabilities, cash flows, and equity are consequently not  affected. The accounting treatment of our hedging contracts according to IFRS and business performance is summarised in the table below.",

        "page_content": "## Expected impact on business performance EBITDA from energy and currency hedging\n\nAt 31 December 2020, a loss of DKK 671 million would have been deferred (2019: gain of DKK 1,434 million) and affected business performance  EBITDA in subsequent years if we had continued with the business performance principle. Of this, a gain of DKK 68 million is expected in EBITDA in 2021.\n\nPower prices increased in 2020, which means that the market value of the hedges has decreased as we are selling power. The decrease in the deferred loss on currency hedging is primarily attributable to a decrease in the GBP/ DKK rate causing a gain as we are selling GBP.\n\n## Explanation of the business performance principle\n\nIn year 1, we enter into a contract hedging the price risk associated with Offshore's generation of 1,000GWh in year 5 at GBP 52,000 per GWh. This ensures a total  revenue of GBP 52 million. In year 5, the cost of power has decreased to GBP 45,000 per GWh, which means that the hedging contract has a positive market value of GBP 7 million (a hedged price of GBP 52,000 per GWh minus the spot price of GBP 45,000 per GWh). This means that we ensure that the total income, including the hedging transaction, is still GBP 52 million. The income of GBP 52 million consists of a gain from the hedging contract\n\nof GBP 7 million and GBP/uni00A045/uni00A0million from the sale of 1,000 GWh at a spot price of GBP 45,000 per GWh. The financial impact of the hedging transaction in years 1-5 is shown in the table. Under the business performance principle, the hedging transaction is recognised in the income statement in year 5, i.e. at the same time as the hedged contract with a positive market value of GBP 7 million. The value development is, however, recognised continuously in the income statement according to IFRS. Upon the expiry of the contract in year 5, the total effect on results over the period is the same under the IFRS and the business performance principle. Only the timing differs.\n\n## Expected impact on EBITDA from energy and currency hedging, DKKm\n\n|                                                         | Deferred for subsequent recognition   at

  sale of gas or power in the market, e.g. North Pool, TTF, NBP\n- -   transmission assets for offshore wind farms at farm-down.\n\n'Over time' mainly comprises:\n\n- -   construction agreements for offshore wind farms and transmission assets\n- -   long-term contracts with customers to deliver gas, heat, or power.\n\nRevenue for the year (business performance) decreased by 22 % to DKK 52,601 million in 2020. The decrease was mainly due to significantly lower gas and power prices relative to last year, lower gas volumes sold, limited construction work on wind farms for partners, and a decrease in thermal heat generation. This was only partly offset by\n\nthe divestment of the Walney Extension transmission asset and the increase in government grants, mainly due to receipt of CfDs of another 400 MW related to Hornsea 1 from April 2020, ramp-up of  generation from Hornsea 1 and  Borssele 1 & 2 as well as higher wind speeds across the portfolio.\n\nOther revenue in Offshore primarily related to operations and maintenance agreeements, which increased due to ramp-up of generation from Hornsea 1 and Borssele 1 & 2 in 2020.",

These estimates are influenced by our assessment of:\n\n- -   the degree of completion of the individual offshore wind farm and offshore transmission assets\n- -   total expected costs for the individual contract\n- -   the value of the incentive agreements under which we may be paid a bonus for early delivery or have to pay compensation for late delivery\n- -   the guarantee commitments undertaken\n- -   the share of total costs associated with transmission assets which are expected to be covered upon handover, etc.\n\nTherefore, our determination of profit and the recognition of revenue and related contract assets are subject to significant uncertainty. We believe that our estimates are the likely outcome of future events.\n\nThe transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation (unsatisfied or partially satisfied).\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, the overview does not include revenue from contracts with customers to deliver gas, heat, and power, or our operations and maintenance agreements. For these types of goods and services, we recognise the revenue that corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Assumptions for recognition of revenue from the construction of offshore wind farms over time\n\nWe construct offshore wind farms with partners where we construct our partner's share of the wind farm. We assess each construction agreements at the time of conclusion of the agreements. In our view, our partner assumes control of the offshore wind farm in step with construction. This is supported by:\n\n- -   the regular approval of part deliveries\n- -   the approval or rejection of significant variations to the construction\n- -   the partner's takeover of work from the subcontractors, both concerning risk and legal title to the wind farm on an on-going basis\n- -   the milestone payments from the partner.\n\nTherefore, revenue is recognised over time during the construction of the offshore wind farms.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer (transaction price) and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, i.e. VAT. We recognise revenue when we transfer control over a product or service to a customer or a partner.\n\nIf a part of the transaction price is variable, i.e. bonus payments, incentive payments for unmissed deadlines, etc., the variable consideration is recognised in revenue when it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWe adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if the payments exceed twelve months.\n\nSales agreements are divided into individually identifiable performance obligations. If a sales agreement includes several performance obligations, the sales agreement's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation's stand-alone selling price.\n\n## Sal/e.ss01 of ga/s.ss01\n\n## Types of goods and services\n\nRevenue from the sale of gas includes the sale of gas sourced from other producers.\n\n## Timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations and significant estimates\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of the gas is transferred to the buyer. Transfer of control occurs either when the gas is injected into the distribution system or physically delivered to the customer.\n\n## Significant terms of payment and associated estimates and judgements\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of gas at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice.\n\nSome long-term gas sales contracts include clauses which give the right to renegotiate the fixed sales prices. Expectations for the outcomes of\n\nrenegotiations are not included in revenue before we know the outcome of the individual renegotiations.\n\nIn most cases, the consideration for the gas is due when the gas is injected into the distribution system or delivered to the customer. The delivery of gas is invoiced on a monthly basis, and the payment is due within 10-30 days.\n\n## Sal/e.ss01 of pow/e.ss01/r.ss01\n\n## Types of goods and services\n\nRevenue from the sale of power includes the sale of power sourced from other producers.\n\n## Timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations and significant estimates\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of the goods is transferred to the buyer. Transfer of control occurs when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\n## Significant terms of payment and associated estimates and judgements\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts and for longterm agreements on selling power at a fixed price, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice.\n\nIn most cases, the consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.

        "page_content": "## Significant terms of payment and associated estimates and judgements\n\nRevenue from ancillary services consists of fees for having power plants on standby and/or immediately ready to increase or decrease the generation of power by an agreed amount to balance the demand and supply in the system. Ancillary services are considered one performance obligation which is fulfilled over time when the power plants are on standby and/or immediately ready to increase or decrease the generation of power.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts and for longterm agreements on selling power at a fixed price, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice.\n\nIn most cases, the consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\nAncillary services are invoiced on a monthly basis, and consideration is payable when invoiced.\n\n## R/e.ss01v/e.ss01nu/e.ss01 f/r.ss01om con/s.ss01/t.ss01/r.ss01uc/t.ss01ion of off/s.ss01ho/r.ss01/e.ss01 win/d.ss01 fa/r.ss01m/s.ss01\n\n## Types of goods and services\n\nRevenue from construction of offshore wind farms includes development and construction.\n\nThe construction agreements cover the construction phase from design to delivery of an operational asset. The agreement consists of two performance obligations:\n\n- -  Offshore wind farms.\n- -  Offshore transmission assets, if applicable.\n\nThe construction agreements cover our partners' shares of the construction of the wind farm and offshore transmission assets, if applicable.\n\nIf the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost-plus margin.\n\n## Timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations, and significant estimates\n\nWe recognise revenue from the construction agreements over time, using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation because the customer gains control of the offshore wind farm during the construction process. The input method reflects our ongoing transfer of control to the customer. When the outcome of the performance obligation in the contract can be measured reasonably, the construction agreement is measured at the transaction price of the work performed less progress billings, based on the percentage of completion of the contract at balance sheet date and the total expected revenues from the individual contracts.\n\nWe estimate the degree of completion on the basis of an assessment of the work performed, normally calculated as the ratio between the costs incurred and the total costs expected related to the contract in question.\n\nThe transaction price is based on the total expected income from individual contracts. Estimates of revenues are based on the transaction price and the completion degree of the offshore wind farm or offshore transmission asset at the balance sheet date.\n\nEstimates of revenues, costs, and percentage of completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenue or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision come to our knowledge.\n\nAn expected loss is recognised when it is deemed probable that the total construction costs will exceed the total revenue from the individual contracts.\n\n## Significant terms of payment and associated estimates and judgements\n\nThe consideration for the construction of an offshore wind farm consists of a fixed fee and a relatively minor variable fee, depending on when the wind farm can be put into operation.\n\nThe consideration for an offshore transmission asset is a fixed fee.\n\nAfter signing the construction agreement, we carry out an assessment determining when the wind farm\n\nis expected to be completed, and calculate the size of the variable payment on this basis. We only recognise the variable fee when it is highly probable that a subsequent reversal will not take place.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, an assessment is made of the size of the variable payment which can be included in the transaction price. Revenue is adjusted accordingly. The customer pays the fixed consideration based on a payment schedule. The payment schedule is determined and based on the expected progress of the construction and transfer of control to the customer.\n\nIf the work we have performed exceeds invoicing on account, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the work we have performed, a contract liability is recognised.\n\n## G/e.ss01n/e.ss01/r.ss01a/t.ss01ion an/d.ss01 /s.ss01al/e.ss01 of h/e.ss01a/t.ss01\n\nTiming of satisfaction of delivery obligations and significant estimates\n\nHeat is sold under long-term heat contracts.\n\nRevenue is recognised when control is transferred to the customer. Transfer of control occurs when the heat is physically delivered to the customer.\n\nIn connection with a biomass conversion of a CHP plant, the heat customer makes a prepayment to finance the majority of our CAPEX associated with the conversion. The prepayment is recognised as a contract liability. The contract liability is recognised as revenue in step with the transfer of heat to the customer.\n\n## Significant terms of payment and associated estimates and judgements\n\nPayment for the sale of heat consists of fixed costs associated with operations and maintenance of a CHP plant, fuel costs for the generation of heat, and a financial return.\n\nThe delivery of heat is invoiced on a monthly basis, and the payment is due within 10-30 days.\n\n## Di/s.ss01/t.ss01/r.ss01ibu/t.ss01ion an/d.ss01 /t.ss01/r.ss01an/s.ss01mi/s.ss01/s.ss01ion\n\n## Timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations and significant estimates\n\nRevenue from the distribution and transmission of gas and power is recognised when the gas or power is delivered to the buyer, or when the capacity is made available.\n\n## Significant terms of payment and associated estimates and judgements\n\nRevenue is calculated as the amount to which we are entitled when the service is delivered to the customer and invoiced on a monthly basis, and consideration is payable when invoiced.\n\n## O/t.ss01h/e.ss01/r.ss01 /r.ss01/e.ss01v/e.ss01nu/e.ss01\n\n## Types of goods and services\n\nOther revenue primarily includes operations and maintenance agreements and other services.\n\n## Timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations and significant estimates\n\nRevenue from providing services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.\n\nFor fixed-priced contracts, revenue is recognised based on the actual service rendered at the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be rendered because the customer receives and uses the benefits simultaneously. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total labour hours expected.\n\n## Significant terms of payment and associated estimates and judgements\n\nThe consideration for operations and maintenance agreements consists of a fixed fee and a minor variable fee, e.g. bonuses or compensation for wind farm availability.\n\nAvailability bonuses will be recognised on an ongoing basis when it is highly probable that a subsequent reversal will not take place.\n\nFixed-price contracts are invoiced on a monthly basis, and consideration is payable when invoiced. Variable fee services are generally due after the services are rendered.\n\n## Wa/r.ss01/r.ss01an/t.ss01y obliga/t.ss01ion/s.ss01\n\nWe typically have a five-year responsibility to remedy defects that exist at the relevant takeover date when we construct offshore wind farms. These types of warranties are accounted for under IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'. Reference is made to the accounting policy on warranty provisions in note 3.2 'Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities'.",

The Burbo Bank Extension,  Walney Extension, and Hornsea 1 offshore wind farms are under the CfD regime, while our other UK offshore wind farms as well as our Renescience plant are under the ROC regime. We treat the payments from the ROC and CfD schemes as government/uni00A0grants.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nGovernment grants comprise grants for environmentally sustainable power generation, grants for the funding of development projects as well as investment grants, etc.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is  reasonable assurance that the grants will be received.\n\nGrants for the purchase of assets which we recognise in the balance sheet are recognised under deferred revenue and are transferred to other operating income in step with the depreciation of the assets to which the grants relate.\n\nAs grants for power generation are intended as a compensation for the price of power, we systematically recognise the grants under revenue in step with the power generation and thus the related revenue.\n\nFixed feed-in tariffs from our Dutch and German wind farms are also recognised as government grants.\n\n| Government  grants,  DKKm                                                                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf         | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Government grants recognised in profit (loss) for the year under revenue                 | /one.tf/two.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/eight.tf |\n| Government grants recognised in profit (loss) for the year under other  operating income | /four.tf                               | /four.tf                                 |\n| Government grants recognised in the balance sheet                                        | (/four.tf)                             | (/four.tf)                               |\n| Government grants recognised for the year                                                | /one.tf/two.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/eight.tf |\n\n## 2.5  Research and development expenditures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Expensed  research and  development  expenditures  DKKm   | Offshore                          | Onshore                 | Markets &  Bioenergy -   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf  total   | Offshore                          | Onshore                 | Markets &  Bioenergy   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf  total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Research                                                  | /eight.tf/zero.tf                 | -                       |                          | /eight.tf/zero.tf                       | /one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf            | -                       | -                      | /one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                  |\n| Development                                               | /one.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/nine.tf  | /one.tf/two.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/three.tf         | /one.tf,/eight.tf/five.tf/five.tf       | /one.tf,/eight.tf/one.tf/five.tf  | /one.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /eight.tf              | /one.tf,/nine.tf/four.tf/zero.tf        |\n| Total                                                     | /one.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/two.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/three.tf         | /one.tf,/nine.tf/three.tf/five.tf       | /one.tf,/nine.tf/three.tf/five.tf | /one.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /eight.tf              | /two.tf,/zero.tf/six.tf/zero.tf         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the year, we expensed research and development costs amounting to DKK 1,935 million (2019: DKK 2,060 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nResearch costs are costs incurred to analyse and optimise different aspects of offshore wind farm technology (e.g. improving offshore foundations and optimising blade stability and performance).\n\nResearch costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs primarly comprise salaries as well as internal and external costs which can be directly or indirectly attributed to design and development of new offshore and onshore wind farms and the Renescience Northwich plant.\n\nDevelopment costs are expensed until the capitalisation criteria are met.\n\nWhen the capitalisation criteria are met, development costs are capitalised as 'Assets under construction'.",

In 2020, 'Gains on divestment of assets' mainly related to the Hornsea 1 transmission asset where we lowered our assumption regarding the preferred bidder's expected return requirement. In 2019, we had no gains related to divestment of assets.\n\n'Other compensation' is primarily related to compensations regarding outages and curtailments, mainly from TenneT, the German grid operator.\n\nThe increase in 'US tax credits and tax attributes' income was mainly due to the commissioning of three onshore wind farms in 2020.\n\n## Other operating expenses\n\n'Loss on divestment of assets' was primarily related to M&A transaction costs.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn connection with the divestment of ownership interests in offshore wind farms, the gain is recognised on the divestment date as other operating income in the income statement.\n\nGains for future construction of the partner's share of the offshore wind farm are recognised over time in the income statement in step with the construction. See notes 2.2 'Revenue' and 4.2 'Contract assets and liabilities'.\n\nThe accounting policies for 'US tax credits and tax attributes' income is described in note 4.5 'Tax equity liabilities'.\n\n## Divestment of ownership interests in our offshore wind farms\n\nWhen we divest an ownership interest in an offshore wind farm to a partner, we typically also enter into agreements on the future construction and  operation of the offshore wind farm.\n\nContracts in connection with a divestment are typically agreements on:\n\n- -  The sale of shares (divestment of/uni00A0assets) (SPA).\n- -   The future construction of the offshore wind farm (construction agreements).\n- -   The future operation of the offshore/uni00A0wind farm (O&M agreements).\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Estimates for the variable selling price related to divestments of offshore wind farms and offshore transmission assets\n\nWhen we divest an ownership interest in an offshore wind farm and offshore transmission asset to a partner, we consider all terms and activities in the contracts in order to determine the transaction price.\n\nIf the consideration includes a variable amount, we estimate the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for transferring the assets, the wind farm, and the transmission assets to our partner.\n\nThe variable considerations are estimated at contract inception based on future outcome of events, e.g.:\n\n- -   the divestment price of offshore transmission asset through competitive tender process\n- -   the impact on production from future wind farms\n- -   the winning bid of tender revenue stream through a competitive tender process.\n\nWe consider 'the most likely amount' to provide the most appropriate estimate of the expected variable consideration.",

As a condition for the granting of performance share units (PSUs), the participant must own a number of shares in \u00d8rsted corresponding to a portion of the individual participant's annual fixed salary. The portion depends on the employee category and, for our CEO, makes up 75 % of the fixed salary; see/uni00A0the table above for more information. The participants in the programme must invest in \u00d8rsted shares prior to the first granting.\n\nIf the participants fulfil the shareholding requirement at the time of granting, they will be granted a number of PSUs each year, representing a value of 15-20 % (15-40 % in the US) of the annual fixed salary on the date of granting.\n\nThe granted PSUs have a vesting period of approximately three years, after which each PSU entitles the holder, without payment, to receive a number of shares corresponding to 0-200 % of the number of PSUs granted. Assuming no share price development since\n\nthe grant, this would correspond to 0-30 % or 0-40 % (0-80 % in the US) of the fixed salary on the date of grant. The final number of shares for each participant will be determined on the basis of the total shareholder return delivered by \u00d8rsted, benchmarked against ten comparable European energy companies.\n\nThe highest rate (200 %) will be triggered if \u00d8rsted's results, measured as the total return to  shareholders, outperform those of the comparable companies. For each lower ranking, the number of shares granted will fall by 20 percentage points. If, for example, \u00d8rsted ranks third, the participants will be entitled to/uni00A0160 % of the target.\n\nIf \u00d8rsted ranks 11 in the comparison, no shares will be granted to the participants. The right to shares is conditional upon continued employment.\n\n## Retention share programme\n\nThe target group for the share-based retention agreements will typically be employees responsible for vital, long-term projects. The use of these share-based retention agreements will be limited to 25 concurrent agreements with an individual time frame of up to five years. Members of the Executive Board (CEO and CFO) cannot be granted such retention agreements.\n\nThe number of retention share units (RSUs) to be granted will be determined on the basis\n\nof the price of \u00d8rsted's shares at the time of the grant and will be limited to an amount corresponding to a maximum of six months' base pay for the employee in question. At vesting, each RSU will entitle the employee to one \u00d8rsted share free of charge. However, the total value of the shares to be received at vesting will be capped at a maximum of twelve months' base pay for the employee in question.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe share programme is classified as an  equity-based programme as the programme is settled in shares. The market value of the PSUs/RSUs and the  estimated number of PSUs granted are measured at the time of granting and recognised:\n\n- -   in the income statement under employee costs over the vesting period\n- -   as an offset in the balance sheet under equity over the vesting period.\n\nThe valuation of the PSUs/RSUs and the estimate of the number of PSUs/RSUs expected to be granted are carried out as a probability simulation based on \u00d8rsted's expected total shareholder return relative to ten comparable European energy companies. The expect ations are factored into the market value and are not adjusted subsequently. The participants are compensated for any dividend payments by receiving additional PSUs/RSUs.",

We monitor investment projects closely, as a large part of our value is created in the development and construction/uni00A0phases.\n\n## Investments and divestments in 2020\n\nOur gross investments amounted to DKK 27.0 billion in 2020, of which Offshore accounted for 73 %.\n\nInvestments were primarily related to:\n\n- -  offshore wind farms (DKK 19.5 billion), including Borssele 1 & 2 in the Netherlands, Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan, Hornsea 2 in the UK, and Ocean Wind in the US.\n- -  onshore wind and solar farms (DKK 6.6 billion), including Permian Energy Center, Muscle Shoals, Western Trail, Sage Draw, Plum Creek, Willow Creek, and Haystack in the US.\n- -  Markets & Bioenergy (DKK 0.7 billion), mainly relating to the maintenance of the power distribution grid.\n\nDivestments amounted to DKK 19.0 billion and were primarily related to the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses. The transaction resulted in proceeds of DKK 20.5 billion.\n\nFurthermore, we received minor proceeds regarding the divestment of our 10 MW solar farm Oak Solar in New Jersey and our Inbicon production facilities.

Renescience is part of our Markets & Bioenergy segment.\n\nThe impairment losses in 2019 related to Renescience were primarily due to delays in commissioning, increases in CAPEX as we were optimising the waste conversion technology, and changes in cost and price estimates.\n\nThe recoverable amount of Renescience was measured on the basis of its value in use and was based on internal budgets and forecasts. Significant assumptions in the forecasts  included the facility capacity, the waste conversation ratios, and potential revenue streams from increased recycling. The estimated cash flows were discounted with a pre-tax rate of 7.5 %.\n\nIn 2019, production assets related to the battery storage project Carnegie Road were fully impaired by DKK 68 million.\n\n| Buildings                                                | /two.tf/zero.tf-/five.tf/zero.tf years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Offshore wind farms                                      | /two.tf/zero.tf-/three.tf/zero.tf years  |\n| Onshore wind farms                                       | /two.tf/four.tf-/three.tf/zero.tf years  |\n| Production assets, power (thermal)  and district heating | /two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/five.tf years    |\n| Gas transportation system   (marine pipelines)           | /two.tf/zero.tf-/four.tf/zero.tf years   |\n| Fixtures and fittings, tools, and  equipment             | /three.tf-/one.tf/zero.tf years          |\n\n## Key accounting estimates\n\n## Key assumptions for value in use\n\nCGUs are tested for impairment if there is any indication of impairment. In performing an impairment test, we assess whether the recoverable amount exceeds the net book value of a CGU. When performing value-in-use tests, we see if the CGU will be able to generate positive net cash flows sufficient to support the net book values.\n\nValue-in-use calculations are based on expected future cash flows from financial budgets and forecasts and include a number of assumptions and estimates. These assumptions include future market conditions, market prices of power and biofuel, estimated discount rates, estimated useful lives of the projects, etc. The market prices applied are based on available forward prices for a period of up to five years and our best estimate of long-term prices for the remainder of the period.\n\nWhen calculating the recoverable amount of property, plant, and equipment under construction, other material assumptions include the expected completion costs and the commissioning dates.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nRights are measured at cost less accumulated amort isation and impairment losses. Rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated future useful lives, which are 5-20 years.\n\n## Property, plant, and equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment which is not a lease is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost of property, plant, and equipment is depreciated by using the straight-line method, the diminishing-balance method, or the reducing -fraction method. The diminishing-balance method and the reducing-fraction method result in decreasing depreci ation over the useful life. These methods are used for some of our offshore wind farms.\n\nCost comprises purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date the asset is available for use. The cost of self-constructed assets comprises direct and indirect costs of materials, components, sub-suppliers, and labour. Borrowing costs relating to both specific and general borrowing directly attributable to assets under construction with a lengthy construction period are recognised in cost during the construction period. Cost is increased by the present value of the estimated obligations for demolition and decommissioning of assets to the extent that the obligations are recognised as a provision.\n\nSubsequent costs, for example in connection with replacement of parts of an item of property, plant, and equipment, are recognised in the carrying amount of the asset in question when it is  probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group from the expenses incurred. Any residual value of the replaced parts is recognised in the income statement as loss on disposal of non-current assets. Other repair and/uni00A0 maintenance expenses are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as incurred.",

        "page_content": "## Contingent liabilities\n\n## Liability to pay compensation\n\nIn case of any environmental accidents or other types of damage caused by our gas and oil transport, the companies \u00d8rsted Salg & Service A/S and Danish Oil Pipe A/S are liable to pay compensation according to legislation. This also applies if there is no proof of negligence (strict liability). We have taken out insurance to cover any such claims.\n\n## Secondary liability\n\nAs part of the divestment of our Oil & Gas business in 2017, we assumed a secondary liability regarding the decommissioning of offshore installations.\n\n## Litigation\n\nWe are party to a number of court cases and legal disputes. In our assessment, none of these will significantly impact \u00d8rsted's financial position, neither individually nor collectively.\n\nWe have been party to actions relating to the Danish competition authorities' claim that the former Elsam A/S and Elsam Kraft A/S ('Elsam'), now part of \u00d8rsted, charged excessive prices in the Danish wholesale power market in the period 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2006.\n\nThere are no longer any outstanding cases with the competition authorities claiming Elsam infringed competition law, but in connection with the former cases, some energy trading companies, some of their customers, and others have filed claims for damages which are still pending. The biggest claim was filed in 2007 before the Copenhagen Maritime & Commercial Court, amounting to approx. DKK 4.4 billion with addition of litigation interest. In a ruling from March 2020, Elsam was acquitted from the claim, but the plaintiffs have appealed the ruling, and it is now pending before the High Court of Western Denmark.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMonitoring and coordinating all service vessels and helicopters in the North Sea, at the East Coast Hub, at the Port of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, the UK.\n\n\u00d8rsted is involved in ongoing transfer pricing disputes. For further information, we refer to section 5.1 'Approach to taxes'.\n\n## Change of control\n\nSome of our activities are subject to consents, permits, and licences granted by public authorities. We may be faced with a claim for acceptance of any transfer, possibly with additional terms and conditions, if the Danish State holds less than 50 % of the share capital or voting rights in \u00d8rsted A/S. Read more in note 6.1 'Interest-bearing debt'.\n\n## Key accounting estimates\n\n## Assumptions for provisions\n\nWe continually assess our provisions recognised to cover contractual obligations and claims raised against \u00d8rsted. Timing, probabilities, amounts, etc., which have a bearing on our provisions' estimates are updated quarterly based on our expectations.\n\nEstimates of provisions are based on our expectations of, for example:\n\n- -   timing and scope of obligation\n- -   future cost level\n- -legal  assessment.\n\nIf deemed material, non-current provisions are discounted using either the structural risk-free interest rate or the incremental borrowing rate. The structural risk-free interest rate is used for decommissioning liabilities and onerous contracts.\n\nThe outcome of our contractual obligations and claims may depend on future events which are uncertain by nature.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the following criteria/uni00A0are  fulfilled:\n\n- -   We have a legal or constructive obligation as a result of an earlier event.\n- -   The settlement of the obligation is expected to result in an outflow of resources.\n- -   The obligation can be measured reliably.\n\nDecommissioning obligations are measured at the present value of the future liability in respect of decommissioning as expected at the balance sheet date. The present value of the provision and changes in estimate are recognised as part of the cost of prop erty, plant, and equipment and depreciated together with the associated asset. The addition of interest on provisions is recognised in the income statement under financial expenses.\n\nFor onerous contracts, a provision is made when the expected income to be derived from a contract is lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting our obligations under the contract.\n\nProvisions concerning carbon emissions are recognised when our actual emissions exceed our holding of carbon emission allowances.",

Post-acquisition, this fair value is recognised as an adjustment to revenue over the duration of the contract, based on the fair value calculation at the time of the acquisition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWalney Extension, off the coast of Cumbria, the UK.",

The power distribution, residental customer, and city light businesses as well as the LNG business were all divested in 2020. See note 3.4.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssets classified as held for sale comprise assets and liabilities, the values of which are highly probable to be recovered through a sale within 12 months rather than through continued use.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the carrying amount at the time of classification as 'held for sale' or at market value less selling costs, whichever is lower. The carrying amount is measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. No depreciation or amortisation is effected on intangible assets, and prop er ty, plant, and equipment from the time of classification as 'held for sale'.\n\nWhen we divest an offshore wind farm, the retaining interest typically represents a joint operation. Since we retain a direct interest in the underlying assets and liabilities after the disposal, the assets and liabilities disposed off are not classified as held for sale.\n\n## 3.7 Discontinued operations\n\n| Profit from discontinued operations,  DKKm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Operating profit (loss) (EBIT)               | -                                | (/seven.tf)                      |\n| Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises     | /four.tf/five.tf                 | (/four.tf/three.tf)              |\n| Financial income and expenses, net           | (/seven.tf/two.tf)               | (/eight.tf)                      |\n| Profit (loss) before tax                     | (/two.tf/seven.tf)               | (/five.tf/eight.tf)              |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year            | /one.tf/six.tf                   | /two.tf                          |\n| Profit from discontinued operations          | (/one.tf/one.tf)                 | (/five.tf/six.tf)                |\n| Cash flows,  DKKm                            | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   |\n| Cash flows from operating activities         | (/seven.tf/six.tf)               | (/two.tf/one.tf/one.tf)          |\n| Cash flows from investing activities         | /one.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/two.tf  | /three.tf/eight.tf/five.tf       |\n| Cash flows from financing activities         | -                                | -                                |\n| Total cash flows                             | /nine.tf/six.tf/six.tf           | /one.tf/seven.tf/four.tf         |\n\nDiscontinued operations related to our Oil & Gas business which was sold to INEOS in 2017.

Working capital\n\nOur key working capital items consist of inventories, net contract assets, trade receivables and payables, and tax equity liabilities.\n\nWorking capital items vary with the seasonal variations in our generation and sales  activities during the year.\n\nOur net contract assets primarily relate to prepayments from heat customers in connection with bioconversions and construction of offshore wind farms for partners.\n\nConstruction of offshore transmission assets in the UK, which are recognised as inventories, will continue to tie up cash until they are divested.\n\nTax equity liabilities also vary within and across years. This is due to the fact that we receive cash contributions from tax equity partners at the point in time when a US wind farm enters into operation.\n\nTrade payables relating to capital investments are not included in this section, as they are presented as part of the cash flows from investing activities.\n\nThe net contract assets vary within and across years, depending on the portfolio of offshore construction assets, and when we reach certain milestones and trigger payments from our partners.\n\n| Working capital,  DKKm                                                                                      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf             | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Inventories                                                                                                 | /one.tf/four.tf,/seven.tf/three.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/four.tf,/zero.tf/three.tf/one.tf |\n| Contract assets, net                                                                                        | (/four.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf)         | (/three.tf,/eight.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf)   |\n| Trade receivables                                                                                           | /six.tf,/seven.tf/three.tf/two.tf          | /eight.tf,/one.tf/four.tf/zero.tf        |\n| Other receivables                                                                                           | /three.tf,/two.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf         | /three.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/three.tf       |\n| Trade payables, excluding trade payables relating to capital expenditure                                    | (/five.tf,/seven.tf/zero.tf/one.tf)        | (/seven.tf,/five.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)      |\n| Tax equity liabilities                                                                                      | (/seven.tf,/two.tf/four.tf/six.tf)         | (/four.tf,/five.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf)    |\n| Other payables                                                                                              | (/two.tf,/nine.tf/six.tf/five.tf)          | (/two.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/three.tf)     |\n| Net working capital, excluding trade payables relating to capital expenditure  at /three.tf/one.tf December | /four.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/seven.tf        | /six.tf,/seven.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf        |\n| Of which, work in progress and related trade payables                                                       | /nine.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/five.tf        | /eight.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/six.tf       |\n| Of which, tax equity partner liabilities and other working capital                                          | (/five.tf,/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf)        | (/two.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/seven.tf)      |\n\n## Working capital, DKKm /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOffshore primarily has funds tied up in inventories, construction agreements, and trade receivables.

We/uni00A0measure green certificates (earned and bought) at cost using the first in, first out (FIFO) principle.\n\nOther inventories are measured at cost, determined on a first in, first out basis or net realisable value, if net realisable value is lower.\n\nInventories are written down to the lower of net realisable value and cost price. For offshore transmission assets, it is the expected final transfer value announced by Ofgem.\n\nThe net realisable value is the sum (discounted) which the inventories are expected to generate through a normal sale.\n\n## 4.2  Contract assets and liabilities\n\n| Revenue from contracts with customers,  DKKm                                     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf    | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Revenue recognised included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the year | /six.tf/five.tf/four.tf           | /seven.tf/seven.tf/one.tf         |\n| Revenue recognised from perfomance obligations satisfied in previous years       | /one.tf/zero.tf/four.tf           | /one.tf/two.tf/eight.tf           |\n| Contract balances,  DKKm                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf    | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf    |\n| Contract assets                                                                  |                                   |                                   |\n| Current contract assets                                                          | /three.tf/zero.tf                 | /seven.tf/three.tf/nine.tf        |\n| Total contract assets                                                            | /three.tf/zero.tf                 | /seven.tf/three.tf/nine.tf        |\n| Contract liabilities                                                             |                                   |                                   |\n| Non-current contract liabilities                                                 | /three.tf,/six.tf/five.tf/zero.tf | /three.tf,/seven.tf/six.tf/two.tf |\n| Current contract liabilities                                                     | /four.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf         | /seven.tf/eight.tf/four.tf        |\n| Total contract liabilities                                                       | /four.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/zero.tf | /four.tf,/five.tf/four.tf/six.tf  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContract assets and contract liabilities are primarily related to:\n\n- -  the construction of offshore wind farms with partners, with each party usually owning 50 % of the offshore wind farm\n- -  prepayments from heat customers.\n\nAt the end of 2020, contract assets relates to the Coastal Virginia Wind project in the US.\n\nAt the end of 2019, contract assets and liabilities regarding construction agreements relates to our partners' share of the offshore wind farm Hornsea 1 and the Coastal Virginia Wind project in the US.\n\nNon-current contract liabilities primarily relate to prepayments from heat customers.\n\nThe table shows the amount of our revenue relating to contract liabilities carried forward (as prepayments and deferred revenue) and the amount relating to performance obligations satisfied in a prior year (e.g. renegotiations or constraints on variable considerations that are not recognised until they are highly probable).\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWe recognise a contract asset when we perform a service or transfer goods in advance of receiving consideration, and the consideration is conditional.

The write-down is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and the net present value of expected future cash flows from the/uni00A0receivable.

During 2020, we commissioned the onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek and received tax equity contributions from our partner.\n\nIn 2019, we commissioned the onshore wind farm Lockett with a tax equity partner.\n\n## Description of tax equity partnerships\n\nTax equity partnerships are characterised by a tax equity partner who contributes an upfront payment as part of the initial project investment and does not have an operational role in the project. The partner receives a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, we have seven onshore wind farms and one offshore wind farm in operation for which we have received tax equity contributions.\n\ncontractually agreed return on the contribution. In order to 'repay' the initial contribution and the return, a disproportionate share of the production tax credits (PTCs) and other tax attributes (accelerated tax depreciation and other taxable results) are allocated to the partner during the first part of the project's lifetime. The partner also receives some cash payment-based percentages specified in the partnership agreements. Once the partner receives the agreed return, the agreement flips, and the partner is typically entitled to a minor part of the cash distributions from the project, unless we repurchase this right from them, which is highly likely.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWhen a tax equity partnership is formed, we evaluate if the company should still be fully consolidated based on our right to variable returns as well as our ability to exercise influence on financial and operational  decisions impacting those returns. Due to the operational and financial nature of the projects and the influence normally given to tax equity partners in such agreements, we normally have the influence to fully consolidate companies that have tax equity partners.\n\nThe terms of the tax equity partner's contribution are evaluated to determine the accounting treatment. The contribution generally has the characteristics of a liability as the initial contribution is repaid, including an agreed return, and the partner does not share in the risks of the project in the same way as a shareholder. As such, the contribution is accounted for as a liability and measured at amortised cost. The liability is based on the expected method of repayment and is divided into:\n\n- -   a net working-capital element to be repaid through PTCs and other tax attributes\n- -   an interest-bearing debt element expected to be repaid through cash distributions.\n\nThe partner's agreed return is expensed as a financial expense and is recognised as an increase of the tax equity liability. PTCs and other tax attributes transferred to the tax equity partner are recognised as other operating income. Tax attributes allocated to the tax equity partner are deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated contractual length of the partnership structure, while PTCs are recognised in the periods earned, similar to recognition of our own PTCs.\n\nIn addition to the above, we recognise a liability for the expected purchase price for the partner's postflip rights to cash distributions. This liability is recognised at fair value, and adjustments are expensed as a financial item. This recognition reflects the intention and high  likelihood that we will purchase the partner's post-flip rights, and they are part of the financial costs of the arrangement.\n\nIf we choose not to buy the partner's post-flip rights, the tax equity partner will be entitled to part of the company's returns in the post-flip period. At that point, the partner will share in the risks and rewards in the company as a shareholder and will be considered a non-controlling interest.",

        "page_content": "## 5.1 Approach to taxes\n\nIn \u00d8rsted, we wish to provide user-friendly information about our tax positions. By drawing inspiration from the standard GRI 207: Tax, we have increased the transparency of our reporting in a standardised manner.\n\nWe believe that taxes are a core part of our corporate social responsibility. At \u00d8rsted, we are committed to conducting our business in a way that contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Taxes are a key contribution to the SDGs, in particular target 16.6 on the development of effective, accountable, and transparent institutions.\n\nTaxes are overseen by the Board of Directors who is accountable for the tax policy. The responsibility for tax risk management lies with the CFO and is overseen by the Audit & Risk Committee. The day-to-day tax management is handled by a centralised global tax team who is involved in all significant business developments.\n\nWe have a clear responsibility to comply with the laws in the countries where we operate. We choose to do this by aiming to comply not only with the letter of the law, but also with the underlying tax policy intent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmazon Wind Farm, Scurry County, Texas, the US.\n\nIn December 2019, the GRI 207: Tax standard was adopted with effect for reports published after 1 January 2021. We have drawn inspiration from the standard when presenting our approach to and reporting of tax.\n\nManagement has been provided with a statement (ISRS 4400 - Agreed Upon Procedures) from our auditors on our application of GRI 207: Tax.\n\n## Tax stakeholder engagement\n\nIn line with our tax policy, we engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups, and civil society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation, and administration.\n\nDuring 2020, our engagement consisted mainly of the following: Participation in a public hearing in the Danish Parliament on CFC taxation, participation in the Tax Dialogue Project, meetings with NGOs, submission of responses to OECD's public consultations on CbC Reporting, Pillar I, and Pillar II, participation in the tax panel meetings of the Danish Confederation of Enterprises, and participation in BIAC's workgroup on OECD's Pillar II.\n\nThe purpose of our engagement is to support the development of robust and sustainable tax legislation and practice by contributing to an informed discussion. By engaging with civil society and gathering input on, for example, how we share information, we believe we can contribute to rebuilding the public's confidence\n\nin the corporate tax system. As an example, feedback received in the Tax Dialogue project aided our decision to update our 2020 tax reporting by drawing inspiration from the GRI 207: Tax standard.\n\n## Tax risk management and controls\n\nComplying with tax rules can be complex as the interpretation of legislation and case law may not always be clear cut and may change over time, giving rise to tax risks. We manage our tax risks by the prevention of unnecessary disputes, which we strive to achieve through strong technical positions, clear explanations of our positions, thorough documentation, and strong compliance procedures.\n\nWe define a tax risk as any consequence relating to: the application of our tax policy, dayto-day operations, compliance, or external reporting that impacts the business in form of cash liabilities, financial statement errors or misstatements, or reputational damage.\n\nTo ensure a coordinated assessment of tax risks, \u00d8rsted's tax function is involved in the planning and implementation as well as documentation of all significant new processes.\n\nOur risk appetite is governed by the 'more likely than not' approach.\n\nFor more details on our approach to taxes, we refer to our tax policy which can be found here: orsted.com/taxpolicy.",

        "page_content": "## Uncertain tax positions\n\nOur tax risk management work includes taking into account uncertain tax positions, e.g. when we have taken a position where there is an uncertainty created by a comparison of the wording of the law, the expressed policy intent or lack thereof, or fluctuating or divergent application by tax authorities or judicial systems in countries where we operate.\n\n## Tax controversies\n\nIn an administrative decision, The Danish Tax Agency has concluded that \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S has not acted at arm's length terms and conditions when charging fees for technical services provided to two project companies for the Walney Extension and Hornsea 1 offshore wind farms in the UK during the development phase.\n\nThe decision entails an additional tax payable of DKK 5.1 billion for the income years 2015 and 2016 plus interest. We dispute the decision, and we have lodged an appeal with the Danish National Tax Tribunal and also filed an application for Mutual Agreement Procedure between the Competent Authorities of the Danish Tax Agency and Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs under both the EU Arbitration Convention and the relevant Double Tax Agreement, including the Multilateral Instrument. We have further requested a deferral of payment until the case is finally decided. Our application for Mutual Agreement Procedure under both instruments has been confirmed as admissible by the Danish and UK Competent Authorities. Our request for a deferral of payment until the case is finally decided has been accepted by the Danish Tax Agency.\n\nWe seek to avoid unnecessary disputes, but recognise that in our business, which involves large amounts, cross-border payments, and activities in highly regulated sectors, there will inevitably be a number of claims from the national tax authorities in the markets where we operate that cannot be avoided. In response to these risks, including the current controversy involving the development fees for the Walney Extension and Hornsea 1 offshore wind farms, we have made tax-related provisions in accordance with IAS 12, IAS 37, and relevant interpretations, such as IFRIC 23. The provisions have been calculated on the basis of differences in tax rates and statistical risks of suffering economic or legal double taxation.\n\n## Tax controls\n\nWithin \u00d8rsted, the main control is our four-eye review principle. This means that all our work is reviewed by a colleague. Tax decisions in relation to matters which are subjected to approval by management are approved by the Head of Tax.\n\n## Tax planning and use of tax incentives\n\nWe only use business structures that are driven by commercial considerations, aligned with business activity. We do not use so-called secrecy jurisdictions or tax havens to avoid taxes. If we establish an entity in a low or nilrate jurisdiction, it will be for substantive and commercial reasons. We pay tax on profits according to where value is created. In order to remain competitive, we make use of incentives and tax relief implemented by governments where we have commercial substance.\n\n## Danish CFC taxation\n\nDenmark has proposed to introduce the CFC rules in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive. These rules have been proposed several times, most recently in November 2020, but have so far failed to secure a political majority in the Danish Parliament. It was announced in December 2020 that the latest draft bill would not be passed before the end of 2020, and that a public hearing will be conducted on the rules during 2021. We expect the revised CFC rules to enter into force during the course of 2021, but the exact timing is unknown.\n\nThe overarching purpose of the CFC rules is to prevent companies from undermining the domestic tax base by moving mobile income to low-tax jurisdictions. In such scenarios, the CFC rules will ensure that the income will still be subject to domestic taxation.\n\nPursuant to the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, a foreign subsidiary shall be\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlum Creek, Wayne County, Texas, the US.\n\nconsidered to be a CFC company if more than one-third of its income consists of CFC income. 'Other income from intangible property' is now considered CFC income, but as of yet, there is very little guidance on how to calculate such income.\n\nThe EU directive exempts subsidiaries from the CFC rules if they have real commercial activity, or if they are not situated in a low-tax jurisdiction. In the latest published draft bill, Denmark has chosen not to include any of these exceptions. Unless such exemptions are included in a revised draft bill, operational foreign subsidiaries which have been established for commercial purposes can be considered to be CFC companies regardless of whether the corporate residential tax rate is lower, higher, or the same as in Denmark. We see this as a risk and have, in public consultations, proposed that a substance exemption is included in the Danish CFC rules in order to not place Danish companies at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The effective tax rate was 11 % in 2020 against 31 % in 2019.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 (11 %) was primarily affected by the largely tax-exempt sale of our Danish power distribution business and related activities as well as recognition of a tax liability in connection with tax equity partnerships related to the onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek (see more regarding tax equity partnerships in notes 4.5 'Tax equity liabilities' and 5.3 'Deferred tax').\n\nNon-taxable income and non-deductible expenses primarily relate to the divestment of the Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses. See more in note 3.4 'Divestment of enterprises'.\n\nThe movement in uncertain tax positions is a consequence of reassessment of a calculated uncertain tax position.\n\nThe adjustment of tax concerning previous years primarily relates to a realised discount on payment for utilisation of tax losses in the UK.\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2019 was primarily affected by the sale of assets in certain wind farm projects to a partner in the US as well as the tax equity partnership related to the onshore wind farm Lockett.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTax for the year consists of current tax, changes in deferred tax, and adjustments in respect of previous years. Tax on profit (loss) for the year is recognised in the income statement. Tax relating to other items is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nLiabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions are measured as follows:\n\n- -   The most-likely-outcome method is applied in cases where there are only two possible outcomes.\n- -   The weighted-average method is used in cases where there are more than two possible outcomes.\n\nThe liability is recognised under 'Income tax' or ' Deferred tax', depending on how the realisation of the tax position will affect the financial statement.\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Estimates regarding recognition of income taxes\n\n\u00d8rsted is subject to income taxes in all the countries where we operate. Significant judgement and estimates are required in determining the wordwide income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nIn the course of conducting business around the world, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business. Judgement is applied to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. We apply the methods prescribed in IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments' when making provisions for uncertain tax positions, and the provisions made are based on different scenarios of possible outcomes. We consider the provisions made to be adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and might lead to additional tax in excess of provisions included as uncertain tax provisions depending on the result of litigations and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.\n\nOngoing tax disputes, primarily related to transfer pricing cases, are included as part of 'Income tax' and 'Deferred tax'. Estimates in respect of transfer pricing cases include among others whether corresponding adjustments can be obtained in the relevant jurisdictions, and, in terms of disputes regarding project companies with partners, whether compensation can be obtained from these partners. Any expected compensation from partners are included as part of 'Other receivables'.",

        "page_content": "## Tax on profit (loss) for the year and other comprehensive income\n\nIn 2020, tax on IFRS profit (loss) for the year amounted to DKK 1,776 million, consisting of current tax expenses of DKK 2,735 million, changes in deferred tax of DKK 1,635 million, changes in tax rates of DKK 138 million, uncertain tax positions of DKK 101 million, hybrid capital tax of DKK 107 million, tax equity of DKK 903 million, and adjustments of tax concerning previous years of DKK 83 million.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the payable tax expense incurred in \u00d8rsted on profit for the year. This differs from taxes paid as a result of payments or refunds regarding prior years and residual payments for the current year.\n\nBecause of the high level of investments and the subsequent deferrals of payable tax as a consequence of accelerated tax depreciation, our current tax is generally lower than the statutory corporate tax rates during construction and the initial years after first power from a wind farm. The current tax for 2020 has decreased compared to 2019 because there was no tax related to construction agreements in 2020.\n\n|                                                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf     | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Income tax,  DKKm                                                 | Business  performance                | IFRS                                 | Business  performance              | IFRS                               |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year                                 | (/two.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf)    | (/one.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/six.tf)  | (/two.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/six.tf) | (/three.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf) |\n| Tax on other comprehensive income                                 | /seven.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf          | /four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf            | (/five.tf/three.tf/nine.tf)        | (/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf)          |\n| Tax on hybrid capital                                             | -                                    | -                                    | /three.tf/four.tf                  | /three.tf/four.tf                  |\n| Total tax for the year                                            | (/one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/six.tf)   | (/one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/six.tf)   | (/three.tf,/two.tf/six.tf/one.tf)  | (/three.tf,/two.tf/six.tf/one.tf)  |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year can be broken down as follows:  |                                      |                                      |                                    |                                    |\n| Current tax                                                       | (/two.tf,/seven.tf/three.tf/five.tf) | (/two.tf,/seven.tf/three.tf/five.tf) | (/five.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/five.tf) | (/five.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/five.tf) |\n| Deferred tax                                                      | /one.tf,/two.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf    | /one.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/five.tf     | /three.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf,/seven.tf/six.tf/five.tf   |\n| Changes in tax rates                                              | /one.tf/three.tf/eight.tf            | /one.tf/three.tf/eight.tf            | (/eight.tf/three.tf)               | (/eight.tf/three.tf)               |\n| Uncertain tax positions                                           | (/one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf)             | (/one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf)             | /one.tf/four.tf/three.tf           | /one.tf/four.tf/three.tf           |\n| Tax on hybrid capital                                             | /one.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf             | /one.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf             | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Tax equity                                                        | (/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf)          | (/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf)          | (/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf)          | (/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf)          |\n| Adjustment of tax concerning previous years                       | /eight.tf/three.tf                   | /eight.tf/three.tf                   | (/one.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf)         | (/one.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf)         |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year                                 | (/two.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf)    | (/one.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/six.tf)  | (/two.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/six.tf) | (/three.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf) |\n| Tax on other comprehensive income can be broken down  as follows: |                                      |                                      |                                    |                                    |\n| Current tax                                                       | /four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf            | /four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf            | (/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf)          | (/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf)          |\n| Deferred tax                                                      | /three.tf/four.tf/seven.tf           | -                                    | (/three.tf/four.tf/five.tf)        | -                                  |\n| Tax on other comprehensive income                                 | /seven.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf          | /four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf            | (/five.tf/three.tf/nine.tf)        | (/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf)          |\n\n## Effective current tax rate (IFRS), /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncome tax for the year is calculated on the basis of the profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations.

        "page_content": "## 5.3 Deferred tax\n\n## Development in deferred tax\n\nIn 2020, net deferred tax assets increased. The effect primarily related to the update of the Hornsea 1 transmission asset divestment assumptions, variance on long-term liabilities, and financial instruments as well as adjustments to previous years' deferred tax in the UK. The recognition of the deferred tax liability was increased because of our tax equity partnerships. In 2019, the net deferred tax assets were also impacted by Hornsea 1 since current tax on the deferred gain was triggered when construction was completed.\n\n## Deferred tax by segment\n\nNet deferred tax in our segments primarily concerned the following:\n\n- -  Offshore: a deferred tax asset is recognised related to tax loss carryforwards and internal gains on construction agreements. The deferred tax asset is partially offset by a  deferred tax liability as a result of accelerated tax depreciation compared to accounting depreciation regarding property, plant, and equipment.\n- -  Onshore: a deferred tax liability is recognised related to wind farm assets in tax equity structures.\n- -  Markets & Bioenergy: a deferred tax liability related to financial instruments and accelerated tax depreciation on property, plant, and equipment is recognised.\n- -  Other activities/eliminations comprised intra-group eliminations in the joint taxation across segments.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## US tax equity partnerships\n\nWe have entered into several tax equity partnership agreements in the US.\n\nThe expected value of the deferred tax liability related to property, plant, and equipment at the flip date in the tax equity partnership agreement is included in our accounts when the tax equity partner ship is established. The deferred tax liability from existing tax equity partnerships will be gradually reduced based on accounting depreciation after flip-date.

As the accelerated depreciation is larger than our taxable profits when we make large investments, our tax loss carryforwards increase when more wind farms enter into operation. The tax loss carryforwards are either offset against deferred tax liabilities on the same wind farm or jurisdiction or offset against expected future profits from the very same wind farm or jurisdiction.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts.\n\nHowever, deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to:\n\n- -   the acquisition of joint operations, including licence interests\n- -   other items where differences arise at the time of acquisition, affecting neither the profit (loss) for the year nor the taxable income. However, this does not include differences arising in connection with company acquisitions.\n\nDeferred tax is measured depending on how we plan to use the assets and settle the liabilities. We set off tax assets and liabilities when the tax assets can be offset against tax liabilities in the year in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be used.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised at the value at which they are expected to be used. They may be offset against future earnings. This is done within a joint taxation scheme. Due to timing differences in realisation and utilisation of losses, the UK consortium relief rules are not considered to be a joint taxation. This means that tax losses resulting from accelerated tax depreciation are accounted for as tax loss carryforwards until they are used, instead of being used to offset taxable income in the same year in affiliated companies. The result is a disproportionate current tax on the overall profits. Intra-group gains and losses are eliminated. Tax losses carried forward in jurisdictions where we have a history of losses are recognised based on other convincing evidence of future profits.\n\nDeferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and rates applying when the deferred tax becomes current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognised in profit (loss) for the year.\n\nDeferred tax (net liability) related to the tax equity structures is recognised as tax income in the income statement when we take over the agreements. The liability recognised is the amount that we expect to take over once the contribution from the equity partner is repaid, and the tax equity structure flips.",

        "page_content": "## 5.4 Our tax footprint\n\n\u00d8rsted's tax footprint is an effect of how and where we conduct our business.\n\nWe have paid DKK 1,118 million in corporate income taxes in 2020, of which DKK 412 million related to residual tax for 2019. At the end of the year, we expect to have a residual tax of DKK 109 million regarding 2020, primarily due to movement in financial instruments in the last quarter of 2020.\n\n## Local taxes paid\n\nWe have made significant investments in offshore wind farms in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, the US, and Taiwan, resulting in the accumulation of large tax assets in recent years. Accordingly, we have not paid significant taxes in these countries historically. This is changing as the offshore wind farms are being commissioned and generating positive taxable income, resulting currently in paid taxes in the UK and Taiwan. We expect to start paying corporate tax in the Netherlands in 2021 and in Germany in 2022.\n\nWe are also continuously investing in the US; however, we do expect to pay tax in the US in 2022-2024, due to the commercial structural set-up in the US.\n\n## A wind farm life cycle\n\n\u00d8rsted operates in several countries (see our global footprint in the management's review). The design of the individual tax regime in each jurisdiction impacts the tax over the life cycle of our investments and thereby the timing of when we pay tax.\n\nA wind farm life cycle begins with the development phase. This includes opportunity screening, if applicable, bid preparation, obtaining land rights, grid connection, and permits. The latter activities are further matured if an investment decision is made, and the construction phase commences, which includes construction of the wind farm. During both phases, product, people, and property taxes are borne or collected (see our total tax contribution section).\n\nWhen the wind farm is commissioned and put into operation, income and positive cash flow are generated. In many cases, the effect of tax incentives results in a deferral of taxable income compared to profit before tax for accounting purposes. Conversely, once the deferral ends, the taxable income related to the wind farm will exceed the accounting profit. For this reason, the applicable corporate tax rate and cash tax paid will always differ, but accumulated over the lifetime of the wind farm, they will be identical.\n\nFurthermore, in many of the jurisdictions where we operate, there are mandatory or voluntary tax groupings. This means that we will only pay tax on the consolidated result of\n\nall of our activities in that country. As a result, continued significant investments in such a country may further defer the time at which we pay taxes in that country.\n\n## Project phases, wind farm life cycle example\n\n- Profit (loss) before tax\n\nTaxable income\n\nCash flow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDevelopment activities results in negative cash flow in the beginning of the project life cycle. During construction, the capital employed accelerates materially. Positive income begins when the project enters operation.",

This means a payment paid by \u00d8rsted to the government, including amounts paid through an agent. Tax does not result in a return of value to \u00d8rsted for a right or asset used in the business.\n\nTaxes borne by \u00d8rsted are those that represent a direct cost and are reflected in the financial result. Taxes borne are charged to the profit and loss account.\n\nTaxes collected are those which are generated by \u00d8rsted's operations, but do not constitute a tax liability for \u00d8rsted. \u00d8rsted generates the commercial activity that gives rise to the  taxes and then collects and administers them on behalf of the tax authorities in the countries where we operate.\n\nTotal tax contribution is highly impacted by collection of VAT, sales taxes, duties as well as profit taxes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12.0 bn\n\nOur total tax contribution in 2020 totalled DKK 12,028 million.\n\n## Total global taxes paid in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf\n\nProfit\n\ntaxes\n\n- People taxes\n- Product taxes\n\nThese include taxes on company profits that are borne (such as corporate income tax) and collected (such as withholding tax on payments to third parties).\n\nTaxes on employment, both borne and collected (including income tax and social security tax payments).\n\nIndirect taxes on the production and consumption of goods and services, including net VAT and sales tax, custom duties, and insurance premium tax.

The overarching capital structure targets are a credit rating of Baa1/BBB+ and an FFO/adjusted net debt credit metric of around 30 %.\n\n## Financing policy\n\n## Cash management\n\nThe aim of our financing policy is to ensure that hedging needs and the best possible financing arrangements are taken into account, while also minimising financing costs, liquidity, and refinancing risks.\n\nThe borrowing activities are diversified among various funding sources and maturities. In addition, we have robust financial resources.\n\nOur borrowing activities are primarily consolidated in the parent company where cash resources are available to the Group companies via an internal bank.\n\n## Equity and interest-bearing net debt, DKKbn\n\n- Interest-bearing assets\n- Interest-bearing debt\n- Hybrid capital\n- Equity attributable to shareholders in \u00d8rsted A/S\n- Non-controlling interests\n\n## 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne of the most significant cash management objectives is to secure sufficient and flexible financial resources in relation to our dayto-day operations, investment programme, and debt maturity profile.\n\nTherefore, we define minimum financial resources for the coming calendar year.

The share capital is unchanged from last year. No shares are subject to special rights or restrictions on voting rights. All shares are fully paid up.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTo secure our share programme, we acquired additional treasury shares in May 2020. The total portfolio of treasury shares  consists of 312,844 shares at 31/uni00A0December 2020 (2019: 395,619), corresponding to less than 0.1 % of the share capital.\n\n## Dividend yield, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows the proposed dividends in relation to the closing price for an \u00d8rsted share on the last trading day of the year.\n\nThe table shows earnings per share distributed on continuing and discontinued operations. Diluted profit (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) per share, as the only dilutive effect comes from the share programme and equals 0.1 % of the share capital (2019: 0.1 % of the share capital).\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board of Directors recommends that dividends of DKK 4,834 million (2019: DKK 4,414 million) be paid for the financial year, corresponding to DKK 11.50 per share (2019: DKK 10.50 per share). The proposed dividends correspond to a dividend yield of 0.9 % (2019: 1.5 %), calculated on the basis of the closing price for an \u00d8rsted share on the last trading day of the/uni00A0year.\n\n## Owners in \u00d8rsted\n\nThe Danish state is the principal shareholder with an ownership interest of 50.1 %. In addition, Andel and The Capital Group Companies, Inc. have an ownership interest above 5 %.

The notional amount, which constitutes a liability, is recognised at present value, and equity has been increased by the difference between the net proceeds received and the present value of the discounted liability. Accordingly, any coupon payments\n\nare accounted for as dividends, which are recognised directly in equity at the time the payment obligation arises. This is because the coupon is discretionary, and therefore any deferred coupon lapses upon maturity of the hybrid capital. Consequently, coupon payments do not have any effect on profit (loss) for the year.\n\nThe part of the hybrid capital that is accounted for as a liability is measured at amortised cost. However, as the carrying amount of this component amounted to nil on initial recognition and due to the 1,000-year term of the hybrid capital, amortisation charges will only have an impact on profit (loss) for the year towards the end of the 1,000-year term of the hybrid capital. Coupon payments are recognised in the statement of cash flows in the same way as dividend payments within financing activities.\n\nOn redemption of hybrid capital, the payment will be distributed between liability and equity,  applying the same principles as used when the hybrid capital was issued. This means that the  difference between the\n\nDue in /three.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf\n\nSubordinate to other creditors\n\nDKK /four.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/six.tf million\n\nEquity\n\nEUR /six.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf million (DKK /four.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/six.tf million)\n\nDecember /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf\n\nDecember /three.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf\n\nLuxembourg\n\n/nine.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf\n\nCoupon for the first eight years at /one.tf./seven.tf/five.tf % p.a., after which it is adjusted every five years with the\n\nfive-year euro swap\n\n+/one.tf./nine.tf/five.tf/two.tf percentage points from /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf\n\n+/two.tf./zero.tf/two.tf percentage points from /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/two.tf\n\n+/two.tf./nine.tf/five.tf/two.tf percentage points from /two.tf/zero.tf/four.tf/seven.tf\n\nOptional\n\npayment on redemption and the net proceeds received on issue is recognised directly in equity, as the debt portion of the existing hybrid issues will be nil during the first part of the life of the hybrid capital.\n\nOn the date when the Board of Directors decides to exercise an option to redeem hybrid capital, the part of the hybrid capital that will be redeemed will be reclassified to loans and borrowings. The reclassification will be made at the market value of the hybrid capital at the date the decision is made. Coupon payments and exchange rate adjustments following the reclassification to loans and borrowings will be recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income or expenses.",

The maturity analysis was determined on 31/uni00A0December.\n\nThe maturity analysis is based on undiscounted cash flows, including estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on market conditions and interest -rate hedging entered into on 31/uni00A0December.\n\nThe maturity analysis does not include hybrid capital classified as equity. At 31 December 2020, we had issued hybrid capital with a notional amount totalling DKK 13,398 million due in 3013 (DKK 5,210 million), 3017 (DKK 3,722 million), and 3019 (DKK/uni00A04,466 million), respectively.\n\nThe maturity analysis for leasing is part of note 8.2 'Leases'.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nSecurities comprise bonds that are monitored, measured, and reported at market value on an on going basis in conformity with the Group's investment policy. Changes in market value are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income and expenses. Purchase and sale of securities are recognised at the settlement date.\n\nFor listed securities, market value equals the market price, and for unlisted securities, market value is estimated based on generally accepted valuation methods and market data.\n\nDivested securities where repurchase agreements (repo transactions) have been made at the time of sale are recognised in the balance sheet at the settlement date as if the securities were still held. The amount received is recognised as a liability, and the difference between the selling price and the purchase price is recognised in profit (loss) for the year over the term as interest. The return on the securities is recognised in profit (loss) for the year.",

        "page_content": "## 7.1 Market risks\n\n## Market risks and market risk management\n\nOur most significant market risks relate to:\n\n- - energy prices\n- - foreign exchange rates\n- - interest and inflation.\n\nWe manage market risks to protect \u00d8rsted against market price volatility and ensure stable and robust financial ratios that support our growth strategy as well as protect the value of our assets.\n\nIn the short- to medium-term horizon, we primarily hedge future prices using derivatives to reduce cash flow fluctuations after tax. Minimum hedging levels are determined by the Board of Directors. In the first two years, we are almost fully hedged. The degree of hedging declines in subsequent years due to:\n\n- -  reduced certainty about long-term production  volumes\n- -  increasing hedging costs in the medium to long term, both spread costs and costs of collateral\n- -  adverse impacts from collateral, potentially tying up large amounts of capital if hedging contracts become unfavourable.\n\nOur long-term market risk picture is determined by our strategic asset portfolio. Our power exposure is partly mitigated through long-term power purchasing agreements (PPAs), and we use debt to manage currency, interest rate, and inflation risks.\n\n## Energy price risks\n\nOur consolidated energy exposure for the years 2021-2025 after hedging can be summarised as shown in the table.\n\n| Risk after hedging                        | Effect of price change   | Effect of price change   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| DKKbn                                     | +/one.tf/zero.tf %       | -/one.tf/zero.tf %       |\n| Power: /eight.tf./two.tf sales position   | +/zero.tf./eight.tf      | -/zero.tf./eight.tf      |\n| Gas: /zero.tf./three.tf sales position    | +/zero.tf./zero.tf       | -/zero.tf./zero.tf       |\n| Oil: /zero.tf./two.tf sales position      | +/zero.tf./zero.tf       | -/zero.tf./zero.tf       |\n| Spread: /zero.tf./seven.tf sales position | +/zero.tf./one.tf        | -/zero.tf./one.tf        |\n\nTherefore, a 10 % increase in the power price in 2021-2025 will result in a gain of DKK 0.8 billion in the period, all else remaining unchanged.\n\n## Currency risks\n\nOur consolidated currency exposure after hedging for the years 2021-2025 (USD 20212036) can be summarised as shown in the table.\n\n| Risk after hedging                           | Effect of price change   | Effect of price change   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| DKKbn                                        | +/one.tf/zero.tf %       | -/one.tf/zero.tf %       |\n| GBP: /one.tf/nine.tf./one.tf sales position  | +/one.tf./nine.tf        | -/one.tf./nine.tf        |\n| NTD: /four.tf./eight.tf sales position       | +/zero.tf./five.tf       | -/zero.tf./five.tf       |\n| USD: /one.tf/two.tf./eight.tf sales position | +/one.tf./three.tf       | -/one.tf./three.tf       |\n\nOur main currency exposure stems from offshore wind farms in the UK, but activities in the US and Taiwan have increased our USD and NTD exposures.\n\nIn general, highly certain cash flows in a foreign currency are hedged within the first five years.\n\nExchange rates related to energy prices in foreign currencies are not hedged until the energy price is hedged. Hence, the GBP exchange rate associated with power generation in the UK is not hedged until the GBP power price is hedged.\n\nCash flows that relate to fixed tariffs and guaranteed minimum prices from offshore wind farms in the UK deviate from the main principle. Hedging of these, less operating expenses, is based on a declining level of hedging over the five-year risk management horizon. The target is to hedge 100 % of the risk in year 1, declining by 20 percentage points each year, to 20 % in year 5.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GBP exposures, DKKbn\n\nOur GBP exposure amounted to DKK 19.1 billion after hedging for the years 2021-2025. This unhedged GBP exposure stems from subsidised GBP income less operational expenditures.\n\nThe GBP exchange rate for hedges impacting EBITDA in 2021 and 2022 is hedged at an average exchange rate of GBP/DKK 8.3 and 8.1, respectively.\n\nFor our USD and NTD exposures from new markets, we have limited existing portfolio against which we can net construction payments. Therefore, we seek to hedge the price risk in the near term, while simultaneously hedging a similar, but opposite, exposure in the longer term. Our EUR risk is subject to continuous assessment, but is generally not hedged, as we believe that Denmark will maintain its fixed exchange-rate policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows our GBP exposure before and after hedges from:\n\n- -divestments  and investments\n- -green  certificates\n- -hedged  energy.\n\nThe divestment proceeds from the Hornsea 2 transmission asset were  previously expected in 2022, but are now expected in 2023. The related hedges will remain in 2022 until we know the final timing of the divestment.",

        "page_content": "## Interest and inflation risk\n\nTo a certain extent, our medium- to longterm earnings can be expected to follow the development in consumer and market prices, thereby protecting the real value of our assets and equity. This is the case for earnings related to our UK wind farms.\n\nHowever, we are exposed to inflation risk on projects with fixed nominal cash flows, as an increase in inflation will erode the expected real value of the revenue. This is the case for:\n\n- -  fixed nominal subsidies from offshore wind assets in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the US\n- -  fixed nominal power purchase agreements related to onshore wind assets in the US and offshore wind assets in Europe and Taiwan.\n\nThe close relationship between inflation and interest rates protects our equity value against changes in interest rates to some extent. We manage interest rate and inflation risk by matching the sensitivity of our assets with the sensitivity of our debt.\n\nThe share of our debt which is fixed in nominal terms partially offsets the inflation risk. We have fixed the inflation for part of the future revenue from our UK offshore wind farms at an average retail price index (RPI) rate of 3.6 % for the period 2024-2037 and an average consumer price index (CPI) rate of 2.7 % for the period 2030-2032. This will create a better match with our fixed-rate UK debt.\n\n## Offshore\n\nEarnings from power generation from offshore wind farms mainly comprise:\n\n- -  fixed tariffs in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK (CfD wind farms), the US, and Taiwan\n- -  guaranteed minimum prices for green certificates in the UK (ROC wind farms)\n- - long-term power purchase agreements\n- -  sale of power at market price from our wind farms with market price risk.\n\nAt the end of 2020, such fixed tariffs and guaranteed minimum prices cover approx. 86 % of the expected income from offshore wind farms for the period 2021-2025. The remaining price exposure concerns sales of power at market price in the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands.\n\n## Onshore\n\nEarnings from power generation from onshore wind farms in the US comprise tax incentives, such as PTCs or ITCs, and power. The tax incentives have a fixed value. However, there is a price risk associated with the power which is reduced by entering into power purchase agreements (PPAs). The current PPAs cover approx. 65 % of the expected generation, spanning 12-15 years from the commissioning of the wind farm. The PPAs are entered into with large corporates or financial institutions.\n\n## Markets & Bioenergy\n\nOur combined heat and power plants consists of biomass- and fossil-fuelled plants in Denmark. Heat generation accounts for a larger share of the earnings and does not give rise to price risks, as the associated costs are covered by the heat customers. However, heat generation often entails a price risk for power, as heat and power are generated simultaneously to a large extent. The profitability\n\nof power generation is determined by the difference between the selling price of power and the purchase price of fuel and carbon emission allowances. For our biomass-based power generation, we secure profitability by buying biomass at fixed prices and hedging the associated power generation. At the end of 2020, 36 % of the expected power generation from our power plants in 2021 was hedged. The total net risk associated with the power plants' power generation for the 2021-2025 period is DKK 0.7 billion after hedging.\n\nOur price risks in Markets arise from the purchase and sale of power and gas. The price risks associated with the purchase and sale of gas result from differences in the indexing of sales and purchase prices. Our largest gas purchase contracts are mainly indexed to pure gas prices and thus no longer constitute a significant risk.\n\nThe price risks associated with power purchases and sales are given by the difference between the purchase and sales prices. The price risk relates primarily to timing differences between purchases and sales and the related hedges and is therefore considered to be limited.\n\n## Principles for estimating exposures\n\nExposure is calculated as the expected production (or net purchase/sale) times the forward price for the respective years. In addition, the exposure is determined on the basis of the expected exposure after renegotiations of oil-indexed gas purchase contracts.\n\n## Offshore's power price exposure, DKKbn\n\n- Before hedging\n- After hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table shows the exposure from Offshore's generation of power before and after hedges.\n\n## Expected value for recognition in EBITDA, DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Power\n- Currency\n- Inflation and interest\n- US  PPAs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table shows the time of the transfer of the value of hedging contracts in business  performance EBITDA for both business performance and IFRS hedges together with deferred gains from US power purchase agreements (PPAs).

However, ineffectiveness arise on our economic and commercial contracts where we are currently not applying IFRS hedge accounting.\n\n| Cash flow                                              | Contractual                                  | Maturity analysis                 | Maturity analysis                | Maturity analysis                                    | Market value                    | Market value               | Recognised in  comprehen-       | Expected transfers to income statement   | Expected transfers to income statement   | Expected transfers to income statement   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| hedge accounting /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf,  DKKm | principal  amount                            | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf    | After /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf                  | Asset                           | Liability                  | sive income                     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf            | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf            | After /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf      |\n| Revenue (US+DE power)                                  | /one.tf/one.tf,/eight.tf/five.tf/seven.tf    | /eight.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf        | /eight.tf/three.tf/six.tf        | /one.tf/zero.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf              | /five.tf/eight.tf/three.tf      | (/six.tf/five.tf/six.tf)   | /two.tf/one.tf/zero.tf          | /six.tf/five.tf                          | /one.tf/two.tf/one.tf                    | /two.tf/four.tf                          |\n| Revenue (UK inflation)                                 | /one.tf/nine.tf,/seven.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf    | -

The GBP exposure, for example, is hedged using GBP forward exchange contracts, GBP swaps, or GBP loans. Thus, there are no significant sources of ineffectiveness. For currency swaps, the basic spread is accounted for according to the cost of the hedging model.\n\nTo the extent that a risk needs to be hedged, and if there is no fully effective instrument available in the market, analyses are performed of the expected effectiveness of the hedging instrument before the hedging transaction is concluded. In this case, the ratio between the hedged risk and the hedging instrument may deviate from the one-to-one  principle and will be determined as the ratio which most effectively hedges the desired risk.\n\nWe recognise changes to the market value of hedging instruments that qualify for recognition as a hedge of future cash flows in other comprehensive income in the hedging reserve. On realisation of the hedged cash flow, the resulting gains or losses are transferred from equity and recognised in the same item as the hedged item. However, on hedging of proceeds from future loans, the resulting gain or loss is transferred from equity over the term of the loan.\n\nWhen we conclude a hedging transaction, and each time we present financial statements thereafter, we assess whether the hedged exposure and the hedging instrument are still financially correlated. If the hedged cash flows are no longer expected to be realised, the accumulated value change is transferred to profit (loss) for the year.\n\nChanges in the market value of derivatives that are classified as hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability are recognised in profit (loss) for the year together with changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability to the extent of the hedged risk.",

VaR reached DKK 56 million on 8 January 2020, causing a passive breach of the Executive Committee mandate of DKK 50 million. This was due to increased volatility as a consequence of the Russian/Ukraine conflict and the Iranian attack on US bases on 8 January. The risk was brought back within the limit the next day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe contractual principal amount has been determined as the net position per derivative type.\n\nThe risk associated with our options is smaller than for our swaps.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTrading activities are carried out within mandates approved by the Board of Directors. The mandates comprise a value-at-risk (VaR) mandate and a stress mandate as well as a limit for the maximum positions measured in energy units per product (power, gas, etc.).",

        "page_content": "## 7.5  Credit risks\n\nWe are exposed to credit risks from our trading partners and customers. A large part of our counterparty risks concerns major  international energy companies and banks. Such trading is regulated under standard agreements, such as EFET and ISDA agreements, which feature, for instance, credit rating and netting provisions. Our credit exposure is mainly concentrated on counterparties in Denmark, the UK, Germany, and the US.\n\nWe limit our credit risks by:\n\n- -  systematically rating significant counterparties\n- -  granting credit limits\n- -  demanding that collateral be furnished, or/uni00A0credit insurance put in place.\n\nThe counterparties and credit limits  granted are monitored on an ongoing basis. The monitoring is based on the framework established by our Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. For the most significant counterparties, an internal rating is required to determine credit limits. The rating is based on information from  external credit rating agencies, publicly  available information, and our own analyses.\n\nWe have not suffered losses from any single major counterparty in 2019 or 2020.\n\nThe credit risks from our financial assets primarily concern derivatives, cash, securities, and receivables. The assessment is based on the\n\nindividual counterparty's ratings with Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch.

        "page_content": "## 7.7   Fair value measurement\n\nWe measure our securities and derivatives at fair value. A number of our derivatives, mainly power purchase agreements, are measured based on non-observable inputs. The most significant non-observable input is the longterm US power price, due to the long duration of the contracts.\n\n## Valuation principles and key assumptions\n\nIn order to minimise the use of subjective estimates or modifications of parameters and calculation models, it is our policy to determine fair values based on the external information that most accurately reflects the market values. We use pricing services and benchmark services to increase the data quality. Market values are determined by the Treasury & Risk Management function which reports to the CFO. The development in market values is monitored on a continuing basis and reported to the Executive Committee.\n\n## US pow/e.ss01/r.ss01 p/r.ss01ic/e.ss01/s.ss01 (ERCOT)\n\nThe US power purchase agreements give exposure to the long-term US power prices in the ERCOT region. The price is observable for the first four to six years. For the following four to six years, the power price is estimated based on observable inputs (gas prices and heat rates). For the short subsequent period, the power price is non-observable and estimated by extrapolating the power price towards the U.S. Energy Information Administration's long-term power price forecast, assuming similar seasonality as in previous periods. As only a minor part of the contract period is within the period where power prices are non- observable, we classify the contracts as based on  observable input.\n\n## Deferred gain/losses from US power purchase agreements\n\nThe deferred gains from US PPAs consist of the market value of PPAs recocognised in the opening balance when Lincoln Clean Energy was purchased in 2018. The PPAs lock the  power price of the expected power in generation over a period of 13-15 years. These contracts are accounted for at fair value. Due to the long duration of these PPAs, power prices are not observable for the last part of the duration. The deferred revenue is recognised in profit or loss in the future period to which the market value relates. In 2020, we have recognised an  income of DKK 184 million (2019: DKK 216 million) related to the deferred fair value of PPAs not recognised in profit or loss at initial recognition. The total amount of deferred revenue as of 31  December 2020 amounts to DKK 736 million (2019: DKK 995 million).\n\n|                                      | Assets                              | Assets                              | Assets            | Assets                                    | Liabilities                         | Liabilities    |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Fair value hierarchy,  DKKm          | Inventories                         | Derivatives                         | Other receivables | Securities                                | Derivatives                         | Other payables |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf       |                                     |                                     |                   |                                           |                                     |                |\n| Quoted prices                        | /one.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf | /two.tf,/zero.tf/seven.tf/four.tf   | -                 | -                                         | /two.tf,/two.tf/nine.tf/four.tf     | -              |\n| Observable input                     | -                                   | /three.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/seven.tf   | -                 | /two.tf/five.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/four.tf | -              |\n| Non-observable input                 | -                                   | /four.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf           | -                 | -                                         | /four.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf            | -              |\n| Total /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf | /six.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf     | -                 | /two.tf/five.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /six.tf,/three.tf/one.tf/eight.tf   | -              |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf       |                                     |                                     |                   |                                           |                                     |                |\n| Quoted prices                        | /nine.tf/five.tf/nine.tf            | /one.tf/six.tf                      | -                 | -                                         | /two.tf/one.tf                      | -              |\n| Observable input                     | -                                   | /seven.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/seven.tf  | -                 | /one.tf/six.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/two.tf    | /six.tf,/nine.tf/one.tf/six.tf      | -              |\n| Non-observable input                 | -                                   | /two.tf/five.tf/seven.tf            | -                 | -                                         | /two.tf/one.tf                      | -              |\n| Total /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf | /nine.tf/five.tf/nine.tf            | /seven.tf,/seven.tf/four.tf/zero.tf | -                 | /one.tf/six.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/two.tf    | /six.tf,/nine.tf/five.tf/eight.tf   | -              |\n\n## Significant non-observable inputs\n\nMarket values based on non-observable input comprise primarily long-term contracts on the purchase or sale of power and gas. Since there are no active markets for the long-term prices of power and gas, the market values have been determined through an estimate of the future prices. Normally, the price can be observed for a maximum of four to six years in the power market, after which an active market no longer exists.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nMarket values based on quoted prices comprise quoted securities and derivatives that are traded in active markets. The market value of derivatives traded in an active market are often settled on a daily basis, thereby minimising the market value presented on the balance sheet.\n\nMarket values based on observable inputs comprise derivatives where valuation models with observable inputs are used to measure fair value.\n\nAll assets and liabilities measured at market value are measured on a recurring basis.\n\nIn business combinations, gain (loss) at initial recognition on derivatives whose values are based on non-observable inputs are deferred and recognised in the period to which the value relates.",

        "page_content": "## 8.2   Leases\n\nOur lease liabilities decreased by DKK/uni00A0278 million relative to 31 December 2019. Additions primarily related to commenced leases of plots of land related to development and construction projects in Onshore.\n\nOffshore's leases mainly comprise seabeds related to the offshore wind farms in the UK and US and service  vessels. Onshore's leases comprise plots of land related to onshore wind farms. Markets & Bioenergy mainly lease gas storage facilities in Germany.\n\nLeased assets recognised under 'Other activ ities' mainly comprise our two office premises in Gentofte and London. The premises are used by employees from all of our business units.\n\nSeabed leases include variable lease payments which depend on the number of megawatt hours generated. However, we have typically agreed on minimum lease payments for the seabeds, and these minimum payments are included in the lease liabilities.\n\nExpenses for the year relating to variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities amounted to DKK 411 million in 2020 (2019: DKK 311 million). Interests on lease debt expensed in profit (loss) were DKK 177 million in 2020 (2019: DKK 171 million).\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases were DKK 1,129 million in 2020 (2019: DKK 1,147 million).\n\nWe have entered into leases of DKK 368 million which are not commenced and consequently not included in our lease liabilities.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOur lease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of the in-substance fixed lease payments for the use of a lease asset. If, at inception of the lease, we are reasonably certain about exercising an option to extend a lease, we will include the lease payments in the option period when calculating the lease liability. We measure the lease asset to the value of the lease liability at initial recognition.\n\nOur lease assets are classified alongside our owned assets of similar type under property, plant, and equipment. We depreciate our lease assets during the lease term. The depreciation method used is the straight-line method for all our lease assets, except for seabed leases where the depreciation method is aligned with the depreciation method for the related offshore wind farm. Therefore, seabed lease assets are depreciated by using either the straight-line method or the reducing-fraction method.\n\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. We allocate the consideration in a contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. We account for non-lease components in accordance with the accounting policy applicable for such items. Non-lease components comprise building services and operating costs of leased vessels, etc.\n\nVariable lease expenses are recognised in other external expenses in the period when the condition triggering those payments occurs. Interests of lease liabilities are recognised in financial expenses.\n\nEach lease payment is separated into repayment of the lease liability and payment of interests of the lease liability. Debt repayments are classified as cash flows from financing activities, and payment of interests are classified as cash flows from operating activities.\n\n| Lease assets,  DKKm                                                         | Land and  buildings                | Production  assets                  | Fixtures and fittings,  tools, and equipment                                    | Property,  plant, and  equipment    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Carrying amount at /one.tf January /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf           | /four.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf | /four.tf/seven.tf/six.tf            | /three.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                                                      | /five.tf,/one.tf/nine.tf/one.tf     |\n| Exchange rate adjustments                                                   | (/two.tf/two.tf/six.tf)            | (/seven.tf)                         | (/four.tf)                                                                      | (/two.tf/three.tf/seven.tf)         |\n| Additions                                                                   | /seven.tf/seven.tf/five.tf         | -

The ESG performance report also includes additional information, such as selected ESG indicators by country and all ESG accounting policies, including a list of  references for conversion factors used in calculations.\n\n## Scope and consolidation\n\nUnless otherwise stated, ESG data is reported on the basis of the same principles as the financial statements. Thus, the  consolidated ESG statements include consolidated data from the parent company, \u00d8rsted A/S, and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S. Data from associates and joint ventures are not included.\n\nThe consolidation of safety data deviates from the above-described principles. Safety data is collected using an operational scope. This means that irrespective of our ownership share, we include 100 % of injuries and hours worked, etc., arising from all operations where \u00d8rsted is responsible for safety, including safety related to external suppliers.\n\nData from acquisitions and divestments are  included or excluded from the date of acquisition or divestment.\n\n## Danish Financial Statements Act, sections 99 a, 99 b, and 107 d\n\nPursuant to section 99 a of the Danish Financial Statements Act (\u00c5rsregnskabsloven), \u00d8rsted is under an obligation to account for the company's CSR activities and report on business strategies and activities with regard to human rights, labour rights, anticorruption, the environment, and the climate. By publishing our sustainability report (orsted.com/sustainability2020), \u00d8rsted complies with section 99 a of the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\n\u00d8rsted's work for increased gender diversity at management level is reported in accordance with section 99 b of the Danish Financial Statements Act in our ESG performance  report 2020 (orsted.com/ESGperformance2020).\n\nReporting of diversity in accordance with section 107 d of the Danish Financial Statements Act can be seen in our sustainability report (orsted.com/sustainability2020).\n\n## Business changes in 2020 affecting ESG data\n\nIn August 2020, we closed the divestment of the Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses.\n\nIn December 2020, we closed the divestment of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) business.\n\n## Discontinued ESG indicators in 2020\n\n- -  Power distribution.\n\n## Discontinued ESG indicators in 2020 which can still be found in the full ESG performance report 2020\n\n- - LTIF (lost-time injury frequency).\n- - People powered.\n- - Jobs created.\n- -  Nationality diversity of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee.\n\n## Scope 3 target: update of the 2018 base year emissions\n\nWe have updated our 2018 base year for scope 3 emissions in accordance with our policy for baseline adjustments for scope 3, due to our divestment of the LNG business in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur full ESG data set can be seen in the ESG performance report 2020 (orsted.com/ESGperformance2020).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 11.3 GW\n\nOur installed renewable capacity increased by 14 % from 2019 to 2020. We have a target of +30 GW installed renewable capacity in 2030.\n\n## 90 %\n\nThe green share of our heat and power generation increased from 86 % in 2019 to 90 % in 2020. We have a target of 99 % in 2025.\n\n## 58 g CO 2 e/ kWh\n\nOur greenhouse gas intensity was reduced by 11 % to 58 g CO2e/kWh in 2020. Our target is to reach 10 g CO2e/kWh in 2025.\n\n## 100 %\n\nWe reached our target for sourced certified sustainable wooden biomass as the share of certified sustainable biomass is now 100 %.",

The increase was  primarily due to higher generation from wind farms. Our target is 99 % green energy generation in 2025.\n\nOur greenhouse gas intensity was reduced by 11 % for the same reasons as for the increase in the renewable energy share. We are well on track to meeting our target of a greenhouse gas emission intensity of no more than 10 g CO2e/kWh in 2025. We will continue to investigate solutions for the remaining emissions, which could include investing in certified carbonremoval projects.\n\nWe have updated our 2018 base year scope 3 emissions in accordance with our policy for baseline adjustments for scope 3. We divested the LNG business in 2020. The LNG bussiness accounted for 20 % of the 2018 base year scope 3 emissions. Therefore, we have reduced the scope 3 base year emissions and target emissions in 2032 by 20 %.\n\nOur scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 27 % from 2019 to 2020. The main driver for this reduction was the 28 % decrease in gas sales ( category 11). Our second-largest source of scope 3 emissions (category 3) was reduced by 24 % from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to reduced sale of regular power to end-customers. Our third-largest source of scope 3 emissions (category 2) includes greenhouse gas emissions from the supply chain and the installation of new assets, such as the offshore wind farm Borssele 1 & 2 and the three onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek.\n\nThe installed renewable capacity increased by 14 % in 2020 due to the commisioning of the offshore wind farm Borssele 1 & 2 (752 MW) and the onshore wind farms Sage Draw (338 MW), Plum Creek (230 MW), and Willow Creek (184 MW).",

wind-based generation in 2020. The increase was primarily due to full-year generation from Hornsea 1 (commissioned in Q4 2019), generation from Borssele 1 & 2 (commisioned in Q4 2020), and higher wind speeds.\n\nOnshore wind-based generation increased by 64 % in 2020 relative to 2019. The increase was primarily due to additional generation from Lockett (commissioned in Q3 2019), Sage Draw (commissioned in Q1 2020), Plum Creek (commissioned in Q2 2020), and Willow Creek (commissioned in Q3 2020).\n\nThermal power generation was 4 % lower in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower combined heat and power generation, partly offset by increased power generation due to ancillary services.\n\nThermal heat generation decreased by 20 %, primarily due to the warm weather in Q1 2020, leading to a lower demand for heat, which was partly offset by colder weather and higher heat generation in H2 2020.\n\nThe coal share of fuels in our thermal heat and power generation increased by 5 percentage points due to generation at Esbjerg and Studstrup power stations, associated with additional ancillary services. The green share of energy in Markets & Bioenergy increased by 3 percentage points in 2020, primarily due to the bioconversion of Asn\u00e6s Power Station in late 2019.\n\nWe reached our target to source all wooden biomass as certified sustainable biomass in 2020.\n\nDue to the increase in renewable energy generation, the amount of avoided carbon emissions increased by 16 % from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, our renewable energy generation avoided the emission of 13.1 million tonnes carbon dioxide.",

With a satisfaction and motivation score of 78 in 2020, our target of being in the top 10 % compared to our external benchmark group was met.\n\nOur total recordable injury rate (TRIR) decreased from 4.9 in 2019 to 3.6 in 2020. We registered 77 total recordable injuries (TRIs), of which 58 involved employees working for our suppliers. We continue to have a strong focus on safety. Our target is a TRIR of 2.9 or below in 2025.\n\nOur employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistle-blower scheme or through our management system. In 2020, four substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistle-blower scheme. A total of three cases concerned violation of our good business conduct policy, and one case concerned violation of administrative procedures. The four cases had consequences for the individuals involved. None of the reported cases were critical to our business or impacted our financial results.",

For combined heat and power (CHP) plants, the share of the specific fuel (e.g. biomass) is calculated relative to the total fuel consumption for a given plant or unit within a given time period. The specific fuel share is then multiplied with the total heat and power generation for the specific unit in the specific period. The result is the fuel-based generation for the individual unit - for example the biomass-based generation of heat and power from the CHP unit within a given time period.\n\nThe percentage shares of the individual energy sources are calculated by dividing generation from individual energy source with the total generation.\n\nThe following energy sources and fuels are considered renewable energy: wind, solar PV, biomass, biogas, and power sourced with green certificates. The following energy sources are considered fossil energy sources: coal, natural gas, and oil.\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity\n\nGreenhouse gas intensity is defined as the scope 1 and 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas emissions divided by the total heat and power generation.\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 1 covers all direct emissions of greenhouse gases from \u00d8rsted. The direct carbon emissions from the combined heat and power plants are determined on the basis of the fuel quantities used in accordance with the EU ETS scheme. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS scheme are for the most part calculated as energy consumptions multiplied by emission factors.\n\nScope 2 emissions are primarily calculated as the power volumes  purchased multiplied by\n\ncountry-specific emission factors. Location-based emissions are calculated based on average emission factors for each country, whereas market-based emissions take account for green power purchased and assume the regular power is delivered as residual power where the green part has been taken out.\n\n## Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol which divides the scope 3 inventory into 15 subcategories.\n\nGHG emissions from capital goods include upstream GHG emissions from installed wind farms. We calculate the emissions based on GHG life-cycle data from one of our wind turbine suppliers. Carbon emissions are included from cradle to operation and maintenance for single wind turbines. Wind farms are included from the month where the wind farm has achieved commercial operation date (COD).\n\nGHG emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities are calculated based on actual fuel consumption and power sales as reported in our ESG consolidation system. The fuel consumption is multiplied by emission factors to calculate the upstream GHG emissions from extraction, mining, forestry, transportation, etc., for the fuels. We include all power sales to end-customers and use separate emission factors for green sales (with certificates) and regular sales (without certificates).\n\nGHG emissions from use of sold products are calculated based on actual sales of gas (to both end-users and wholesale) as reported in our ESG consolidation system. The total gas sale is divided into natural gas, LNG, and biogas which have specific upstream and downstream emission factors.\n\n## 'Other' includes GHG emissions from:\n\n- -  purchased goods and services, calculated based on spend reports from our SAP system. All spends are divided into categories where relevant emission factors are used to calculate the GHG emissions from each spend category\n- -  upstream transportation and distribution which are included in the emission factors we use for purchases and sale and are therefore not reported separately\n- -  waste generated in operations, calculated based on actual waste volumes multiplied with the relevant emission factors\n- -  business travel, calculated based on mileage allowances for employee travel in own car. GHG emissions from plane travel is provided by our travel agent\n- -  employee commuting, calculated based on estimates for distance travelled and travel type (e.g. car and train)\n- -  downstream transportation and distribution, calculated based on actual volumes of residual products generated from our CHP plants multiplied by relevant GHG emission factors for transportation.\n\n## Installed, decided (FID), and awarded or contracted renewable energy capacity\n\nInstalled renewable capacity is calculated as the cumulative renewable gross capacity installed by \u00d8rsted before divestments. For installed renewable thermal capacity, we use the heat capacity, as heat is the primary outcome of thermal energy generation, and as bioconversions of the combined heat and power plants are driven by heat contracts. Decided (FID) capacity is the renewable capacity for which a final investment decision (FID) has been made. The awarded renewable capacity is based on the capacities which have been awarded to \u00d8rsted in auctions and tenders. The contracted capacity is the capacity for which \u00d8rsted has signed a contract or power purchase agreement (PPA) concerning a new renewable energy plant. Typically, offshore wind farms are awarded, whereas onshore wind farms are contracted. We include the full capacity if more than 50 % of PPAs or offtake are secured.\n\n## Heat and power generation\n\nPower generation from wind is calculated as sold generation. The Gunfleet Sands and Walney 1 and 2 offshore wind farms have been consolidated according to ownership interest. The other wind farms are financially consolidated.\n\nThermal power generation is determined as net generation sold, based on settlements from the official Danish production database. Data for generation from foreign facilities are provided by the operators. Thermal heat (including steam) generation is measured as net output sold to heat customers.\n\n## Heat and power generation capacity\n\nPower generation capacity from offshore wind farms is included from the time when the individual wind turbine has passed a 240-hour test. For onshore wind and solar PV farms, the whole farm is included after COD. The Gunfleet Sands and Walney 1 and 2 offshore wind farms have been consolidated according\n\nto ownership interest. Other wind farms, solar farms, and CHP plants are financially consolidated.\n\nThe thermal heat and power generation capacity is a measure of the maximum capability to generate heat and power. The capacity can change over time with plant modifications. For each CHP plant, the capacity is given for generation with the primary fuel mix. Overload is not included.\n\n## Availability\n\nAvailability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by market requested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of site performance, but due to external factors. Total availability is determined by weighting the individual wind farm's availability against the capacity of the wind farm.\n\n## Load factor\n\nThe load factor is calculated as the ratio between actual generation over a period relative to potential generation, which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period. The load factor is commercially adjusted. Commercially adjusted means that, for Danish and German offshore wind farms, the load factor is adjusted if the offshore wind farm has been financially compensated by the transmission system operators in situations where the offshore wind farm is available for generation, but the output cannot be supplied to the grid due to maintenance or grid interruptions. Wind farms in other countries are not compensated for non-access to the grid. New wind turbines are included in the calculation of availability and load factor once they have passed a 240-hour test for offshore wind turbines and commercial operation date (COD) for onshore wind turbines.\n\n## Wind speed\n\nWind speeds for the areas where \u00d8rsted's offshore and onshore wind farms are located are provided to \u00d8rsted by an external supplier. Wind speeds are weighted on the basis of the capacity of the individual wind farms and consolidated to an \u00d8rsted total for offshore and onshore, respectively. 'Normal wind speed' is a 20-year historical wind speed average.",

        "page_content": "## Degree days\n\nDegree days are a measure of how cold it has been and thus indicate the amount of energy needed to heat a building. The number of degree days helps to compare the heat demand for a given year with a normal year. The number of degree days expresses the difference between an average indoor temperature of 17 \u00b0C and the outside mean temperature for a given period. The need for heat increases with the number of degree days.\n\n## Coal share of fuels used for thermal heat and power generation\n\nThe coal share is calculated as the coal consumption in gigajoule (GJ) relative to the total fuel volume in gigajoule.\n\n## Certified sustainable wooden biomass sourced\n\nCertified biomass is defined as wooden biomass, i.e. wood pellets and wood chips. Biomass is measured as sourced wooden biomass delivered to individual combined heat and power plants within the reporting period.\n\nCertified sustainable wooden biomass sourced must be certified within at least one of the claim categories accepted by the Danish industry agreement on certified biomass. Accepted claim categories are: FSC 100 %, FSC Mix, PEFC 100 %, and SBP compliant. Certified biomass is calculated as the amount of sourced wooden biomass compared to the total amount of sourced wooden biomass delivered to individual CHP plants within the reporting period.\n\n## Green share of generation, Markets & Bioenergy\n\nThis is calculated as the green share of heat and power generation, but is only shown for the business unit Markets & Bioenergy.\n\n## Avoided carbon emissions\n\nAvoided carbon emissions due to generation from offshore and onshore wind farms are calculated under the assumption that the generation from wind farms replace an equal quantity of power generated using fossil fuels.\n\nThe carbon emissions avoided due to conversions of combined heat and power plants and subsequent switch from fossil fuels to biomass is calculated on the basis of the energy content of the fuel used\n\nat CHP plants. It is assumed that the use of 1 GJ of biomass fuel avoids the use of 1 GJ of fossil fuels. The upstream emissions (from production, manufacture, and transport of biomass) are included.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales of power and gas are calculated as physical sales to retail customers, wholesale customers, and exchanges. Sales are based on readings from \u00d8rsted's trading systems. Internal sales to Bioenergy are not included in the statement.\n\n## Accounting policies - social\n\n## Employees\n\nOur reporting covers contractually employed employees in all \u00d8rsted companies in which \u00d8rsted holds an ownership interest of more than 50 %. Employees in associates are not included.\n\nEmployee data are recognised based on records from the Group's ordinary registration systems. The  number of employees is determined as the number of employees at the end of each month converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs).\n\nEmployees who have been made redundant are recognised until the expiry of their notice period, regardless of whether they have been released from all or some of their duties during their notice period.\n\n## Employee satisfaction\n\n\u00d8rsted conducts a comprehensive employee satisfaction survey once a year. With a few exceptions, all \u00d8rsted employees are invited to participate in the survey.\n\nThe following employees are not invited to participate: employees who joined the company shortly before the employee satisfaction survey, employees who resigned shortly after the employee satisfaction survey, interns, consultants, advisers, and external temporary workers who do not have an employment contract with \u00d8rsted.\n\nIn the survey, a number of questions are asked. The answers are given on a scale from 1 to 10 and are subsequently converted to index figures on a scale from 0 to 100.\n\n## Safety\n\nOccupational injuries are calculated according to operational scope. Data from companies whollyor partly-owned by \u00d8rsted, and where \u00d8rsted is responsible for safety, is included. Occupational injuries and lost-time injuries are calculated for both our own employees and suppliers. Data from all \u00d8rsted locations is recognised.\n\nThe total recordable injury rate (TRIR) is calculated as the number of total recordable injuries per one million hours worked. The number of hours worked is based on 1,667 working hours annually per full-time employee and monthly records of the number of employees converted into full-time employees. For suppliers, the actual number of hours worked is recognised on the basis of data provided by the supplier, access control systems at locations, or estimates.\n\nFatalities are the number of employees who lost their lives as a result of a work-related incident.\n\n## Accounting policies - governance\n\n## Board of Directors of \u00d8rsted A/S\n\nThe employee representatives on the Board of Directors are not included in the data for the Board of Directors.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe Executive Committee consists of the Executive Board (our CEO and CFO) and five additional members who undertake the day-to-day management of \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Substantiated whistle-blower cases\n\n\u00d8rsted's whistle-blower hotline is available for internal and external reporting of suspected cases of inappropriate or illegal behaviour. Whistle-blower cases are received and handled by the Internal Audit function which also receives similar reports through the management system and from compliance officers.\n\nAll reports are managed in accordance with the guidelines for the handling of whistle-blower reports approved by the Audit & Risk Committee, which is ultimately responsible for the whistle-blower scheme.\n\nOnly cases which are closed during the financial year, and which have been reported to the Audit & Risk Committee as fully or partially substantiated are reported in the ESG statements.\n\n## Cases transferred to the police\n\nCases transferred to the police are defined as the number of cases reported in accordance with the above which have been transferred to the police.",

Basis of reporting\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act ('\u00c5rsregnskabsloven') (reporting class D).\n\nThe Danish Financial Statements Act allows us to use certain IFRS standards to interpret the act. Previously, we have therefore implemented IFRS 15 'Revenue' and IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\nThe accounting policies remain unchanged from the previous year.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK) rounded to the nearest million.\n\nThe parent company accounting policies are consistent with the accounting policies described for the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nWe recognise exchange rate adjustments of receivables from and payables to subsidiaries as financial income and expenses in the income statement when the balances are accounted for as part of the total net investment in foreign enterprises. Likewise, we recognise foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and derivatives in the income statement as financial income and expenses when they have been entered into to hedge the net investment in the foreign enterprises.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRental income comprises income from commercial leases and is recognised over the term of the lease. Income from services is recognised when delivery has taken place.\n\n## Dividends from investments\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and associates are recognised in the income statement for the financial year in which the dividends are approved at the annual general meeting. If the dividends exceed the total income after takeover, the dividends are recognised as a reduction of the cost of the investment under assets.\n\n## Investments\n\nWe measure our investments in  subsidiaries and associates at cost. If there is any indication that the value of a company is lower than our future earnings in the company, impairment testing of the company is carried out as described in the consolidated financial statements. The carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount whenever the carrying amount exceeds the future earnings in the company (recoverable amount).\n\nIf we have a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit in subsidiaries and  associates, we recognise a provision for this.\n\n## Tax\n\n\u00d8rsted A/S is taxed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. The jointly taxed companies are\n\npart of joint taxation with the parent company as the management company.\n\nSubsidiaries are included in the joint taxation from the date they are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date on which they are no longer consolidated.\n\nCurrent tax for 2020 is recognised by the individual, jointly taxed companies.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nWe do not prepare a separate statement of cash flows for the parent company. Reference is made to the consolidated statement of cash flows on page 81.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFormosa 1, off the coast of Miaoli County, Taiwan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimates\n\nIn connection with the preparation of the financial statements, a number of accounting estimates have been made that affect the profit (loss) and balance sheet. Estimates are regularly reassessed by management on the basis of historical experience and other relevant factors.\n\n## Impairment test\n\nIf there is any indication that the carrying amount is lower than our future earnings in a company, we test for impairment as described in the consolidated financial statements. The future earnings of the company (recoverable amount) are calculated based on assumptions concerning significant estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Partnership agreements\n\nDivestment of ownership interests in an offshore wind farm (farm-downs) to a partner in a joint operation, including calculating the divestment gains and subsequent recognition of construction agreements and assessment of consolidation method for the retained interests, are considered non-routine transactions.\n\nAs part of farm-downs, compensation mechanisms are often agreed with the partners, e.g. regarding sales price, cost of subsequent use of the offshore transmission asset constructed for the wind farm, potential wake effect compensations and warranties.\n\nWe focused on this area because farm-downs and the related matters are considered non-routine transactions and because the recognition and measurement of the divestment gain, assessment of consolidation method, subsequent construction agreements with the partners, compensation mechanisms and warranties are based on significant judgements and estimates.\n\nOn this basis, partnership agreements were a matter of most significance in our audit.\n\nRefer to notes 1.2, 2.6, and 3.2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nDuring 2020, \u00d8rsted did not perform any new farm-downs, but completed the construction agreements with partners from previous years' farm-downs and divested the offshore transmission asset related to the Walney Extension wind farm.\n\nAs part of our audit we read the sales agreements and the construction agreements and challenged the accounting treatment applied by Management, including the consolidation method.\n\nWe furthermore obtained an understanding of the compensation mechanisms and warranties agreed in farm-downs from previous years. We challenged the estimates prepared by Management for recognition and measurement of these compensation mechanisms and warranties, hereunder by assessing and testing the data, assumptions and models applied, and by evaluating the outcome of previous estimates prepared by Management.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Income Taxes\n\n\u00d8rsted is subject to income taxes in all the countries where they operate. Significant judgements and estimates are required in determining the income taxes, and the measurement of income tax assets and liabilities including uncertain tax positions.\n\nManagement makes significant judgements and estimates when calculating and assessing the income taxes due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business activities conducted in different tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, Management makes estimates, when measuring the tax assets, including when and to which extent these can be utilised in the future, and when measuring tax liabilities including assessing deferred taxes in tax equity partnerships.\n\nAdditionally, \u00d8rsted is party in tax and transfer pricing disputes, where Management assesses the possible outcomes and consequently recognise provisions to cover for these uncertain tax positions. In 2020, \u00d8rsted received an administrative decision from the Danish Tax Agency entailing an additional tax payable and related interests, which Management disputes and has appealed to the relevant authorities.\n\nOn this basis, income taxes were a matter of most significance in our audit.\n\nRefer to notes 1.2, 5.2, and 5.3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur procedures in relation to income taxes, income tax assets and liabilities included evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes, including those related to tax equity partnerships, while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and external advisors. In our audit of income taxes, we involved our tax specialists.\n\nOur procedures covered assessing Management's judgements and estimates of tax balances and carrying amounts as well as the related applied tax rates when calculating these, including the deferred tax liabilities in tax equity partnerships.\n\nOur procedures also covered evaluating and testing \u00d8rsted's processes for recording, assessing and continually reassessing provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nIn our audit of uncertain tax positions, we obtained and reviewed the correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax disputes and the related provisions. When assessing the measurement of the provisions, we challenged the assumptions used, including the possibility of obtaining corresponding tax adjustments, compensations from partners and the likelihood of different outcomes. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the tax disputes, and we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement\n\nand maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures\n\nin the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit  evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the  Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 with the file name ORST-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European  Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:\n\n- -  The preparing of the annual report in XHTML format;\n- -  The selection and application of  appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;\n- -  Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in human-readable format; and\n- -  For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment\n\nof the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- -  Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- -  Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- -  Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- -  Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- -  Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- -  Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31  December 2020 with the file name ORST-2020-12-31.zip\n\nis prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nHellerup, 3 February 2021\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR No 3377 1231\n\n## Lars Baungaard\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne23331\n\n## Rasmus Friis J\u00f8rgensen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne28705",

        "page_content": "## Limited assurance report on the consolidated ESG statements\n\n## To the stakeholders of \u00d8rsted A/S\n\n\u00d8rsted A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the data described below and set out in the consolidated environment, social, and governance statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2020 (consolidated ESG  statements) as included on pages 168-174 in the Annual Report of \u00d8rsted A/S for 2020.\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that the consolidated ESG statements are free of material misstatements and are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies as stated on pages 168-174.\n\nThis conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report.\n\n## What we are assuring\n\nThe scope of our work was limited to assurance over data in the consolidated ESG statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2020 on pages 168-174.\n\n## Professional standards applied and level of assurance\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on  Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits and  Reviews of Historical Financial Information', and, in respect of the reported greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 'Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements'. A limited assurance engagement is  substantially\n\nless in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the  procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited  assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been  obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n## Our independence and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity,  objectivity, professional competence and due care,  confidentiality and professional behaviour. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multi -disciplinary team with  experience in sustain ability reporting and assurance.\n\n## Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies\n\nData and information need to be read and understood together with the accounting policies on pages 168-174, which management are solely responsible for selecting and applying. The  absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure ESG information allows for  different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and\n\ncan affect comparability between entities and over time. The quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine the emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gasses.\n\n## Work performed\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the data. In doing so and based on our professional judgment, we:\n\n- -   conducted interviews with Group functions to assess consolidation processes, use of company -wide systems, and controls performed at Group level;\n- -   performed an assessment of materiality and the selection of topics for the consolidated ESG statements for the period 1 January 31 December 2020;\n- -   conducted an analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted by all business units for consolidation at Group level; and\n- -   evaluated the evidence obtained.\n\n## Management's responsibilities\n\nManagement of \u00d8rsted A/S is responsible for:\n\n- -   designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of data in the consolidated ESG statements on pages 168-174 that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- -   establishing objective accounting policies for preparing data;\n- -   measuring and reporting data in the consolidated ESG statements based on the accounting policies; and\n- -   the content of the  consolidated ESG statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2020.\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are responsible for:\n\n- -   planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the consolidated ESG statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2020 on pages 168-174 are free from material misstatements and are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies;\n- -   forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained; and\n- -   reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of \u00d8rsted A/S.\n\nHellerup, 3 February 2021\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR no. 3377 1231\n\n## Lars Baungaard\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne23331\n\n## Rasmus Friis J\u00f8rgensen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne28705\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nAvailability: Availability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by market requested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of site performance, but due to external factors.\n\nAvoided emissions: The amount other sources of energy would have emitted, if we had not generated energy from renewable sources.\n\nAwarded capacity: Offshore capacity that we have been awarded in auctions and tenders, but where we have yet to sign a PPA and take final investment decision.\n\nBiomass conversion: When a CHP plant is converted from using fossil fuels to using biomass, such as wood pellets, wood chips, and straw. After the conversion, the CHP plant will typically be able to use biomass along with the original fuel types.\n\nBlockage effect: The blockage effect arises from the wind slowing down as it approaches the wind turbines.\n\nBSUoS tariffs: Costs related to the day-to-day operation of the transmission system imposed on generators and suppliers.\n\nCarbon emission allowances: Carbon emission allowances subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).\n\nCfD : A contract for difference is a subsidy that guarantees the difference between the market reference price and the exercise price won.\n\nCHP plant: A combined heat and power (CHP) plant generates both heat and power in the same process.\n\nCommissioning/COD: When our assets are in operation, and the legal liability has been transferred from the supplier to us.\n\nContracted capacity: Onshore capacity where we have signed a PPA, but where we have not yet taken final investment decision.\n\nDecided (FID) and installed capacity: Installed generation capacity plus capacity for assets where a final investment decision has been made.\n\nDegree days: Number of degrees in absolute figures in difference between the average temperature and the official Danish indoor temperature of 17 \u00b0C.\n\nDirect current (DC): The type of power generated by our solar panels.\n\nEPC: Engineering, procurement, and construction. The part of our business which handles the construction and installation of assets.\n\nFTE: Employees (full-time equivalent). The number of full-time employees during a fixed time period.\n\nGeneration capacity: \u00d8rsted's ownership of the asset. Offshore wind turbines are included when each turbine has passed the 240-hour test. Onshore capacities are included after COD.\n\nGreen certificates: Certificate awarded to producers of environment-friendly power as a supplement to the market price of power in the given price area.\n\nGreen dark spread (GDS): Represents the contribution margin per MWh of power generated at a coal-fired CHP plant with a given efficiency. It is determined as the difference between the market price of power and the cost of the coal (including associated freight costs) and carbon emission allowances used to generate the power.\n\nHedging instruments: Financial and physical instruments that can be used to guarantee a specific price for the purchase or sale of, for example, commodities and currency.\n\nInstalled capacity: Installed capacity where the asset has been completed and has passed a final test.\n\nInvestment tax credits (ITCs): Federal tax credit based on qualifying renewable investment costs.\n\nLevelised cost of electricity (LCoE): Average cost measured as present value per megawatt hour (MWh) generated power, covering costs for development and construction as well as subsequent operation and maintenance of the asset.\n\nLoad factor: The ratio between the actual power generation in a given period relative to the potential generation which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period.\n\nNord Pool: The Norwegian-based Nordic power exchange which facilitates power trading in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark.\n\nOffshore transmission assets: Connect offshore generation to the onshore grid and typically include the offshore power transmission infrastructure, an onshore substation, and the electrical equipment relating to the operation of the substation.\n\nO&M: Operations and maintenance. The part of our business that operates and maintains our assets after installation.\n\nPartnership income: Income originating from our partners' purchase of ownership interests in the offshore wind farms. Includes both the gain in connection with the farm-down and the subsequent construction of the wind farm.\n\nPower purchase agreement (PPA): An agreement between us and a buyer/seller to purchase/sell the power we generate which includes all commercial terms (price, delivery, volumes, etc).\n\nProduction tax credit (PTC): Federal tax credit based on eligible power generation in the US.\n\nROCs: Renewable obligation certificates issued by Ofgem in the UK to operators of accredited generating stations for the eligible renewable energy they generate. Operators can trade ROCs with other parties.\n\nStress: Method of measuring the market trading risk of loss on a portfolio from day to day, calculated on a fair-value basis.\n\nTax equity: An arrangement where an investor obtains rights to federal tax credits and other tax attributes in exchange for a cash contribution.\n\nTEC: Transmission entry capacity defines a generator's maximum contractual level of transmission access in MW.\n\nThermal generation: Heat and power generated through the combustion of fossil fuels, biomass, or waste.\n\nFID: Final investment decision.\n\nTNUoS tariffs: Costs related to the use of the transmission networks in the UK based on TEC.\n\nTRIR: In addition to lost-time injuries, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) also includes injuries where the injured person is able to perform restricted work the day after the accident as well as accidents where the injured person has received medical treatment.\n\nTTF: Title transfer facility, Dutch gas hub.\n\nTWh: Terawatt-hour. The amount of energy generated in one hour with the effect of 1 TW. 1 TWh is equivalent to 1,000 GWh or 1,000,000 MWh.\n\nValue at risk (VaR): A financial term used for measuring the loss that may occur in connection with a risk position, assuming a certain volatility, and that the position is held for a certain period of time.\n\nWake effect: Wake within wind farms and between neighbouring wind farms. There is a wake after each wind turbine where the wind slows down. As the wind flow continues, the wake spreads, and the wind speed recovers.\n\nWind speed: Shows the wind speed at \u00d8rsted's wind farms. The wind measurements are weighted on the basis of our generation capacity and can be compared to a normal wind period.",
