Almost all nations felt the e/ffects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large - with the extreme su/ffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle East and the potential restructuring of the global order - are far more important.\n\nAs these events unfold, America's global leadership role is being challenged outside by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put aside our di/fferences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that America, 'conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are\n\nJamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer",

JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure.\n\nIn spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year's regional bank turmoil, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch. Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system annually - and we have never truly experienced the full e/ffect of quantitative tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious.\n\n2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record revenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion 1 and net income of $49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter of 2023 - and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 - while continuing to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology while exercising strict risk disciplines.\n\nThroughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients - as we always are in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across the firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-over-year in retail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding close to 3.6 million net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB)",

In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.3 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world. On a daily basis, we move nearly $10 trillion in over 120 currencies and more than 160 countries, as well as safeguard over $32 trillion in assets. By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought muchneeded stability to the U.S. banking system while allowing us to give a new, secure home to over half a million First Republic customers.\n\nAs always, we hold fast to our commitment to corporate responsibility, including helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy - from supporting work skills training programs around the world to financing a/ffordable housing and small businesses to making investments in cities like Detroit that show how business and government leaders can work together to solve problems.\n\nWe have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5), which allow us to drive good organic growth and promote proper management of our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks). The charts on pages 9-15 show our performance results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. Please peruse them and the CEO letters in this Annual Report, all of which provide specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future.\n\nI remain proud of our company's resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout these challenging past few years, we have never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. As you know, we are champions of banking's essential role in a community - its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in di/fficult times.

        "page_content": "## STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING (AND ONE NEW ONE)\n\nLooking back on the past two+ decades starting from my time as Chairman and CEO of Bank One in 2000 - there is one common theme: our unwavering dedication to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. It is clear that our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people have enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment. In addition, across the firm, we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating.\n\nFirst, our work has very real human impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by single investors, in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100 million people in the United States own stocks; many, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Frequently, these shareholders are veterans, teachers, police o/fficers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or those saving for a home, education or retirement. Often, our employees also bank these shareholders, as well as their families and their companies. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholders.\n\nSecond, shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned over the past few years, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still strengthening shareholder value.\n\nThird, while we don't run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time. This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. These important investments will also drive our company's future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is exceptional. For example, whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004, when the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took place, we have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Standard & Poor's Financials Index.\n\nFourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the principles for How We Do Business on our website and our Purpose statement in my letter from last year) that have helped build this company and made it thrive. These allow us to maintain a fortress balance sheet, constantly invest and nurture talent, fully satisfy regulators, continually improve risk, governance and controls, and serve customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm.\n\nFifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from one another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our superior returns. Nonetheless, despite our best e/fforts, the walls that protect this company are not particularly high - and we face extraordinary competition. I have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it again in this letter. We recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as best we can.\n\nSixth, and this is the new one , we must be a source of strength, particularly in tough times, for our clients and the countries in which we operate. We must take seriously our role as one of the guardians of the world's financial systems.\n\nSeventh, we operate with a very important silent partner - the U.S. government noting as my friend Warren Bu/ffett points out that his company's success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the American flag, they all should say thank you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we always want to give back and pay our fair share. We do pay our fair share - and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, we paid more than $46 billion in federal, state and local taxes in the United States and over $22 billion in taxes outside of the United States. Additionally, we paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over $10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking sector. Our partner - the federal government - also imposes significant regulations upon us, and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our company.\n\nEighth and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our people. They are the front line, both individually and as teams, serving our customers and communities, building the technology, making the strategic decisions, managing the risks, determining our investments and driving innovation. However you view the world - its complexity, risks and opportunities - a company's prosperity requires a great team of people with guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabilities and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success.",

United by our principles and purpose, we help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world. What we have accomplished in the 20 years since the Bank One and JPMorgan Chase merger is evidence of the importance of our values.\n\n## CELEBRATING THE 20 TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BANK ONE/JPMORGAN CHASE MERGER\n\n## J.P. Morgan Chase\n\nBy 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10 largest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of their predecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late 1700s.\n\n## Bank One\n\nBank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United States. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it announced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just three years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now headquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the Midwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the United States. But the merger didn't go as planned, with Bank One issuing three di/fferent earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive ranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company and help bring it back to profitability and growth.\n\n## The story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks\n\nFast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S. banking. Most of the nation's larger banks were trying to position themselves to be an 'endgame winner.' In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston Financial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks - already amalgamations of several predecessor companies - touted the breadth of their combined retail branch network.",

In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among U.S. commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion, according to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data.\n\nIn July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged - as part of a 225-year journey - to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger in 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market capitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years - fixing systems and upgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent we have made our company an endgame winner.\n\nIn earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have brought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis and a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from accomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by market capitalization.\n\nEach of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share, strong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities and shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded in JPMorgan Chase - the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-standing client relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence in more than 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet - would be hard to replicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always be there for clients, governments and communities - in good times and in bad times - and this strength has enabled us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future.\n\nYou can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have achieved along the way.",

        "page_content": "## Update on Specific Issues Facing Our Company\n\nEach year, I try to update you on some of the most important issues facing our company. First and foremost may well be the impact of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile we do not know the full e/ffect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business - or how it will a/ffect society at large - we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others.\n\n## THE CRITICAL IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nSince the firm first started using AI over a decade ago, and its first mention in my 2017 letter to shareholders, we have grown our AI organization materially. It now includes more than 2,000 AI/ machine learning (ML) experts and data scientists. We continue to attract some of the best and brightest in this space and have an exceptional firmwide AI/ML and Research department with deep expertise.\n\nWe have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years - and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk - and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way.\n\nWhile we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are a/ffected by this trend.\n\nFinally, as a global leader across businesses and regions, we have large amounts of extraordinarily rich data that, together with AI, can fuel better insights and help us improve how we manage risk and serve our customers. In addition to making sure our data is high quality and easily accessible, we need to complete the migration of our analytical data estate to the public cloud. These new data platforms o/ffer high-performance compute power, which will unlock our ability to use our data in ways that are hard to contemplate today.\n\nRecognizing the importance of AI to our business, we created a new position called Chief Data & Analytics O/fficer that sits on our Operating Committee.\n\nElevating this new role to the Operating Committee level - reporting directly to Daniel Pinto and me reflects how critical this function will be going forward and how seriously we expect AI to influence our business. This will embed data and analytics into our decision making at every level of the company. The primary focus is not just on the technical aspects of AI but also on how all management can - and should - use it. Each of our lines of business has corresponding data and analytics roles so we can share best practices, develop reusable solutions that solve multiple business problems, and continuously learn and improve as the future of AI unfolds.",

        "page_content": "## Clearly, AI comes with many risks, which need to be rigorously managed.\n\nWe have a robust, well-established risk and control framework that helps us proactively stay in front of AI-related risks, particularly as the regulatory landscape evolves. And we will, of course, continue to work hard with our regulators, clients and subject matter experts to make sure we maintain the highest ethical standards and are transparent in how AI helps us make decisions; e.g., to counter bias among other things.\n\nYou may already be aware that there are bad actors using AI to try to infiltrate companies' systems to steal money and intellectual property or simply to cause disruption and damage. For our part, we incorporate AI into our toolset to counter these threats and proactively detect and mitigate their e/fforts.\n\n## OUR JOURNEY TO THE CLOUD\n\nGetting our technology to the cloud - whether the public cloud or the private cloud - is essential to fully maximize all of our capabilities, including the power of our data. The cloud o/ffers many benefits: 1) it accelerates the speed of delivery of new services; 2) it simultaneously reduces the cost of compute power and enables, when needed, an extraordinary amount of compute capability - called burst computing; 3) it provides that compute capability across all of our data; and 4) it allows us to be able to constantly and quickly adopt new technologies because updated cloud services are continually being added - more so in the public cloud, where we benefit from the innovation that all cloud providers create, than in the private cloud, where innovation is only our own.\n\nOf course, we are learning a lot along the way. For example, we know we should carefully pick which applications and which data go to the public cloud versus the private cloud because of the expense, security and capabilities required. In addition, it is critical that we eventually use multiple clouds to avoid lock-in. And we intend to maintain our own expertise so that we're never reliant on the expertise of others even if that requires additional money.\n\nWe invested approximately $2 billion to build four new, modern, private cloud-based, highly reliable and e/fficient data centers in the United States (we have 32 data centers globally). To date, about 50% of our applications run a large part of their processing in the public or private cloud. Approximately 70% of our data is now running in the public or private cloud. By the end of 2024, we aim to have 70% of applications and 75% of data moved to the public or private cloud. The new data centers are around 30% more e/fficient than our existing legacy data centers. Going to the public cloud can provide 30% additional e/fficiency if done correctly (e/fficiency improves when your data and applications have been modified, or 'refactored,' to enable new cloud services). We have been constantly updating most of our global data centers, and by the end of this year, we can start closing some that are larger, older and less e/fficient.\n\n## ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC BANK AND ITS CUSTOMERS\n\nThe purchase of First Republic Bank was not something that we would have done just for ourselves. But the regulators relied on us to step forward (we worked hand in hand with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. Treasury), and the purchase of First Republic helped stabilize and strengthen the U.S. financial system in a time of crisis.\n\nThe acquisition of a major company entails a lot of complexity. People tend to focus on the financial and economic outcomes, which is a reasonable thing to do. And in the case of First Republic, the numbers look rather good. We recorded an accounting gain of $3 billion on the purchase, and we told the world we expected to add more than $500 million to earnings annually, which we now believe will be closer to $2 billion. However, these results mask some of the true costs. First, approximately one-third of the incremental earning was simply deploying excess capital and liquidity, which doesn't require purchasing a $300 billion bank we simply could have bought $300 billion of assets. Second, as soon as the deal was announced, approximately 7,600 of our employees went from working on tasks that would benefit the future of JPMorgan Chase to working on the",

        "page_content": "merger integration. Overall, the integration involves e/ffectively combining more than 165 systems (e.g., statement, deposit, accounting and human resources) and consolidating policies, risk reporting, and other various rules and procedures. We hope to have most of the integration done by the middle of 2024.\n\nFortunately, we were very familiar and comfortable with all of the assets we were acquiring from First Republic. What we didn't take on was First Republic's excessive interest rate exposure - one of the reasons it failed - which we e/ffectively hedged within days of the acquisition.\n\nOur people did a great job of respectfully managing this transition, knowing that circumstances were particularly tough for our new colleagues, whom we tried to welcome with open arms. We did everything we could to redeploy individuals whose jobs were lost because of the merger (we directly hired over 5,000 people). Our approach has always been to go into an acquisition knowing we can learn things from other teams, and in this case, we did: First Republic had done an outstanding job serving high-net-worth clients and venture capitalists, and we are developing what is e/ffectively a new business for us following First Republic's servicing model. We will serve these high-net-worth clients through a single point of contact, supported by a concierge service model, across our distribution channels - including more than 20 new J.P. Morgan branded branches.\n\n## NAVIGATING IN A COMPLEX AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WORLD\n\nIn the policy section, we talk about how we may be entering one of the most treacherous geopolitical eras since World War II. And I have written in the past about high levels of debt, fiscal stimulus, ongoing deficit spending and the unknown e/ffects of quantitative tightening (which I am more worried about than most) so I won't repeat those views here. However, the impacts of these geopolitical and economic forces are large and somewhat unprecedented; they may not be fully understood until they have completely played out over multiple years. In any case, JPMorgan Chase must be prepared for the various potential impacts and outcomes on our company and our people.\n\n## We remain wary of economic prognosticating.\n\nWhile all companies essentially budget on a base case forecast, we are very careful not to run our business that way. Instead, we look at a range of potential outcomes for which we need to be prepared. Geopolitical and economic forces have an unpredictable timetable - they may unfold over months, or years, and are nearly impossible to put into a one-year forecast. They also have an unpredictable interplay: For example, the geopolitical situation may end up having virtually no e/ffect on the world's economy or it could potentially be its determinative factor.\n\nWe have ongoing concerns about persistent inflationary pressures and consider a wide range of outcomes to manage interest rate exposure and other business risks.\n\nMany key economic indicators today continue to be good and possibly improving, including inflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow , conditions that will a/ffect the future should be considered. For example, there seems to be a large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue. All of the following factors appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the world, restructuring of global trade, capital needs of the new green economy, and possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed investment in the energy infrastructure. In the past, fiscal deficits did not seem to be closely related to inflation. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a general understanding that inflation was driven by 'guns and butter'; i.e., fiscal deficits and the increase to the money supply, both partially driven by the Vietnam War, led to increased inflation, which went over 10%. The deficits today are even larger and occurring in boom times - not as the result of a recession and they have been supported by quantitative easing, which was never done before the great financial crisis. Quantitative easing is a form of increasing the money supply (though it has many o/ffsets). I remain more concerned about quantitative easing than most, and its reversal, which has never been done before at this scale.",

        "page_content": "Equity values, by most measures, are at the high end of the valuation range, and credit spreads are extremely tight. These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing modest growth along with declining inflation and interest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower than that. In the meantime, there seems to be an enormous focus, too much so, on monthly inflation data and modest changes to interest rates. But the die may be cast - interest rates looking out a year or two may be predetermined by all of the factors I mentioned above. Small changes in interest rates today may have less impact on inflation in the future than many people believe.\n\nTherefore, we are prepared for a very broad range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even more, with equally wide-ranging economic outcomes from strong economic growth with moderate inflation (in this case, higher interest rates would result from higher demand for capital) to a recession with inflation; i.e., stagflation. Economically, the worst-case scenario would be stagflation, which would not only come with higher interest rates but also with higher credit losses, lower business volumes and more di/fficult markets. Under these many di/fferent scenarios, our company would continue to perform at least okay. Importantly, being prepared means we can continue to help our clients no matter what the future portends.\n\n## The mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but beware of higher rates and recession - not just for banks but for the whole economy.\n\nWhen we purchased First Republic in May 2023 following the failure of two other regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we thought that the current banking crisis was over. Only these three banks were o/ffsides in having the toxic combination of extreme interest rate exposure, large unrealized losses in the held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio and highly concentrated deposits. Most of the other regional banks did not have these problems. However, we stipulated that the crisis was over provided that interest rates didn't go up dramatically and we didn't experience a serious recession. If long-end rates go up over 6% and this increase is accompanied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress -\n\nnot just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others. Remember, a simple 2 percentage point increase in rates essentially reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, and certain real estate assets, specifically o/ffice real estate, may be worth even less due to the e/ffects of recession and higher vacancies. Also remember that credit spreads tend to widen, sometimes dramatically, in a recession.\n\nFinally, we should also consider that rates have been extremely low for a long time - it's hard to know how many investors and companies are truly prepared for a higher rate environment.\n\n## We seek to be engaged globally and carefully manage complex countries and geopolitical issues.\n\nJPMorgan Chase does business in more than 100 countries, and we have people on the ground in over 60 countries. In almost all those locations, we do research on their economy, their markets and their companies; we bank their government institutions and their companies; and we bank multinational corporations, including the U.S. multinational corporations within their borders. This is a critical role - not only in helping those countries grow and improve but also in expanding the global economy.\n\nMany of these countries are quite complex with different laws, customs and regulations. We are occasionally asked why we bank certain companies and even certain countries, particularly when countries have some laws and customs that are counter to many of the values held in the United States. Here's why:\n\n- \u00b7  The U.S. government sets foreign policy. And when it does, we salute. Wherever we do business, we follow the law of the United States, as it applies in that country (in addition to the laws of the country itself), in all respects. Think of trade rules, sanctions, anti-money laundering and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among others. By and large, these things help improve those countries. In most cases, the U.S. government does not want us to leave because it agrees, generally, that the engagement of American business enhances our relationships with other countries and helps those countries themselves.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Engagement makes the world a better place. We all should want the world to continue to improve. Isolation and lack of engagement do not accomplish that goal. While we believe that it makes sense for the United States to push for constant improvement around the world - from advocating for human rights to fighting corruption - this is rarely accomplished through coercion, and, in fact, is enhanced by engagement.\n- \u00b7 We need to be prepared for emerging challenges and position ourselves to understand them. We created a new role - Head of Asia Pacific Policy and Strategic Competitiveness - to focus specifically on key policy issues critical to the firm's (and, in fact, the country's) competitiveness, such as trade restrictions, supply chains and infrastructure. We also created a new strategic security forum to focus on emerging and evolving risks, including trade wars, pandemics, cybersecurity and actual wars, to name just a few.\n\n## OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS, INCLUDING DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nJPMorgan Chase makes an extraordinary e/ffort as part of our 'normal' day-to-day outreach to engage with individual clients, small and midsized businesses, large and multinational firms, government o/fficials, regulators and the press in cities all around the world. This dialogue is part of the normal course of business but it is also part of building trust and putting down roots in a community.\n\nWe believe that companies, and banks in particular, must earn the trust of the communities and countries in which they operate. We believe - and we are unashamed about this - that it is our obligation to help lift up the communities and countries in which we do business. We believe that doing so enhances business and the general economic well-being of those communities and countries and also enhances long-term shareholder value. JPMorgan Chase thrives when communities thrive.\n\nThis approach is integral to what we do, in great scale, around the world - and it works. We are quite clear that whether our e/fforts are inspired by the goodness of our hearts (as philanthropy or venture-type investing) or good business, we try to measure the actual outcomes .\n\nIt's also interesting to point out that many of our e/fforts were spawned from our work around Advancing Black Pathways, Military and Veterans A/ffairs, and our work in Detroit. While we've banked Detroit for more than 90 years, our $200 million investment in its economic recovery over the last decade demonstrated that investing in communities is a smart business strategy. We are one of the largest banks in Detroit, from consumer banking to investment banking, and it's quite clear that not only did our e/fforts help Detroit, but they also helped us gain market share. The extent of Detroit's remarkable recovery was recently highlighted when Moody's upgraded the city's credit rating to investment grade - an extraordinary achievement just over 10 years after the city filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nFor JPMorgan Chase, Detroit was an incubator for developing models that help us hone how we deploy our business resources, philanthropic capital, skilled volunteerism, and low-cost loans and equity investments, as well as how we identify top talent to drive successful business and societal improvements. I hope that, as shareholders, you are proud of our focus on promoting opportunity for all, both within and outside our organization, which includes economic opportunity. Some of our initiatives are listed below.\n\n- \u00b7  Business Resource Groups. To deepen our culture of inclusion in the workplace, we have 10 Business Resource Groups (BRG) across the company to connect more than 160,000 participating employees around common interests, as well as to foster networking and camaraderie. Groups welcome anyone - allies and those with shared a/ffinities alike. For example, some of our largest BRGs are Access Ability (employees with disabilities and caregivers), Adelante (Hispanic and Latino employees), BOLD (Black employees), NextGen (early career professionals), PRIDE (LGBTQ+ employees) and Women on the Move.",

In fact, our major lines of business - CCB, AWM and CIB, which would be among Fortune 1000 companies on their own - are all run by women (one with a co-head who is male). More than 10 years ago, a handful of senior women at the company, on their own, started this global, firmwide, internally focused organization called Women on the Move. It was so successful that we expanded the initiative beyond the company; it now empowers clients and consumers, as well as women employees and their allies, to build their careers, grow their businesses and improve their financial health. The Women on the Move BRG has more than 70,000 employees globally.\n- \u00b7  Advancing Black Pathways. This comprehensive program, which just reached the five-year mark, focuses on strengthening the economic foundation of Black communities because we know that opportunity is not always created equally. The program does so by, among other accomplishments, helping to diversify our talent pipeline, providing opportunities for Black individuals to enter the workforce and gain valuable experience, and investing in the financial success of Black Americans through a focus on financial health, homeownership and entrepreneurship. An important part of the program's work is achieved through our investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). We now partner with 18 schools across the United States to boost recruitment connections, expand career pathways for Black students and other students, and support their long-term development and financial health. As a measure of the program's success, in four years we have made nearly 400 hires into summer and full-time analyst and associate roles at the firm.\n- \u00b7  Military and Veterans A/ffairs. This firmwide e/ffort sponsors recruitment, mentorship and development programs to support the military members and veterans working at JPMorgan Chase. Back in 2011, we joined with 10 other companies to launch the Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), whose membership has since grown to more than 300 companies representing various industries\n\n- across the United States and has hired over 900,000 veterans and military spouses. In 2023, VJM announced the creation of its Advisory Board, which is composed of 14 corporate leaders, to provide strategic direction and oversight of VJM as it continues to expand its commitment to support economic opportunities for veterans and military spouses, including its goal to hire 2 million veterans and 200,000 military spouses by 2030. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired in excess of 18,000 veterans since 2011 and currently employs more than 3,100 military spouses .\n- \u00b7  Creating opportunity for people with disabilities. The firm's O/ffice of Disability Inclusion continues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed at advancing economic opportunity for people with disabilities. In 2023, we joined lawmakers and business leaders in Washington, D.C., to show support for passage of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Savings Penalty Elimination Act. Modernizing the SSI program, by updating asset limits for the first time in nearly 40 years, would allow millions of people with disabilities who receive SSI benefits the opportunity to build their savings without putting their essential benefits at risk. We also provided business coaching to more than 370 entrepreneurs with disabilities.\n- \u00b7  Virtual call centers . When we sought to expand our customer service specialists program across the United States, we turned to Detroit, launching our first virtual call center in 2022. Investments in Detroit's workforce development infrastructure helped us hire 90 virtual customer service specialists for a program that has outperformed many of our traditional call centers around the world. Following this success, we expanded our hiring e/fforts and this virtual program to Baltimore to create new jobs that jump-start careers. And now we're evaluating the possibility of expanding even further.",

A critical challenge we have seen in so many communities is that traditional lending standards render too many entrepreneurs - particularly entrepreneurs of color and those serving these communities - ineligible for credit. In response, we helped launch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (EOCF) in Detroit, a lending program designed to help aspiring small business owners gain access to critical resources needed for growth that are often not equitably available - capital, technical assistance and mentorship, among others. These challenges aren't unique to Detroit so we worked with community development financial institutions to replicate the EOCF program in 10 markets across the United States in 2023, deploying more than 2,900 loans and $176 million in capital to underserved entrepreneurs across the country.\n- \u00b7  Senior business consultants. To help entrepreneurs and small businesses make the transition from community lending to accessing capital from traditional financial institutions, we created a new job - senior business consultant - to provide support. Senior business consultants in branches that focus on underserved communities o/ffer coaching and help business owners with everything from navigating access to credit to managing cash flow to generating e/ffective marketing. Since 2020, these consultants have mentored more than 5,500 business owners, helping them improve their operations, grow revenue and network with others in the local business community.\n- \u00b7  Advancing Cities . The organizing principles that define the business and community investments we make and how we best achieve an overall impact in local economies were heavily influenced by our experience in Detroit. Seeing Detroit's comeback begin to take shape several years ago, we created Advancing Cities to replicate this model for large-scale investments to other cities around the world. From San Francisco to Paris to Greater Washington, D.C., we've applied what we learned in Detroit to communities where conditions are opportune for success and require deeper investments - where community, civic and business leaders have come together to solve problems and get results.\n- \u00b7  JPMorgan Chase Service Corps . Ten years ago, we launched the JPMorgan Chase Service Corps to strengthen the capacity-building of nonprofit partners. We brought employees from around the world to Detroit to assist with its recovery from creating a scoring model for a nonprofit to helping prioritize neighborhoods for development funding to devising an implementation plan for an integrated talent management system. Since that time, the Service Corps has expanded, with more than 1,500 JPMorgan Chase employees contributing 100,000 hours to support over 300 nonprofits globally.\n- \u00b7  Community Centers/Branches and Community Managers . A local bank branch, especially in a low-income neighborhood, can be successful only when it fits the community's needs. That is why over the last several years we have shifted our approach to how we o/ffer access to financial health education, as well as low-cost products and services to help build wealth. Since 2019, we have opened 16 Community Center branches, often in areas with larger Black, Hispanic or Latino populations, and have plans to open three more by the end of 2024. These branches have more space to host grassroots community events, small business mentoring sessions and financial health seminars, which have been well-attended - to date, over 400,000 people have taken advantage of the financial education seminars. In each of these Community Center branches, we hired a Community Manager (who acts as a local ambassador) to build relationships with community leaders, nonprofits and small businesses. The Community Manager concept and practice have become so successful that we have also placed these managers in many of our traditional branches in underserved communities. We now have 149 Community Managers throughout our branch network.\n- \u00b7  Work skills development. Detroit showed us how talent in communities is often overlooked. We saw this in the early days of our investment when we visited our partners at Focus: HOPE, a training program designed to help Detroiters develop skills for high-demand jobs. Quickly, it became clear that the training and education system in Detroit was disconnected from",

By investing in programs like Focus: HOPE, we have been able to help bridge local skills gaps by training people for in-demand jobs in communities like Dallas, Miami and Washington, D.C. Between 2019 and 2023, we supported more than 2 million people through our extensive learning and career programming around the world.\n\n- \u00b7  Increasing our rural investment. We are proud to be the only bank with branches in all 48 contiguous states, which include many rural communities. Nearly 17 million consumers living in rural areas hold over $100 billion in deposits with us and $175 billion in loans. We are also a leading wholesale lender in these communities, helping to fuel local economies through relationships with local companies, governments, hospitals and universities. Since 2019, we have made material progress in extending our footprint to reach more rural Americans, including expanding our branch network into 13 new states with large rural populations. Now we are raising the bar. With our new strategy, we have a goal to have a branch available to serve 50% of a state's population within an acceptable driving distance, including in heavily rural states such as Alabama and Iowa. This focus is part of our recently announced plan to build an additional 500 branches and hire 3,500 employees over the next three years. Through this expansion, we will partner across lines of business and our Corporate Responsibility organization to help advance inclusive economic growth and bring the full force of the firm to America's heartland.\n\n## We've nearly completed our five-year, $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment - it will now become a permanent part of our business.\n\nWhat began in 2020 as a five-year, $30 billion commitment is now transforming into a consistent business practice for our lines of business in support of Black, Hispanic, Latino and other underserved communities. By the end of 2023, we reported over $30 billion in progress toward our original goal. However, our focus is not on how much money is deployed - but on long-term impact and outcomes. And going forward, these programs will be embedded in our businessas-usual operating system.\n\n- \u00b7  A/ffordable rental housing. Through our A/ffordable Housing Preservation program, we approved program funding to date of approximately $21 billion in loans to incentivize the preservation of over 190,000 a/ffordable housing rental units across the United States. Additionally, we financed approximately $5 billion for the construction and rehabilitation of a/ffordable rental housing.\n- \u00b7  Homeownership . In 2023, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to include over 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities - and in January 2024, we increased our grant amount to $7,500 in select markets. Since our grant program began in 2021, we have provided about 8,600 grants totaling $43 million. We also have provided home purchase and refinance loans in 2023 worth over $4.6 billion for more than 14,000 Black, Hispanic and Latino households across the economic spectrum.\n- \u00b7  Small business . The Business Card Special Purpose Credit Program, launched in January 2023, has provided over 10,900 cards, totaling over $43 million in available credit lines to underserved entrepreneurs and communities across the United States.",

To date, we have invested more than $110 million in equity in diverse financial institutions and provided over $260 million in incremental financing to community development financial institutions to support communities that lack access to traditional financing. JPMorgan Chase also helped these institutions build their capacity so they can provide a greater number of critical services like mortgages and small business loans.\n\n## We're thoughtfully continuing our diversity, equity and inclusion e/fforts.\n\nOf course, JPMorgan Chase will conform as the laws evolve. We will scour our programs, our words and our actions to make sure they comply.\n\nThat said, we think all the e/fforts mentioned above will remain largely unchanged. And, in fact, around the world, cities and communities where we do business applaud these e/fforts. We also believe our initiatives make us a more inclusive company and lead to more innovation, smarter decisions and better financial results for us and for the economy overall.\n\nWe are often asked in particular about 'equity' and what that word means. To us, it means equal treatment, equal opportunity and equal access \u2026 not equal outcomes. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging and trying to bridge social and economic gaps, whether they be around wealth or health. We would like to provide a fair chance for everyone to succeed - regardless of their background. And we want to make sure everyone who works at our company feels welcome.\n\n## We want to articulate how we weigh in on social issues and what it means for our customers.\n\nBefore I comment about culture issues, I have a confession to make: I am a full-throated, redblooded, patriotic, free-enterprise (properly regulated, of course) and free-market capitalist. Our company is frequently asked to take a position on an issue, rule or legislation that might be considered 'cultural.' When that happens, we take a deep breath and study the matter. Many of the laws in question have many specific requirements, some of which you would agree with but not others. But we are being asked to support the entire law. In cases like these, we simply make our own statement that reflects our educated view and values; however, we do not give our voice to others.\n\nWe believe in the values of democracy, including freedom of speech and expression, and are staunchly against discrimination and hate. We have not turned away - and will not turn away customers because of their political or religious a/ffiliations nor would we tell customers how they should spend their money.\n\nOur commitment to these ideals is also reflected in our employees. The talent at our firm is a vibrant mix of cultures, beliefs and backgrounds. We are, of course, fully committed to freedom of speech. There are things that you can say that would be permitted under freedom of speech but would not be allowed under our Code of Conduct. For example, we do not allow intimidation, threats or highly prejudicial behavior or speech. Our Code of Conduct clearly stipulates that certain statements and behavior, while allowed under freedom of speech, can lead to disciplinary action at our company from being reprimanded to being fired.",

        "page_content": "## WHAT WE LEARNED: A FIVE-POINT ACTION PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE\n\nIn May 2023, we gathered with knowledgeable and influential people from the energy industry writ large to the government and financial services arena in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an action forum. The goal was to explore various aspects of the climate challenge and try to devise e/ffective solutions that could help lead to meaningful progress. The climate challenge is immense and complex. Addressing it requires more than making simplistic statements and rules; rather, energy systems and global supply chains need to be transformed across virtually all industries. And there is also a deep need for new research and development. Energy systems and supply chains provide the foundation of the global economy and must be treated with care.\n\nAt the same time, the opportunity here is immense. The investment required to meet climate goals - estimated at over $5 trillion annually - could generate economywide growth and opportunity at a scale the world has not seen since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe task for industry, policymakers and finance is to help formulate solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, balancing a/ffordable, reliable access to energy with generating economic growth.\n\nTo find a way forward, we sought input from diverse stakeholders in pursuit of a North Star. In Scottsdale and in discussions with clients across industries about what's needed to achieve a low-carbon economy, these five action steps and reforms were top of mind:\n\n- \u00b7 Supportive government policy and leadership to advance the transition. Policy that promotes favorable economic conditions to make the transition viable is a critical first step for clients. This includes government leadership via mandates, incentives or subsidies to support jobs and investment in the transition; actions on permitting and interconnection reform; and regulatory clarity and certainty, especially around long-term investments. As one vital example, current grid infrastructure is insu/fficient to accommodate the growth in renewables.\n\n- \u00b7 Public/private partnerships in scaling bankable projects. Scaling investments needs to happen both for commercially proven technologies (e.g., wind and solar) and for emerging technologies (e.g., green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture). Developing 'bankable' clean energy projects will require the application of smart financial tools, as well as further policy support. It will take public/private partnerships and innovation to create catalytic forms of capital that can step into these gaps, absorb first-mover risks and provide the necessary funding. The cost of capital is too high for some companies - and public funds ought to be deployed in a smart way that e/ffectively attracts private capital.\n- \u00b7 Public education and engagement. Without question, clients told us that public commitment to and investment in energyrelated infrastructure is one of the most important parts of combating the climate crisis and running their businesses. Supporting the buildout of energy-related infrastructure with speed and scale is critical. Public acceptance of building and advancing the infrastructure needed to meet climate goals is at the heart of progress. While the energy transition is poised to deliver benefits to communities across the world, securing acceptance and support to build clean energy infrastructure at scale is challenging. Access to job-creating renewable energy projects can help rural communities thrive by advancing local economies. Ensuring public support and social license to operate requires better engagement strategies, including widespread stakeholder education about the benefits of these technologies for local communities.\n- \u00b7 Communication about concrete successes. Across industries, market participants need to do a better job of celebrating and championing concrete successes and tangible milestones. This includes highlighting success stories around emerging technologies and the complex nature of the carbon transition. Stakeholders also should better convey the benefits of clean energy - across all technologies - to help combat misinformation and foster a more informed dialogue.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Work skills training. Businesses depend on healthy, thriving communities so the carbon transition needs to work for everyone. This includes helping to ensure that workers are trained in the skills for the future, such as through improved engineering schools and job training programs. Work across the entire supply chain is essential to moving at pace. As one example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates we will need more than 70,000 additional electricians per year through 2031; it is currently unclear how the market will meet that demand. If the deployment of heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers accelerates, demand for electricians will be even higher. A concerted focus to train electricians can help the United States meet some of its climate goals while providing well-paying jobs that do not require a fouryear college degree. Also, broadly speaking, businesses are in a better position to make investments with confidence when labor requirements across the value chain - from design and manufacturing to installation - are satisfied.\n\n## We recently reconsidered certain memberships.\n\nJPMorgan Chase recently exited Climate Action 100+ and the Equator Principles. 'Why?' we are asked. While we don't necessarily disagree with some of the principles many organizations have, we make our own business decisions. We think we have some of the best-in-class environmental, social and risk standards because we have invested in our own in-house experts and matured our own risk management processes over the years. As a result, we are going to go our own way and make our own independent decisions, gathering the best learnings of experts in the field, and, of course, we will follow all legal requirements.\n\n## We are engaged but recognize our role: three more important points.\n\nFirst, everyone should understand that conquering the climate problem needs proper government action, particularly around taxes, permitting, grids, infrastructure building and proper coordination of policies - we are not there yet. Second, there is no known technology that can fill the gap between our 'aspirations' and the current trajectory of the world. We hope and believe that this will be found (for example, through carbon capture, improved batteries, hydrogen or other measures). This new technology will also require proper government research and development funding, as the e/ffort cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone. And third, we are going to use the word 'commitment' much more reservedly in the future, clearly di/fferentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding commitments .\n\nFor JPMorgan Chase to play the right role in tackling the climate challenge, we have organized a special group around the green economy and related infrastructure investment. This group will coordinate and inform our work across all established industry groups (from auto to real estate, energy, agriculture and others) and includes hundreds of employees devoted to these e/fforts.",

        "page_content": "## GIVING THE BANK REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY PROCESS A SERIOUS REVIEW\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was finished 14 years ago, and we believe it accomplished a lot of good things. But it's been quite a while since then, and we're still debating some very basic issues. It's time to take a serious, hard, honest look at what has been done and what can be improved.\n\nIt's good to remember that the United States has the best financial system in the world, with diversified, deep and experienced institutions, from banks, pension plans, hedge funds and private equity to individual investors. It has healthy public and private markets, transparency, rule of law and deep research. The best banking system in the world is a critical part of this, and, integrated with the overall financial system, is foundational to the proper allocation of capital, innovation and the fueling of America's growth engine.\n\nThis is not about JPMorgan Chase - we believe we can manage through whatever is thrown our way. This is about the impact on all parts of the system - from smaller banks to larger regional banks that may not have the resources to handle all of these regulatory requirements. It's also about the e/ffect on the financial markets and the economy from the rapidly growing shadow banking system, as well as the ultimate impact on the customers, clients and communities we serve. This is about what's right for the system.\n\n## The banking and financial system is innovative, dynamic and constantly changing.\n\nThe banking system is not static: There are startup banks, mergers, successful upstarts and fintech banks, and even Apple, which e/ffectively acts as a bank - it holds money, moves money, lends money and so on. Nonbanks are competing with traditional banks, and, in general, this dynamism and churn are good for innovation and invention - with success and failure simply part of the robust process. Innovation runs across payments systems, budgeting, digital access, product extensions, risk and fraud prevention, and other services. Di/fferent institutions play di/fferent roles, and, importantly,\n\nsmall banks and big banks serve completely di/fferent strategic functions. Large banks bank multinational corporations around the world, make healthy markets, and wield technology and a product set that are the best in the world. A small bank simply cannot bank these same multinational governments and safely move the amount of money and securities that large banks do. Regional and community banks have exceptional local knowledge and presence and are critical in serving thousands of towns and certain geographies.\n\nIt is also important to recognize that the banking system as we know it is shrinking relative to private markets and fintech, which are growing and becoming increasingly competitive. And remember that many of these new players do not have the same transparency or need to abide by the extensive rules and regulations as traditional banks, even if they o/ffer similar products - this often gives them significant advantage.\n\nTo deal with this fluid environment, banks of all sizes develop their own strategies, whether to specialize, expand geographically or embark on mergers and acquisitions. There are certain banking services where economies of scale are a competitive advantage, but not all banks need to become bigger to gain this benefit (there are many highly successful banks that are smaller). What is clear is that banks should be allowed to pursue their individual strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, as they see fit. Overall, this process should be allowed to happen - it's part of the natural and healthy course of capitalism - and it can be done without harming the American taxpayer or economy.\n\nWhile we all want a strong banking and financial system, we should step back and assess how all the regulatory steps we have taken measure up against the goals we all share. Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010, thousands of rules and reporting requirements written by 10+ di/fferent regulatory bodies in the United States alone have been added. And it would probably be an understatement to say that some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, contradictory, extremely costly, and unnecessarily painful for both banks and regulators. Many of the rules have unintended consequences that are not desirable and have negative impacts, such as increasing the cost of credit for consumers (hurting lower-income Americans the most).",

        "page_content": "The whole process, including the Basel III endgame, could be much more productive, streamlined, economical, e/fficient and safe.\n\nBoth regulators and banks should want the same thing - a healthy banking system, serving its clients and striving for continuous improvement. We all should also want the enormous benefits that would come from good collaboration between regulators and bank management teams and boards.\n\nOver time, these relationships have deteriorated, and, again, are increasingly less constructive. There is little real collaboration between practitioners - the banks - and regulators, who generally have not been practitioners in business. While we acknowledge the dedication of regulators who work with banks on a daily basis, management teams across the industry are putting in a disproportionate amount of time addressing requests for extra details, documentation and processes that extend far beyond the actual rules - and distract both regulators and management from more critical work. We should be more focused on the truly important risks for the safety of the system. And unfortunately, without collaboration and su/fficient analysis, it is hard to be confident that regulation will accomplish desired outcomes without undesirable consequences. Instead of constantly improving the system, we may be making it worse. A few additional points:\n\n\u00b7  The Basel III endgame disadvantages\n\n- American banks. The Basel III endgame has been 10 years in the making, and it still has not been completed. In my view, many of the rules are flawed and poorly calibrated. If the Basel III endgame were implemented in its current form, it would hamper American banks: As proposed, it would increase our firm's required capital by 25%, making our requirement 30% higher than it would be under the equivalent European Union proposal. That means for every loan and asset financed in the United States by a major American bank, that bank would have to hold 30% more capital than any international competitor. The proposed regulations would also damage market making (see the following section). There are many other flaws but su/ffice it to say that much of the work being done today to analyze the e/ffects should have been done before the proposed rulemaking.\n\nOne of the single most important lessons from the great financial crisis is that there is enormous value to having a bank that is well-managed and has diverse revenue sources. Yet regulation since then both punishes consolidation and diversification and punishes performance - through many features of the GSIB surcharge.\n\n- \u00b7  Built over many years, the framework is now full of duplication. The following is only a partial list: American gold-plating and conceptual inconsistencies among Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), recovery and resolution plans, liquidity requirements, global systemically important bank (GSIB) requirements, and safety and soundness principles. The many overlapping rules contribute to the bureaucracy that generates an extraordinary amount of make-work (an 80,000-page CCAR and shockingly another, coincidentally, 80,000-page recovery and resolution plan).\n- \u00b7  The new rules do virtually nothing to fix what caused the failure of SVB and First Republic. For example, they don't improve certain liquidity requirements, limit HTM accounting or reduce allowable interest rate exposure.\n- \u00b7  The current regulatory approach to liquidity might simply run counter to the stated intent. Regulations should recognize the value and importance of lending and borrowing against good collateral and using central bank resources, such as the discount window. Adhering to current liquidity requirements permanently ties up good liquidity in a way that makes the system more fragile and more risky.\n- \u00b7  It is not clear what the full intent of the Basel III endgame was - it will have unintended consequences. Without real analysis of expected outcomes, additional regulation will likely reduce the number of banks o/ffering certain services and increase costs for all market participants and activity, including loans, market making and hedging (by farmers, airlines and countries, among others). And new rules might even increase consolidation as companies race to achieve economies of scale in certain products and services.",

        "page_content": "Unfortunately, some recent regulations are ending up in court. You can imagine that no one wants to sue their regulators. Banks would not sue if they did not think they were right - or if they thought they had any other recourse - which they e/ffectively do not. This is definitely not what anyone should want. A more constructive relationship with regulators would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would lead to better outcomes for banks, their shareholders, and their clients, customers and communities.\n\n## Collaboration between banks and regulators could improve the use of resources and create better outcomes.\n\nTrue collaboration could dramatically improve the banking system. For example:\n\n- \u00b7  Redirect enormous resources from things that don't matter to things that do. As mentioned, it takes 80,000 pages to describe a CCAR test and 80,000 pages to detail recovery and resolution. The talent and resources at the banks and regulators could be better used elsewhere. Such overload is distracting and takes your eye o/ff the ball on real, emerging risks, including China, trade, payment systems and cybersecurity, among others.\n- \u00b7  Reduce bureaucratic processes that provoke a tendency to herd mentality. For example, CCAR is just a point-in-time stress test, and it can lull you into a false sense of security - for reference, we do more than 100 stress tests each week. On interest rate exposure, focusing on the documentation of details may stop you from thinking about big interest rate exposure. Sometimes analyzing 'what ifs' and fat tail risks is better than excessive and rigid models and documentations.\n- \u00b7  Examine risks outside the regulatory system that are rarely analyzed and largely unaddressed. These risks include data and privacy, as well as consumer banking and payment systems, which are growing fast in the unregulated market. In addition, there are potential risks from private credit markets (which I talk about later in the next section).\n- \u00b7  Let's imagine what's possible with real collaboration. Working together, we can improve how the FDIC manages failing institutions, how to limit\n\ncontagion and restore confidence to depositors, how liquidity requirements can create more flexible funding for banks under stress, how the banking and Federal Reserve's payment system can become more interoperable, how clearinghouse risk can be reduced, how stress tests can protect the system from a wider variety of outcomes, how costs and therefore consumer costs can be reduced (not increased), how anti-money laundering requirements can be simplified and improved at the same time, and how financial products can be brought to the unbanked.\n\nWe can fix the housing and mortgage markets. For example, mortgage regulations around origination, servicing and securitization could be simplified, without increasing risk, in a way that would reduce the average mortgage by 70 or 80 basis points. The Urban Institute estimates that a reduction like this would increase mortgage originations by 1 million per year and help lower-income households, in particular, buy their first home, thereby starting them on the best way to build household net worth.\n\nThere are many more things that can be improved - and we really should start working on them.\n\n## We need a detailed review and probably a complete revamp.\n\nI know this might be wishful thinking, but now would be a good time to step back and have a thorough and candid review of the thousands of new rules passed since Dodd-Frank. After this review, we should ask what is it that we really want: Do we want to try to eliminate the possibility of bank runs? Do we want to change and create liquidity rules that would essentially back most uninsured deposits? Do we want the mortgage business and leveraged lending business to be inside or outside the banking system? Do we want products that are inside and outside the banking system to be regulated the same way? Do we want to reasonably give smaller banks a leg up in purchasing a failing bank? And while DoddFrank did some good things, shouldn't we take a look at the huge overlapping jurisdictions of various regulators? This overlap creates di/fficulties, not only for banks, but for the regulators, too. Any and all of this is achievable, and, I believe, could be accomplished with simpler rules and guidelines and without stifling our critical banking system.",

        "page_content": "## PROTECTING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF MARKET MAKING (TRADING)\n\nBefore we discuss market making and financial markets, readers should understand that market making occurs in almost all businesses. There are healthy markets in farm animals, foreign products, commodities, energy, logistics, healthcare and so on. Healthy markets increase customer choice and reduce cost. They almost always involve holding inventory and taking some risk, which is simply a part of the process. America's financial markets are the biggest in the world U.S. public debt and equity markets total $137 trillion, constituting the biggest 'market' in the world, and are larger than America's gross domestic product (GDP) of $27 trillion.\n\nMarket participants are not 'Wall Street.' They are large and small, mainly sophisticated, global investors (pension plans, mutual funds, governments and individuals) representing retirees, veterans, individuals, unions, federal workers and others. They all benefit from our e/fficient, low-cost and transparent markets.\n\nSome regulators seem to think that market making is a speculative, hedge fund-like activity - and this thinking is what might be leading them to constantly increase capital requirements. The proposed capital rules could fundamentally alter market-making activities that are critical to a thriving economy, particularly in di/fficult markets when market making is even more important . The new rules would raise capital requirements by 50% for major banks - which could undermine market stability, make banking services costlier and less accessible, and push even more activity to a less regulated banking system.\n\nOur financial system and markets are the best in the world and benefit ALL participants; exceptionally good market making in the secondary market makes our primary markets the best in the world.\n\nWe should recognize that the United States has the biggest, deepest and most liquid capital markets in the world. For these markets to function, it is critical for transparency and liquidity to be in the secondary market . Market making provides this, promoting the flow of capital to real economy\n\ninvestments and supporting all sectors of the economy, including companies, state and local governments, universities, hospitals, pension plans and overall job creation. Without market making in the secondary market, it would be extremely di/fficult for companies to raise capital through the primary market - equity and debt o/fferings which have totaled approximately $3.6 trillion on average over the past few years. The incredible strength of these markets enables companies of all sizes to grow and expand especially during times of volatility and stress. It also enables consumers to access cheaper credit and governments (local, state and federal) to reduce their borrowing costs.\n\n## It takes enormous resources to properly support the Markets business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase spends $700 million per year in extensive research coverage of nearly 5,200 companies across 83 countries. This massive e/ffort continuously educates investors and decision makers around the world and often leads to improved governance and management. It also critically complements the firm's market-making activities and further promotes transparency, enabling investors to make thoughtful choices around investing in capital markets.\n\nI would also like our shareholders to know that our market making is backed by approximately $7 billion in support expenses, including over $2 billion in technology spend alone each year. This investment allows us to maintain global trading systems and constantly improve upon risk management and e/fficiency.\n\nJPMorgan Chase deploys approximately $70 billion in capital to maintain our Markets franchise. This capital supports $500 billion in securities inventory (largely hedged) - and this inventory allows us to buy and sell $2 trillion (notional) in securities daily for our clients.\n\n## Market making entails risk but is not particularly speculative.\n\nThe main objective of market makers is to continuously quote prices and diligently manage an inventory to transact at those prices, which includes assuming certain risks to support heavy volumes and orderly trading. Market makers have a moral obligation to try to make markets in good times",

        "page_content": "and in bad. Part of our brand promise is to stand ready as the willing buyer and seller. In this, we have never failed. In addition, in most cases regarding government debt, where we serve as a government securities dealer, we are legally obligated to make markets. This constant visibility into prices provided by market makers fosters investor confidence, keeps fees low and promotes economic growth by attracting more investors.\n\nMany large market participants - for example, hedge funds and high-frequency traders, among others - have no obligation to make markets. In fact, many of these market participants often 'step out' of the markets and dramatically reduce liquidity specifically when market conditions are di/fficult.\n\nMarket making is not particularly speculative since market makers generally hedge their positions, as you will see from some real life examples of the economics and risks. We earn revenue of approximately $100 million on a typical day. In the average year, the total is nearly $30 billion. On our $2 trillion in notional daily trading, this amounts to only one hundredth of a cent charged to the investor for these services - an extraordinarily low cost compared with any other market in the world.\n\nNow let's take a look at the actual risk and results versus the hypothetical risk and results. The hypothetical global market shock of the CCAR stress test has us losing $18 billion in a single day and never recovering any of it. Let's compare that to actual losses under real, actual market stress.\n\nNow consider these historical data points: First, over the last 10 years, the firm's market-making business has never had a quarterly loss and has lost money on only 30 trading days. These loss days represent only 1% of total trading days, and the average loss on those days was $90 million. Second, when markets completely collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 2 through March 31, 2020, the stock market fell 16%, and bond spreads gapped out dramatically), J.P. Morgan's market-making activities made money every day prior to the Federal Reserve's major interventions, which stabilized the markets. During that entire month, we lost money on only two days but made $2.5 billion in Markets revenue for the month. And\n\nthird, in the worst quarter ever in the markets following the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers, we lost $1.7 billion, but we made $5.6 billion in Markets revenue for the full year. The firm as a whole did not lose money in any quarter that year. In 2009, there was a complete recovery in Markets, and we made $22 billion in Markets revenue.\n\nYou can see that our actual performance under extreme stress isn't even close to the hypothetical losses of the stress test.\n\nAnother major fallacy is that derivatives are objects of financial destruction. In reality, derivatives are an essential part of managing financial risk and are used by investors, corporations, farmers, businesses, countries, governments and others to manage their risks. And more than 85% of derivatives are fairly basic forms of foreign exchange or interest rate swaps.\n\nOne last fallacy is that the repo markets are all about speculation. While it's true that repo is used by certain investors to leverage up their positions, about 75% of repo is essential to normal money market functioning, i.e., is done by broker-dealers financing their actual inventory positions, money market funds investing their cash backed by highly rated collateral and clients hedging their positions.\n\n## Market makers add confidence, liquidity and transparency to U.S. capital markets - market making helps stabilize markets and can reduce volatility.\n\nIn addition, more liquidity, not less liquidity, will be needed to maintain market stability. Large banks keep an inventory of securities they can deploy in times of stress to help soothe markets; however, with the implementation of new regulations, banks now hold 70% as much inventory in securities as they did before the 2008 financial crisis, while the total size of the market has almost tripled. Higher capital requirements will accelerate this trend even further, impacting banks' ability to deliver support to clients and markets in times when it is needed the most.",

        "page_content": "Washington's Basel III endgame proposal damages market making, hurts Americans and drives activity to less transparent, less regulated markets.\n\nIf this proposal is enacted as drafted:\n\n- \u00b7  Everyday consumer goods could be impacted. Households contending with inflation could also feel the e/ffects of higher capital requirements on market-making activities when they shop. From beverage companies that need to manage aluminum costs to farms that need to protect against environmental risks, if the cost of hedging those risks increases, it could be reflected in what consumers pay for everything from a can of soda to meat products.\n- \u00b7  Mortgages and small business loans will be more expensive . Consumers seeking a mortgage - including first-time homebuyers and historically underserved, low- to moderate-income borrowers with smaller down payments - will face higher interest rates or will have a tougher time accessing one. This will occur not only because the cost of originating and holding these loans is higher but also because the cost of securitizing them will rise for banks, nonbanks and government agencies. Not only that, but the proposal will likely lead to reductions in the size of unfunded credit card lines, which will put pressure on FICO scores and thereby make it more di/fficult for some people to access other forms of retail credit such as mortgages. Again, this will have the greatest impact on low- to moderate-income borrowers who rely most heavily on credit cards for day-to-day spending and to build their credit history. It could even be argued that existing regulations go too far and that there is an opportunity to help underserved communities by dialing down regulations that lead to higher borrowing costs. This should be studied and the pros and cons analyzed. The same can be said for small business loans, which will become more expensive and less accessible.\n- \u00b7  Saving for retirement or college will be harder . The cost of products that families count on to save for retirement or college will go up as a result of this proposal. Asset managers, money market funds and pension funds all buy, sell and safekeep securities and other financial instruments for American investors. Under the proposed rules, the cost of banking products used on behalf of clients each day - including brokerage, advisory, clearing and custody services - will go up and feed through to customers. That will lead to lower returns on retirement accounts, college funds and other long-term savings.\n- \u00b7  Government infrastructure projects and corporate development will become more expensive . Federal, state and local governments, as well as corporations and other institutions, rely on large banks for access to U.S. capital markets to fund development. If accessing capital markets becomes more expensive, it will have a ripple e/ffect on the hiring of American workers, investment in research and development, and funding to build hospitals, roads and bridges, including the planned infrastructure projects from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nMore market activity will move to unregulated institutions, out of sight from regulators and without the same level of consumer protections that Americans expect from their banks. Other market participants that don't have holistic client relationships are less likely to provide liquidity to help stabilize markets.\n\nIn volatile times, banks have been able to intermediate to help their clients and to work with the regulators. With new regulations, they may be less able to do so. There have been several times in the past few years where banks had ample liquidity and capital but were unable to rapidly increase their intermediation in the markets due to very rigid liquidity and capital requirements. Finally, the proposed rules increase the chance that the Federal Reserve will have to step in again - and this is not something they should want to do on a regular basis but only in an extreme emergency.",

        "page_content": "## Staying Competitive in the Shrinking Public Markets\n\nIn previous letters, I have described the diminishing role of public companies in the American financial system. From their peak in 1996 at 7,300, U.S. public companies now total 4,300 - the total should have grown dramatically, not shrunk. Meanwhile, the number of private U.S. companies backed by private equity firms - which does not include the rising number of companies owned by sovereign wealth funds and family o/ffices - has grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades. This trend is serious and may very well increase with more regulation and litigation coming. Along with a frank assessment of the regulation landscape, we really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\n\nThere are good reasons for private markets, and some good outcomes result from them. For example, companies can stay private longer if they wish and raise more and di/fferent types of capital without going to the public markets. However, taking a wider view, I fear we may be driving companies from the public markets. The reasons are complex and may include factors such as intensified reporting requirements (including investors' growing needs for environmental, social and governance information), higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, cookie-cutter board governance, shareholder activism, less compensation flexibility, less capital flexibility, heightened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings.\n\nAlong with the universal proxy - which makes it easier to put poorly qualified directors on a board - the pressures to retreat from the public market are mounting. In addition, corporate governance principles are becoming more and more templated and formulaic, a negative trend. For example, proxy advisors may automatically judge directors unfavorably if they have a long tenure on the board, without a fair assessment of their actual contributions or experience. Another example is the constant battle by some proxy advisors who try to split the chairman and CEO role when there is no evidence this makes a company better o/ff - in fact,\n\ntoday, lead directors generally hold most of the authorities previously assigned to the chairman. The governance of major corporations is evolving away from guidance by governance principles that focus on a company's relationship to long-term economic value toward a bureaucratic compliance exercise. Good corporate governance is critical, and a little common sense would go a long way.\n\n## THE PRESSURE OF QUARTERLY EARNINGS COMPOUNDED BY BAD ACCOUNTING AND BAD DECISIONS\n\nThere is something very positive about detailed and disciplined quarterly financial and operating reporting. But company CEOs and boards of directors should resist the undue pressure of quarterly earnings, and it is clearly somewhat their fault when they don't. However, it is na\u00efve to think that the pressure doesn't exist because companies that 'disappoint' can face extensive criticism, particularly those with a new or young CEO. It's possible for companies to take short-term actions to increase earnings, such as selling more product cheaply at the end of a quarter, cutting certain investments that may be terrific but can show accounting losses in the first year or two, or just deploying more aggressive accounting methods at times. Once shortcuts like this begin, people all over the company understand that it is okay to 'stretch' to meet your numbers. This could put you on a treadmill to ruin. Obviously, a company should not resort to these tactics, but it does happen in the public markets - and it's probably less likely in the private markets.\n\n## THE HIJACKING OF ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS\n\nOne of the reasons it is less desirable to be a public company is because of the spiraling frivolousness of the annual shareholder meeting, which has devolved into mostly a showcase of grandstanding and competing special interest groups. We should",

        "page_content": "treat shareholders with tremendous respect - and we do. At JPMorgan Chase, we are constantly talking with our investors - our directors, our lead director and our corporate governance experts visit most of our major investors whether they be direct owners or asset managers who manage the money for others. Meeting with your shareholders and investors is critical, but the annual shareholder meeting itself has become ine/ffective. We should try to come up with a far more constructive alternative.\n\n## THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF PROXY ADVISORS\n\nThere are essentially two main proxy advisors in the United States. One is called Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), and the second is called Glass Lewis. These proxy advisors started out providing reams of data from companies to help their institutional investor clients vote on proxy matters (information on executive compensation, stock returns, detail on directors, policies and so on). However, they soon also began to provide advice on how shareholders should vote on proxy matters. And, in fact, institutional investors generally execute their voting on an ISS or Glass Lewis platform, which often includes a clear statement of the advisory service's position.\n\nI should also point out, because it may be relevant, that ISS is owned by Deutsche Boerse, a German company, and Glass Lewis is owned by Peloton Capital, a Canadian private equity firm. I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance.\n\nWhile asset managers and institutional investors have a fiduciary responsibility to make their own decisions, it is increasingly clear that proxy advisors have undue influence.\n\nAsset managers (who manage money on behalf of others) and institutional investors (e.g., pension plans and endowments) may rely on a variety of information sources to support their valuation\n\ndecision-making process. While data and recommendations may form pieces of the information mosaic, their votes should ultimately be based on an independent application of their own voting guidelines and policies. To the extent they use recommendations from proxy advisors in their decision-making processes, they should disclose that they do so and should be satisfied that the information upon which they are relying is accurate and relevant. However, many companies would argue that this information is frequently not balanced, not representative of the full view and not accurate. In addition, companies complain that they often cannot get the data corrected, and, therefore, a vote may go uncorrected.\n\nAlmost all asset managers receive proxy advisor data and recommendations; while some asset managers vote completely independently of this information, the majority do not. Most asset managers have formed corporate governance or stewardship committees that are responsible for their voting, and these committee positions are often held not by portfolio managers and research analysts (i.e., the people buying and analyzing the individual securities) but by stewardship experts. While it is good to have stewardship experts, the reality is that many of these committees default large portions of what they do to proxy advisors and, more troubling, make it harder for actual portfolio managers to override this decision making.\n\nSome have argued that it's too hard and too expensive to review the large number of proxies and proxy proposals - this is both lazy and wrong. If issues are important to a company, they should be important to the shareholder - for the most part, only a handful of proposals are important to companies.\n\nWe are making enhancements to J.P. Morgan Asset Management's proxy voting processes to amplify the role of portfolio managers and to address the perception of asset managers' reliance on third-party advisor voting recommendations.\n\nEnhancements to the firm's internal proxy voting process will include:",

The firm has significantly expanded the representation of portfolio managers on its North American Proxy Committee in an e/ffort to increase the diversity of viewpoints represented on the committee. As part of this change, and in recognition that portfolio managers, as fiduciaries, may di/ffer in their views on how to vote on particular proposals depending on a mandate's investment strategy and guidelines, we are broadening our capabilities to support voting results that may vary across our platform.\n- \u00b7  Diminished role of proxy advisor recommendations. J.P. Morgan Asset Management makes its own independent proxy voting decisions (based on deep fundamental research) and stands behind the depth and rigor of its processes and historical information advantage. In most cases, the firm will only use proxy advisory firms for research, data and technical mechanics of vote transmission and not for outsourced recommendations. By the end of 2024, J.P. Morgan Asset Management generally will have eliminated third-party proxy advisor voting recommendations from its internally developed voting systems. Additionally, the firm will work with thirdparty proxy voting advisors to remove their voting recommendations from research reports they provide to J.P. Morgan Asset Management by the 2025 proxy season.\n- \u00b7  Other enhancements . We are working to give a company and its management even greater access to the ultimate decision makers; to raise critical issues to a company as early as possible in a constructive and proactive way; and to be willing to tell companies how we have voted once our decision is made rather than waiting until votes are finally counted.\n\nTaken together, these steps are designed to respond to a growing perception (and, I believe, reality) that the asset management industry generally places undue reliance on proxy advisors in how proxies are voted. We believe these actions will strengthen our relationships with our clients and with companies while helping to build trust among shareholders, investors and companies.\n\n## THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF PRIVATE CREDIT\n\nI have already mentioned some of the benefits of private credit, and I'll now mention some more. Many people in the private credit arena are very smart and creative and want to help the companies they invest in navigate through market shoals. They can move quickly, discreetly and flexibly. Most generally understand that bad accounting drives bad decisions, and their goal is to make the right decisions for the future of the company.\n\nOn the other hand, not all players are that good. And problems in the private credit market caused by the bad players can leak onto the good ones, even though private credit money is locked up for years. If investors feel mistreated, they will cry foul, and the government will respond by putting a laser focus on the business. It's a reasonable assumption that at some point regulations will focus on the private markets as they do on the public markets.\n\nThis scrutiny will include a look at how private credit values its assets, which isn't as transparent as public market valuations. In addition, private market loans commonly lack liquidity in the secondary market and are not generally supported by in-depth market research.\n\nNew financial products that grow extremely rapidly often become an area of unexpected risk in the markets. Frequently, the weaknesses of new products, in this case private credit loans, may only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which private credit loans have not yet faced. When credit spreads gap out, when interest rates go up and when some leveraged companies su/ffer in the recession, we will find out how those loans survive stress testing . In addition, they can create a little bit of a ' credit crunch ' for borrowers since it might be hard for private creditors to roll over loans under those conditions. Under stress conditions, private creditors would have to charge exorbitant prices that companies simply cannot a/fford in order to book the new loan at par. Banks are in a slightly di/fferent position.",

Banks do this for multiple reasons: They normally feel an obligation to help their clients, they have longterm relationships and they can commonly earn other sources of revenue from client-driven transactions. Banks can also flex their capital and lending base as needed by their clients. This is because a bank can and should make decisions to help com-24\\_JD\\_size of financial sector\\_0 8\n\npanies through good times and bad, seeking to retain them as long-term clients across many areas of the bank.

One cannot overemphasize the importance of observation and a full assessment - the failure to do so leads to some of the greatest mistakes, not only in war but also in business and government.\n\n## A full assessment is critical.\n\nTo properly manage any business situation, you need to perform a full and complete assessment of it. In business, you have to understand your competitors, their distribution, their economics, their innovations, and their strengths and weaknesses. You also need to understand customers and their changing preferences, along with your own costs, your people and their skills. Then there's knowing how other factors fit in, like technology, risk, motivations \u2026 hope you get the point. For countries, you need a thorough grasp of their economies, strengths and weaknesses, population and education, access to raw materials, laws and regulations, history and culture. Research, data and analytics should be at a very detailed level and constantly reassessed. Only after you complete this diligent study can you start to make plans with a high degree of success.\n\n## Get on the road - it builds knowledge and culture.\n\nI have frequently wondered about all the nonstop road trips, client meetings, briefings, greetings, bus trips, and visits to call centers, operating centers and branches, regulators and government o/fficials, among others: Did they make a di/fference? The answer is absolutely yes because they enabled a process of constant learning, assessment and modification of best practices - gaining insights from employees to clients to competitors. Employees will tell you what you are doing well or poorly if you simply ask them, and they know you want to hear the real answer. Curiosity is a form of humility - acknowledging that you don't know everything. Responding to curiosity allows other people to speak freely. Facts and details matter and inform a deeper and deeper analysis that allows you to continually revise and update your plans. This, of course, also means that you are constantly admitting prior mistakes.\n\n## You need to shed sacred cows, seek out blind spots and challenge the status quo.\n\nVery often companies or individuals develop narratives based upon beliefs that are very hard to dislodge but are often wrong - and they can lead to terrible mistakes. A few examples will su/ffice. Stripe, Inc. built a payments business by working with developers - something we never would have imagined but might have figured out if we had tried to seek out what others were doing in this area. Branches were being closed, both at Bank One and Chase, because the assumption was that they would not be needed in the future. We underinvested for years in the wealth management business because we were always focused on the value of deposits versus investments. Question everything.",

        "page_content": "## Use your brains to figure out the truth - not to justify what you already think.\n\nIt's often hard to change your own attitudes and beliefs, especially those you may have held on to for some time. But you must be open to it. When you learn something that is di/fferent from what you thought, it may a/ffect many conclusions you have, not just one. Try not to allow yourself to become rigid or 'weaponized,' where other employees or interest groups jazz you up so much that you become a weapon on their behalf. This makes it much harder to see things clearly for yourself. When people disagree with you, seek out where they may be partially right. This opens the door for a deeper understanding and avoids binary thinking.\n\n## It's hard to see certain long-term trends, but you must try.\n\nThere is too much emphasis on short-term, monthly data and too little on long-term trends and on what might happen in the future that would influence long-term outcomes. For example, today there is tremendous interest in monthly inflation data, although it seems to me that every long-term trend I see increases inflation relative to the last 20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed each year for the green economy, the remilitarization of the world and the restructuring of global trade - all are inflationary. I'm not sure models could pick this up. And you must use judgment if you want to evaluate impacts like these.\n\nAlso, a block of time as short as one year is an artificial framework for judging the impact of longterm trends that could easily play out over years. A helpful exercise is to think 'future back,' in which you imagine di/fferent future outcomes, including the ones you want, and then work backward to events that are happening today (or that might happen or that you cause to happen), closely\n\nexamining the connections between those events and your projected or desired outcomes. Those connections inform your risk and R&D planning. Similarly, when companies compare the attributes of their products and services with their competitors, they usually only consider where they are versus their competitors. But nothing is static they should consider where their competitors will be in the future. Conditions are always changing, crises are always emerging. When analyzing the playing field, it is better to assume that your competitors are strong and are already in the process of improving and innovating. This minimizes the chance of arrogance leading to complacency.\n\n## DECISION MAKING AND ACTING (HAVE A PROCESS)\n\n## There is a time for an individual to decide and act.\n\nSometimes you should take the time to measure twice and cut once. And then sometimes making a quick decision is better than delaying. You should try to distinguish between the two. For example, with decisions that are hard to reverse, it's usually better to go slow. With other decisions where you can test, learn, probe and change direction, it's often better to go fast. It's been my experience that it's hard for some people to actually decide and act. This could be from analysis paralysis, lack of 'perfect' information, fear of failure or the feeling that full consensus is needed before a decision can be reached. But whatever it is, it can slow down and possibly seriously damage a company.\n\nTo get people to think like decision makers and take a strong point of view, we like to ask, 'What would you do if you were king or queen for a day?' It helps shift the direction to individual decision making. We also ask questions like, 'What would",

        "page_content": "you wish for if you knew X was going to happen?' (for example, higher interest rates). Decision making takes a mix of courage, grit and guts.\n\nOne exercise that I find useful (and sometimes painful) is to draw up a list of important decisions that need to be made - the ones I often avoid confronting. So I take time every Sunday to think about these tough issues and almost always make progress. Progress doesn't always mean that you come to the final conclusion - sometimes it's just a very rational next step that can put you on a path to the final decision.\n\n## Try to have a good decision-making process.\n\nTry to give yourself the time to decide. Make sure you speak with the right people and make sure the right people are in the room. Information should be fully shared. People should be made very comfortable with open debate. Quite often, the 'right' answer is simply waiting to be found - you don't have to guess.\n\n## Crowdsourcing, compromise, consensus and committees have benefits and risks.\n\nThere are huge benefits to crowdsourcing intelligence. It is a form of full assessment, a strategy for getting the best ideas and challenging the status quo. We should do this for almost every major decision. It is perfectly fine on some occasions to compromise and gain consensus, particularly on decisions that are not critical and can easily be reversed. Often people spend too much time debating issues that are simply not that important; it's better to decide and move on. Also, before you compromise, you should know exactly what you want to achieve and the consequences of any tradeo/ffs. However, sometimes compromise and consensus cannot work and only lead to a feel-good decision that is probably wrong - this could be the road to ruin.\n\nThe use of committees can be good when done properly. For example, if our risk committees could do a full assessment and crowdsource all potential risks, that would lead to better decision making. I will give one very personal and painful example, which is when we had a major trading scandal, called The London Whale. The scandal was not caused by the complexity of the trade but rather the failure to go to the proper Risk committee for a thorough review, which should have happened but didn't. I have no doubt that had the trade been raised there, the flaws would have been exposed immediately, thereby dramatically reducing or eliminating the problem. On the other hand, the opposite can happen when a committee, with everyone staring at each other, devolves into herd-like behavior with people looking for confirmation and ending up with a compromise that is a poor choice.\n\nGood leadership involves great observation and the ability to act, but there is more \u2026\n\n## THE SECRET SAUCE OF LEADERSHIP (HAVE A HEART)\n\n## You need to earn trust and respect with your employees.\n\nYou can be great at assessment, you can be brilliant and you may often be willing to act. But all of that is not good enough for 'complete' leadership. To become a true leader, you need to be trusted and you must earn your respect, every day. People have to know that you do not have ulterior motives and that you're trying to do the right thing - not trying to burnish your personal reputation. Good people want to work for people they respect, and they will not respect people who take all the credit and share all the blame. People need to know that even when you make mistakes, you're willing to admit them and take corrective action. And there is more \u2026",

        "page_content": "## The importance of vision, communication and inspiration.\n\nThe reason I've always hesitated to talk about 'vision' is because often it is the basic BS of corporate speak - that somehow if you impart your vision to people, they will take the mountain. What it really is all about is this: After you've done your full assessment and decision making, you can then continuously educate, explain, train, simplify, propel and fight. But this only works if people know you are in the trenches with them, if they understand the mission and if they are there side by side with your e/ffort.\n\nWe know that bureaucracy can lead to politics, corporate stasis and terrible decisions. So you can communicate your vision about how to fight bureaucracy by telling stories about the silly things we do - but with a smile - and then by showing people that you will actually fix the problems.\n\nFinally, your vision needs to be clear, coherent and consistent. Within an organization, people very quickly pick up the pattern of management saying one thing but doing another. Because if words and actions are inconsistent (for example, and I could give many, when we say we want employees to be treated with respect, but we allow a jerk to be their boss), confidence in leadership will be eroded.\n\n## Heart cannot be overstated.\n\nHeart matters. And it makes a di/fference when people know and see that you actually care. One example: Many years ago when I was new to JPMorgan Chase, I learned that the company's security guards had been outsourced - to save money. Since after outsourcing, when the same guards continued coming to work every day at the same salary, I wondered, 'How could this be?' (FYI, this was brought to my attention by the head of the Service Employees International Union, who\n\ncame to see me over the objection of my management team.) The reason we were saving money is because the healthcare benefits were cut in half for the guards and their family members (currently worth approximately $15,000 a year), and the savings were split with us. This was a heartless thing to do - and the second I found out, I reversed the decision. JPMorgan Chase's success will not be built o/ff the backs of our guards - it will be the result of fair treatment of all of our employees and we're thankful that many of those guards are still with our company today.\n\nYou know heart and soul when you see it in e/ffect on sports teams or with 'the boys in the boat' it's a beautiful thing to watch. It's not as obvious, but it happens in business, too.\n\n## It's essential to build trust with your customers, constituencies and, yes, even competitors.\n\nOf course, I'm not bringing this up as a matter of corporate governance or a corporation's purpose: A business should, over the long run, try to maximize shareholder value. It is completely obvious that running a decent business -treating everyone ethically and earning trust and respect in all your communities - is not only fundamental to shareholder value but also to a healthy society.",

        "page_content": "## A Pivotal Moment for America and the Free Western World: Strategy and Policy Matter\n\nIn past years, I have written extensively about public policy issues. It is important to engage in these conversations, particularly around domestic economic policy because policy matters . While JPMorgan Chase can execute specific plans to improve outcomes for customers and communities, there is no replacement for e/ffective government policies that add to the general well-being of the country. A stronger and more prosperous country will make us a stronger company.\n\nAs CEO of this company, every year I visit numerous countries around the globe. I meet with foreign government leaders, presidents and prime ministers, business leaders, and civic and academic experts, which allows me to learn a significant amount about how public policy is executed around the world. It also reinforces some of the critical values and virtues that are essential to a healthy country.\n\nEvery time I see the American flag, it reminds me of the values and virtues of this country and its founding principles conceived in liberty and dedicated to the notion that all men and women are created equal. Talk with someone who has recently become a naturalized citizen or watch a ceremony where groups of people take the oath to America, and you will see extraordinary joy and newfound pride. They now live free, with individual rights protected by the Constitution and with their life and the well-being of their family and community protected by the U.S. military. As Americans, we have much to be grateful for and much to defend.\n\nIf you read the newspaper from virtually any day of any year since World War II, there is abundant coverage on wars - hot and cold - inflation, recession, polarized politics, terrorist attacks, migration and starvation. As appalling as these events have\n\nbeen, the world was generally on a path to becoming stronger and safer. When terrible events happen, we tend to overestimate the e/ffect they will have on the global economy. Recent events, however, may very well be creating risks that could eclipse anything since World War II - we should not take them lightly.\n\nFebruary 24, 2022 is another day in history that will live in infamy. On that day, 190,000 Russian soldiers invaded a free and democratic European country - importantly, somewhat protected by the threat of nuclear blackmail. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent abhorrent attack on Israel and ongoing violence in the Middle East should have punctured many assumptions about the direction of future safety and security, bringing us to this pivotal time in history. America and the free Western world can no longer maintain a false sense of security based on the illusion that dictatorships and oppressive nations won't use their economic and military powers to advance their aims - particularly against what they perceive as weak, incompetent and disorganized Western democracies. In a troubled world, we are reminded that national security is and always will be paramount, even if its importance seems to recede in tranquil times.\n\nThe fallout from these events should also lay to rest the idea that America can stand alone. Of course, U.S. leaders must always put America first, but global peace and order are vital to American interests. Only America has the full capability to lead and coalesce the Western world, though we must do so respectfully and in partnership with our allies. Without cohesiveness and unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide and conquer the bickering democracies. America needs to lead with its strengths - not only its",

        "page_content": "military but also its economic, diplomatic and moral forces. And now we must do so as America's leadership is being challenged around the world. There is nothing more important.\n\n## Policy and strategy matter, and it's important to be engaged.\n\nIn our increasingly complex world, there is a vital interrelationship between domestic and foreign economic policy, particularly around trade, investment, national security and other issues. And, of course, while American voters and leadership set U.S. foreign policy, being a constructive part of the global conversation has become more important than ever.\n\nIf you doubt how important public policy is for the health of a country, you need to look no further than the recent history of Greece, Ireland or Singapore. Each of these countries, starting from deeply challenging places, implemented e/ffective government and policies that have done a great job of lifting up their people when many thought it wasn't possible. Sweden is another great example of a country with good broad-based policies that have succeeded at precisely what we all may want - a dynamic, innovative, free-market economy (Sweden actually has fewer government-owned enterprises than America) and safety nets that work. Conversely, you need to look no further than North Korea or Venezuela to see the complete destruction and havoc that terrible public policies (often in the name of the people) can cultivate.\n\nStrategy by its nature must be comprehensive. In the rest of this section, I try to answer the question: What must we do to ensure that the world stays safe, not only for America but for freedom and democracy? A comprehensive strategy entails four important pillars, and we must succeed at each:\n\n- 1. Maintain American leadership (including military).\n- 2. Achieve long-term economic success with our allies.\n- 3. Strengthen our nation domestically.\n- 4. Deepen focus and resolve on addressing our most pressing challenges.\n\n## COALESCING THE WESTERN WORLD - A UNIQUELY AMERICAN TASK\n\nOnly America has the full capabilities of military might, economic power and the principles that most people around the world yearn for - based on 'liberty and justice for all' and the proposition that all people are created equal. America remains the bastion of freedom and the arsenal of democracy.\n\n## There is no alternative to American leadership.\n\nIn the free and democratic Western world, and, in fact, for many other countries, there is no real or good alternative to America. The only other potential superpower is China. Other nations know they can rely on the founding principles of America. If we reach out our hand, most nations will happily take that hand. America is still the most prosperous nation on the planet, which not only can guarantee our military strength but also positions us to help our allies develop and grow their nations (though we should minimize the 'our way or the highway' type of behavior). This leadership is needed today to help Ukraine stay free in its battle with Russia.\n\n## Most of the world wants American leadership.\n\nAmerica continues to be the envy of much of the world, and as we've seen with the challenges at our borders, there is a reason people want to come here and not to autocratic nations. If you opened America's borders to the rest of the world, I have little doubt that hundreds of millions of people would want to move here. By contrast, not many would want to emigrate to autocratic nations. Also, I have little doubt that if most investors across the globe could only invest in one country, they would choose the United States. Beyond our country's borders, people and nations around the world understand the role that America has played in promoting world peace - known as Pax Americana . For the most part, Pax Americana has kept the world relatively peaceful since World War II and helped lead to enormous global economic prosperity, which has helped lift 1.3 billion people out of poverty.",

        "page_content": "Modern America does not engage in economic coercion or foreign wars to steal land or treasure. The fact that some of our foreign excursions might have been misguided does not negate this. We helped rebuild Europe and Japan after the devastation of World War II, and we, with our allies, have helped create global institutions to maintain peace. We are still trusted.\n\n## First and foremost, the Western world needs unquestioned military might - peace through strength.\n\n'We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak,' said Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nSo far, the Western world has done a good job in strengthening military alliances in response to the war in Ukraine. Ukraine is essentially the front line that needs immediate support. Providing that support is the best way to counter autocratic forces that would seek to weaken the Western world, particularly America. But the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could become far worse and spread in unpredictable ways. Most important, the specter of nuclear weapons - probably still the greatest threat to mankind - hovers as the ultimate decider, which should strike deep fear in all our hearts. The best protection starts with an unyielding resolve to do whatever we need to do to maintain the strongest military on the planet - a commitment that is well within our economic capability.\n\n## American leadership requires not only the military but also the full 'symphony of power.'\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in his book Exercise of Power , writes extensively in the first chapter about 'the symphony of power.' He makes the critical point that America has often overused and misused military power and has massively underused other muscles - diplomacy, intelligence, communication (explaining to the world the benefits of democracy and free enterprise) and comprehensive economic policy.\n\nAmerica has the most extensive group of partners, friends and allies - both military and economic that the world has probably ever seen. We should put this to better use.\n\n## The American public ought to hear more about why this is so important.\n\nInternational isolationism has run through American foreign policy throughout our history, frequently with good reason. The chant, 'Don't get involved in foreign wars' was often right. That said, the American public should remember that even after the Revolutionary War, we did, in fact, have British and French armies on our soil. The sinking of American merchant and passenger ships during World War I and the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II brought isolationism to a close for a time. America is never far from being dragged into terrible conflicts. Global wars come to our shores whether we like it or not - we need to stay engaged.\n\nIn perilous periods of history when our allies and other democracies were under serious assault, great American leaders have inspired the American people - through words and actions - to stand up to help and defend them. Staying on the sidelines during battles of autocracy and democracy, between dictatorship and freedom, is simply not an option for America today. Ukraine is the front line of democracy. If the war goes badly for Ukraine, you may see the splintering of Pax Americana, which would be a disaster for the whole free world . Ukraine's struggle is our struggle, and ensuring their victory is ensuring America first . It is imperative that our national leaders explain to the American people what is at stake and make a powerful case - with energy, consistency and clarity - for our strong enduring commitment to Ukraine's survival for as long as it takes (and it could take years).\n\nOne last point: Ukraine needs our help immediately, but it's important to understand that much of the money that America is directing to Ukraine is for purchasing weapons and equipment, most of which will be built in America. Not only is our aid helping Ukraine, but it is going directly to American manufacturers, and it is helping the country rebuild our military industrial capacity for the next generation.",

There are many things we need to do to strengthen the U.S. economy, and I talk about that later in this section. This discussion is about foreign economic policies -the economic battlefield .\n\nThe whole Western world is rethinking and reimagining its military strategies and alliances. We need to do the same for our economic strategies and alliances, but we should be guided by a comprehensive global strategy that deals with critical issues. Done properly, such a strategy would help strengthen, coalesce and possibly be the glue that holds together Western democratic alliances over decades.\n\nForeign economic policy involves trade and investment, export controls, secure and resilient supply chains, and the execution of sanctions and any related industrial policies. It must also include development finance - think of the 'Belt and Road' e/fforts in China - which are critical to most developing nations. This framework should tell us not only how to deal with our allies but also how to work with nonaligned nations around the world. These strategies should not be aimed against any one country (such as China) but rather be focused on keeping the world safe for democracy and free enterprise.\n\n## Economic national security is paramount both for the United States and for our allies.\n\nIt is a valid point that the Western world - both government and business - essentially underestimated the growing strength and potential threat of China. It's also true that China has been comprehensively and strategically focused on these economic issues, all while we slept. But let's not cry over spilled milk - let's just fix it.\n\nWe missed the potential threat from three vantage points. The first is companies' overreliance on China as the sole link in their supply chain, which can create vulnerabilities and reduces resiliency. But to the extent this involves everyday items, like\n\nclothes, sneakers, vaccine compounds and consumer goods, this dependency is not as critical or complex and will eventually be sorted out.\n\nThe second is the most critical. The United States cannot rely on any potential adversaries for materials essential to our national security - think rare earths, 5G and semiconductors, penicillin and materials critical to essential pharmaceuticals, among others. We also cannot be sharing vital technologies that can enhance an adversary's military capabilities. The United States should properly and narrowly define these issues and then act unilaterally, if necessary, to fix them.\n\nThe third is also complex, which is countering unfair competition or 'mercantilist' behavior in critical industries; think electric vehicles, renewable energy and AI, among others. Examples of this would be where a state, any state, uses government powers, capital, subsidies or other means to dominate critical industries and deeply damage the economic position of other nations. Weakening a country economically can render it a virtual 'vassal state,' reliant on potential adversaries for essential goods and services, which also weakens it militarily. We cannot cede our important resources and capabilities to potential adversaries.\n\nAll these issues can be resolved, though they will take time and need devoted e/ffort.\n\nEvery nation will have di/fferent national security issues. For example, Europe in general and countries like India, Japan and Korea need reliable, a/ffordable and secure energy; many nations would put food security as their top concern. This means that we must work with our allies to accomplish our own goals and to help them accomplish theirs. We have extraordinary common interests in our joint security: We must hang together - because if we don't, we will assuredly hang separately.\n\n## We already engage in trade - improving it is good economics and great geopolitics.\n\nWe must have a better understanding of trade. As a nation, we refuse to get into genuine trade discussions, but this ignores the complete and obvious truth - we already have trade relationships with all these countries. Approximately 92%",

We should negotiate trade agreements that can achieve more, economically, for ourselves and our allies, as well as meet all of our national security needs. While it is appropriate to use trade to continue to nudge allies in the right direction around human rights and climate, this objective should be subordinated to our national interests of long-term security.\n\nNegotiating must be done in concert with our allied nations so as not to cause a fissure in economic relations. This is critical - strong economic bonds will help ensure strong military alliances. The Inflation Reduction Act has much good in it (more on this later), but it angered many of our allies. To them, the bill was by America and for America, and, subsequently, they felt a need to match it so their businesses would not be disadvantaged. The terms of the legislation could have been better negotiated with our allies in mind, strengthening our economic ties with the free world.\n\nWe should also immediately re-enter, if possible, the prior negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Not only is it good for the economy, but it also could be a brilliant, strategic, economic security move - an economic alliance that binds us with 11 other important countries (including Australia, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and Vietnam). Geopolitically and strategically, this might be one of the most important moves to counter China. While this is a challenging step, our political leaders need to explain and lead - and not be afraid of dealing with the tough issues. We also need to acknowledge that there have been real negative job impacts as a result of trade, which are usually concentrated around certain areas and businesses. So any new trade policy should be combined with a greatly enhanced Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides retraining, income assistance and relocation for those workers directly impacted by trade.\n\nTrade is realpolitik, and the recent cancellation of future liquified natural gas (LNG) projects is a good example of this fact. The projects were delayed mainly for political reasons - to pacify those who\n\nbelieve that gas is bad and that oil and gas projects should simply be stopped. This is not only wrong but also enormously na\u00efve. One of the best ways to reduce CO2 for the next few decades is to use gas to replace coal. When oil and gas prices skyrocketed last winter, nations around the world wealthy and very climate-conscious nations like France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as lower-income nations like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam that could not a/fford the higher cost started to turn back to their coal plants. This highlights the importance of safe, secure and a/ffordable energy. Second, the export of LNG is a great economic boon for the United States. But most important is the realpolitik goal: Our allied nations that need secure and a/ffordable energy resources, including critical nations like Japan, Korea and most of our European allies, would like to be able to depend on the United States for energy. This now puts them in a di/fficult position - they may have to look elsewhere for such supplies, turning to Iran, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates or maybe even Russia. We need to minimize anything that can tear at our economic bonds with our allies.\n\nThe strength of our domestic production of energy gives us a 'power advantage' - cheaper and more reliable energy, which creates economic and geopolitical advantages.\n\n## Industrial policy is now necessary, but it should be carefully constructed and limited.\n\nIn some cases, industrial policy (using government resources to subsidize investments to help make businesses more competitive) may be the only solution for quickly building up the industries we need (rare earths and semiconductors, among others) to guarantee resilient national security. The IRA and CHIPS Act are good examples of this and government has to get it right.\n\nSuch policy can also be used to help combat unfair competitive policies of nations that are using state capitalism and state control to dominate critical industries. However, when crafting industrial policy, the function of government needs to be narrowly defined and kept simple; i.e., governmental jurisdiction should be limited to very specific products and",

And industrial policy should include twin provisions: 1) strict limitations on political interference, like social policies, and 2) specific permitting requirements, which, if not drastically improved, will badly inhibit our ability to make investments and allow infrastructure to be built. Adding social policy, politics and matters other than simple tax credits dramatically reduces the economic e/fficiency of industrial policy and creates conditions for corporate America to feed at the trough of government largess. We should quickly address how we can improve on already executed legislation. We do not want to look back and have great regrets about how so much of this policy work failed.\n\nThere are those who argue that the U.S. government needs much more far-reaching industrial policy to be able to micromanage and accomplish its many ambitious objectives. To those I say, read further in this section about how ine/ffective so many government policies have been.\n\n## We should be tough, but we should engage with China.\n\nOver the last 20 years, China has been executing a more comprehensive economic strategy than we have. The country's leaders have successfully grown their nation and, depending on how you measure it, have the first or second largest economy in the world. That said, many question the current economic focus of China's leadership as they don't have everything figured out. While China has become the largest trading partner to many countries around the world, its own GDP per person is $13,000. And the country continues to be beset by many economic and domestic issues.\n\nChina has its own national security concerns. The country is located in a very politically complex part of the world, and many of China's actions have caused its neighbors (e.g., Japan, Korea, Philippines, among others) to start to re-arm and, in fact, draw closer to the United States. It also surprises many Americans to hear that while our country is 100% energy su/fficient, China needs to import 10 million\n\nbarrels of oil a day. It is clear that China's new leadership has set a di/fferent course, with a much more intense focus on national security, military capability and internal development. That is their right, and we simply need to adjust to it.\n\nAmerica still has an enormously strong hand plenty of food, water and energy; peaceful neighbors; and what remains the most prosperous and dynamic economy the world has ever seen, with a per person GDP of over $80,000 a year. Most important, our nation is blessed with the benefit of true freedom and liberty. See the sidebar on the amazing power of freedom later in this section.\n\nWhile we may always have a complex relationship with China (made all the more complicated and serious by ongoing wars), the country's vast size and importance to so many other nations requires us to stay engaged - thoughtfully and without fear. At the same time, we need to build and execute our own long-term, comprehensive economic security strategy to keep our position safe and secure. I believe that respectful, strong and consistent engagement would be best for both our countries and the rest of the world.\n\n## We need to strengthen and rebuild the international order - we may need a new Bretton Woods.\n\nThe international rules-based order established by the Western world after World War II is clearly under attack by outside forces, somewhat weakened by its own failures and inability to keep up with the increasingly complex world. This international order relies on a web of military alliances, trade agreements (e.g., World Trade Organization), development finance (e.g., International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) and related global tax and investment policies and diplomacy organizations (e.g., United Nations), which have evolved into a confusing and overlapping regime of policies. You can now add to it the new issues of cyber warfare, digital trade and privacy, and global taxes, among others.",

The time may be right for a reimagined Bretton Woods - and by this, I mean revitalizing our global architecture. Since too many parts of the world have been neglected, any new system has to take into account and properly address the needs of all nations, including areas of concentrated poverty.\n\nWhile we hope the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East will end eventually (and, we hope, successfully from the standpoint of our allies), these other critical economic battles could possibly continue throughout our lifetime. If the Western world is slowly split apart over the next few decades, it will likely be the result of our failure to e/ffectively address crucial global economic challenges.\n\n## PROVIDING STRONG LEADERSHIP GLOBALLY AND EFFECTIVE POLICYMAKING DOMESTICALLY\n\nWhen you travel around the United States and talk with people of all types and persuasions, there is a rather common refrain; namely, why are we helping foreign nations with the safety of their borders and economies when we are not doing a particularly good job of protecting our own? While there is no moral equivalency in these arguments, they are understandable. It is clear that many Americans feel we need to do a better job here at home before we can focus over there . We can understand why some people living in this country, who have been neglected for decades, ask how their government can find the money for Ukraine and other parts of the world but not for them. It is a reasonable question.\n\nFrom my point of view, our highly charged, emotional and political domestic issues are centered around 1) immigration and lack of border security and 2) the fraying of the American dream, particularly for low-income and rural Americans who feel left behind amid the growing wealth and prosperity of others around them. Please read the sidebar on page 57, which I believe explains the legitimate frustration of some of our citizens. And I agree with them.\n\nIn the sidebar, I also explain how two policies (a large expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and focus on work skills and job outcomes at high schools, community colleges and colleges) would not only dramatically increase both the income and employment opportunities for many of those left behind but would also have the virtue of actually growing the workforce. The combined e/ffect of all of this would be quite a boon to our GDP.\n\nI believe that many a/ffected Americans are not angry at hardworking, law-abiding immigrants and, in fact, acknowledge the critical role immigrants continue to play in building this wonderful country. Rather, they are angry that America has not implemented proper border control and immigration policies. It is astounding that many in Congress know what to do and want to do it but are simply unable to pass legislation because of partisan politics. Congress did come close on a few occasions - and I hope they keep trying.\n\n## Deliberate policies meant to drive healthy growth are needed.\n\nFor over two decades, since 2000, America has grown at an anemic rate of 2%. We should have strived for and achieved 3% growth. Had we done so, GDP per person today would be $16,000 higher, which would, in turn, have paid for better healthcare, childcare, education and other services. Importantly, the best way to handle our excess deficit and debt issues is to maximize economic growth.\n\nGrowth policies include (the list could be very long so I'll just mention a few):\n\n- \u00b7  Consistent tax policies, conducive to both employment and capital investment. Capital investment is the primary driver of innovation, productivity and, therefore, growth in America. Tax policies change too frequently, which causes uncertainty and complicates long-term capital investment decision making (I won't bore you with the details here). A bipartisan committee of Congress is probably required to fix this - and the sooner the better.",

This requires an ongoing concerted e/ffort to streamline regulations to cost e/ffectively drive better outcomes for the United States. The last thing we need is a constant pile-on of politically driven, fragmented policies. Please read the sidebar on the next page, an editorial in The Wall Street Journal by George McGovern, one of the most liberal presidential nominees in our lifetime, in which he clearly lays out the complexity, risks and costs that businesses, large and small, face every day. While he acknowledges the worthiness of the goals of many regulations, he points out their negatives. He also calls out the 'blame-shifting and scapegoating' and 'the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees.' Not only is this state of a/ffairs demoralizing, but it also reduces employment, capital investment and the formation of new businesses, as well as cause unnecessary bankruptcies. Estimates of the regulatory costs for America are approximately $19,000 per worker, dwarfing the regulatory burdens in other countries. We all want sensible regulations that make us a better and safer nation - but this number is astounding. We should be able to accomplish our goals while sharply reducing needless and wasteful expenses. And remember, it's discouraging not only to companies but to all citizens who have to deal with it on a daily basis.\n- \u00b7  Timely permits on projects large and small. There is virtually no industry - from agriculture and construction to transportation, technology, and oil and gas - or business, large or small, that isn't disadvantaged by the tedious process and the length of time it takes to get approvals for permits to get things done. This includes federal, state and local requirements. These bottlenecks also make investment far more costly and slow. Timely permits would improve infrastructure and save lives, not endanger them.\n\n## \u00b7  Proper federal government budgeting and\n\n- fiscal management. The staggering inability of the government to draft and pass a proper budget causes deep and unnecessary damage to our growth. Some people estimate that the waste alone (due to improper payments, overlapping programs, and fragmented and duplicative contracts, among other things) could cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This uncertainty filters through virtually every part of the American economy and should not be accepted.\n\n## We can all forgo a little self-interest to do what is right for our country.\n\nThose of us who have benefited the most from this country bear even greater responsibility to do this. It's perfectly understandable that institutions, including businesses, unions and industries, lobby in Washington, D.C., to protect themselves - in good ways and bad - but we should more regularly put national interests ahead of self-interests. It's good to want to ensure well-paying jobs and healthy industries. But it is not good when it reduces competition, stops the deployment of enhanced technology, harms e/fficiency, creates fake jobs or builds bridges to nowhere or damages the general health of the economy. Doing the right thing, the right way - which is achievable - would be better for everyone. As former President John F. Kennedy said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.'\n\n## Celebrate American exceptionalism.\n\nWe can safely say that America is an exceptional nation built and grounded on principles - principles of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment brought to us by our democracy through the power to elect our leaders and of our Constitution, which makes these individual freedoms sacrosanct. Much of the world yearns to be here because of those principles - the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We should extol those virtues while recognizing that America has never been a perfect nation, like all other nations. We can acknowledge our flaws and strive to constantly correct them, without denigrating our nation.",

After  leaving  a career in politics, I devoted  much of my time  to  public lectures  that took  me  into every  state in  the  union  and  much  of Europe, Asia,  the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nIn  1988,  I invested  most  of  the earnings  from  this  lecture  circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's Stratford  Inn.  Hotels,  inns  and restaurants have  always  held  a special fascination  for  me.  The  Stratford  Inn promised  the  realization  of  a longtime dream  to  own  a  combination  hotel, restaurant  and  public  conference facility  -- complete with  an  experienced manager  and  staff.\n\nIn  retrospect,  I wish  I had  known more about the  hazards  and  difficulties of  such  a business,  especially during a recession  of  the  kind  that  hit  New England  just as  I was  acquiring  the inn's  43-year  leasehold.  I  also  wish that during the  years I was  in  public office,  I  had  had  this  firsthand experience  about  the  difficulties business  people  face  every  day. That knowledge  would  have  made  me  a better  U.S.  senator  and  a  more understanding presidential  contender.\n\nToday  we  are  much  closer  to  a general  acknowledgment  that government must encourage business to expand  and  grow.  Bill  Clinton,  Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have,  I believe,  changed  the  debate  of  our party.  We  intuitively  know  that  to create  job  opportunities  we  need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital against  an  expected  payoff.  Too  often, however, public policy does not consider whether  we  are  choking  off  those opportunities.\n\nMy own business perspective has\n\nbeen  limited  to  that  small  hotel  and restaurant in  Stratford,  Conn.,  with  an especially  difficult  lease  and  a severe recession.  But  my  business  associates and  I also  lived  with  federal,  state and local  rules  that were  all  passed with  the objective  of  helping  employees, protecting the  environment,  raising tax dollars  for  schools,  protecting  our customers from  fire  hazards, etc. While I never have  doubted  the  worthiness  of any  of  these  goals,  the  concept  that most  often  eludes  legislators  is:  \"Can we  make  consumers  pay  the  higher prices  for  the  increased operating costs that  accompany  public  regnlation  and government  reporting  requirements with  reams  of  red  tape.\"  It is  a simple concern  that  is  nonetheless  often ignored  by  legislators.\n\nFor  example,  the  papers  today are  filled  with  stories  about  businesses dropping  health  coverage  for employees.  We  provided  a substantial package  for  our staff at  the  Stratford Inn.  However,  were we operating today, those costs would exceed $150,000 a year for  health  care on  top  of  salaries  and other benefits.  There  would  have  been no  reasonable  way  for  us  to  absorb  or pass on  these  costs.\n\nSome  of  the  escalation  in  the cost  of  health  care  is  attributed  to patients  suing  doctors.  While  one cannot  assess  the  merit  of  all  these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand  the explosion  in  blame-shifting  and scapegoating  for  every  negative experience  in  life.\n\nToday,  despite  bankruptcy,  we are still  dealing  with  litigation  from individuals  who  fell  in  or  near  our restaurant.  Despite  these  injuries,  not every  misstep  is  the  fault  of  someone else.  Not  every such  incident  should  be viewed  as  a  lawsuit  instead  of  an unfortunate accident.  And while the business owner may prevail in the  end, the endless exposure to  frivolous  claims and high  legal  fees  is  frightening.\n\nOur  Connecticut  hotel,  along with  many others, went  bankrupt for  a variety of reasons,  the  general economy in  the  Northeast  being  a  significant\n\ncause.  But  that  reason  masks  the variety of  other  challenges  we  faced that drive operating costs and financing charges  beyond  what  a small  business can  handle.\n\nIt is  clear  that  some  businesses have  products  that can  be  priced  at almost  any  level.  The  price  of  raw materials (e.g., steel  and  glass)  and life-saving  drugs  and  medical  care are  not easily substituted  by consumers. It is  only  competition  or  antitrust that tempers  price  increases.  Consumers may  delay  purchases,  but  they  have little  choice  when  faced  with  higher prices.\n\nIn  services,  however,  consumers do  have  a  choice  when  faced  with higher prices. You  may  have  to  stay in a hotel  while  on  vacation,  but  you  can stay  fewer  days.  You  can  eat  in restaurants fewer  times  per month,  or forgo  a  number  of  services  from  car washes  to  shoeshines.  Every  such decision  eventually results in job  losses for  someone.  And  often  these  are the people  without  the  skills  to  help themselves  -\u00b7  the  people  I've  spent  a lifetime  trying  to  help.\n\nIn  short,  \"one-size-fits-all\" rules  for  business  ignore  the  reality of the marketplace. And setting thresholds for  regulatory  guidelines  at artificial levels  -- e.g.,  50  employees  or  more, $500,000  in  sales  -- takes  no  account of other realities,  such  as  profit  margins, labor  intensive  vs.  capital  intensive businesses,  and  local  market economics.\n\nThe  problem  we  face  as legislators  is:  Where  do  we  set the  bar so  that it is  not  too  high to  clear?  I don't have the  answer.  I do know that we need  to  start  raising  these  questions more  often.\n\nMr.  McGovern,  the  1972 Democratic presidential  candidate,  is president  of  the  Middle-Eastern Policy Council  in  Washington.\n\n(See  related  letters:  \"Letters  to the  Editor:  A Politician's  Dream  Is  a Businessman's  Nightmare\" -- WSJ July 2,  1992)",

In New York City, at 7 p.m. every evening, people throughout the city would open their windows, shouting and screaming and banging pots and pans to show gratitude to the essential workers - sanitation workers, police, firefighters, emergency responders, nurses and doctors. Of course, these workers were always essential, but I was hoping that spirit and civility would become deeply embedded and have longer lasting e/ffects in our society.\n\nI can understand when an individual for conscientious reasons chooses not to do work that helps our military. But I cannot understand when an entire company takes that position. How can we have a sense of shared sacrifice, when America is home to 18 million veterans who were willing to risk their lives for America's safety, and yet some companies are not even willing to use their fingertips to help?\n\nFor example, back in 1969 the cancellation of the Reserve O/fficers' Training Corps programs by the country's most prestigious universities and colleges likely fueled the great divide - between elites and others in our country - that persists today. Our strength as a nation is best served when the best students and the best soldiers are brought together, and we would all benefit from more civility and better teaching around basic virtues like hard work, shared sacrifice, justice, rationality and more respect for the enduring values of American freedom and free enterprise.\n\n## Resist being 'weaponized.'\n\nWe can start by trying to understand other people's and other voters' points of view, even around deeply emotional topics. We can stop insulting whole classes of voters. We can stop name calling. We can stop blame-shifting and scapegoating. We can stop being petty. Politicians can cease insulting, baiting and belittling each other, which diminishes them\n\nand the voter. It has also become too acceptable for some politicians to say one thing in private and deliver a completely di/fferent message in public. It would also be nice to see some cabinet members from the opposing party. We should also stop degrading and demonizing American business and American institutions, which are the best in the world, because it erodes confidence in our very country.\n\n## Social media could do more.\n\nThere is no question that social media has some real negative e/ffects, from the manipulation of elections to the increasingly documented negative e/ffects on the mental health of children. These are issues impacting our individual and collective spheres, and it's time for social media companies to take more action to remedy these challenges and swiftly. Rapid advances in technology will not only make these existing issues harder to address, but they will likely create new ones. The current state of the online information landscape has wide-ranging implications on trust in institutions, information integrity and more - and it bears on institutions like ours, where platform policy has increasingly widespread implications for concerns about fraud, security and other issue spaces.\n\nA range of tools and approaches is required to address this complex and important situation and there are several measures that platform companies can immediately enact, voluntarily, while strengthening and improving their business models. One commonsense and modest step would be for social media companies to further empower platform users' control over what they see and how it is presented, leveraging existing tools and features - like the alternative feed algorithm settings some o/ffer today. I believe many users (not just parents) would appreciate a greater ability to more carefully curate their feeds; for example, prioritizing educational content for their children.\n\nPlatforms could also consider enhanced authentication measures; i.e., having users identify themselves to the platform or to a trusted third party. This would have the virtue of increasing individual accountability and reducing imposters, bots and",

There are also legitimate questions as to whether authentication would be used as a tool to chill or block speech or quash bona fide political dissenters, and real work needs to be done to identify policy and technical solutions that balance such risks and benefits.\n\nI o/ffer these approaches as a starting place, understanding that it's crucial to continue honest conversation across sectors about the immediate, incremental improvements we can make to our online public square, considering the high stakes involved in how information is created and shared.\n\nE/ffective measures will require time, money, learning and improvement, all in service of significantly enhancing the well-being, quality, and civility of our experiences online and in the world around us.\n\n## Healthy collaboration with business is needed.\n\nCompanies big and small create jobs, pay for employee healthcare and benefits, and build bridges, roads and hospitals.

There are fewer individuals in government who have any significant experience in starting or running a company, which is apparent every day in the political rhetoric that demonizes businesses and free enterprise and that damages confidence in American's institutions. The relationship between business and government, in fact, might improve if there were more people from the business sector working in government. Inexperience\n\nwith business is also evident from the regular lack of transparency or curiosity from regulators as they develop economic policies with potentially seismic consequences for the economy.\n\nWhen I travel around the country, I experience a very di/fferent perspective on the street and at the local level - I see that many governors, mayors and city council members understand they are not facing big challenges alone. They stand shoulder to shoulder with our company, even when some of their constituents disagree or are skeptical about big banks. These government o/fficials know they need partners who have the same stake in helping successful communities thrive and who care about building a prosperous future as much as they do. For example, in fewer than 10 years, Detroit saw one of the greatest turnarounds because of a vibrant collaboration between government and business. And businesses know they cannot succeed if individuals, families, towns and cities are not flourishing. We obviously don't agree on everything, but there is a shared belief that we must work together. We can and should be full partners in developing solutions to our big problems.\n\n## The federal government, regardless of which party is in charge, needs to earn back trust through competence and e/ffective policymaking.\n\nThe world is becoming more complex, more technologically competent and faster. Unfortunately, the government simply is not built to innovate, compete and move quickly, as in the competitive business world. This may be the reason why government is becoming less e/ffective. We need to take action on this because the loss of trust in government is damaging to society. We should be brutally honest about the staggering number of policies, systems and operations that are underperforming: Too many ine/ffective public schools do not give students the skills they need to land a well-paying job; we have over 25 million uninsured Americans, soaring healthcare costs and too many bad outcomes; we are unable to plan, permit and build infrastructure e/fficiently; our litigation",

I'll stop here. This should be unacceptable to all of us.\n\n## We need to find a way to bring more varied expertise and accountability to government.\n\nWe should be more ambitious in striving for excellence in government. I acknowledge that some of the best and the brightest are in government and the military today. Yet we should return to a government that seeks out more of the best and the brightest people from every background , including the private sector, to benefit from their knowledge and experience. Government also needs to leverage the expertise of business to address problems that it cannot solve on its own. And to be fair, business could use its influence to do less to further its own interest and more to enhance the nation as a whole.\n\nWe need good government. And there are some things only governments can do, such as oversee the military and justice systems. And while most innovation happens through the private sector, there are certain types of foundational innovations that can only be advanced by the government, such as basic research that simply cannot be funded by business. The Democrats want the government to do even more and the Republicans even less - I think we should spend more time trying to do even better . But no one, not even my most liberal Democratic friends, thinks that sending the government another trillion a year would be a wise use of money.\n\n## OUT OF THE LABYRINTH, WITH FOCUS AND RESOLVE\n\nEven America, the most prosperous nation on the planet with its vast resources, needs to focus its resources on the complex and di/fficult tasks ahead.\n\nI hope to never read a book about How the West Was Lost, summarized as follows: The failure to save Ukraine and find peace in the Middle East led to more bickering among the allies and weakened military alliances. This accelerated a division within the Western world, splitting countries into di/fferent economic spheres and with each nation trying to protect its economy, trade and energy sources. America's economy weakened, eventually leading to the loss of its reserve currency status. Besotted by populism and partisanship and crippled by bureaucracy and lack of willpower, America failed to focus on what it needed to do to lead and save the Western world. The enemy was within - we just didn't see it in time.\n\nParaphrasing what Winston Churchill was thought to have said: America, after it had exhausted all other possibilities, would do the right thing.\n\nWhat I want and hope to see is a book about How the West Was Won . As the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East dragged on and as the fears of the Western world mounted, America rose to the challenge as it had in other turbulent times in history. America coalesced with its allies to form the alliances necessary to keep the world safe for freedom and democracy.\n\nI remain with a deep and abiding faith in the strength of the enduring values of America.",

        "page_content": "## WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN THE AMAZING POWER OF OUR FREEDOMS\n\nThe heart and soul of the dynamism of America is human freedom - freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment brought to us by our democracy through the right to elect our leaders. Free people are at liberty to move around as they see fit, work as they see fit, dream as they see fit, and invest in themselves and in the pursuit of happiness as they see fit. This freedom that people enjoy, accompanied by the freedom of capital, is what drives the dynamism - economic and social of this great country.\n\nOur civil liberties depend upon the rule of law, property rights, including intellectual property, and restrictions on government encroachment upon these freedoms. Our Constitution and Bill of Rights secure our individual freedoms and reserve all rights to the individual other than those important but limited authorities given to the government.\n\nThe issue of individual rights is not all or none or freedom versus no freedom. There are, of course, terrible examples where individual rights were trampled upon, and the results were devastating - both for the individual and for the economy - in East Germany, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, to name a few. And there are many countries that protect individual rights and are on a spectrum closer to American values. Think of Europe, for example. But even in some countries that have some of these rights, a lack of dynamism - often due to bureaucracy, weak institutions and government, and corruption - is palpable and has clearly led to less innovation, lower growth and, in general, a lower standard of living.\n\nFreedom must necessarily be joined with the principle of striving toward equal opportunity. Equal opportunity is what allows individuals to rise to the best of their ability - it also means unequal outcomes. Equal opportunity is the foundation for fairness and meritocracy. The fight for equality, which is a good moral goal, should not damage the rights of the individual and their liberties.\n\nDemocracy and freedom are cojoined - together, they make freedom more durable. Democracy also has a self-correcting element - every four years you get to throw out leadership if\n\nyou don't like them (which you do not see in autocracies). But we all know that democracy can be sloppy: Maintaining an e/ffective democracy is hard work. Democracy fosters open debate and compromise, which lead to better decisions over time (whether in government or in business). Intelligence is e/ffectively 'crowdsourced' with constant feedback. Good public policy comes from good debate and analytics, guided by reason coupled with a firm understanding of what you would like the outcomes to be and complemented with an honest assessment of what is really happening.\n\nEven democracies can become stagnant, bureaucratic and selfperpetuating. Good government does many admirable things, but admitting to mistakes is often not one of them. It takes civically engaged citizens and a strong free press to bring sunlight to issues and keep a nation strong.\n\nAutocratic societies by their nature subjugate the individual to the state. By definition they are not meritocracies - they are more about 'who you know,' and they exist to perpetuate the existing ruling class. Their decisions are based on a completely di/fferent calculation, and their decision-making process does not encourage and, therefore, benefit from open debate. Democracy means that it is immoral to subjugate individual freedoms to state actors other than to protect the existence of the nation itself.\n\nThere are values that many of us hold dear, such as religion, family and country. But none may be more important than the freedoms that allow us to choose to live our life as we see fit. We should do more to applaud the virtue and amazing power of our freedoms.",

        "page_content": "## HOW WE CAN HELP LIFT UP OUR LOW-INCOME CITIZENS AND MEND AMERICA'S TORN SOCIAL FABRIC\n\nTo fix problems, we must first acknowledge them. Despite decades of government programs and all the moralizing that surrounds them, we have not done a particularly good job lifting up our low-income fellow citizens. I may be wrong, but I do believe this is tearing at the social fabric of America and is among the root causes of the fraying of the American dream.\n\nThe gap between low-wage and well-paid workers has been growing dramatically. From 1979 to 2019, the wage growth of the top 10% was nearly 10 times that of the bottom 10% which, basically, had not increased at all. The growth of lowincome workers' annualized real wages after the pandemic was, for the first time in decades, higher than the top 60%, but that's not enough. The net worth for the bottom 25% of households is $20,800, and the net worth for the bottom 10% is essentially $0. This makes it increasingly di/fficult for lowwage workers to support their families. Of the 160 million Americans working today, approximately 40 million are paid less than $15 per hour.\n\nLow-income individuals bear far greater burdens than the rest of us. Nearly 40% of Americans don't have $400 in savings to deal with unexpected expenses, such as medical bills or car repairs, which leads to financial distress. More than 25 million Americans don't have medical insurance at all; of these, one in five are in a family with income below the federal poverty level. People who live in low-income neighborhoods also tend to have worse health outcomes, including higher rates of mental health issues, depression and suicide, and a lower life expectancy - as many as 20 years. Finally, low-income Americans generally experience higher unemployment and more crime.\n\nNo one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being o/ffered to all Americans through our education systems. Students in the lowest socioeconomic bracket are 50% less likely to attend college than those in the highest socioeconomic groups. Many inner city schools graduate under 50% of their students - and even those who graduate may not be wellprepared for the workforce. In addition, boys growing up in the bottom 10% of family income are 20 times more likely to be\n\nincarcerated. Those who do run afoul of our justice system generally do not get the second chance that many of them deserve. Their exclusion from the workforce is not only unfair to them but also results in an estimated $87 billion average annual cost to the economy.\n\nToo many policies that are wrong - a/ffecting housing and mortgage markets, healthcare, immigration, regulation, education and student lending, to name a few - are jeopardizing the opportunity for American citizens to succeed. The people who su/ffer the most, throughout all of this, are not high-income individuals. I strongly believe that these outcomes are destroying the concept of 'fair' in America and are driving populism and diminishing, if not eliminating, trust - not only in government but in all our institutions. Simply put, the social needs of far too many of our citizens are not being met. We should never accept these outcomes - we must fix them.\n\nThere are two policy changes that I believe can have a dramatic e/ffect on jobs, growth and equality - and they go a long way toward repairing the frayed American dream. Let's start by treating all jobs with respect. Even starter jobs, which are the first rung on the ladder of opportunity, bring dignity and create better social outcomes in terms of health, higher household formation and lower crime. Of these two policy changes, one would better utilize existing resources, and the other would cost some money. But both would significantly change outcomes for low-income Americans.\n\nThe free one is so blindingly obvious that it's almost embarrassing to propose. Our schools (high schools, community colleges and perhaps even four-year colleges) should take responsibility for outcomes - they should be judged on the quality and income level of the jobs that their graduates and even non-graduates attain. This means providing graduating students and other individuals with work skills (in fields such as advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and technology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to better paying jobs. These schools should work with local businesses to replicate e/ffective programs that are in place - because that is where the actual jobs are now. This would be good for growth and, as there are so many examples of successful programs, we",

        "page_content": "already know what to do. With nearly 9 million job openings and just under 6 million unemployed workers in the United States, job skills training has never been needed more. We already spend a tremendous amount of money on education just not the right way.\n\nThe second step is related to the first: Get more income to lowpaid workers. While this one would cost money, it is to me a complete no-brainer since it is an expansion of an existing program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many Democrats and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the EITC supplements low- to moderate-income working individuals and couples, particularly with children and people living in rural areas. For example, a single mother with two children earning $9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of more than $6,000 at year-end. Workers without children receive a very small tax credit (96% of all EITC dollars were received by families with children). This should be dramatically expanded, including eliminating the child requirement from the calculation altogether. We should convert the EITC to make it more like a negative income payroll tax, paid monthly. Any tax credit income should not be o/ffset by any other benefits these individuals already receive (we have to eliminate benefit 'cli/ffs' that disincentivize work).\n\nAn increase in the EITC to a maximum of $10,000 would cost tens of billions a year, but I have little doubt that these policy changes would do more than anything else to lift up lowincome families and their communities. Well-paying jobs have been shown to reduce crime, increase household formation, improve health and reduce addiction. Both of these policies would have the virtue of increasing the number of people in the workforce. I also have little doubt that this would add to GDP.\n\nWe should attack all our other problems as well, but these two policy changes alone would dramatically improve our lowincome neighborhoods, broadly strengthen the economy and give more opportunity to deserving citizens. It would restore the American Dream for many.",

        "page_content": "## Consumer & Community Banking\n\nI'm very proud to have co-led Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) for the past three years and am grateful to Jenn Piepszak for her partnership. When we took over this leading franchise, we established a strategic framework for continued, long-term success, and that framework guided CCB to deliver strong performance again in 2023. The evolving macro landscape means uncertainty on many fronts: the financial health of the consumer, the path of credit and interest rates, and the impact of new regulations. While the future will bring challenges, it will also create opportunities, and we've proved our ability to adapt and optimize.\n\nIn 2023, we remained focused on a consistent set of strategic priorities:\n\n- \u00b7  Growing and deepening relationships by:\n- - Engaging customers with products and services they love and\n- - Expanding our distribution\n\n## 2019 TO 2023 GROWTH\n\nCONSUMER BANKING\n\nCUSTOMERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCREDIT CARD\n\nACTIVE ACCOUNTS\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Delivering financial performance that is consistently best-in-class.\n- \u00b7  Leveraging data and technology to deliver customer value and drive speed to market.\n- \u00b7  Protecting our customers and the firm through a strong risk and controls environment.\n- \u00b7  Cultivating talent to build highperforming, diverse teams where culture is a competitive advantage.\n\nOur strategy is working as evidenced by our results last year.\n\n## GROWING AND DEEPENING RELATIONSHIPS\n\nAfter the pandemic, we accelerated the pace of customer acquisition while lowering attrition. Maintaining that momentum, we now serve over 82 million consumers and 6.4 million small businesses, up 11% and 37%, respectively, since 2019. We're driving that growth across businesses during the same period, Consumer Bank-\n\ning customers are up 18%, Business Banking clients are up 41% and Card accounts are up 30% 1 .\n\nWe're engaging customers with our products and services and delivering seamless experiences across digital and branch channels. Our digital banking platform grew to nearly 67 million active customers, up 28% since 2019. Once customers begin to use Chase.com and the Chase mobile app, we make it easy to help them save for the future, make small or big purchases (including a car or home), plan for retirement or a dream vacation, or find the perfect restaurant for a night on the town.\n\nOur branches remain a critical touchpoint as over 900,000 people walk into one every day. We know being local matters and that customers increasingly value personal interaction and advice. In 2023, over 2 million more customers met with a banker than in 2022.\n\nOnce we onboard a customer to the franchise, we focus on earning the right to deepen that relationship and serve more of their financial needs. Last year was a banner year for deepening as we ended 2023 with over 24 million multi-line of business (LOB) customers - up 9% from 2022 and 30% from 2019 3 . We have prioritized growing multi-LOB relationships as it helps us address more of our customers' needs while driving higher retention and engagement with our products and services. We constantly focus on improving the customer experience, which we measure in many ways. We're proud to have all-time-high satisfaction\n\n- 1 Defined as average sales debit active accounts.\n- 2 Unique families with primary and joint account owners for open and funded accounts.\n- 3 Reflects consumers and small businesses that have relationships with two or more CCB lines of business.",

Customer attrition is below historic levels, and CCB's overall net promoter score remains very healthy.\n\n## DELIVERING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT IS CONSISTENTLY BEST-IN-CLASS\n\nWhile we recognize that favorable macro conditions contributed to overearning in net interest income and credit, we still outperformed as we delivered strong returns and grew market share across businesses. With a 38% return on equity, we exceeded our 25% target for the third straight year and would have done so even when normalized to reflect through-the-cycle credit and rate assumptions. Net income was $21.2 billion, up 42% over 2022. Revenue of $70.1 billion was up 28% from 2022, and CCB's overhead ratio was 50%. Average deposits were $1.1 trillion, and although down 3% from 2022, we outperformed the industry average. Average loans were up 20% over the prior year to $526 billion, including the First Republic acquisition.\n\n## EXTENDING OUR #1 POSITION ACROSS INDUSTRY-LEADING BUSINESSES\n\nOur momentum is driven by successful execution across all lines of business in CCB. We're the clear market leader in Consumer Banking, Business Banking and Card and continue to grow.\n\n## Consumer Banking\n\nWe extended our #1 position in 2023 with an 11.3% deposit market share, up 40 basis points from 2022. Excluding First Republic, share growth was up 10 basis points. Since 2019, we've increased our share by 220 basis points. We'll continue to drive growth by expanding branches and evolving products to meet customer needs by segment.\n\nBranches remain the hub for our local team of experts - over 50,000 bankers, advisors and business relationship managers - and a key distribution channel for all parts of the firm. We continue to optimize our network of over 4,800 branches as we aim to be within a 10-minute drive for 70% of the U.S. population. This will help us grow share in major metropolitan areas like Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., as well as states with mostly rural populations such as Alabama and Iowa, where we are also expanding our presence.\n\nWe've added more than 650 new branches in the last five years, by far the most of any bank in the U.S. We're doubling down on that investment and will add 500+ branches over the next three years. The result is a significantly younger branch network, which creates embedded growth that already has driven share gains and will continue to do so for years to come. Newer or 'unseasoned' branches represent more than $150 billion in incremental deposit upside as they mature. At the same time, we are consolidating older branches in certain markets in response to shifting customer behavior.\n\nWe aim to be the bank for all, so tailoring products, services and experiences for each customer segment and community is central to our strategy. We're increasingly focused on supporting the financial health of customers and communities through digital and in-person resources, such as our nearly 150 dedicated Community Managers. We now have 16 Community Center branches and plan to open three more in 2024.\n\nWe started 2023 with a goal of maintaining primary bank relationships and capturing money in motion, and we did both. We retained over 95% of our primary bank customers and succeeded in deep-\n\nening with investments and an enhanced, higher-yield product set - including competitive-rate CDs and the new J.P. Morgan Premium Deposit account. As a result, we successfully captured more than 80% of yield-seeking flows in 2023.\n\n## Business Banking\n\nWe o/ffer small business owners a comprehensive product suite to help them start, run and grow their businesses. We're #1 in small business primary bank share with 9.5% of a fragmented market and plan to grow by:\n\n- \u00b7  Increasing banker capacity to better cover large clients, which drives higher retention, cross-product deepening and client satisfaction. In 2023, we added more than 350 bankers against our target of 1,000 incremental bankers.\n- \u00b7  Rolling out value-added services like payroll, broadening our payment acceptance suite with new o/fferings such as invoicing (currently in pilot) and launching Tap-to-Pay, which enables merchants to accept card payments on their mobile devices.\n- \u00b7  Continuing to expand support for small business owners in underserved communities through special purpose credit programs, one-on-one mentoring and local events.\n\n## Card\n\nIn 2023, we extended our #1 position in credit card, with sales and outstandings market share up approximately 50 and 30 basis points, respectively, compared with 2019 4 .\n\nWe drove growth by leveraging our marketing capabilities to get the right products in the right customers' hands. In 2023, we invested nearly $7 billion in\n\n- 4  Card outstandings market share has been revised to reflect a restatement to the 2022 reported total industry outstandings disclosed by Nilson, which impacted annual share growth in 2023.",

These businesses are natural adjacencies to banking and credit card, with scale and distribution that will fuel their growth.\n\n## Connected Commerce\n\nWe continue building out a powerful twosided platform to connect Chase customers with top brands, helping them book travel, discover new dining experiences and save money while shopping. We expect to drive approximately $30 billion in volume and about $2 billion in revenue through the platform in 2025. We've nearly doubled volume over two years, driving more than $18 billion in 2023. Going forward, we're focused on:\n\n- \u00b7  Scaling Travel. We are a top 5 consumer leisure travel provider with $10 billion in booked volume last year, up more than 25% from 2022. We've just relaunched ChaseTravel.com to help customers dream, discover and book travel, including a new collection of more than 600 of the world's finest hotels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#1\n\n#1 U.S. credit card issuer based on sales and outstandings 4\n\n- \u00b7  Expanding Shopping through Chase O/ffers. In 2023, we generated more than $8 billion in attributed spend volume, up over 30% from 2022. We're accelerating growth by launching Chase Media Solutions SM , a new digital media business aimed at merchants that allows them to target and connect with Chase customers.\n- \u00b7  Innovating payments and lending capabilities. To provide customers with innovative, convenient ways to pay and borrow, last year we began to roll out Pay in 4 SM , which has scaled to more than 20 million customers. We also saw more than 50% year-over-year growth in card-linked installment originations through My Chase Plan\u00ae.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nIn 2023, we grew client investment assets by 25% to $800 billion before accounting for the First Republic acquisition. In total, we ended the year with $950 billion in assets, up $450 billion since 2019, as we close in on our goal of reaching $1 trillion in assets under supervision. We now have 2.5 million client relationships - up 60% from 2019 - with a record 120,000 firsttime investors in 2023.\n\nThis momentum stems from the investments we've made in products, channels and talent in the last four years since we established J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. In 2023, we:\n\n- \u00b7  Added more than 400 total advisors, ending the year with nearly 5,500 on a path to 6,000.\n- \u00b7  Scaled Wealth Plan, an omnichannel financial planning experience that customers start digitally and can finish with an advisor. Customers have created more than 1 million financial plans since the experience launched in December 2022.",

Given the cyclical nature of both businesses, we manage returns on a through-the-cycle basis.\n\nDespite recent market headwinds, Auto and Home Lending delivered a return on equity of 17% and 15%, respectively, averaged over the last five years 6 . While the acquisition of First Republic's mortgage portfolio helped bolster Home Lending returns last year, CCB's mortgage business was key to enabling the transaction.\n\nAcross both businesses, we continue to leverage data and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled techniques to enhance and optimize our underwriting and credit decisioning.\n\nWe also remain committed to increasing homeownership among underserved communities. Our Chase Homebuyer Grant program has scaled to over 15,000 communities since its launch in 2021, and we recently increased the grant amount to $7,500 in select markets.\n\n## LEVERAGING DATA AND TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER CUSTOMER VALUE AND DRIVE SPEED TO MARKET\n\nData and technology make everything we do better - our products, channels and experiences. In 2023, CCB spent over $3 billion on technology investments spanning both product development and modernization.\n\nA little over half of our annual investment is focused on product development, helping ensure we have the best products,\n\nservices and channels to meet customers' evolving needs. From paying a bill and checking a balance to replacing a card and disputing a transaction, we're making processes more seamless, taking friction out of customers' everyday financial lives. At the same time, customers are increasingly engaging with our advice-oriented digital and omnichannel experiences to meet their more complex needs, like buying a home or planning for retirement. Engaged online activity - beyond viewing balances - is up 25% since 2019.\n\nThe rest of our technology investment is focused on modernization, which is both o/ffensive and defensive. We need to deliver new products and experiences more quickly while executing with resiliency at massive scale to stay competitive and avoid being disrupted. We've made significant progress and are on track to substantially complete data center migration by the end of 2024. We've also migrated almost 90% of our data to the public cloud. Looking ahead, we'll continue to focus on modernizing our core banking infrastructure, which will enable us to launch products faster, improve platform stability and reduce run-thebank expenses over time.\n\nOur data migration e/fforts help us take full advantage of our extraordinary data assets to deliver personalization at scale and accelerate existing and future AI initiatives. We've been using AI for years and have a strong foundation in place. Initially, we focused on using AI to drive cost reduction and risk avoidance, but we've pivoted to focus more on revenue growth. We'll continue to invest where we will realize the greatest benefit, including:\n\n- \u00b7  Optimizing marketing e/fforts to better target profitable prospects.\n- \u00b7  Identifying unmet customer needs, then addressing them in the moment with digital nudges and personalized o/ffers.\n- \u00b7  Increasing the productivity and e/fficiency of our sales force through lead management and propensity models.\n- \u00b7  Predicting in real time the likelihood of fraud to better protect customers and the firm.\n- \u00b7  Supporting specialists with AI advancements like call prediction, real-time insights and intelligent routing to drive customer and employee satisfaction.\n\n## PROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE FIRM\n\nRisk management is core to our culture and a key competitive advantage, helping us build trust and providing security to customers. We are focused on protecting shareholders, customers and the firm by maintaining our fortress balance sheet, strong controls environment and throughthe-cycle decision-making approach.\n\n## CULTIVATING TALENT\n\nThe work we do matters to customers, communities and the economy overall. Our goal is always to attract and retain great talent and create a culture where everyone's voice matters. We help employees build a long-term career at the firm and have a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. Our high-performance culture rewards the hard work, heart and humanity that our more than 140,000 employees deliver every day. All of this leads to the best business outcomes.\n\n## ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC\n\nIn the midst of widespread instability in the banking sector, it was the strength and breadth of our franchise and the dedication of thousands of employees that enabled us to complete the acquisition of virtually all of First Republic's assets in one weekend.\n\nWe had long admired First Republic's capabilities and culture of client service, which complement our existing a/ffluent",

        "page_content": "strategy. We already serve customers across the wealth spectrum, but the acquisition will help us deepen relationships with the a/ffluent segment. In 2023, we prioritized stabilizing First Republic's existing business. We retained the vast majority of customers, and deposits have increased approximately 20% since the acquisition. While we are on track against key integration milestones, 2024 will be critical as we aim to largely complete integration e/fforts by year-end.\n\n## 2024 LOOK AHEAD\n\n## Macro factors\n\nThe macro environment going forward will likely look very di/fferent from 2023. While we anticipate the Federal Reserve will lower rates this year, the trajectory is still uncertain. Lower rates will be a headwind for deposit margins but a tailwind for businesses such as Home Lending. The diversification of our franchise provides natural o/ffsets and hedges and creates resiliency in earnings and performance.\n\nWe are rigorous in monitoring our portfolios at a granular level using multiple data sources to assess direct risk and the overall health of consumers and small businesses. Based on what we're seeing, consumers and small businesses both still remain generally healthy. Although consumers have largely spent the excess cash reserves built up from the fiscal response to the pandemic, balance sheets remain strong. Spending on a per account basis is largely flat year-overyear. Delinquencies played out as expected in 2023, and credit card losses should fully normalize later this year.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nThe banking industry is facing an unprecedented barrage of untested and unstudied proposed regulations and legislation targeting multiple aspects of our business. The combined impact of all of these - Basel III, Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees), overdraft and late fee changes, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Sections 1033 and 1071, and the Credit Card Competition Act - will meaningfully disrupt the economics of consumer financial products and services. This level of intervention will lead to some combination of the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Fewer financial products and services available, and the remaining ones will become more expensive and harder to access, especially for lower-income consumers.\n- \u00b7  Less investment and innovation in the financial services industry, leading to an erosion of the customer experience.\n- \u00b7  More consolidation across the industry, which will limit consumer choice.\n- \u00b7  More financial activity handled by nonbanks outside of the regulatory perimeter, increasing risk for consumers.\n\nOf course, we will comply with the final rules and regulations and are relatively well-positioned to do so. However, consumers and small businesses will likely bear the largest burden.\n\n## Our hand\n\nWe continue to operate from a position of strength with a relentless focus on the customer, a proven strategy and the best team. We recognize headwinds on the horizon and will adapt accordingly, taking\n\n- a through-the-cycle approach to managing our business. Moving forward, we'll continue to:\n- \u00b7  Execute with excellence and a focus on e/fficiency and flexibility as the environment around us changes.\n- \u00b7  Engage with regulators on how current proposals will negatively impact consumers and the industry.\n- \u00b7  Reshape our business where necessary in response to new regulations, balancing impacts to shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.\n\nI remain very confident about the future of our franchise, yet approach the opportunities and challenges we'll face with great humility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarianne Lake\n\nCEO, Consumer & Community Banking",

        "page_content": "## Commercial & Investment Bank\n\nWhen Jamie asked me to lead a new organization 12 years ago, I was thrilled. The firm was combining its traditional Investment Bank with the Treasury & Securities Services division.\n\nThe rationale was clear. The merger would create a massive franchise encompassing the industry's most diverse and comprehensive solutions for the world's largest and most prominent companies, governments and institutions. From capital raising and M&A advice to payments, trading and custody, the combined franchise would enable us to deliver a full range of products and solutions to clients around the world.\n\nAs others retrenched, we believed growth would come from being global and diversified, having scale and providing a complete client o/ffering. So we merged two divisions, identified gaps and invested in global capabilities. To this day, I believe the decisions we made then set us up for the success that we've had for the last decade. The proof is in the revenue, returns, rankings and market share that we've discussed with you over the years.\n\nThis January, we announced the latest evolution of our corporate structure by merging two divisions once again: Commercial Banking (CB) with the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB).\n\nAs we integrate these top-notch franchises, I am delighted to hand the keys of this incredible organization to Jenn Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh. They are exceptional leaders in every way, and I know they will continue to work hard each day, leading our employees and serving our clients with heart, integrity and excellence.\n\nI am equally thrilled to spend more of my time in my role as President and Chief Operating O/fficer, helping Jamie with firmwide, strategic priorities that will provide growth and opportunities for years to come.\n\nMy focus will be on driving synergies across our lines of business, accelerating our investments in growth and innovation, and optimizing our resources across the firm. Priorities include harnessing data and modernizing our technology infrastructure so we can apply artificial intelligence (AI) to our businesses. This will help identify e/fficiencies and areas of opportunity. I also want to make sure we continue to manage and deploy capital in ways that best serve our clients, particularly when they need it most.\n\nIn 2023, we made significant strides in key areas:\n\nIn March, teams across our Consumer Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking and Investment Banking businesses joined forces to deliver the firm's full support to the venture ecosystem in the aftermath of the regional banking turmoil. We are now exploring new ways to better serve this community, including tapping opportunities in the booming private markets so that we can compete e/ffectively in this rapidly evolving area.\n\nOur payments capabilities also continue to strengthen and advance as we prioritize innovation and resiliency. We are unique in that we can compete with fintechs on customer experience and digital solutions while also o/ffering the stability, expansive network and services of a global bank.\n\nTechnology is reshaping the financial services landscape, and we are channeling its transformative power. Among our e/fforts, we are already using AI to onboard customers faster, combat fraud and serve up more insights to clients.\n\nWe are pushing into new markets both at home and internationally. Whether it's growing our presence in emerging markets, deepening our relationships with multinational corporations, or expanding our U.S. branch network and wealth management business, our strategy is guided by a commitment to clients, communities and long-term value creation.\n\nThe leadership positions we have today are the result of hard work and investment over many years. We know also how hard it is to stay ahead of the pack. My promise to you, our shareholders, is that we will not be complacent. We will stay humble and hungry and strive always to be the best, most respected financial firm in the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDaniel E.

        "page_content": "In January 2024, we announced an exciting new chapter in our decade-long growth story.\n\nThe decision to bring together the firm's major wholesale businesses to form the Commercial & Investment Bank continues a journey we have been on for a while as we seek to better support clients from their early stages of growth through to international expansion, acquisitions and beyond.\n\nThe new combined business has the scale, business diversity and financial firepower to o/ffer complete solutions across banking, trading, payments and custody to middle market businesses, global companies and governments in more than 100 markets.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Daniel Pinto, who built the Corporate & Investment Bank over the last 12 years with leadership positions across products and regions 1,2 . In his time as CEO, the CIB grew revenue from $34 billion in 2011 to $49 billion in 2023 and increased net income by more than 75% during the same period, and its Investment Banking and Markets businesses have been #1 franchises for over a decade 1,2 .\n\nIt is a privilege to lead this remarkable business, and we are thrilled about the opportunities still to come. But let us first reflect on the key events and highlights of our performance in 2023.\n\n## OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2023\n\nIn 2023, the CIB generated net income of $14 billion on $49 billion in revenue, mirroring 2022's solid performance but down from 2021's record highs. Strong trading results and record years for our deposittaking businesses cushioned the impact of industrywide weakness in investment banking activity, underscoring the benefits of our diversified business model.\n\nThe year included central banks hiking rates at the fastest pace in decades, a second year of war in Ukraine and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, the collapse of several U.S. regional banks and recession in parts of Europe. Throughout, J.P. Morgan o/ffered its expertise and balance sheet, helping companies, financial institutions and governments weather the storm.\n\nDuring the regional bank turmoil and resulting economic stress, the firm helped shore up the financial system and the economy, stepping in with billions of dollars in liquidity to help banks, their clients and investors navigate the crisis. This was complemented by the firm helping to raise $155 billion for financial institutions in 2023.\n\nWorldwide investment banking activity was hit by the uncertain economic outlook and market conditions. Industrywide fees shrank to a 10-year low 1 , and dealmaking remained subdued, causing our own investment banking revenue to dip slightly, to $6.2 billion from $6.5 billion in 2022. Even so, the business maintained its #1 ranking in global investment banking fees with a wallet share of 8.8% 1 . We also ranked #1 in debt capital markets, #2 in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and rose to #1 in equity capital markets 1 .\n\nOur M&A franchise advised on nearly 350 deals totaling more than $700 billion in volume 1 , including some of the year's largest announced transactions: the $42 billion separation of Johnson & Johnson's consumer health business, agricultural supplier Viterra's $17 billion merger with U.S. oilseed and grain processor Bunge, and sandwich chain Subway's $10 billion sale to Roark Capital, one of the biggest transactions in fast food history.\n\nA decline in M&A dealmaking and the higher interest rate environment led to subdued debt capital markets and a drop in our debt underwriting fees to $2.6 billion in 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in 2022. A standout deal was the $31 billion bond deal for Pfizer to fund its acquisition of cancer drug pioneer Seagen, in which the firm had a lead role.\n\nIn 2023, our equity underwriting fees were up 11% compared with 2022, and we gained market share year-over-year 1 . While market uncertainty dented confidence in initial public o/fferings (IPO), the franchise led two of the year's biggest o/fferings, including the $5 billion IPO of British chip designer Arm Holdings and consumer health company Kenvue's $4 billion debut.\n\nIt was another strong year for our Markets business, which generated $28 billion in revenue. Some of the uncertainty that plagued investment banking activity kept trading desks busy as clients hedged and positioned themselves accordingly. Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 1% from 2022, driven by the Securitized Products Group and Credit, mainly o/ffset by normalization in Currencies & Emerging Markets, while Equity Markets revenue dipped after a relatively strong performance in 2022.\n\nClients also voted J.P. Morgan the #1 global research firm in Institutional Investor 's annual survey for the fourth year in a row. Our analysis of economies and markets, including research on some 5,200 companies across more than 80 countries, is particularly sought after during turbulent times.\n\nCIB Payments reported a record $9.3 billion in revenue in 2023, up from $7.6 billion in 2022, as it benefited from the higher interest rate environment.",

Sitting adjacent to the industry's largest Markets business, it provides post-trade services to institutional asset-manager and asset-owner clients, providing safekeeping, settlement and related services for securities in approximately 100 markets around the world. Since the CIB was formed in 2012, the Securities Services business has nearly doubled assets under custody from $17 trillion at the end of 2011 to $32 trillion at the end of 2023 3 . In recent years, investments in technology have enhanced the scale and resiliency of its platforms, enabling the business to grow revenue and secure major new mandates.\n\n## SIZING UP THE OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD\n\nJ.P.

The completeness of our products and services, talent, ongoing investments in digital technology and tools, client focus and fortress balance sheet have given the CIB strong share positions across almost all areas 1,2 .\n\nWe are not complacent about these leadership positions. The competitive landscape for our businesses is intensifying, driven by both traditional banks as well as further growth of nonbank financial institutions. Core to our strategy is looking very closely at all areas of the business and pinpointing where there are weaknesses and opportunities to grow.\n\nHere are some of our target areas:\n\n## The benefits of integration\n\nThis year we are integrating our major wholesale businesses Commercial Banking and the Corporate & Investment Bank.

In 2023, over $3 billion in gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue 6 and more than $8 billion in firmwide Payments revenue, almost half, came from Commercial Banking clients 7 . With our extensive footprint in the middle market, combined with our Investment Banking franchise, we are uniquely positioned to support middle market clients as they grow in size and complexity.\n\nAt the same time, our biggest multinational and asset manager clients are navigating an increasingly complex set of challenges and need a banking partner with the scale, global reach and full-service o/ffering to resolve them. With employees around the world supporting clients in more than 100 countries, the newly enlarged business is among the most complete institutional client franchises in the industry. Wherever companies are on their growth journey, the newly combined business will have the resources and coverage to help.\n\n## Trading at scale\n\nOur trading business operates at huge scale.\n\nIn 2023, in the U.S. alone, it handled more than 42 billion client orders and helped investors buy and sell nearly $11 trillion in 12,000 equity securities.\n\nOur strategy of being a complete counterparty is paying o/ff, with our biggest institutional clients choosing to do more business with us. Accordingly, the bank's share of the institutional client wallet has grown from 11.1% in 2018 to 13.9% in 2023 8 .\n\nBeing there for clients in all markets and conditions, however, demands a significant amount of capital. Although this is a headwind, the business continues to provide solid returns, and we remain focused on the disciplined allocation of capital while preparing for updated U.S. capital requirements.\n\n## PAYMENTS AND SECURITIES SERVICES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6   Includes gross revenues earned by the firm that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement between CB and the CIB for Investment Banking and Markets products sold to CB clients. This includes revenues related to fixed income and equity markets products.

We are investing to enhance the trading experience for clients across the life cycle of their trades, from onboarding to pretrade services like research, execution, post-trade settlement and data services.\n\nWe are investing heavily in the electronification of our credit business, bringing across some of the technology and approach behind our Equities business. Among other initiatives in 2023, J.P. Morgan launched a new algorithmic trading o/ffering to U.S. Treasury investors to capture share in the world's most important bond market.\n\n## Private capital markets\n\nPrivate markets - both credit and equity - have grown significantly over the past decade. The private credit market has grown nearly fourfold over the last 10 years to more than $1.6 trillion 9 , while money raised in venture capital and private equity growth deals has more than doubled over the same period 10 .\n\nOur borrower and investor clients are on both sides of this growth, and we are well-positioned to serve the full range of their needs. We are growing our solutionagnostic credit strategy, deploying balance sheet where it makes sense for direct lending, in addition to our existing financing and structured solutions. We are also enhancing our o/ffering for asset managers and financial sponsors looking to deploy capital. As the private markets continue to evolve, we will remain a significant player with a goal of providing clients with a full range of financing options.",

In the past, these e/fforts were led largely by Commercial Banking. With our new combined franchise, we can now better serve this dynamic, fastgrowing client base. We want to make clients-for-life out of the legions of tech companies and their founders by supporting them from the earliest stages of growth up to IPO and beyond.\n\n## Capital for the climate\n\nIn 2023, we continued to help clients with their sustainability goals as well as scaling green solutions. Since 2021, the CIB has financed and facilitated $230 billion for green activities toward our firmwide target of $1 trillion by 2030, primarily by supporting clients with green bond underwriting and financing for renewable and clean energy. From financing and capital raising to strategic advice, we are working closely with clients across industries as they aim to meet their own long-term sustainability targets.\n\n## Investing for the future\n\nWe are investing to scale and enhance the resiliency of our core platforms and are pioneering new technologies to move faster and improve the client experience.\n\nAcross the business, we are exploring use cases for artificial intelligence. In Markets, our AI-powered Client Intelligence platform is starting to use data from across the business to create recommendations based on client interactions, and our Prime Finance team is harnessing AI to better manage the inventory of securities we have on hand for clients while optimizing our balance sheet for capital e/fficiency. Elsewhere, AI has improved the onboard-\n\ning experience for clients, speeding up and improving the accuracy of our Know Your Customer procedures, while in Investment Banking, the technology is helping coverage teams to pinpoint when companies might need to tap the equity markets.\n\nOur Payments business moves nearly $10 trillion 13 each day, with capabilities to send payments in more than 120 currencies across 160 countries. We are futureproofing its platforms and investing to help businesses across industries, such as healthcare and e-commerce accept and make payments more seamlessly. In Securities Services, an increasing focus is to provide better data services to help investor clients improve the performance of their portfolios and the operational e/fficiency of their businesses. In 2023, we launched the first commercial o/fferings on our Fusion platform, giving clients access to their custody, fund accounting and middle o/ffice data via API or the cloud. We also rolled out a tool that helps clients gather, cleanse and organize ESG data from di/fferent sources.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nThe start of 2024 has brought some early encouraging signs for investment banking activity but a more mixed outlook for our Markets business.\n\nSeveral risks remain. Economies are still adjusting to life after the pandemic and the injection of trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus; geopolitical challenges continue to flare; and the competitive threat is intensifying. The outcome of these is inherently unknown - they could provide both headwinds and opportunities for our business.\n\nThe consistent returns created by the scale and diversity of our franchise allow us to keep investing through economic cycles.\n\nWe are global with capabilities at scale, and now combined with Commercial Banking, we have the ability to become even more client-centric.\n\nOur products, services and reach coupled with incredible people and our winning culture make us especially hopeful about the future of our business.\n\nIt is an honor for both of us to lead this world-class franchise, and we are excited for the opportunities in front of us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJennifer Piepszak\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCo-CEO, Commercial & Investment Bank\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTroy Rohrbaugh Co-CEO, Commercial & Investment Bank\n\n<!-- image -->",

Morgan shines even brighter as a port in the storm - and 2023 was no exception. The U.S. regional banking crises served as a stark reminder that banking and lending are not to be treated as a commodity.

This exceptional investment performance is an outcome of decades of refinement and involves close to 1,300 investment professionals along with one of the industry's largest research budgets, which enables us to actively cover nearly 2,500 public companies, with over 5,000 company visits annually.

For a sovereign wealth fund or a first-time individual investor, investing is deeply nuanced in terms of volatility tolerances, income and distribution requirements, taxes, preferences and passions. The proprietary technologies we gained from our acquisitions of 55ip and OpenInvest, for example, enable us to combine over 600 di/fferent investment strategies to create highly customized portfolios in a smart, e/fficient way. We know our clients have a choice - not only in managers and investment styles but also in preferences around sectors or tilts and, where appropriate, in a taxoptimized way. We do not believe it is\n\nJ.P. Morgan's job to tell clients what to include or exclude inside their portfolio sectors or stock selection. Instead, we empower clients to guide us and drive their own decisions.\n\nAnd because preferences are often personal in nature, we are steadfast in focusing our stewardship on voting matters that maximize long-term shareholder value and good governance. With the increased prevalence of outsourcing proxy voting, by the end of 2024, generally we will have eliminated third-party proxy advisor voting recommendations from our internally developed voting systems. We believe these enhancements will allow companies to better understand our independent rationale regarding voting issues.\n\n## INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE\n\n## Active ETFs and SMAs\n\nInnovation forms the core of our business. Having launched our active exchange-traded fund (ETF) platform less than 10 years ago, we have emerged as a global leader - ranking #2 in AUM and net flows, led by having the #1, #3 and #5 largest actively managed ETFs\n\n## GLOBAL ACTIVE ETF RANKING\n\n|   No. | Fund Name                                 | Ticker   | Total Assets   |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|\n|     1 | JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF        | JEPI     | $32.8          |\n|     2 | Dimensional US Core Equity 2 ETF          | DFAC     | $26.1          |\n|     3 | JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF           | JPST     | $22.5          |\n|     4 | PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF  | MINT     | $10.8          |\n|     5 | JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF | JEPQ     | $10.8          |\n\n- ($ in billions)\n\nSource: Morningstar as of February 29, 2024, excludes GBTC",

We persist in our e/fforts to innovate, expanding our o/fferings by launching 17 new solutions (12 U.S. and five UCITS) in the past year. We are equally enthusiastic about our separately managed account (SMA) platform. Acquiring 55ip enabled us to provide our clients with improved tax management and portfolio customization, and our clients now have greater control over their investments and taxes. Since the acquisition, our AUM increased 16-fold in this area.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nAs a top 10 manager and investor, with more than $400 billion in assets and a 60-year legacy, we continue to invest in scaling and expanding our alternatives capabilities across private equity, hedge funds, private credit, real estate and infrastructure. After launching J.P. Morgan Private Capital two years ago, we successfully introduced technology, consumer and life sciences strategies. As access to alternatives continues to widen, we launched J.P. Morgan Real Estate Income Trust (JPMREIT) and JPMorgan Private Markets Fund (JPMF), which is one of the industry's first private equity funds available to individual investors. Overall, alternatives across AWM continue to grow.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nGlobal Shares, a share plan administrator of both public and private companies around the world, is one of our most recent acquisitions. As we build out our broader J.P. Morgan Workplace o/ffering, we are leveraging Global Shares as the foundation to help new companies accelerate growth and encourage employees and owners to invest. With plan participants from over 100 countries, the number continues to grow - up 15% this past year. Just as impressive, client assets are up\n\n32% since the acquisition. We also completed the acquisition of China International Fund Management (CIFM), rebranding it as J.P. Morgan Asset Management (China). We commemorated this pivotal rebrand by moving 400 new onshore colleagues into Shanghai Tower. This served not only as a celebration but also as a testament to our shared heritage, global strengths and deep-rooted expertise in the local market, as J.P. Morgan's history in China dates back more than 100 years.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management (China)'s headquarters in the heart of downtown Shanghai.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A rigorously controlled environment\n\nTo ensure scalable growth, we are committed to operational excellence from enhancing trades, client transactions and money movement to simplifying interactions and implementing robust controls and safeguards. Some of these e/fforts are being further enhanced using AI to streamline our processes, manage risk and make informed decisions to protect our clients. Additionally, these investments in our infrastructure help us - as fiduciaries - perform optimized stress testing of client portfolios on a consistent basis.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nAs I have said from the beginning of my tenure as CEO of AWM, our focus is on being the best in the industry, not the biggest. And by best, I mean the best performer for clients. Advice is not a simple commodity. Strong investment performance across a broad, diversified o/ffering paired with best-in-class advice\n\nand thought leadership are critical elements. I am confident that our capabilities and commitment to future-focused investments, as well as enhancements using technology and AI, will bolster our ability to serve our clients and empower them to attain their future success. By achieving optimal results through these e/fforts, clients reward us with their flows, and future growth will follow. Furthermore, we hold a unique advantage that sets us apart from all of our competitors: Being part of JPMorgan Chase provides us with unmatched resources, opportunities and scale.\n\nI am so proud of how we helped our clients and shareholders navigate the challenges of 2023 and previous market cycles. Our industry-leading growth of client assets is a testament to our unwavering commitment to delivering on our fiduciary responsibilities and dedication to serving clients' best interests. We are deeply grateful for this trust and will continue to strive for excellence in all we do, each and every day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMary Callahan Erdoes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCEO, Asset & Wealth Management",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Responsibility\n\nAcross the firm, we believe that the strength of our company is inextricably linked to the vitality of our communities.\n\nWhen families do well, we do well. When communities thrive, we thrive.\n\nIn Corporate Responsibility (CR), we put this philosophy into action by operating at the nexus of business, policy and community. We understand that complex problems aren't solved with a single grant or meeting but rather require multifaceted solutions. This is why we have brought together our philanthropy, government relations, research and policy, sustainability and community engagement functions to tackle inclusive economic growth as one team. Our integrated model allows us to tap a wide-ranging set of tools and perspectives to address societal issues impacting our clients, customers and employees and drive favorable conditions for the firm's continued success.\n\nWe are not just committed to delivering for communities - we are built for it. With team members around the globe, we partner with local residents to understand what's happening on the ground and how JPMorgan Chase can use its unique expertise and resources to maximize impact. Recognizing that there is no one-size-fitsall approach, our local strategies are informed by global insights yet intentionally tailored to the local context, whether that is a region, neighborhood or even city block.\n\nTo me, there is nothing more rewarding than seeing our impact up close. In that spirit, I invite you to learn about our work in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia (Greater Washington); the United Kingdom (U.K.); Dallas-Fort Worth; and Chicago. These place-based case studies showcase the breadth and depth of our engagements in hundreds of communities around\n\nthe world - and show that working in lockstep with communities is critical to promoting a strong business environment.\n\n## GREATER WASHINGTON\n\n## Landscape\n\nWhile the firm has operated in Greater Washington for more than 50 years, over the past decade we have made a concerted e/ffort to advance our business footprint by opening new branches, hiring local employees, lending to small businesses and contributing in other ways. We have intentionally invested in areas where we can grow alongside communities and help residents achieve financial security, especially in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, two cities with significant racial wealth divides.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe have pursued initiatives to address these disparities and lift up the region's residents and workforce.\n\n- \u00b7  In D.C., we provided $3 million to help launch the Congress Heights Community Training and Development Corporation's (CHCTDC) small business career and skills building incubator in Wards 7 and 8.\n- \u00b7  We partnered with Baltimore's Mayor's O/ffice of Employment Development to launch our Baltimore Virtual Call Center, hiring 40 Baltimore-based customer service specialists and leaders.\n- \u00b7  Working with the Greater Washington Partnership and Education Strategy Group - and with support from local government leaders in D.C., Maryland and Virginia - we recommitted $5.4 million to the TalentReady initiative to support the preparation of high school students across the region for in-demand careers, building on our previous commitment that engaged more than 25,000 students across five school districts.\n\n## Our impact in action\n\nWe first worked with Monica Ray at CHCTDC, where she had served as the organization's executive director for more than two decades. Monica has devoted her career to her community, attracting investment to help improve Wards 7 and 8's low homeownership and high poverty and unemployment rates. After years of collaborating on CHCTDC initiatives and the opening of Chase's Community Center Branch in Skyland Town Center, Monica shared her vision about helping to launch a small business career and skills building incubator.\n\n'We are providing support and coaching for promising new businesses, as well as for entrepreneurs still in the idea stage,' she says. 'Our JPMorgan Chase partnership helps us arm these socially and economically disadvantaged women entrepreneurs with the processes and systems they need to succeed in their business ventures.'\n\nMonica and her team have already helped launch 83 new businesses and are growing 47 more, creating jobs and building individual and community wealth.\n\n## THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n## Landscape\n\nThe U.K. has long been an important market for our firm. With over 22,000 employees, our o/fferings have continued to grow with the 2021 launch of the Chase digital consumer bank and the expansion in the U.K. of our commercial banking, investment banking and asset management businesses. While our presence has evolved, the country's economic landscape has experienced historic changes, with ongoing income inequality and nearly 22% of U.K. residents living in poverty .",

        "page_content": "## Our approach\n\nTo address some of the challenges facing the U.K., we have focused on helping businesses succeed, supporting individuals as they build a strong financial future and connecting people to job opportunities. This has included committing $64 million in philanthropic capital over the past five years, alongside the firm's active employee volunteerism programs, civic partnerships, and close engagements with government and nonprofits. We have also promoted e/fforts to boost the U.K.'s leadership in sustainable finance, providing input on a report o/ffering recommendations the U.K. can take to unlock capital at scale to transition to a more sustainable energy system.\n\nExamples of our work to benefit local communities and economic growth include:\n\n- \u00b7  The Aspiring Professionals Program (APP), run in collaboration with the Social Mobility Foundation, works to connect talented young people from low-income backgrounds with work and mentorship experiences at JPMorgan Chase.\n- \u00b7  The Founders Forward mentoring program pairs women entrepreneurs in the U.K. with JPMorgan Chase mentors, who provide business strategy and leadership development guidance.\n\n## Our impact in action\n\nOver the past five years, our collective work with nonprofits has helped more than 33,000 people reduce their debts and improve their financial health. We have also provided resources to support the growth of over 10,000 small businesses and place 9,000+ individuals into apprenticeships or full- or part-time positions.\n\nSince launching in 2012, the APP has supported more than 800 young people, 86% of whom began full-time employment at JPMorgan Chase or other firms within 15 months of graduation. Radhika, currently a vice president with the firm's Global Rates team, enrolled in APP. She credits the program with helping her build the skills she needed for the interview process and now in her sales role at the firm.\n\nFeatured above: Elle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFounders Forward is also changing lives. Approximately 240 women entrepreneurs in the U.K. have participated in the program. This includes Elle, whose business won a startup accelerator competition and expanded to the United States. In addition to the U.K., we are proud to o/ffer Founders Forward in France and Germany, further embedding our commitment to fostering entrepreneurship into the fabric of our global company.\n\n## DALLAS-FORT WORTH\n\n## Landscape\n\nTexas is home to our largest employee base in the United States. With many companies like ours recognizing Texas as a great place to do business, the state is currently experiencing a skilled-labor shortage, specifically in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This local challenge will persist: Although 85% of living-wage jobs in Dallas County require education beyond a high school degree, as of 2017, 73% of Texas' students were not able to receive postsecondary credentials within six years, largely due to financial obstacles.\n\n## Our approach\n\nTo help young people access educational and skills training opportunities, we began advising and funding data-driven nonprofits, including the Commit Partnership and Tarrant To & Through (T3) Partnership, coalitions of school systems, higher education institutions, local and state governments, foundations, employers and workforce agencies, among others.\n\nWhile these organizations work to address compounding issues that impact student success and graduation rates, our commitments are deliberately focused on initiatives where we have expertise and insights to add the greatest value. In 2023, we committed:\n\n- \u00b7  $1.5 million to The Commit Partnership's Opportunity 2040 Plan Phase 1 to support a comprehensive 18-year investment plan to help improve the long-term financial health of 150,000 current students by 2040.\n- \u00b7  $750,000 to the T3 Pathways to Careers (P2C) platform to provide a virtual college-to-career resource to help parents and students understand what's needed to pursue industrybased credentials, degrees, certifications and job opportunities.\n\nWe also promote policies at the local, state and federal levels that align with our goals. Since 2022, we have been a vocal champion of Texas's House Bill 8 legislation that creates a new funding model that incentivizes community colleges in Texas to ensure that more students complete certificates and other credentials or transfer to a four-year university to complete their undergraduate degree.\n\n## Our impact in action\n\nHalfway through the first year, Commit2Dallas's Opportunity 2040 Plan has already met 87% of its year 1 goal: to help an additional 7,700 students reach educational benchmarks that put them on a pathway to well-paying jobs. This work is touching Dallas County families like the Donjuans, whose oldest daughter Annahi will graduate from the University of North Texas at Dallas this spring. 'I'm the first on both sides of my family \u2026 to obtain higher education,' says Annahi. 'I decided to attend college in order to start saving and serve as a role model for my siblings.'",

        "page_content": "We are seeing a similar impact from our T3 P2C commitment. Over the next six months, T3 will integrate its platform with the registration process for all Fort Worth Independent School District middle school students, which will give approximately 15,000 students valuable information about educational opportunities at various high schools and careers they can pursue as an adult.\n\n## CHICAGO\n\n## Landscape\n\nFor more than 160 years, our firm has served Chicago, a city ripe with business opportunities - along with its share of challenges. Between 2017 and 2019, several reports captured the stark segregation and inequities among communities in Chicago, underscoring devastating impacts on economic vitality.\n\n## Our approach\n\nLooking at this research and findings from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, we recognized an opportunity to change the decades-long trajectory of the city's South and West Sides from disinvestment to revitalization. Following conversations with policymakers and residents, we focused on addressing the city's a/ffordable home shortage as an opportunity to catalyze wealth building.\n\nTo leverage vacant city-owned land, CR deepened partnerships with nonprofits building a/ffordable homes in coordination with local government, including The Resurrection Project, Reclaiming Chicago and the Chicago Community Trust. These organizations target city blocks to acquire and build homes, supporting individual and community wealth. They also connect people with a/ffordable mortgages and help them plan for costs like maintenance and repairs. Additionally, our businesses combined expertise to make one of our largest-ever a/ffordable housing investments in redeveloping the Lawson YMCA into 400+ a/ffordable housing units.\n\n## Our impact in action\n\nWe see returns on our commitments in the pride and promise of new homeowners, including Janay, a public school teacher. Janay saved part of every paycheck to purchase her first home and put down roots.\n\nFeatured above: Janay\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'As a teacher, building a sense of community is one of the first things I do with my students at the beginning of the year. It is a way of making students feel safe, valued and supported. This home does the same for me,' she reports.\n\nJanay's inspiring story is one of many. Housing production from a collaborative of organizations - funded in part through grants from JPMorgan Chase - surged from 19 homes in 2022 to 79 homes in 2023, demonstrating significant progress toward the collaborative's goal of scaling production to more than 100 homes per year through 2030.\n\nThis is just the beginning. In addition to deploying $1.1 million in home loans and raising $50 million toward lending and home construction, our grantees have leveraged our philanthropic support to secure another 500 city-owned vacant lots and gain funding from the state of Illinois focused on assisting with down payments and closing appraisal gaps.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nThe essence of our work outlined above can be captured in three words: We show up . As listeners, learners and community partners, we come to the table - real, tangible tables - ready to create avenues to economic opportunity.\n\nAt these various tables, we ask: 'What's working?' We examine our investments with our colleagues across the firm and external partners, gaining an understanding of how winning approaches can be scaled to markets around the world. Our team's work ensuring that policymakers know the value we bring to communities becomes all the more important as we seek to scale solutions during this uncertain political moment. It is in tandem with elected o/fficials and other stakeholders that we have brought, and will continue to bring, the right products and services to our clients and customers.\n\nAnd when we show up, in good and in tough times, we will bring our holistic model, positioning ourselves to grow and truly be the bank for the place we are in, in every market we serve. We take this responsibility seriously. It is a privilege to bank more than 88 million customers and small businesses. It is a privilege to support schools, hospitals and other community institutions. But perhaps most of all, it is a privilege to lead by example, demonstrating through our business success that the private sector has a role to play in shaping a stronger, more inclusive economy for everyone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Berry Global Head of Corporate Responsibility, Chairman of the Mid-Atlantic Region\n\n<!-- image -->",

Refer to page 67 and Note 34 for additional information.\n\nComparisons noted in the sections below are for the full year of 2023 versus the full year of 2022, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## Firmwide overview\n\nJPMorgan Chase reported net income of $49.6 billion for 2023, up 32%, earnings per share of $16.23, ROE of 17% and ROTCE of 21%.\n\n- \u00b7 Total net revenue was $158.1 billion, up 23%, reflecting:\n\n- -Net interest income ('NII') of $89.3 billion, up 34%, driven by higher rates, the impact of First Republic, and higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average deposit balances. NII excluding Markets was $90.0 billion, up 44%.\n- -Noninterest revenue ('NIR') was $68.8 billion, up 11%, driven by the impact of First Republic, including the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain, higher Markets noninterest revenue, and higher asset management fees, partially offset by the absence of the gain on the sale of Visa B shares in the prior year, higher net securities losses in Treasury and CIO, and lower auto operating lease income.\n- \u00b7 Noninterest expense was $87.2 billion, up 14%, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase in employees, primarily in technology and front office, as well as wage inflation. The increase in expense also includes the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and costs associated with the First Republic acquisition.\n- \u00b7 The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net addition to the allowance for credit losses of $3.1 billion. Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card Services, and to a lesser extent single name exposures in wholesale. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included:\n- - a net addition of $1.3 billion in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending, and\n- - a net addition of $657 million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB.\n\nThe net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $2.9 billion.\n\n- \u00b7 The total allowance for credit losses was $24.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, compared with 1.81% in the prior year.\n- \u00b7 The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $7.6 billion at December 31, 2023, up 5%, predominantly driven by wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected the impact of downgrades.

Nearly all of the Firm's other U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products that remained outstanding at LIBOR Cessation have been remediated through contractual fallback provisions or through the framework provided by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act ('LIBOR Act').

This was largely offset by higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven by higher industry-wide issuance,\n\n## partially offset by\n\n- \u00b7 higher equity underwriting fees driven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market volatility and a higher level of convertible securities offerings, which benefited from higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private placements amid a challenging environment.\n\nRefer to CIB segment results on pages 72-77 and Note 6 for additional information.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB:\n\n- \u00b7 higher Equity Markets principal transactions revenue in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives,\n- \u00b7 higher Fixed Income Markets principal transactions revenue in Securitized Products and Fixed Income\n\nFinancing, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets;\n\n- - the net increase in Markets principal transactions revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets net interest income, primarily due to higher funding costs; and\n- \u00b7 losses of $280 million in Credit Adjustments & Other compared with $836 million in the prior year.\n\nThe prior year included net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB.\n\nThe increase in principal transactions revenue also included the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO, reflective of the current interest rate environment.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income, lower other assets, and accrued interest and accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading assets, lower accounts payable and other liabilities, and higher securities borrowed.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading assets.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nThe Firm's investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds from investment securities, proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment and lower securities purchased under resale agreements, largely offset by net originations of loans and net cash used in the First Republic Bank acquisition.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from investment securities.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nThe Firm's financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by higher securities loaned under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.\n- \u00b7 For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.\n\n*     *     *\n\nRefer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 5860, Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102-109, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 170 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm's cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM'S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\n## Non-GAAP financial measures\n\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 166-170. That presentation, which is referred to as 'reported' basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm's results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a 'managed' basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow\n\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 65-85 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.\n\n|                                                        | 2023 2023 2023   | 2023 2023 2023                             | 2023 2023 2023   | 2022 2022 2022   | 2022 2022 2022                             | 2022 2022 2022   | 2021 2021 2021   | 2021 2021 2021                             | 2021 2021 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Year ended  December 31,  (in millions, except ratios) | Reported         | Fully taxable- equivalent  adjustments (a) | Managed basis    | Reported         | Fully taxable- equivalent  adjustments (a) | Managed basis    | Reported         | Fully taxable- equivalent  adjustments (a) | Managed basis    |\n| Other income                                           | $  5,609         | $  3,782                                   | $  9,391         | $  4,322         | $  3,148                                   | $  7,470         | $  4,830         | $  3,225                                   | $  8,055         |\n| Total noninterest revenue                              | 68,837           | 3,782                                      | 72,619           | 61,985           | 3,148                                      | 65,133           | 69,338           | 3,225                                      | 72,563           |\n| Net interest income                                    | 89,267           | 480                                        | 89,747           | 66,710           | 434                                        | 67,144           | 52,311           | 430                                        | 52,741           |\n| Total net revenue                                      | 158,104          | 4,262                                      | 162,366          | 128,695          | 3,582                                      | 132,277          | 121,649          | 3,655                                      | 125,304          |\n| Total noninterest expense                              | 87,172           | NA                                         | 87,172           | 76,140           | NA                                         | 76,140           | 71,343           | NA                                         | 71,343           |\n| Pre-provision profit                                   | 70,932           | 4,262                                      | 75,194           | 52,555           | 3,582                                      | 56,137           | 50,306           | 3,655                                      | 53,961           |\n| Provision for credit losses                            | 9,320            | NA                                         | 9,320            | 6,389            | NA                                         | 6,389            | (9,256)          | NA                                         | (9,256)          |\n| Income before income tax expense                       | 61,612           | 4,262                                      | 65,874           | 46,166           | 3,582                                      | 49,748           | 59,562           | 3,655                                      | 63,217           |\n| Income tax expense                                     | 12,060           | 4,262                                      | 16,322           | 8,490            | 3,582                                      | 12,072           | 11,228           | 3,655                                      | 14,883           |\n| Net income                                             | $ 49,552         | NA                                         | $ 49,552         | $ 37,676         | NA                                         | $ 37,676         | $ 48,334         | NA                                         | $ 48,334         |\n| Overhead ratio                                         | 55 %             | NM                                         | 54 %             | 59 %             | NM                                         | 58 %             | 59 %             | NM                                         | 57 %             |",

Markets consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are nonGAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm's lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines.

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm's use of equity.\n\nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's common stockholders' equity to TCE.\n\n|                                                | Period-end Period-end   | Period-end Period-end   | Average Year ended December 31, Average Year ended December 31, Average Year ended December 31,   | Average Year ended December 31, Average Year ended December 31, Average Year ended December 31,   | Average Year ended December 31, Average Year ended December 31, Average Year ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions, except per share and ratio data) | Dec 31, 2023            | Dec 31, 2022            | 2023                                                                                              | 2022                                                                                              | 2021                                                                                              |\n| Common stockholders' equity                    | $  300,474              | $  264,928              | $  282,056                                                                                        | $  253,068                                                                                        | $  250,968                                                                                        |\n| Less: Goodwill                                 | 52,634                  | 51,662                  | 52,258                                                                                            | 50,952                                                                                            | 49,584                                                                                            |\n| Less: Other intangible assets                  | 3,225                   | 1,224                   | 2,572                                                                                             | 1,112                                                                                             | 876                                                                                               |\n| Add: Certain deferred tax liabilities (a)      | 2,996                   | 2,510                   | 2,883                                                                                             | 2,505                                                                                             | 2,474                                                                                             |\n| Tangible common equity                         | $  247,611              | $  214,552              | $  230,109                                                                                        | $  203,509                                                                                        | $  202,982                                                                                        |\n| Return on tangible common equity               | NA                      | NA                      | 21 %                                                                                              | 18 %                                                                                              | 23 %                                                                                              |\n| Tangible book value per share                  | $  86.08                | $  73.12                | NA                                                                                                | NA                                                                                                | NA                                                                                                |",

There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm's Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm's use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 62-64 for a definition of managed basis.\n\n| JPMorgan Chase  (a)                       | JPMorgan Chase  (a)          | JPMorgan Chase  (a)                   | JPMorgan Chase  (a)         | JPMorgan Chase  (a)                      | JPMorgan Chase  (a)                      | JPMorgan Chase  (a)             |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Consumer Businesses                       | Consumer Businesses          | Consumer Businesses                   | Wholesale Businesses        | Wholesale Businesses                     | Wholesale Businesses                     | Wholesale Businesses            |\n| Consumer & Community Banking              | Consumer & Community Banking | Consumer & Community Banking          | Corporate & Investment Bank | Corporate & Investment Bank              | Commercial  Banking                      | Asset & Wealth  Management      |\n| Banking &  Wealth Management  \u00b7  Consumer | Home Lending  \u00b7  Home        | Card Services &  Auto \u00b7 Card Services | Banking  \u00b7  Investment      | Markets &  Securities Services  \u00b7  Fixed | \u00b7  Middle  Market  Banking  \u00b7  Corporate | \u00b7  Asset  Management  \u00b7  Global |\n\n- (a) As a result of the organizational changes that were announced on January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its business segments to reflect the manner in which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments is expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Recent events on page 52 for additional information.\n\n## Description of business segment reporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm's LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.\n\n## Revenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm's clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\n\n## Expense allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally\n\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a particular business segment.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing ('FTP') is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments.\n\nAs a result of the higher interest rate environment, the cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased, impacting the business segments' net interest income. During the period ended December 31, 2023, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and",

Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on page 143 for additional information.\n\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable.\n\nThe allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment's net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a business segment's net income applicable to common equity.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for additional information.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. The Firm's current allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized riskweighted assets ('RWA') and the global systemically important banks ('GSIB') surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.\n\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 98 for additional information on capital allocation.\n\n## Segment Results - Managed Basis\n\nThe following tables summarize the Firm's results by segment for the periods indicated.\n\n| Year ended December 31,      | Consumer & Community Banking Consumer & Community Banking Consumer & Community Banking   | Consumer & Community Banking Consumer & Community Banking

Net interchange income in Card Services also reflected the impact of a reduction in rewards costs and partner payments in the first quarter of 2023 related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed and an increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023;\n- \u00b7 higher travel-related commissions in Card Services, predominantly offset by\n- \u00b7 lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, and\n- \u00b7 lower mortgage fees and related income in Home Lending.\n\nRefer to Note 6 for additional information on card income, asset management fees, and commissions and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 155-158 for credit card rewards liability.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.\n\nRefer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.\n\nNoninterest expense was $34.8 billion, up 12%, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 higher compensation expense, driven by an increase in employees, including the impact of First Republic in the second half of 2023 and additions primarily in bankers, advisors and technology, wage inflation and higher revenue-related compensation, as well as\n- \u00b7 higher noncompensation expense, driven by the impact of First Republic, investments in marketing and technology, the increase in the FDIC assessment announced in the prior year as well as higher legal expense, partially offset by lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $6.9 billion, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, up $2.6 billion, predominantly driven by Card Services, as the portfolio continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels,\n- \u00b7 a $1.2 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, which included $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; and\n- \u00b7 $408 million to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe provision in the prior year was $3.8 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $2.7 billion and a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses across CCB.\n\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 111-134 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 131133 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.",

Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio recorded in the second quarter of 2022, Investment Banking revenue was down 8%. Investment Banking fees were down 5%, driven by lower advisory and debt underwriting fees, partially offset by higher equity underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.\n- -Advisory fees were $2.8 billion , dow n 8%, due to a lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the lower level of announced deals in the current and the prior year amid a challenging environment.\n- - Debt underwriting fees were $2.6 billion, down 8%, as challenging market conditions, primarily in the first half of the year, resulted in lower issuance activity across leveraged loans, investment-grade loans, and high-grade bonds. This was largely offset by higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven by higher industry-wide issuance.\n- - Equity underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, up 11%, driven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market volatility and a higher level of convertible securities offerings which benefited from higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private placements amid a challenging environment.\n- \u00b7 Payments revenue was $9.3 billion, up 22%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and fees, partially offset by the higher level of client credits that reduce such fees and lower average deposits. The net impact of equity investments was flat reflecting net markdowns in both periods, including the impact of an impairment in the current year.\n- \u00b7 Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 27%, driven by $494 million of fair value losses on hedges of retained loans which included an increase in hedging activity, compared to $27 million of gains in the prior year, partially offset by higher net interest income.\n\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $32.3 billion, down 1%. Markets revenue was $27.8 billion, down 4%.\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.8 billion, up 1%, driven by an increase in finance and trading activity in the Securitized Products Group and improved performance in Credit Trading, predominantly offset by lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets as the business substantially normalized from the prior year's elevated levels of volatility and client activity.\n- \u00b7 Equity Markets revenue was $9.0 billion, down 13%, driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash Equities, compared with a stronger performance in the prior year.\n- \u00b7 Securities Services revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower average deposits and fees.\n- \u00b7 Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $280 million, compared with a loss of $836 million in the prior year.\n\nNoninterest expense was $28.6 billion, up 5%, driven by higher legal expense, compensation expense, including the impact of wage inflation, and higher indirect tax expense.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $121 million, driven by net charge-offs of $272 million, up $190 million, driven by single name exposures, largely offset by a $151 million net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe net reduction in the allowance was driven by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios and the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook, predominantly offset by an addition for certain accounts receivable and net downgrade activity.\n\nThe provision in the prior year was $1.2 billion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses.",

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items.\n\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as 'inventoryrelated revenue', which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the\n\ndifference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.",

Noninterest revenue was $13.6 billion, up 8%.\n\nRevenue from Asset Management was $9.1 billion, up 4%, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, and\n- \u00b7 higher asset management fees driven by strong net inflows largely offset by the net impact of foreign exchange rate movements, as well as the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the prior year,\n\nlargely offset by\n\n- \u00b7 lower performance fees, and\n- \u00b7 lower NII due to higher funding costs.\n\nRevenue from Global Private Bank was $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 higher net interest income on higher average loans associated with First Republic, and from deposit margin expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower average deposits, and\n- \u00b7 higher noninterest revenue, predominantly driven by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, partially offset by net investment valuation losses.\n\nNoninterest expense was $12.8 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including continued growth in private banking advisor teams, revenue-related compensation and the impacts of closing the Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisitions.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $159 million, predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe provision in the prior year was $128 million driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses.",

        "page_content": "## Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance.\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund's three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura 'star rating' is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 'primary share class' level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n- \u00b7 Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years) :All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a 'primary share class' level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n- ' Primary share class ' means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds.

income was $2.8 billion, compared with a net loss of $743 million in the prior year.\n\nNet revenue was $8.0 billion, compared with $80 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by the impact of lower Firmwide average deposit balances.\n\nNoninterest revenue was $132 million, compared with a loss of $1.8 billion in the prior year, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition,\n- \u00b7 higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues associated with foreign exchange rate movements that are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, and\n- \u00b7 the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities as a result of the current interest rate environment,\n\npartially offset by\n\n- \u00b7 higher net investment securities losses related to the sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio, and\n- \u00b7 lower net gains related to certain other Corporate investments.\n\nThe prior year included a gain on the sale of Visa B shares and proceeds from an insurance settlement.\n\nNoninterest expense was $5.6 billion, up $4.6 billion, predominantly driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment,\n- \u00b7 $1.0 billion associated with First Republic, predominantly driven by integration and restructuring costs as well as expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023 with respect to individuals associated with First Republic who did not become employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023,\n- \u00b7 a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements that are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO,\n- \u00b7 higher legal expenses, and\n- \u00b7 higher costs associated with the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives,\n\npartially offset by\n\n- \u00b7 lower benefits-related and real estate expenses.\n\nThe net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that was transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income.

The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm's four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and offbalance sheet assets and liabilities.\n\nTreasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm's asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in highquality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm's investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm's assetliability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm's cash position primarily through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102-109 for further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135-143 for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\nThe investment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion,\n\nand the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

        "page_content": "## FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase's business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm's overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;\n- \u00b7 Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n- \u00b7 A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 'Board'). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm's performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.\n\n## Risk governance framework\n\nThe Firm's risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.\n\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The Firm's risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity, or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or an inadequate response to changes in the operating environment.\n- \u00b7 Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\n- \u00b7 Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational risk includes cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.\n\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the Firm's reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\n\nThe Firm's risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management ('IRM') function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm's Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the 'Board Risk Committee'), the Firm's Chief Risk Officer ('CRO') to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.\n\nThe Firm's CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk Executives ('FREs'), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate ('LOB CROs'), and the Firm's Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO'), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, develop the Firm's risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm's risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within the risk and control standards established by its own management.\n\n## Three lines of defense\n\nThe Firm's 'three lines of defense' are as follows:\n\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. The first line of defense owns the identification of risks within their respective organizations and the design and execution of controls to manage those risks.\n\nResponsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk",

IRM is also responsible for the identification of risks within its respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the development and implementation of policies and standards with respect to its own processes.\n\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function that provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk management. The Internal Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.\n\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment but are not considered part of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible for the identification of risks within their respective organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM.\n\n## Risk identification and ownership\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their respective organizations, as well as the design and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB and Corporate's responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm's businesses and operational activities, catalog them in a central repository and review material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate's identified risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee ('FRC') and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Firm's overall appetite for risk is governed by 'Risk Appetite' frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. The Firm's risk appetite is periodically set and approved by senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the Firm's capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.",

Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is a strategic imperative of the Firm's Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm's 'fortress balance sheet' philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm's capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in marketleading businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm's capital prior to making significant decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm's earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm's capital strength.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk across the Firm.\n\nCapital Risk Management's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;\n- \u00b7 Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;\n- \u00b7 Developing processes to classify, monitor and report capital limit breaches;\n- \u00b7 Performing assessments of the Firm's capital management activities, including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and\n- \u00b7 Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital framework intended to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory capital rules.\n\n## Capital management\n\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Firm's capital management are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firm's businesses through normal economic cycles and in stressed environments;\n- \u00b7 Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Promote the Parent Company's ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain 'well-capitalized' status for the Firm and its principal insured depository institution ('IDI') subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nat all times under applicable regulatory capital requirements;\n\n- \u00b7 Meet capital distribution objectives; and\n- \u00b7 Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm's preferred resolution strategy.\n\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\n\n- \u00b7 Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm's regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events;\n- \u00b7 Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential events; and\n- \u00b7 Regularly monitoring the Firm's capital position and following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels.\n\n## Governance\n\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm's capital management include the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate ('CTC') Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm's capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 86-89 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.\n\n## Capital planning and stress testing\n\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank Holding Company ('BHC'), to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ('CCAR') and other stress testing processes to assess whether large BHCs, such as the Firm, have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forwardlooking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC's unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC's capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes ('ICAAP'), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm's Stress Capital Buffer ('SCB') requirement for the coming year.\n\nThe Firm's current SCB requirement is 2.9%, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2024. The Firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, was 11.4% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nRefer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on actions taken by the Firm's Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm's processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm's ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm's Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the capital planning framework.\n\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm's earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as necessary.\n\n## Contingency Capital Plan\n\nThe Firm's Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm's approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm's principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\n\n## Basel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach ('Basel III Standardized'), and an advanced approach ('Basel III Advanced').\n\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity,\" which is referred to in this Form 10-K as 'U.S. Basel III proposal'. Under the proposal, changes to the framework would include replacement of the Advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of RWA, other than for market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded riskbased approach and the Standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. Based on the Firm's understanding of the proposal, as applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023 (the reference date for a special data collection exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve), the estimated impact at the end of the transition period would increase RWA by approximately 30%, which would result in an approximately 25% increase to CET1 capital necessary to meet the Firm's CET1 ratio requirement, all else equal. These estimates do not reflect any actions that the Firm may take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently proposed.\n\nPending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the Firm expects that it will continue to build capital above the current levels, and therefore the CET1 target of 13.5% previously set by the Firm (which was with respect to the current Standardized RWA measure) is no longer meaningful. The Firm's quarterly capital ratios will vary dependent on market conditions and other factors. Under the requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the new expanded risk-based approach, when fully phased-in, would be the Firm's binding constraint.\n\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is generally calculated consistently between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to",

However, as of December 31, 2023, with respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratios, the Standardized ratios are more binding than the Advanced ratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate its SLR. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, the Firm's SLR became more binding than the Basel III riskbased ratios, primarily reflecting the reduction in the Stress Capital Buffer requirement. With the increase in the GSIB surcharge in the first quarter of 2024, the Firm expects the risk-based ratios to revert to being more binding than the SLR.\n\nRefer to page 95 for additional information on GSIB surcharge and page 98 for additional information on SLR.\n\n## Other Key Regulatory Developments GSIB Surcharge\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be reduced from 50 bps to 10 bps and there would also be other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would revise risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective two calendar quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer to Riskbased Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages 94-95 for further information on the GSIB surcharge.\n\n## TLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand the eligible long-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean holding company requirements under the existing total loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to non-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. While U.S. GSIBs are already subject to these requirements, the proposal would reduce the amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less than two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC requirement. The proposal would also expand the existing capital deduction framework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD issued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD requirements.",

The capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements, as well as a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital requirements.\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve's GSIB rule, the Firm is required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods based on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. 'Method 1' reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee's assessment methodology, and is calculated by the Financial Stability Board ('FSB') across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,\n\ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 'Method 2', calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score 'multiplication factor'.",

The Firm's estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm's effective GSIB surcharge increased to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.\n\nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2023, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.\n\nFailure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive officers.\n\n## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity\n\nThe Federal Reserve's TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB toptier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible LTD. Refer to TLAC on page 100 for additional information.\n\n## Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio\n\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm's total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm's total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain offbalance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory capital rules. Refer to SLR on page 98 for additional information.\n\nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive officers.\n\n## Other regulatory capital\n\nIn addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 'well-capitalized' under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act, respectively.

As a result, for certain exposures associated with the First Republic acquisition, Advanced RWA and any impact on Advanced Total capital is calculated under the Standardized approach as permitted by the transition provisions in the U.S. capital rules.

At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2024, changes to the Firm's line of business capital allocations are primarily a result of updates to the Firm's current capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB under rules currently in effect.

Liquidity Risk Management's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;\n- \u00b7 Independently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite;\n- \u00b7 Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;\n- \u00b7 Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management processes to evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness;\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; and\n- \u00b7 Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Firm's liquidity management are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure that the Firm's core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and\n- \u00b7 Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.\n\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\n\n- \u00b7 Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs, legal entities, as well as currencies, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;\n- \u00b7 Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;\n- \u00b7 Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entityspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;\n- \u00b7 Managing liquidity within the Firm's approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;\n- \u00b7 Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and\n- \u00b7 Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items.\n\nAs part of the Firm's overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Optimize liquidity sources and uses;\n- \u00b7 Monitor exposures;\n- \u00b7 Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm's legal entities; and\n- \u00b7 Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.\n\n## Governance\n\nCommittees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide ALCO, as well as regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for approval, the Firm's liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 86-89 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees.\n\n## Internal stress testing\n\nThe Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm's resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm's contractual financial obligations are met and take into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7 Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets;\n- \u00b7 Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;\n- \u00b7 Credit rating downgrades;\n- \u00b7 Collateral haircuts; and\n- \u00b7 Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.\n\nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.\n\nResults of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm's funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the 'IHC'), provides funding to support the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through",

The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of stress.\n\n## LCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nUnder the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm's reported eligible HQLA.\n\nEstimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of the Firm's assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 based on the Firm's interpretation of the LCR framework.\n\n|                               | Three months ended Three months ended Three months ended   | Three months ended Three months ended Three months ended   | Three months ended Three months ended Three months ended   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Average amount (in millions)  | December 31,  2023                                         | September 30,  2023                                        | December 31, 2022                                          |\n| JPMorgan Chase & Co.:         |                                                            |                                                            |                                                            |\n| HQLA                          |                                                            |                                                            |                                                            |\n| Eligible cash (a)             | $  485,263                                                 | $  402,663                                                 | $  542,847                                                 |\n| Eligible securities (b)(c)    | 313,365                                                    | 378,702                                                    | 190,201                                                    |\n| Total HQLA (d)                | $  798,628                                                 | $  781,365                                                 | $  733,048                                                 |\n| Net cash outflows             | $  704,857                                                 | $  696,668                                                 | $  652,580                                                 |\n| LCR                           | 113 %                                                      | 112 %                                                      | 112 %                                                      |\n| Net excess eligible  HQLA (d) | $  93,771                                                  | $  84,697                                                  | $  80,468                                                  |\n| JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:    |                                                            |                                                            |                                                            |\n| LCR                           | 129 %                                                      | 123 %                                                      | 151 %                                                      |\n| Net excess eligible  HQLA     | $  215,190                                                 | $  167,096                                                 | $  356,733                                                 |\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR increased during the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by CIB market activities, partially offset by loan growth.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased compared with the three months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash due to a decline in average deposits and loan growth, as well as the impact of First Republic and lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. These impacts were partially offset by CIB markets activities.\n\nRefer to Note 10 and Note 34 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First Republic acquisition.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to the Firm's U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for a further discussion of the Firm's LCR.\n\n## Liquidity sources\n\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., partially offset by an increase in unencumbered AFS securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts of $798.0 billion and $735.5 billion, respectively, and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $649 billion and $694 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks ('FHLBs') and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $340 billion and $323 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2022 primarily due to a higher amount of wholesale loans pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\n\n## NSFR\n\nThe net stable funding ratio ('NSFR') is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of 'available' stable funding that is sufficient to meet their 'required' amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's interpretation of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 on the Firm's website for additional information.",

Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term\n\ndebt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm's non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.

A significant portion of the Firm's deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than periodend deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption, average deposit trends may be impacted.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, reflecting the net impact of:\n\n- \u00b7 lower balances in AWM due to continued migration into higher-yielding investments driven by the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by growth from new and existing customers as a result of new product offerings and the impact of First Republic,\n- \u00b7 a decline in CCB reflecting higher customer spending, largely offset by the impact of First Republic,\n- \u00b7 a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as clients seek higher-yielding investments, partially offset by the retention of inflows associated with disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023,\n- \u00b7 a decline in CIB due to deposit attrition, including actions taken to reduce certain deposits, predominantly offset by\n\nnet issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, and\n\n- \u00b7 growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives.\n\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31, 2022, reflecting the net impact of:\n\n- \u00b7 higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, as well as deposit inflows from client-driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, partially offset by deposit attrition, including actions taken to reduce certain deposits,\n- \u00b7 growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives,\n- \u00b7 lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer spending,\n- \u00b7 a decline in AWM due to continued migration into higheryielding investments driven by the higher interest rate environment, predominantly offset by growth from new and existing customers as a result of new product offerings, and\n- \u00b7 a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as clients seek higher-yielding investments, predominantly offset by the retention of inflows associated with disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net increase also included $61 billion of deposits associated with First Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, AWM and CB.",

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, reflecting the impact of a lower level of netting on reduced repurchase activity.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm's demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm's liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and marketmaking portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm's sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe increase in period-end commercial paper and the decrease in average balances for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the respective prior year periods were due to changes in net issuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity management.\n\nThe decrease in average secured other borrowed funds for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower financing of Markets activities.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Long-term funding and issuance\n\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm's long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm's total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in period-end structured notes compared to the prior year period was attributable to net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in fair value.\n\nThe following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm's access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm.

The Firm believes that it\n\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm's funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings.

These events could contribute to financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm.\n\n## Organization and management\n\nReputation Risk Management is an independent risk management function that establishes the governance framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm's LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is inherently challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.\n\nThe Firm's reputation risk management function includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and a standard consistent with the reputation risk framework\n- \u00b7 Providing oversight of the governance framework through processes and infrastructure to support consistent identification, escalation and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of each LOB, Corporate and employees to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or consider any other activity. Environmental impacts and social concerns are increasingly important considerations in assessing the Firm's reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm's reputation risk governance.",

        "page_content": "## CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.\n\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm's credit risk management governance includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n- \u00b7 Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval\n- \u00b7 Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines\n- \u00b7 Assigning and managing credit approval authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure\n- \u00b7 Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\n- \u00b7 Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital management\n\n## Risk identification and measurement\n\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower's credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.\n\nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firm's lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 155-158 for further information.\n\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described below.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm's credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and countryspecific stress scenarios, as appropriate. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.\n\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.\n\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints.\n\nManagement of the Firm's wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Loan underwriting and credit approval processes\n- \u00b7 Loan syndications and participations\n- \u00b7 Loan sales and securitizations\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives\n- \u00b7 Master netting agreements, and\n- \u00b7 Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques\n\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 Independently assessing risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm's wholesale credit portfolio and the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given default ('LGD') rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans.\n\n## Risk reporting\n\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decisionmaking, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors.",

The new guidance requires disclosure of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs from the population previously considered TDRs.

Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.\n\nResidential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.\n\nRetained loans increased compared to December 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate loans associated with First Republic. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared to December 31, 2022 predominantly driven by loan sales, partially offset by the net impact of paydowns and additions, including those associated with First Republic. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates.\n\nLoans at fair value increased from December 31, 2022, driven by an increase in Home Lending as originations outpaced warehouse loan sales, and in CIB as purchases outpaced sales and paydowns.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $90.6 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively. The increase was driven by First Republic. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixedrate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higherincome borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $16.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which included $2.6 billion associated with First Republic. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding included $4.2 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $4.3 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm's residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-forsale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.\n\n| (in millions)                     | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Current                           | $  446               | $  659               |\n| 30-89 days past due               | 102                  | 136                  |\n| 90 or more days past due          | 182                  | 302                  |\n| Total government guaranteed loans | $  730               | $  1,097             |\n\n## Geographic composition and current estimated loan-tovalue ratio of residential real estate loans\n\nAt December 31, 2023, $228.4 billion, or 70% of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion, or 62% at December 31, 2022.\n\nAverage current estimated loan-to-value ('LTV') ratios have improved, reflecting an increase in home prices.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm's residential real estate loans.\n\n## Modified residential real estate loans\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 , residential real estate FDMs were $136 million. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $69 million of loans subject to trial modification where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified, as well as $9 million of loans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\"). The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 , residential real estate TDRs were $362 million.

The portfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2022 due to originations of scored auto loans and an increase in other consumer unsecured fair value option loans in CIB associated with First Republic, largely offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year due to higher chargeoffs of scored auto loans driven by the decline in used vehicle valuations.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm's wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 122-125 for further information.\n\nThe Firm's wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with First Republic.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $41.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022, representing approximately 3.3% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $41.4 billion, $38.3 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was predominantly driven by Real Estate, Technology, Media & Telecommunications (predominantly Technology) and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm's exposures as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty's primary business activity.

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Lending-related commitments\n\nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm's expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments.\n\n## Receivables from customers\n\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm's right to call for, and the borrower's obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management's judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm's accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Derivative contracts\n\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives ('ETD'), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter ('OTCcleared') derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\n\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm's OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements - excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily - was approximately 87% at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was $54.9 billion and $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the receivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative contracts move in the Firm's favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements for derivative transactions.",

To capture this variability, the Firm calculates, on a client-byclient basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent ('DRE'), and Average exposure ('AVG'). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\n\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management.\n\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk.\n\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm's derivative exposures, including the benefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.\n\nThe fair value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm's AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty's credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm's risk management process for derivatives exposures takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which\n\nis broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty's capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty's AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.\n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm's current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.\n\n## Exposure profile of derivatives measures\n\nDecember\n\n31, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm's view, of the true changes in value of the Firm's overall credit exposure.\n\nThe effectiveness of credit default swaps ('CDS') as a hedge against the Firm's exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm's CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm's exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm.

        "page_content": "## ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n- \u00b7 the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n- \u00b7 the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 was $24.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.1 billion from December 31, 2022.\n\nThe net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.9 billion, consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 $1.3 billion in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices, and\n- \u00b7 $675 million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lendingrelated commitment portfolios.\n\nThe net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated recession risks due to high inflation and tightening financial conditions.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm's central case assumptions for the periods presented:\n\n|                                 | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | 2Q24                                                                                                                                           | 4Q24                                                                                                                                           | 2Q25                                                                                                                                           |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 4.1  %                                                                                                                                         | 4.4  %                                                                                                                                         | 4.1  %                                                                                                                                         |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 1.8  %                                                                                                                                         | 0.7  %                                                                                                                                         | 1.0  %                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                 | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022   |\n|                                 | 2Q23                                                                                                                                           | 4Q23                                                                                                                                           | 2Q24                                                                                                                                           |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 3.8 %                                                                                                                                          | 4.3 %                                                                                                                                          | 5.0 %                                                                                                                                          |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 1.5 %                                                                                                                                          | 0.4 %                                                                                                                                          | -

        "page_content": "## INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nInvestment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.\n\n## Investment securities risk\n\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84-85 and Note 10 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102-109 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135-143 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the Firm's Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm's independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.\n\n## Principal investment risk\n\nPrincipal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm's business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm's principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm's investments will continue to evolve based on market circumstances and in line with its strategic initiatives, including the Firm's environmental and social goals.\n\nThe table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n| (in billions)                                                                          | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Tax-oriented investments,  primarily in alternative energy  and affordable housing (a) | $  28.8              | $  26.2              |\n| Private equity, various debt and  equity instruments, and real  assets                 | 10.5                 | 10.8                 |\n| Total carrying value                                                                   | $  39.3              | $  37.0              |\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nThe Firm's approach to managing principal investment risk is consistent with the Firm's risk governance structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy framework for all principal investing activities that includes approval by executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate.\n\nThe Firm's independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.",

Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a market risk policy framework\n- \u00b7 Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk\n- \u00b7 Defining, approving and monitoring limits\n- \u00b7 Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments\n\n## Risk measurement\n\n## Measures used to capture market risk\n\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:\n\n- \u00b7 Value-at-risk\n- \u00b7 Stress testing\n- \u00b7 Profit and loss drawdowns\n- \u00b7 Earnings-at-risk\n- \u00b7 Economic Value Sensitivity\n- \u00b7 Other sensitivity-based measures\n\n## Risk monitoring and control\n\nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management judgment. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.\n\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.\n\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 154.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm's existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time.",

        "page_content": "## Value-at-risk\n\nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk ('VaR'), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework's approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.\n\nThe Firm's Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported as appropriate to various groups including senior management, the Board Risk Committee and regulators.\n\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm's risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress\n\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.\n\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, the daily market data used may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm's valuation process.\n\nThe Firm's VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 154 for information regarding model reviews and approvals.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules ('Regulatory VaR'), which is used to derive the Firm's regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to 'covered' positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm's Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.\n\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase's Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).",

        "page_content": "## VaR backtesting\n\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm's reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm's Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 139 of the 258 days, and observed 13 VaR backtesting exceptions, of which eight were in the three months ended December 31, 2023. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which comprise each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended December 31, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm's Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm's covered positions.\n\n## Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Other risk measures\n\n## Stress testing\n\nAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm's vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits.\n\nThe Firm's stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\n\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate.\n\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as appropriate.\n\nThe Firm's stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm's CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm's Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Profit and loss drawdowns\n\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\n\n## Structural interest rate risk management\n\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm's reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities which are included in\n\nVaR, but also from the Firm's traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and associated derivative instruments. Refer to the table on page 136 for a summary by LOB and Corporate identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm's interest rate risk management policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm's structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk, including limits related to Earnings-atRisk and Economic Value Sensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.\n\n## Key Risk Drivers and Risk Management Process\n\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments\n- \u00b7 Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time\n- \u00b7 Differences in the amounts by which short-term and longterm market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\n- \u00b7 The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change\n\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\n\n## Earnings-at-Risk\n\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm's interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and,",

        "page_content": "in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies ('non-U.S. dollar' currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 136. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure from non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising from the Firm's capital investments. The inclusion of the hedges in these simulations would increase U.S. dollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page 145 for more information.\n\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and longterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n- \u00b7 Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm at any particular time could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits.\n- \u00b7 The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags\n\nimpacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The model change incorporated observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits.\n\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of which are especially significant in the case of consumer deposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm's earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm's interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm's net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 52 for additional information).\n\nThe Firm's U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\n\n| December 31, (in billions)         | 2023   | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| U.S. dollar:  (a)                  |        |          |\n| Parallel shift:  (b)               |        |          |\n| +100 bps shift in rates            | $  2.4 | $  (2.0) |\n| -100 bps shift in rates            | (2.1)  | 2.4      |\n| +200 bps shift in rates            | 4.8    | (4.2)    |\n| -200 bps shift in rates            | (4.6)  | 3.3      |\n| Steeper yield curve:               |        |          |\n| +100 bps shift in long-term rates  | 0.6    | 0.8      |\n| -100 bps shift in short-term rates | (1.5)  | 3.2      |\n| Flatter yield curve:               |        |          |\n| +100 bps shift in short-term rates | 1.8    | (2.8)    |\n| -100 bps shift in long-term rates  | (0.5)  | (0.9)    |\n| Non-U.S. dollar:                   |        |          |\n| Parallel shift:  (b)               |        |          |\n| +100 bps shift in rates            | $  0.7 | $  0.7   |\n| -100 bps shift in rates            | (0.7)  | (0.6)    |\n\nIn the absence of the model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2023, would have been lower by $4.1 billion to the +100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by $3.7 billion to the -100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios.\n\nThe change in the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 also reflected the impact of changes in the Firm's balance sheet including the impact of the First Republic acquisition.",

The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 66 for additional information.\n\n## Other sensitivity-based measures\n\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income ('OCI') and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables.

        "page_content": "## COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm's exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm's exposures are diversified given the Firm's strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\n\n## Organization and management\n\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk management function that assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.\n\nThe Firm's country risk management function includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\n- \u00b7 Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\n- \u00b7 Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm\n- \u00b7 Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior management\n- \u00b7 Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns\n- \u00b7 Providing country risk scenario analysis\n\n## Sources and measurement\n\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country.\n\nUnder the Firm's internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm's risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an\n\nindividual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework:\n\n- \u00b7 Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions\n- \u00b7 Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received\n- \u00b7 Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received\n- \u00b7 Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions\n- \u00b7 Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative's fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures\n\nThe Firm's internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important component of the Firm's country risk management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary.\n\n## Risk reporting\n\nCountry exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits.\n\nFor country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions ('SAR') and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm's top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2023, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm's largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm.\n\nThe decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm.\n\nThe decrease in exposure to Australia when compared to December 31, 2022, was predominantly driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which was approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2023. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.\n\n## Top 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.) (a)\n\n| December 31,   (in billions)   | 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023   | 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023   | 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023    | 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023   | 2023 2023 2023 2023 2023   | 2022 (f)        |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                | Deposits  with  banks (b)  | Lending (c)                | Trading  and  investing (d) | Other (e)                  | Total  exposure            | Total  exposure |\n| Germany                        |                            | $  69.8  $  12.1  $        |                             |                            | 2.1  $  0.8  $  84.8       | $  93.2         |\n| United  Kingdom                | 36.4                       | 25.5                       | 13.5                        | 1.7                        | 77.1                       | 70.1            |\n| Japan                          | 29.4                       | 2.4                        | 3.9                         | 0.3                        | 36.0                       | 55.8            |\n| Australia                      | 9.7                        | 6.9                        | 1.7                         | -                          | 18.3                       | 25.7            |\n| Brazil                         | 5.2                        | 5.3                        | 6.2                         | -                          | 16.7                       | 17.8            |\n| Canada                         | 2.3                        | 11.4                       | 2.0                         | 0.3                        | 16.0                       | 14.4            |\n| China                          | 3.5                        | 5.5                        | 5.0                         | -                          | 14.0                       | 13.7            |\n| Switzerland                    | 5.2                        | 3.6                        | 1.2                         | 0.9                        | 10.9                       | 15.3            |\n| France                         | 0.6                        | 10.9                       | (2.2)                       | 0.8                        | 10.1                       | 18.1            |\n| Singapore                      | 1.9                        | 3.8                        | 3.8                         | 0.3                        | 9.8                        | 9.9             |\n| India                          | 1.2                        | 3.8                        | 4.3                         | 0.4                        | 9.7                        | 9.0             |\n| Mexico                         | 1.1                        | 3.7                        | 3.4                         | -                          | 8.2                        | 5.4             |\n| Belgium                        | 5.6                        | 2.1                        | 0.3                         | -                          | 8.0                        | 9.2             |\n| South Korea                    | 0.8                        | 3.2                        | 3.5                         | 0.3                        | 7.8                        | 10.0            |\n| Saudi  Arabia                  | 0.6                        | 5.2                        | 1.9                         | -                          | 7.7                        | 7.9             |\n| Spain                          | 0.3                        | 5.2                        | 0.8                         | -                          | 6.3                        | 3.4             |\n| Italy                          | 0.1                        | 5.9                        | (0.2)                       | 0.2                        | 6.0                        | 5.8             |\n| Netherlands                    | 0.1                        | 6.4                        | (1.2)                       | 0.3                        | 5.6                        | 7.1             |\n| Malaysia                       | 3.5                        | 0.2                        | 0.4                         | 0.1                        | 4.2                        | 5.3             |\n| Luxembourg                     | 0.9                        | 2.2                        | 0.9                         | -                          | 4.0                        | 4.2             |",

        "page_content": "## CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nClimate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of climate change on the Firm's clients, customers, operations and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk.\n\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea level rise, persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average ambient temperatures.\n\nTransition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a lowcarbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.\n\n## Organization and management\n\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing climate risks that may impact the Firm. The Climate Risk Management function engages across the Firm to help integrate climate risk considerations into existing risk management frameworks, as appropriate.\n\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:\n\n- \u00b7 Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate risk across the Firm\n- \u00b7 Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential climate-related financial and economic impacts to the Firm\n- \u00b7 Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the identification, assessment and management of climate risks present in their business activities and for adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nThe Firm's approach to managing climate risk is consistent with the Firm's risk governance structure. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for integrating climate risk management into existing governance frameworks, or creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate.\n\nThe LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are responsible for providing the Board Risk Committee with information on significant climate risks and climate-related initiatives, as appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm's activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm's financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.\n\n## Operational Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Firm's Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk ('CCOR') Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm's operational risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm's Global Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO') and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\n\n## Operational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control selfassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control environment to assess circumstances in which controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance organization ('Operational Risk and Compliance') provides oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the results to senior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach ('LDA') statistical model, which simulates the projected frequency and severity of operational risk losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm's operational risk capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach ('AMA'), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management's view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm's operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm's CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\n\n## Operational Risk Monitoring and testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Management of Operational Risk\n\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans.\n\n## Operational Risk Reporting\n\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has established standards designed to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards establish escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Insurance\n\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business.\n\n## Subcategories and examples of operational risks\n\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 151, 152, 153 and 154, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks such as business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as cybersecurity, are provided below.\n\n## War in Ukraine and Sanctions\n\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational and other risks associated with addressing these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations.\n\n## Business and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm's control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, civil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of extraordinary events beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets including staff, technology, facilities and third parties. The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business resiliency risks. The program is required to be managed in accordance with the Firm's overall approach to Operational Risk Management, including alignment with technology, cybersecurity, data, physical security, crisis management, real estate and outsourcing programs.\n\n## Payment fraud risk\n\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings.\n\n## Third-party outsourcing risk\n\nThe Firm's Third-Party Oversight ('TPO') and Inter-affiliates Oversight ('IAO') frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third parties to an appropriate standard of operational performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards with respect to thirdparty outsourcing risks.",

        "page_content": "## Cybersecurity risk\n\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology or the unauthorized disclosure of data.\n\n## Overview\n\nCybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices, and other technology. The Firm's security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks that can result in unauthorized access to confidential information, the destruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of service, the sabotaging of systems or other damage.\n\nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented measures and controls reasonably designed to address this evolving environment, including enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the Firm continues to review and enhance its capabilities to address associated risks, such as those relating to the management of administrative access to systems.\n\nThird parties with which the Firm does business, that facilitate the Firm's business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) or that the Firm has acquired are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could have a material adverse effect on the Firm, including in circumstances in which an affected third party is unable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or where the incident delivers compromised software to the Firm or results in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients or customers.\n\nClients and customers are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm's own security and control systems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions with its clients, customers and other external parties concerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities to improve cybersecurity.\n\nRisks from cybersecurity threats, including any previous cybersecurity events, have not materially affected the Firm or its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the comprehensive approach that the Firm takes to address cybersecurity risk, the Firm may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a future cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on the Firm or its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## Organization and management\n\nThe Global Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO') reports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and is a member of key cybersecurity governance forums. The CISO leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization, which is responsible for identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and for implementing and maintaining controls to manage cybersecurity threats. The CISO is responsible for the Firm's Information Security Program, which is designed to prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks in order to help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm's infrastructure, resources and information. The program includes managing the Firm's global cybersecurity operations centers, providing training, conducting cybersecurity event simulation exercises, implementing the Firm's policies and standards relating to technology risk and cybersecurity management, and enhancing, as needed, the Firm's cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nThe Firm's Information Security Program includes the following functions:\n\nCyber Operations , which is responsible for implementing and maintaining controls designed to detect and defend the Firm against cyber attacks, and includes a dedicated function for incident response and ongoing monitoring for cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, including those among the Firm's third-party suppliers.\n\nTechnology Governance, Risk & Controls , which is responsible for operationalizing technology risk and control frameworks, analyzing regulatory developments that may impact the Firm, and developing control catalogs and assessments of controls, as well as overseeing governance and reporting of technology and cybersecurity risk.\n\nSecurity Awareness , which provides awareness and training that reinforces information risk and security management practices and compliance with the Firm's policies, standards and practices. The training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm also provides specialized security training to employees in specific roles, such as application developers. The Firm's Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic training on data privacy that focuses on confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information.\n\nTechnology Resiliency , which establishes control requirements for planning and testing the prioritized recovery of technology services in the event of degradation or outage, including incident response planning, data backup and retention, and recovery readiness in support of the Firmwide Business Resiliency Program and operational risk management practices.",

The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review ('MRGR'), defines and governs the Firm's policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.\n\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR's scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models, as described in detail below.\n\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models within the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the relevant portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.\n\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm's reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.\n\nUnder the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firm's policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed. This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the Firm may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired differ from those used to develop the models.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 155-158 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.",

        "page_content": "## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\n\nJPMorgan Chase's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimates require management's judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n- \u00b7 The allowance for lending-related commitments and\n- \u00b7 The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm's policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm's allowance for credit losses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm's allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm's methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables ('MEVs') that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\n- \u00b7 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n\n- \u00b7 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm's assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\n\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm's modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real estate that has more commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in the sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm's central scenario shown on page 131 and in Note 13 , the Firm's relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the eightquarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.3% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of",

Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm's allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences:\n\n- \u00b7 An increase of approximately $850 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments\n- \u00b7 An increase of approximately $3.1 billion for credit card loans\n- \u00b7 An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments\n\nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.\n\nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Fair value\n\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\n\n## Assets measured at fair value\n\nThe following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

        "page_content": "## Valuation\n\nDetails of the Firm's processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm's creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm's valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm's process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15.\n\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2023. For each of the reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 9% and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.\n\nThe projections for the Firm's reporting units are consistent with management's current business outlook assumptions in the short term, and the Firm's best estimates of longterm growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Credit card rewards liability\n\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $13.2 billion and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate ('RR') and cost per point ('CPP') assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder",

As of December 31, 2023, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by approximately $376 million.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm's estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm's results of operations in any reporting period.\n\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management's judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not . Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes in the period enacted.\n\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss ('NOL') carryforwards and foreign tax credit ('FTC') carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management's estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income , including foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a\n\ndeferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2023, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.\n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available, including changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm's income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will generally impact the Firm's provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made.\n\nThe Firm's provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which could impact the Firm's effective tax rate.\n\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes.\n\n## Litigation reserves\n\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.",

('JPMorgan Chase' or the 'Firm') is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('U.S. GAAP').\n\nJPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase's management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the assessment, management used the 'Internal Control Integrated Framework' ('COSO 2013') promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO').\n\nBased upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon management's assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n\nJames Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nFebruary 16, 2024",

We also have audited the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Firm's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm's consolidated financial statements and on the Firm's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\n\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \u009f 300 Madison Avenue \u009f New York, NY 10017",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\n\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfoliobased component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $20.2 billion on total portfolio-based retained loans of $881.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The Firm's allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm's allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firm's forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in\n\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm's allowance for loan losses, including controls over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management's adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables .\n\n## Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and $541.4 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $11.3 billion of trading assets and $42.2 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include interest rate volatility, interest rate spread volatility, Bermudan switch value, and correlation relating to interest rates, interest rate-toforeign exchange, equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange, equity-to-interest rate and credit.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.",

These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and comparing management's estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value.

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 1 - Basis of presentation\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. ('JPMorgan Chase' or the 'Firm'), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the 'First Republic acquisition') from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC'). The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm's businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.\n\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\n\n## Voting interest entities\n\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations. For these types of entities, the Firm's determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities' voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\n\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\n\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the nonaffiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant interest.\n\nThe Firm's investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privatelyheld entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines.\n\n## Variable interest entities\n\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.\n\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE's investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE's assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nTo assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE's assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.\n\nTo assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE's capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.\n\nThe Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority votinginterest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm's involvement with a VIE cause the Firm's consolidation conclusion to change.\n\nRefer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored VIEs.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nInterest income\n\nThe Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a levelyield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nJPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management fees, commissions and other fees, and components of card income, when the Firm's related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm's revenue from contracts with customers.\n\n## Principal transactions revenue\n\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.\n\n## Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nJPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.\n\nGains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Offsetting assets and liabilities\n\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.\n\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of 'in the money' transactions are netted against the negative values of 'out of the money' transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase",

        "page_content": "agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.\n\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the 'demanding party'). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.\n\nRefer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm's derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm's securities financing agreements.\n\n## Statements of cash flows\n\nFor JPMorgan Chase's Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method\n\nThe adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the portfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that could be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material.\n\nRefer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information.\n\n## Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings ('TDRs')\n\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow ('DCF') methodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the postmodification effective interest rate, instead of the premodification effective interest rate.\n\nThe Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach.\n\nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an increase to retained earnings of $446 million, aftertax, predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card.\n\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs from those previously considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further information.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 - Fair value measurement\n\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value may also incorporate valuation adjustments.\n\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Valuation process\n\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm's Valuation Control Group ('VCG'), which is part of the Firm's Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm's positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm's Valuation Governance Forum ('VGF'), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm's Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.\n\n## Price verification process\n\nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risktaking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions.\n\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm:\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bidoffer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take.\n- \u00b7 The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to sufficiently reduce the net open risk position.\n- \u00b7 Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or",

Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.\n\n- \u00b7 Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm's own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 192 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.\n\n## Valuation model review and approval\n\nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models.\n\nUnder the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm's policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nA financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.",

        "page_content": "## Level 3 valuations\n\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 175-179 of this Note for further information on the Firm's valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\n\nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm's primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.\n\nIn the Firm's view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm's estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "## Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs\n\nThe following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.\n\nThe following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm's positions.\n\nYield - The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nCredit spread - The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgagebacked security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.\n\nPrepayment speed - The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.\n\nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\n\nConditional default rate - The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm's marketmaking portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented.\n\nLoss severity - The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender's lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nCorrelation - Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions.\n\nVolatility - Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\n\nBermudan switch value - The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement .\n\nInterest rate curve - The interest rate curve represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow.\n\nForward price - The forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception.\n\nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\n## Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\n\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm riskmanages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Credit and funding adjustments - derivatives\n\nDerivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm's own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.\n\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm's existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm's credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.\n\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm's FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm's positions with\n\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm's credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\n\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm's own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's own credit quality over time.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Credit and funding adjustments:          |        |        |        |\n| Derivatives CVA                          | $  221 | $  22  | $  362 |\n| Derivatives FVA                          | 114    | 42     | 47     |\n\n## Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities\n\nThe valuation of the Firm's liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm's own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm's probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm's credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI.

These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31,       |          |          |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| (in millions)                                  | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Other assets                                   |          |          |\n| Carrying value (a)                             | $  4,457 | $  4,096 |\n| Upward carrying value changes (b)              | 93       | 488      |\n| Downward carrying value changes/impairment (c) | (325)    | (826)    |\n\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm's interest in approximately 37 million Visa Class B common shares ('Visa B shares'). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares ('Visa A shares') at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875 at December 31, 2023 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\n\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm's estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23 million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa's stockholders approved amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that redenominate the Visa B shares to Visa Class B-1 common shares ('Visa B-1 shares') and authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers (\"the Program\") which, if conducted, would have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on a portion of Visa's B-1 shares through an exchange for Visa Class C common shares ('Visa C shares'). The Program would entitle the Firm to exchange its Visa B-1 shares, for Visa Class B-2 common shares ('Visa B-2 shares') and Visa C shares, through an initial exchange offer if and when conducted by Visa. The Visa B-2 shares would continue to be subject to the transfer restrictions associated with the Visa B shares. The Firm is then entitled to sell the Visa C shares received after a brief lock-up period expires, and Visa is also authorized to extend offers for potential future exchanges, each enabling the release of additional Visa B shares if certain conditions are met. The timing and likelihood of any initial or future exchange offer is dependent upon actions taken by Visa and other factors that may be outside of the Firm's control.",

However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nFinancial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value\n\nCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at\n\namounts that approximate fair value, due to their shortterm nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\n\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at December 31, 2023 and 2022, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value

For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\n\n- information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries.\n- \u00b7 Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm's credit spread as observed in the bond market.\n- \u00b7 Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements.",

Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm's risk appetite.\n\nIn the Firm's consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm's consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.\n\nThe Firm's wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans.\n\nThe Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nTerms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm's assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses.",

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm's derivatives are entered into for marketmaking or risk management purposes.\n\n## Market-making derivatives\n\nThe majority of the Firm's derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives.\n\n## Risk management derivatives\n\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variablerate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability.\n\nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm's net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollarequivalent values of the foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.\n\nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.\n\nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 214216 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\n\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 214 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 211-213 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.\n\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm's counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.\n\n## Derivative clearing services\n\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients' derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm's clearing services.\n\n## Accounting for derivatives\n\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.\n\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 207-214 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.",

However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm's risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.\n\nThere are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, for interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the portfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged.\n\nThe Firm employs the Portfolio Layer Method to manage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis adjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated to individual assets under certain circumstances. These include instances where the portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary dedesignation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currencydenominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nJPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm's net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.",

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.\n\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm's derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:\n\n- \u00b7 collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as \" Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets \" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\n- \u00b7 the amount of collateral

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features\n\nIn addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk - the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.\n\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties' favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm's and its subsidiaries' respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers\n\n| (in millions)                                   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables | $  14,655           | $  16,023           |\n| Collateral posted                               | 14,673              | 15,505              |\n\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2023 and 2022, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.\n\n## Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives\n\n|                                                                                  | December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                                                    | Single-notch  downgrade               | Two-notch  downgrade                  | Single-notch  downgrade               | Two-notch  downgrade                  |\n| Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade (a)                  | $  75  $                              | 1,153                                 | $  128  $                             | 1,293                                 |\n| Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade (b) | 93                                    | 592                                   | 88                                    | 925                                   |\n\n## Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP.

months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.6) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately six years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm's longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.\n\n## Net investment hedge gains and losses\n\nThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                                       | 2023 2023                           | 2023 2023                 | 2022 2022                           | 2022 2022                | 2021 2021                           | 2021 2021                |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions) | Amounts  recorded in  income (a)(b) | Amounts  recorded in  OCI | Amounts  recorded in  income (a)(b) | Amounts  recorded in OCI | Amounts  recorded in  income (a)(b) | Amounts  recorded in OCI |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives          | $384                                | $(1,732)                  | $(123)                              | $3,591                   | $(228)                              | $2,452                   |",

All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.\n\nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm's market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.",

        "page_content": "## Credit default swaps\n\nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity ('single-name'), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.\n\nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.\n\n## Credit-related notes\n\nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer makes periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.\n\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes. Other purchased protection also includes credit protection against certain loans in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes.",

        "page_content": "## Note 6 - Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense\n\n## Noninterest revenue\n\nThe Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management fees, commissions and other fees, and components of card income. The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known.\n\n## Investment banking fees\n\nThis revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client's transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.\n\nThe Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client's transaction.\n\nThe following table presents the components of investment banking fees.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2023     | 2022     | 2021      |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|\n| Underwriting                             |          |          |           |\n| Equity                                   | $  1,149 | $  975   | $  3,969  |\n| Debt                                     | 2,610    | 2,732    | 4,853     |\n| Total underwriting                       | 3,759    | 3,707    | 8,822     |\n| Advisory                                 | 2,760    | 2,979    | 4,394     |\n| Total investment banking fees            | $  6,519 | $  6,686 | $  13,216 |\n\nInvestment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB.\n\n## Principal transactions\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and\n- \u00b7 realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities.\n- - Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.\n- - Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.\n\nIn connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:\n\n- \u00b7 derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;\n- \u00b7 derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.\n\nRefer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities.\n\nIn the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.\n\nThe following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm's client-driven marketmaking activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense.\n\nTrading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.",

Depositrelated fees include fees earned from performing cash management activities, and providing overdraft and other deposit account services. Lending- and deposit-related fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided.

Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period.\n\nAll other asset management fees include commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees, based on the underlying fund's asset value or investor redemption activity.\n\nThe following table presents the components of asset management fees.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2023      |     | 2022      | 2021      |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|-----------|-----------|\n| Asset management fees                    |           |     |           |           |\n| Investment management fees               | $  14,908 | (a) | $  13,765 | $  14,027 |\n| All other asset management  fees         | 312       |     | 331       | 378       |\n| Total asset management fees              | $  15,220 |     | $  14,096 | $  14,405 |\n\nAsset management fees earned primarily by AWM and CCB.\n\n## Commissions and other fees\n\nThis revenue category includes commissions and fees from brokerage and custody services, and other products.\n\nBrokerage commissions represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients' purchases and sales of securities and other financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to thirdparty clearing houses and exchanges net against commission revenue.\n\nAdministration fees predominantly include fees for custody, funds services, securities lending and securities clearance.

Production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for further information on risk management activities and MSRs.\n\nNet interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income.\n\n## Card income\n\nThis revenue category includes interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder and presented net of certain transactionrelated costs. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.\n\nCertain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards\n\nprograms, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income.\n\n## Credit card revenue sharing agreements\n\nThe Firm has contractual agreements with numerous cobrand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the cobrand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to cobrand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years.\n\nThe Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners' marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange income is earned.\n\nThe following table presents the components of card income:\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)      | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interchange and merchant  processing income | $  31,021 | $  28,085 | $  23,592 |\n| Reward costs and partner  payments          | (24,601)  | (22,162)  | (17,868)  |\n| All other (a)                               | (1,636)   | (1,503)   | (622)     |\n| Total card income                           | $  4,784  | $  4,420  | $  5,102  |\n\nCard income is earned primarily by CCB, CIB and CB.",

These amounts are deferred in loans and investment securities, respectively, and recognized on a level-yield basis.\n\nRefer to Notes 10, 11, 12, and 20 for further information on accounting for interest income and interest expense related to investment securities, securities financing activities (i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and securities loaned), loans and long-term debt, respectively.\n\nThe following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense:\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)                                              | 2023      |     | 2022        | 2021               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|-------------|--------------------|\n| Interest income                                                                     |           |     |             |                    |\n| Loans                                                                               | $  83,384 | (e) |             | $ 52,736  $ 41,537 |\n| Taxable securities                                                                  | 17,390    |     | 10,372      | 6,460              |\n| Non-taxable securities (a)                                                          | 1,336     |     | 975         | 1,063              |\n| Total investment securities                                                         | 18,726    | (e) | 11,347      | 7,523              |\n| Trading assets - debt instruments                                                   | 15,950    |     | 9,053       | 6,825              |\n| Federal funds sold and securities  purchased under resale  agreements               | 15,079    |     | 4,632       | 958                |\n| Securities borrowed (b)                                                             | 7,983     |     | 2,237       | (385)              |\n| Deposits with banks                                                                 | 21,797    |     | 9,039       | 512                |\n| All other interest-earning assets (c)                                               | 7,669     |     | 3,763       | 894                |\n| Total interest income                                                               | $ 170,588 |     |             | $ 92,807  $ 57,864 |\n| Interest expense                                                                    |           |     |             |                    |\n| Interest bearing deposits                                                           | $  40,016 |     | $ 10,082  $ | 531                |\n| Federal funds purchased and  securities loaned or sold under  repurchase agreements | 13,259    |     | 3,721       | 274                |\n| Short-term borrowings                                                               | 1,894     |     | 747         | 126                |\n| Trading liabilities - debt and all  other interest-bearing  liabilities (d)         | 9,396     |     | 3,246       | 257                |\n| Long-term debt                                                                      | 15,803    |     | 8,075       | 4,282              |\n| Beneficial interest issued by  consolidated VIEs                                    | 953       |     | 226         | 83                 |\n| Total interest expense                                                              | $  81,321 |     |             | $ 26,097  $  5,553 |\n| Net interest income                                                                 | $  89,267 |     |             | $ 66,710  $ 52,311 |\n| Provision for credit losses                                                         | 9,320     |     | 6,389       | (9,256)            |\n| Net interest income after  provision for credit losses                              | $  79,947 |     |             | $ 60,321  $ 61,567 |",

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants' accounts based on their accumulated balances.\n\nThe Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their\n\ndependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan ('the 401(k) Savings Plan'), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual matching and pay credit contributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\n\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm's significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31,      | Defined benefit  pension and OPEB plans Defined benefit  pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit  pension and OPEB plans Defined benefit  pension and OPEB plans   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                 | 2023                                                                              | 2022                                                                              |\n| Projected benefit obligations                 | $  (14,740)                                                                       | $  (13,545)                                                                       |\n| Fair value of plan assets                     | 22,013                                                                            | 19,890                                                                            |\n| Net funded status                             | 7,273                                                                             | 6,345                                                                             |\n| Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) | (1,517)                                                                           | (1,916)                                                                           |\n\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was 5.16% and 5.14%, respectively.\n\n## Gains and losses\n\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets, partially offset by changes in the discount rate\n\nand interest crediting rate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm's U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firm's U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan's projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI.\n\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm's defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n\n|                                                             | Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans   | Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans   | Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans   | Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans Pension and OPEB plans   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions)                       | 2023                                                                   | 2022                                                                   |                                                                        | 2021                                                                   |\n| Total net periodic defined benefit plan cost/(credit) (a)   | $  (393)                                                               | $  (192)                                                               | (b)                                                                    | $  (201)                                                               |\n| Total defined contribution plans                            | 1,609                                                                  | 1,408                                                                  |                                                                        | 1,333                                                                  |\n| Total pension and OPEB cost included in noninterest expense | $  1,216                                                               | $  1,216                                                               |                                                                        | $  1,132                                                               |\n| Total recognized in other comprehensive (income)/loss       | $  (421)                                                               | $  1,459                                                               |                                                                        | $  (1,129)                                                             |",

Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each plan.\n\nThe discount rates used in determining the benefit obligations are generally provided by the Firm's actuaries, with the Firm's principal defined benefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan's projected cash flows.\n\n## Investment strategy and asset allocation\n\nThe assets of the Firm's defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of December 31, 2023, the approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the Firm's principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 0-2% real estate, and 0-10% alternatives.\n\nAssets held by the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Fair value measurement of the plans' assets and liabilities\n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Firm.\n\n## Pension plan assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\n|

        "page_content": "## Note 9 - Employee share-based incentives\n\n## Employee share-based awards\n\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase granted longterm share-based awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2023, 54 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the 'LTI Plans,' and such plans constitute the Firm's share-based incentive plans.\n\nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding.\n\nPerformance share units ('PSUs') are granted annually, and approved by the Firm's Board of Directors, to members of the Firm's Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm's achievement of specified performance criteria over a threeyear period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.\n\nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.\n\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights ('SARs') were generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase's common stock on the grant date. SARs generally expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs in 2023 or 2022.\n\nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee's full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.\n\nThe Firm's policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.\n\nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.",

Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously.

HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFor both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $7.1 billion resulting in the recognition of $38 million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. Refer to Note 1 and Note 24 for additional information.\n\nDuring 2022, the Firm transferred investment securities with a fair value of $78.3 billion from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized losses of $4.8 billion on the securities at the date of transfer.\n\nUnrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.\n\nTransfers of securities between AFS and HTM are non-cash transactions.",

Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm's internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody's,\n\nhowever the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default ('PD') and loss given default ('LGD')) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer's ability to fulfill its obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nAFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost.\n\nThe Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the security.\n\nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI.\n\nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security.\n\nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral ('pool losses') against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.\n\nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below 'AA' at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.\n\n## HTM securities - credit risk\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security's effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security.\n\nThe application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.\n\n## Credit quality indicator\n\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 99% and 98% rated at least AA+, respectively.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses on investment securities\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment securities was $128 million, $96 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings related to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Selected impacts of investment securities on the Consolidated statements of income\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2023      | 2022      | 2021     |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Realized gains                           | $  622    | $  198    | $  595   |\n| Realized losses                          | (3,802)   | (2,578)   | (940)    |\n| Investment securities losses             | $ (3,180) | $ (2,380) | $  (345) |\n| Provision for credit losses              | $  38     | $  54     | $  (36)  |",

Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.\n\nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm's credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation practices\n\nSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm's policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.",

        "page_content": "The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm's securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with\n\nsecurities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as 'Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,' and reduces the 'Net amounts' presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the 'Net amounts' below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n|

        "page_content": "## Note 12 - Loans\n\n## Loan accounting framework\n\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., 'retained')\n- \u00b7 Loans held-for-sale\n- \u00b7 Loans at fair value\n\nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm's loans by category:\n\n## Loans held-for-investment\n\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees.\n\n## Interest income\n\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.\n\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.\n\n## Nonaccrual loans\n\nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.\n\nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.\n\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis.\n\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.\n\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full.\n\n## Allowance for loan losses\n\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm's Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm's accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.\n\n## Charge-offs\n\nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and closed-end consumer loans, including modified credit card accounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off no later than 120 days past due.\n\nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that are determined to be collateraldependent.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing).\n- \u00b7 Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile.\n\nOther than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the governmentguaranteed portion of loans.\n\nWholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm's claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower's equity or the loan collateral.\n\nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model.\n\nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker's price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation ('exterior opinions'), which is then updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home ('interior appraisals'). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm's experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering statespecific factors.\n\nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm's policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.\n\n## Loans held-for-sale\n\nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.\n\nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.\n\nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.\n\nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm's allowance for loan losses and chargeoff policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm's nonaccrual policies.\n\n## Loans at fair value\n\nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue.\n\nInterest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.\n\nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm's allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the Firm's nonaccrual policies.\n\nRefer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.",

        "page_content": "## Loan classification changes\n\nLoans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-forsale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.\n\nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm's allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm's allowance for loan losses.\n\n## Loan modifications\n\nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm's economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrowerspecific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. Effective January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosure accounting guidance, which changed the accounting for loan modifications from TDRs to FDMs. Refer to Note 1 for further information .\n\nLoans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower's debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and welldefined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs is measured using the Firm's established allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion.\n\nFor periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of loans where the Firm granted concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty were accounted for and\n\nreported as TDRs. The concessions granted varied by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and included interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs.\n\nLoans modified in TDRs were generally measured for impairment using the Firm's established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remained subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan was performing and had been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion.\n\n## Foreclosed property\n\nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and other commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).\n\nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.",

These loans include home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.\n\nThe following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.\n\n| December 31, (in millions)   | 2023       | 2023   | 2022       |\n|------------------------------|------------|--------|------------|\n| Residential real estate      | $  326,409 | (a)    | $  237,561 |\n| Auto and other               | 70,866     |        | 63,192     |\n| Total retained loans         | $  397,275 |        | $  300,753 |\n\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower's continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower's current or 'refreshed' FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower's credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\n- \u00b7 For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.",

total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm's allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.",

The financial effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 20 years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.21% to 4.44% for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs.\n\nIn addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $69 million of loans subject to a trial modification, and $9 million of Chapter 7 loans for the year ended December 31, 2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n\n## Payment status of FDMs and redefaults\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real estate FDMs of $29 million were 30 or more days past due and FDMs that re-defaulted were $17 million.\n\n## Nature and extent of TDRs\n\nFor periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, new TDRs were $362 million and $866 million, and there were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs.\n\nThe Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.\n\nThe following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs during\n\nthe period presented.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.\n\nWhile the borrower's credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower's credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of\n\ncredit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in other credit quality indicators. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.\n\nThe Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders' FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.\n\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency and gross charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n|                                                           | December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 December 31,

If the borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.\n\n## Financial effects of FDMs\n\nThe following table provides information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs.\n\n| Year ended December 31, 2023 (in millions)        | Amortized cost basis   | % of loan modifications to total  retained credit card loans   | Financial effect of loan modification                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Loan modification                                 |                        |                                                                |                                                                                                          |\n| Term extension and interest rate reduction (a)(b) | $  648                 | 0.31 %                                                         | Term extension with a reduction in the  weighted average contractual interest rate  from 23.19% to 3.64% |\n| Total                                             | $  648                 | 0.31 %                                                         | Term extension with a reduction in the  weighted average contractual interest rate  from 23.19% to 3.64% |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm also had $27 million of credit card loans subject to trial modifications. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications are not considered FDMs.\n\n## Payment status of FDMs and redefaults\n\nThe following table provides information on the payment status of FDMs during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n| Year ended December 31, 2023 (in millions)                | Amortized  cost basis   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing | $  558                  |\n| 30-89 days past due and still accruing                    | 59                      |\n| 90 or more days past due and still accruing               | 31                      |\n| Total                                                     | $  648                  |\n\nThere were $50 million FDMs that re-defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2023 which were a combination of term extension and interest rate reduction.\n\nFor credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.",

The Firm granted concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These concessions involved placing the customer's credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically included reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. Substantially all modifications under the Firm's long-term programs were considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not reported as TDRs.\n\nThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.

        "page_content": "## Wholesale loan portfolio\n\nWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.\n\nThe primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.\n\nManagement considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor's debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor's earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm's internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody's, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.\n\nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management's assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm's definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.\n\nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor's ability to fulfill its obligations.\n\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.",

There were no additional unfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties for Secured by real estate loan FDMs.\n\n## Nature and extent of TDRs\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided various concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, new TDRs were $801 million and $881 million, respectively. New TDRs for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm.\n\nAs a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the population previously considered TDRs.",

        "page_content": "## Note 13 - Allowance for credit losses\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 t he allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n- \u00b7 the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and\n- \u00b7 the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.\n\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm's policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\n\n## Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments\n\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lendingrelated commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm's allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.\n\nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using\n\nan approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first.\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.\n\n## Collective and Individual Assessments\n\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.\n\n- \u00b7 Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.\n- \u00b7 Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms.\n\nThe majority of the Firm's credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment ('portfolio-based component'). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments.\n\nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure ('asset-specific component'). The asset-specific component covers collateral-dependent loans and riskrated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.\n\n## Portfolio-based component\n\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument's expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm's estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation",

The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm's central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management.\n\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties.\n\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n\n## Asset-specific component\n\nTo determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually.\n\nOn January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance as described in Note 1.\n\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement to measure the allowance for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology and allowed the option of a nonDCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate.\n\nThe Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual\n\nrisk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to apply. The adoption did not impact the collateral-dependent allowance approach or scope.\n\nThis guidance was adopted under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an increase to retained earnings of $446 million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card.\n\nFor collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of the collateral).\n\nFor non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. The asset-specific component of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan's expected cash flows including changes in interest rates, principal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as management's expectation of the borrower's ability to repay under the modified terms.\n\nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nIn addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm holds other financial assets that are measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit exposures arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements. Management estimates the allowance for other financial assets using various techniques considering historical losses and current economic conditions.\n\nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the",

Because of these mitigating factors, these exposures generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, management may also consider other factors such as the borrower's ongoing ability to provide collateral to satisfy margin requirements, or whether collateral is significantly concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with similar risk characteristics. If in management's judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these exposures is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default.",

The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices, and\n- \u00b7 $675 million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lendingrelated commitment portfolios.\n\nThe net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated recession risks due to high inflation and tightening financial conditions.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm's central case assumptions for the periods presented:\n\n|                                 | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | 2Q24                                                                                                                                           | 4Q24                                                                                                                                           | 2Q25                                                                                                                                           |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 4.1  %                                                                                                                                         | 4.4  %                                                                                                                                         | 4.1  %                                                                                                                                         |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 1.8  %                                                                                                                                         | 0.7  %                                                                                                                                         | 1.0  %                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                 | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022   | Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022 Central case assumptions  at December 31, 2022   |\n|                                 | 2Q23                                                                                                                                           | 4Q23                                                                                                                                           | 2Q24                                                                                                                                           |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 3.8 %                                                                                                                                          | 4.3 %                                                                                                                                          | 5.0 %                                                                                                                                          |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 1.5 %                                                                                                                                          | 0.4 %                                                                                                                                          | -

The Firm considers a 'Firm-sponsored' VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.\n\n| Line of Business   | Transaction Type                         | Activity                                                                                                                              | 2023 Form 10-K page references   |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                    | Credit card securitization trusts        | Securitization of originated credit card receivables                                                                                  | pages 261-262                    |\n| CCB CCB            | Mortgage securitization trusts           | Servicing and securitization of both originated and  purchased residential mortgages                                                  | pages 262-264                    |\n|                    | Mortgage and other securitization trusts | Securitization of both originated and purchased  residential and commercial mortgages, and other  consumer loans                      | pages 262-264                    |\n| CIB CIB CIB        | Multi-seller conduits                    | Assisting clients in accessing the financial markets in  a cost-efficient manner and structuring transactions  to meet investor needs | page 264                         |\n|                    | Municipal bond vehicles                  | Financing of municipal bond investments                                                                                               | pages 264-265                    |\n\nThe Firm's other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund's investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM's interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\n- \u00b7 Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB's maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other thirdparty transaction.\n- \u00b7 Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.\n\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 266 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\n\n## Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs\n\n## Credit card securitizations\n\nCCB's Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the 'Trust'). The Firm's continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller's interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.\n\nThe Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm's ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm's other continuing involvement with the\n\ntrusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant.\n\nThe underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm's other obligations or the claims of the Firm's creditors.\n\nThe agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $4.9 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 65%",

The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Firm's undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts\n\nThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\n\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm's maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.\n\n|                                 | Principal amount outstanding Principal amount

        "page_content": "## Residential mortgage\n\nThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization.\n\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.\n\nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities ('controlling class'). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.\n\n## Re-securitizations\n\nThe Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm's consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm's role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\n\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Transfers of securities to VIEs          |           |           |           |\n| U.S. GSEs and government  agencies       | $  18,864 | $  16,128 | $  53,923 |\n\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.\n\nThe Firm did not transfer any private label securities to resecuritization VIEs during 2023, 2022 and 2021, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the resecuritization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.",

The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with dealspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Dealspecific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm's potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.\n\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% dealspecific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.\n\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm's interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\n\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $9.8 billion and $13.8 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments reflect the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.\n\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $10.8 billion and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n\n## Municipal bond vehicles\n\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond ('TOB') trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates ('floaters') and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests ('residuals'). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2023 and 2022.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider's obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events",

In addition, the liquidity provider's exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.\n\nHolders of the floaters may 'put,' or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the\n\nliquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust's purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters.\n\nTOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\n\n## Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities\n\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n|                                         | Assets Assets Assets Assets   | Assets Assets Assets Assets   | Assets Assets Assets Assets   | Assets Assets Assets Assets   | Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities      | Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities   | Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2023 (in millions)         | Trading  assets               | Loans                         | Other (b)                     | Total  assets (c)             | Beneficial  interests in  VIE assets (d) | Other (e)                             | Total  liabilities                    |\n| VIE program type                        |                               |                               |                               |                               |                                          |                                       |                                       |\n| Firm-sponsored credit card trusts       | $                             | -

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## VIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm'slength, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.\n\n## Tax credit vehicles\n\nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $35.1 billion and $30.2 billion, of which $14.7 billion and $10.6 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n\n## Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)\n\nThe Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.\n\nThe Firm's maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $5.1 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.3 billion and $8.2 billion respectively.\n\n## Loan securitizations\n\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.\n\nFor loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm's creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).\n\nFor loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.",

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional information about the Firm's loan sales- and securitizationrelated indemnifications and Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm's sale of certain excess MSRs.",

Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.\n\nThe goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally determined based on how the Firm's businesses are managed and how they are reviewed. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate.\n\n| December 31, (in millions)   | 2023      | 2022               | 2021               |\n|------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Consumer & Community Banking | $  32,116 |                    | $ 32,121  $ 31,474 |\n| Corporate & Investment Bank  | 8,266     | 8,008              | 7,906              |\n| Commercial Banking           | 2,985     | 2,985              | 2,986              |\n| Asset & Wealth Management    | 8,582     | 7,902              | 7,222              |\n| Corporate                    | 685       | 646                | 727                |\n| Total goodwill               | $  52,634 | $ 51,662  $ 50,315 |                    |\n\nThe following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in  millions)                    | 2023      | 2022   | 2021                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|----------------------|\n| Balance at beginning of period                            | $  51,662 |        | $  50,315  $  49,248 |\n| Changes during the period from: Business combinations (a) | 917       | 1,426  | 1,073                |\n| Other (b)                                                 | 55        | (79)   | (6)                  |\n| Balance at December 31,                                   | $  52,634 |        | $  51,662  $  50,315 |\n\nGoodwill impairment testing\n\nThe Firm's goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 .\n\nThe goodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThe Firm uses the reporting units' allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. LOB's allocated capital levels are incorporated into the Firm's annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm's Board of Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.\n\nThe primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach\n\nprojects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units' annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm's overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management's forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm's overall estimated cost of equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm's businesses and competitor institutions.\n\nThe Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm's reporting",

In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.\n\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\n\n## Mortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\n\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread ('OAS') model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm's prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.",

        "page_content": "The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\n\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.\n\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted)        | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Fair value at beginning of period                                                           | $  7,973 | $  5,494 | $  3,276 |\n| MSR activity:                                                                               |          |          |          |\n| Originations of MSRs                                                                        | 253      | 798      | 1,659    |\n| Purchase of MSRs (a)                                                                        | 1,028    | 1,400    | 1,363    |\n| Disposition of MSRs (b)                                                                     | (188)    | (822)    | (114)    |\n| Net additions/(dispositions)                                                                | 1,093    | 1,376    | 2,908    |\n| Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows                                | (1,011)  | (936)    | (788)    |\n| Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions:                                         |          |          |          |\n| Changes due to market interest rates and other (c)                                          | 424      | 2,022    | 404      |\n| Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions:                                   |          |          |          |\n| Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service)                                                | (22)     | 14       | 109      |\n| Discount rates                                                                              | 14       | -        | -        |\n| Prepayment model changes and other (d)                                                      | 51       | 3        | (415)    |\n| Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions                              | 43       | 17       | (306)    |\n| Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions                                    | 467      | 2,039    | 98       |\n| Fair value at December 31,                                                                  | $  8,522 | $  7,973 | $  5,494 |\n| Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at December 31, | $  467   | $  2,039 | $  98    |\n| Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income             | 1,590    | 1,535    | 1,298    |\n| Third-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31, (in billions)                           | 632      | 584      | 520      |\n| Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at December 31 (e)        | 659      | 758      | 1,611    |",

These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use ('ROU') asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm's ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components.\n\nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm's collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe carrying values of the Firm's operating leases were as follows:\n\n| December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise  noted)                                       | 2023     |     | 2022     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----|----------|\n| Right-of-use assets                                                                             | $  8,431 | (a) | $  7,782 |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                               | 8,833    | (b) | 8,183    |\n| Weighted average remaining lease term  (in years)                                               | 8.4      |     | 8.4      |\n| Weighted average discount rate                                                                  | 4.01 %   |     | 3.55 %   |\n| Supplemental cash flow information                                                              |          |     |          |\n| Cash paid for amounts included in the  measurement of lease liabilities -  operating cash flows | $  1,662 |     | $  1,613 |\n| Supplemental non-cash information                                                               |          |     |          |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in  exchange for operating lease  obligations                      | $  2,094 |     | $  1,435 |\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2023     | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Rental expense                           |          |          |\n| Gross rental expense                     | $  2,079 | $  2,079 |\n| Sublease rental income                   | (72)     | (119)    |\n| Net rental expense                       | $  2,007 | $  1,960 |\n\nThe following table presents future payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2023:\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions)   |          |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n| 2024                                    | $  1,685 |\n| 2025                                    | 1,576    |\n| 2026                                    | 1,318    |\n| 2028                                    | 1,015    |\n| After 2028                              | 3,767    |\n| Total future minimum lease payments     | 10,530   |\n| Less: Imputed interest                  | (1,697)  |\n| Total                                   | $  8,833 |\n\nIn addition to the table above, as of December 31, 2023, the Firm had additional future operating lease commitments of $420 million that were signed but had not yet commenced.

The Firm's lease financings are predominantly auto operating leases.

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm's interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.20% and 4.89% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $41.1 billion and $28.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Firm's unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm's credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.",

        "page_content": "## Note 23 - Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share ('EPS') is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm's common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information.\n\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.\n\nThe following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions,  except per share amounts)                   | 2023      | 2022               | 2021                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| Basic earnings per share                                                           |           |                    |                      |\n| Net income                                                                         | $  49,552 |                    | $  37,676  $  48,334 |\n| Less: Preferred stock dividends                                                    | 1,501     | 1,595              | 1,600                |\n| Net income applicable to common  equity                                            | 48,051    | 36,081             | 46,734               |\n| Less: Dividends and undistributed  earnings allocated to participating  securities | 291       | 189                | 231                  |\n| Net income applicable to common  stockholders                                      | $  47,760 |                    | $  35,892  $  46,503 |\n| Total weighted-average basic shares  outstanding                                   | 2,938.6   | 2,965.8    3,021.5 |                      |\n| Net income per share                                                               | $  16.25  | $  12.10  $        | 15.39                |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                         |           |                    |                      |\n| Net income applicable to common  stockholders                                      | $  47,760 |                    | $  35,892  $  46,503 |\n| Total weighted-average basic shares  outstanding                                   | 2,938.6   |                    | 2,965.8    3,021.5   |\n| Add: Dilutive impact of unvested  PSUs, nondividend-earning RSUs  and SARs         | 4.5       | 4.2                | 5.1                  |\n| Total weighted-average diluted  shares outstanding                                 | 2,943.1   |                    | 2,970.0    3,026.6   |\n| Net income per share                                                               | $  16.23  | $  12.09  $        | 15.36                |",

JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase's expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.\n\nDue to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm's businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm's final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.\n\n## Effective tax rate and expense\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\n| Year ended December 31,                                                     | 2023   |     | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----|--------|--------|\n| Statutory U.S. federal tax rate                                             | 21.0 % |     | 21.0 % | 21.0 % |\n| Increase/(decrease) in tax rate  resulting from:                            |        |     |        |        |\n| U.S. state and local income  taxes, net of U.S. federal  income tax benefit | 2.8    |     | 3.5    | 3.0    |\n| Tax-exempt income                                                           | (0.9)  |     | (0.9)  | (0.9)  |\n| Non-U.S. earnings                                                           | 1.5    |     | 0.4    | 0.1    |\n| Business tax credits                                                        | (4.4)  |     | (5.4)  | (4.2)  |\n| Other, net                                                                  | (0.4)  |     | (0.2)  | (0.1)  |\n| Effective tax rate                                                          | 19.6 % | (a) | 18.4 % | 18.9 % |\n\nThe following table reflects the components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Income tax expense/(benefit)\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)            | 2023      | 2022     | 2021     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Current income tax expense/ (benefit)             |           |          |          |\n| U.S. federal                                      | $  8,973  | $  5,606 | $  2,865 |\n| Non-U.S.                                          | 4,355     | 2,992    | 2,718    |\n| U.S. state and local                              | 3,266     | 2,630    | 1,897    |\n| Total current income tax expense/ (benefit)       | 16,594    | 11,228   | 7,480    |\n| Deferred income tax expense/ (benefit)            |           |          |          |\n| U.S. federal                                      | (3,475)   | (2,004)  | 3,460    |\n| Non-U.S.                                          | 35        | (154)    | (101)    |\n| U.S. state and local                              | (1,094)   | (580)    | 389      |\n| Total deferred income tax       expense/(benefit) | (4,534)   | (2,738)  | 3,748    |\n| Total income tax expense                          | $  12,060 | $  8,490 | $ 11,228 |\n\nTotal income tax expense includes $68 million of tax benefits in 2023, $331 million of tax benefits in 2022, and $69 million of tax expenses in 2021, resulting from the resolution of tax audits.\n\nTax effect of items recorded in stockholders' equity The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders' equity, which are predominantly reflected in OCI as disclosed in Note 24.

The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets, was $14.6 billion and $12.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets, was $6.8 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred income tax expense/(benefit) reflects the differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management's judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established.

        "page_content": "## Unrecognized tax benefits\n\nAt December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $5.4 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, of which $3.9 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as much as approximately $1.1 billion. The change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result in a payment or income statement recognition.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)                          | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Balance at January 1,                                           | $  5,043 | $  4,636 | $  4,250 |\n| Increases based on tax positions  related to the current period | 1,440    | 1,234    | 798      |\n| Increases based on tax positions  related to prior periods      | 37       | 123      | 393      |\n| Decreases based on tax positions  related to prior periods      | (1,110)  | (824)    | (657)    |\n| Decreases related to cash settlements  with taxing authorities  | (9)      | (126)    | (148)    |\n| Balance at December 31,                                         | $  5,401 | $  5,043 | $  4,636 |\n\nAfter-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties related to income tax liabilities recognized in income tax expense were $229 million, $141 million and $174 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, in addition to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for income tax-related interest and penalties.\n\n## Tax examination status\n\nJPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the status of tax years that remain subject to income tax examination of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated subsidiaries by significant jurisdictions as of December 31, 2023.\n\n|                                  | Periods under  examination   | Status                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| JPMorgan Chase - U.S.            | 2011 - 2013                  | Field examination of  amended returns;  certain matters at  Appellate level               |\n| JPMorgan Chase - U.S.            | 2014 - 2020                  | Field examination of  original and amended  returns; certain  matters at Appellate  level |\n| JPMorgan Chase - New  York State | 2012 - 2014                  | Field Examination                                                                         |\n| JPMorgan Chase - New  York City  | 2015 - 2017                  | Field Examination                                                                         |\n| JPMorgan Chase - U.K.            | 2011 - 2020                  | Field examination of  certain select entities                                             |",

These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of the Firm's subsidiaries.\n\nThe business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable limits.\n\nThe Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central banks.\n\nThe Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, the Firm's broker-dealer activities are subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets.\n\nThe following table presents the components of the Firm's restricted cash:\n\n| December 31, (in billions)                                                   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Segregated for the benefit of securities and cleared  derivative customers   | 10.3    | 18.7    |\n| Cash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for  other general purposes | 9.3     | 8.1     |\n| Total restricted cash (a)                                                    | $  19.6 | $  26.8 |\n\nAlso, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had the following other restricted assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $40.5 billion and $42.4 billion, respectively.\n- \u00b7 Securities with a fair value of $20.5 billion and $31.7 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity.\n\n## Intercompany funds transfers\n\nRestrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. ('Parent Company') and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as 'covered transactions'), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary's total capital, as determined by the riskbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary's total capital.\n\nThe Parent Company's two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the 'IHC'). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase's subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).\n\nThe principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity 'thresholds' are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company's management or Board of Directors.\n\nAt January 1, 2024, the Parent Company's banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $20 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2024 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries' earnings during the year.",

The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm's principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach ('Basel III Standardized'), and an advanced approach ('Basel III Advanced'). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n\nThe three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these capital requirements established by its primary regulators .\n\nThe following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.\n\nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments .\n\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.",

The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party's failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off-balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.\n\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the noncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received),\n\nor other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\n\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm's risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires).\n\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 292.\n\nFor additional information on the guarantees, see below.\n\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.\n\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n\n|                                           | 2023 2023                                                 | 2023 2023                | 2022 2022                                                 | 2022 2022                |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| December 31, (in millions)                | Standby letters of credit and  other financial guarantees | Other letters  of credit | Standby letters of credit and  other financial guarantees | Other letters  of credit |\n| Investment-grade (a)                      | $  19,694                                                 | $  3,552                 | $  19,205                                                 | $  3,040                 |\n| Noninvestment-grade (a)                   | 9,178                                                     | 836                      | 8,234                                                     | 1,094                    |\n| Total contractual amount                  | $  28,872                                                 | $  4,388                 | $  27,439                                                 | $  4,134                 |\n| Allowance for lending-related commitments | $  110                                                    | $  37                    | $  82                                                     | $  6                     |\n| Guarantee liability                       | 369                                                       | -                        | 326                                                       | -                        |\n| Total carrying value                      | $  479                                                    | $  37                    | $  408                                                    | $  6                     |\n| Commitments with collateral               | $  16,861                                                 | $  539                   | $  15,296                                                 | $  795                   |",

As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.\n\nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\n\n## Derivatives qualifying as guarantees\n\nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less.\n\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as 'stable value products', that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty's reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions.\n\nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firm's maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount.\n\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm's view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\n\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n| (in millions)                                                                    | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Notional amounts                                                                 |                      |                      |\n| Derivative guarantees                                                            | $  54,562            | $  59,180            |\n| Stable value contracts with  contractually limited exposure                      | 32,488               | 31,820               |\n| Maximum exposure of stable  value contracts with  contractually limited exposure | 1,652                | 2,063                |\n| Fair value                                                                       |                      |                      |\n| Derivative payables                                                              | 89                   | 649                  |\n\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\n\n## Unsettled securities financing agreements\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements.\n\n## Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability\n\nIn connection with the Firm's mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm.\n\n## Private label securitizations\n\nThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.\n\nRefer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation.\n\n## Loans sold with recourse\n\nThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae",

        "page_content": "or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm's securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm's view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 292.\n\n## Other off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nIndemnification agreements - general\n\nIn connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients ('software licensees') or when it sells a business or assets to a third party ('thirdparty purchasers'), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.\n\n## Merchant charge-backs\n\nUnder the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder's favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder's issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,411.0 billion, $2,158.4 billion, and $1,886.7 billion, respectively.\n\n## Clearing Services - Client Credit Risk\n\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients' derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract.\n\nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client's positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member.\n\nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients' underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.\n\nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Exchange & Clearing House Memberships\n\nThe Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm's contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm's maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 292, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line.\n\n## Sponsored member repo program\n\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ('FICC') on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC's rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients' respective obligations under the FICC's rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm's maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 292. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\n\n## Guarantees of subsidiaries\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm's\n\ncounterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote.\n\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC ('JPMFC'), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm's unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 292 of this Note.

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 30 - Litigation\n\n## Contingencies\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.\n\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:\n\n- \u00b7 the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\n- \u00b7 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,\n- \u00b7 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and\n- \u00b7 the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\n\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\n\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.\n\n1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad ('1MDB'), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges 'dishonest assistance' against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. The Firm is challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court's jurisdiction to hear the claim. In August 2023 the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing.\n\nIn addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA's relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing.\n\nAmrapali . India's Enforcement Directorate ('ED') is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group ('Amrapali') relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry.\n\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange ('FX') sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under",

The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\n\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court denied certification of a class and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the District Court's decision is pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval.\n\nGovernment Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network . The Firm is responding to inquiries from civil government authorities regarding the handling of disputes related to transfers of funds through the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and responding to requests for information.\n\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws.\n\nIn September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement has been approved by the District Court and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.\n\nOf the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.\n\nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. In June 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement between the victim class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid $290 million to a fund for Epstein survivors. In November 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlement, rejecting objections, including those of certain state Attorneys General, regarding the victims' releases.\n\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association's ('BBA') London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') for various currencies and the European Banking Federation's Euro Interbank Offered Rate ('EURIBOR'). The Swiss Competition Commission's investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. The Firm is considering its options.\n\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in November 2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions.\n\nRussian Litigation . The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the freezing or restriction of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make, and is contractually excused from paying, under relevant sanctions laws, with judgment entered against the Firm in one claim in February 2024.

The Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm's liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires.\n\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court approval.\n\nShareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers.\n\nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm's resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. In December 2023, the court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\nA shareholder derivative suit was filed in May 2023 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against various officers and directors of the Firm asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that the defendants caused the Firm to retain Jeffrey Epstein as a client of the bank after defendants knew, or should have known, that Epstein was using the Firm's financial services to facilitate his alleged sex trafficking activities. In December 2023, the Court dismissed the derivative action.\n\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm's compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm's subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending.\n\nTrading Venues Investigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB's venue inventory and data completeness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not originally surveilled, which is nearly complete, and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into resolutions with two U.S. regulators that will require the Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent consultant, and pay aggregate civil penalties of approximately $350 million. The Firm is also in advanced negotiations with a third U.S. regulator, but there is no assurance that such discussions will result in a resolution. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these resolutions.\n\n*     *     *",

The Firm's legal expense was $1.4 billion, $266 million and $426 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.\n\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm's consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.",

The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm's U.S. operations serve international businesses.\n\nAs the Firm's operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm's segment reporting as set forth in Note 32.\n\nThe Firm's long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm's long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | Revenue (c)   | Expense (d)   | Income before  income tax  expense   | Net income   | Total assets   | Total assets   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 2023                                                      |               |               |                                      |              |                |                |\n| Europe/Middle East/Africa                                 | $  20,974     | $  11,947     | $  9,027                             | $  6,402     | $  529,335     | (e)            |\n| Asia-Pacific                                              | 10,605        | 6,550         | 4,055                                | 2,709        | 251,588        |                |\n| Latin America/Caribbean                                   | 3,294         | 1,971         | 1,323                                | 994          | 83,003         |                |\n| Total international                                       | 34,873        | 20,468        | 14,405                               | 10,105       | 863,926        |                |\n| North America (a)(b)                                      | 123,231       | 76,024        | 47,207                               | 39,447       | 3,011,467      |                |\n| Total                                                     | $  158,104    | $  96,492     | $  61,612                            | $  49,552    | $  3,875,393   |                |\n| 2022                                                      |               |               |                                      |              |                |                |\n| Europe/Middle East/Africa                                 | $  18,765     | $  11,754     | $  7,011                             | $  5,158     | $  558,430     | (e)            |\n| Asia-Pacific                                              | 10,025        | 6,763         | 3,262                                | 2,119        | 281,479        |                |\n| Latin America/Caribbean                                   | 3,178         | 1,697         | 1,481                                | 1,156        | 78,673         |                |\n| Total international                                       | 31,968        | 20,214        | 11,754                               | 8,433        | 918,582        |                |\n| North America (a)                                         | 96,727        | 62,315        | 34,412                               | 29,243       | 2,747,161      |                |\n| Total                                                     | $  128,695    | $  82,529     | $  46,166                            | $  37,676    | $  3,665,743   |                |\n| 2021                                                      |               |               |                                      |              |                |                |\n| Europe/Middle East/Africa                                 | $  16,561     | $  10,833     | $  5,728                             | $  4,202     | $  517,904     | (e)            |\n| Asia-Pacific                                              | 9,654         | 6,372         | 3,282                                | 2,300        | 277,897        |                |\n| Latin America/Caribbean                                   | 2,756         | 1,589         | 1,167                                | 878          | 65,040         |                |\n| Total international                                       | 28,971        | 18,794        | 10,177                               | 7,380        | 860,841        |                |\n| North America (a)                                         | 92,678        | 43,293        | 49,385                               | 40,954       | 2,882,726      |                |\n| Total                                                     | $  121,649    | $  62,087     | $  59,562                            | $  48,334    | $  3,743,567   |                |",

There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\n\n## Segment results and reconciliation (a)\n\n(Table continued on next page)\n\n| As of or for the

|\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment's performance.\n\nThe Firm's current allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.",

        "page_content": "## Note 34 - Business combinations\n\nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC'), as receiver. The Firm believes that the First Republic acquisition is complementary to the Firm's existing franchises. The acquisition resulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price.\n\nThe Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain.\n\nThe Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the settlement process under which the purchase price, and the identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a year after the acquisition date.\n\nIn addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain could change pending management's finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which may take place up to one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The Firm has continued to progress in the settlement process with the FDIC and refine its acquisition-date fair value estimates. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, adjustments totaling $63 million were made, increasing the estimated bargain purchase gain to $2.8 billion.\n\nIn connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement ('SFSLA'). The CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification\n\nassets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total assets acquired.\n\nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder.\n\nThe Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's $5 billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $25 billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on May 9, 2023.",

The core deposit intangible of $1.3 billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $180 million were valued by discounting estimated aftertax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset\n\nvaluations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other intangible assets.\n\n## Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements\n\nThe indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other",

        "page_content": "assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets is based on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price consideration.\n\n## Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances\n\nThe Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates.\n\nThe FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair values of the FHLB advances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB advance issuance rates.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance (\"UPB\") and estimated fair values of the loans acquired as of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments to the acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired through December 31, 2023.\n\n|                         | May 1, 2023  May 1, 2023   | May 1, 2023  May 1, 2023   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (in millions)           | UPB                        | Fair value                 |\n| Residential real estate | $  106,240                 | $  92,053                  |\n| Auto and other          | 3,093                      | 2,030                      |\n| Total consumer          | 109,333                    | 94,083                     |\n| Secured by real estate  | 37,117                     | 33,602                     |\n| Commercial & industrial | 4,332                      | 3,932                      |\n| Other (a)               | 23,499                     | 21,625                     |\n| Total wholesale         | 64,948                     | 59,159                     |\n| Total loans             | $  174,281                 | $  153,242                 |\n\n## Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\n\nIncluded in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net income contributed by First Republic of $4.4 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion and the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion. Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments.\n\nThe Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods, particularly in light of recent changes in market and economic conditions.\n\n|                     | Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31,   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)       | 2023                                              | 2022                                              |\n| Noninterest revenue | $  65,816                                         | $  66,510                                         |\n| Net interest income | 90,856                                            | 71,005                                            |\n| Net income          | 48,665                                            | 41,089                                            |",

The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 310-313 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.\n\n|                                                                                     | 2023 versus 2022 2023 versus

Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') Determinations Committee.\n\nCriticized: Criticized loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables that are classified as special mention, substandard and doubtful categories for regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a rating of CCC+/Caa1 and below, as defined by S&P and Moody's.\n\nCRO: Chief Risk Officer\n\nCRR: Capital Requirements Regulation\n\nCTC: CIO, Treasury and Corporate\n\nCustom lending: Loans to AWM's Global Private Bank clients, including loans to private investment funds and loans that are collateralized by nontraditional asset types, such as art work, aircraft, etc.\n\nCVA: Credit valuation adjustment\n\nDebit and credit card sales volume : Dollar amount of card member purchases, net of returns.\n\nDeposit margin: Represents net interest income expressed as a percentage of average deposits.\n\nDistributed denial-of-service attack: The use of a large number of remote computer systems to electronically send a high volume of traffic to a target website to create a service outage at the target.

For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative).

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm's Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his\n\nor her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.\n\n## Option ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\n\n## Prime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.\n\n## Subprime\n\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower's primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.\n\nMREL: Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities\n\nMSA: Metropolitan statistical areas\n\nMSR: Mortgage servicing rights\n\nMulti-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under management to more than one asset class.\n\nNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.\n\nNAV: Net Asset Value\n\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net chargeoffs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.\n\nNet interchange income includes the following components:",
