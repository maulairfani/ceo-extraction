NRG is a leading energy and  home  services  company  fueled  by  market-leading  brands,  proprietary  technologies  and  complementary  sales  channels. Across the U.S. and Canada, NRG delivers innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under brand names such as NRG, Reliant,  Direct  Energy,  Green  Mountain  Energy  and  Vivint,  while  also  advocating  for  competitive  energy  markets  and customer choice.

Through a diversified supply strategy, the Company sells reliable electricity and natural gas  to  its  customers  in  the  markets  it  serves,  while  also  providing  innovative  home  solutions  to  customers.  NRG's  unique combination  of  assets  and  capabilities  enables  the  Company  to  develop  and  sell  highly  differentiated  offerings  that  bring together every day essential services like powering and securing the home through a seamless and integrated experience. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to optimize its unique integrated platform to delight customers, generate recurring cash  flow,  significantly  strengthen  earnings  and  cost  competitiveness,  and  lower  risk  and  volatility.  Sustainability  is  a philosophy that underpins and facilitates value creation across NRG's business for its stakeholders. It is an integral piece of NRG's strategy and ties directly to business success, reduced risks and enhanced reputation.\n\nTo effectuate the Company's strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale counterparties in competitive markets and optimizing on additional revenue opportunities through its multiple brands and channels; (ii) offering a variety of energy products and services, including renewable energy solutions and smart home products and services that are differentiated  by  innovative  features,  premium  service,  integrated  platforms, sustainability and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) excellence in operating performance of its assets; (iv) achieving the optimal mix of supply to serve its customer load requirements through a diversified supply strategy; and (v) engaging in disciplined and transparent capital allocation.\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "The following transactions were completed during 2023 in furtherance of the Company's strategy: (i) the March 10, 2023 acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, a leading smart home platform company; (ii) portfolio optimization, including the sale of the Company's 44% equity interest in STP for $1.7 billion; and (iii) disciplined capital allocation through the execution of $1.2 billion in share repurchases and $1.4 billion in debt reduction.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nThe Company's core businesses are the sale of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial and wholesale customers, supported by the Company's wholesale electric generation, as well as the sale of smart home products and services.  NRG  manages  its  electricity  and  natural  gas  operations  based  on  the  combined  results  of  the  retail  and  wholesale generation businesses with a geographical focus. Vivint Smart Home operations are reported within the Vivint Smart Home segment.\n\nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas, other than Cottonwood;\n- \u00b7 East, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Services/Other, which primarily includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to customer, plant  and  market  operations  in  the  West  and  Canada,  (ii)  the  Services  businesses,  (iii)  activity  related  to  the Cottonwood facility and other investments;\n- \u00b7 Vivint Smart Home; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.\n\nIn  Texas,  the  Company's  generation  supply  is  fully  integrated  with  its  retail  load.  This  integrated  model  provides  the advantage of being able to supply a portion of the Company's retail customers with electricity from the Company's assets, which reduces the need to sell electricity to, and buy electricity from, other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in more stable earnings and cash flows, lower transaction costs and less credit exposure. The integrated model also results in a reduction in actual and contingent collateral through offsetting transactions, thereby reducing transactions with third parties.\n\nThe integrated model consists of three core functions in each geographic segment above: Customer Operations, Market Operations and Plant Operations.\n\n## Customer Operations\n\nCustomer Operations is responsible for growing and retaining the customer base and delivering an outstanding customer experience. This includes acquisition and retention of all of NRG's residential, small commercial, commercial and industrial, and government customers. NRG employs a multi-brand strategy that leverages a wide array of sales and partnership channels, direct face-to-face sales channels, call centers, websites, and brokers. Go-to-market activities include market strategy planning and development, product innovation, offer design, campaign execution, marketing and creative services, and selling. Customer portfolio  maintenance and retention activities  include  fulfillment,  billing,  payment  processing,  collections,  customer  service, issue resolution, and contract renewals. NRG provides energy and related services at either fixed, indexed or month-to-month prices. Home customers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to five years, while Business contracts are often between one year and five years in length. Throughout all Customer Operations activities, the customer experience is kept at the forefront to inform decision-making and optimize retention, while creating supporters and advocates for NRG's brands in the market. Customer Operations comprises three end-use customer facing teams: NRG Home, which serves residential customers, NRG Business, which serves business customers, and NRG Services, which primarily includes the Services businesses.\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nNRG sells a variety of products to residential and small commercial customers, including retail electricity and energy management,  natural  gas,  line  and  surge  protection  products,  HVAC  installation,  repair  and  maintenance,  home  protection products,  carbon  offsets,  back-up  power  stations,  portable  power,  portable  solar  and  portable  lighting.  Home  and  Services customers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, incentive, customer service, brand, innovative offers/features and referrals from friends and family. Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, NRG seeks  to  attract,  retain,  and  increase  the  value  of  its  customer  relationships.  NRG's  brands  are  recognized  for  exemplary customer service, innovative smart energy and technology product offerings, and environmentally-friendly solutions.\n\nThe Company provides power and natural gas to the business-to-business markets in North America, as well as retail services,  including  demand  response,  commodity  sales,  energy  efficiency  and  energy  management  solutions  to  Business customers.  The  Company  is  an  integrated  provider  of  supply  and  distributed  energy  resources  and  focuses  on  distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power and other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid. These solutions include system power, distributed generation, renewable and low-carbon products, carbon management",

These  objectives  are  intended  to reduce supply costs and maximize earnings with predictable cash flows.\n\nPower and natural gas are the two main commercial groups within Market Operations.\n\n## Power\n\nThe power commercial group is responsible for end-use electricity supply including power plant optimization and certain fuel supply. To meet the market operations objectives, NRG enters into supply, power and gas hedging agreements via a wide range of products and contracts, including (i) physical and financial commodity instruments, (ii) fuel supply and transportation contracts,  (iii)  PPAs  and  Renewable  PPAs  and  (iv)  capacity  and  other  contracted  revenue  or  supply  sources,  as  further discussed below.\n\nIn addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward purchases and sales contracts to manage commodity price risk.\n\n## Physical and Financial Commodity Instruments\n\nNRG trades power, natural  gas,  environmental,  weather  and  other  physical  and  financial  commodity  related  products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps. NRG enters into these instruments primarily to manage price and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio, manage working capital requirements, reduce the carbon exposure in its business and to comply with laws and regulations.\n\n## Fuel Supply and Transportation Contracts\n\nNRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel. The prices of fossil fuels can be volatile. The Company obtains its fossil fuels from multiple suppliers and through multiple transporters. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability, delays arising from extreme weather conditions and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly uniform across the Company's business and fuel products used. NRG's primary fuel requirements consist of the following:\n\nNatural Gas -  NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants. Fuel needs are managed by the natural gas commercial group, generally on a spot basis, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units as the dispatch is highly unpredictable. Natural gas storage and transportation contracts are utilized to reduce daily volatility.\n\nCoal -NRG  actively  manages  its  coal  requirements  based  on  forecasted  generation,  market  volatility  and  its inventory on site. The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for 2024. As of December 31, 2023, NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for the Company's expected requirements for 2024. For the domestic fleet, NRG purchased approximately 13 million tons of coal in 2023, almost all of which was Powder River Basin coal. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures, which will provide for the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next two years.\n\n## Renewable PPAs\n\nThe Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2023, NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 1.9 GW with third-party project developers and other counterparties, of which approximately 1.1 GW are operational. The average tenure of these agreements is eleven years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.\n\n## Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue or Supply Sources\n\nNRG's revenues and/or cash flows, primarily in the East and West, benefit from capacity/demand payments and other contracted  revenue  sources,  originating  from  market  clearing  capacity  prices,  tolling  arrangements  and  other  long-term contractual arrangements.",

        "page_content": "## Natural Gas\n\nThe natural gas commercial group is responsible for costing, logistics and supply for all of NRG's residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale customers. NRG has contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage assets across its footprint that allow for optimal supply economics in support of its various businesses. NRG's diversified load coupled with this asset portfolio enables the Company to deliver supply economically while providing incremental optimization activities when market  conditions  allow.  The  scale  of  the  natural  gas  operation  extends  from  the  wellhead  (through  its  producer  services business)  to  end  use  customers  (through  NRG's  various  sales  channels).  This  scale,  coupled  with  the  Company's  associated assets, gas system platform and people, create significant value across North America.\n\n## Plant Operations\n\nThe Company owns and leases a diversified wholesale generation portfolio with approximately 13 GW of fossil fuel, and renewable  generation  capacity  at  19  plants  as  of  December  31,  2023.  The  Company's  wholesale  generation  assets  are diversified  by  fuel-type  and  dispatch  level,  which  helps  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with  fuel  price  volatility  and  market demand  cycles.  NRG  continually  evaluates  its  generation  portfolio  to  focus  on  asset  optimization  opportunities  and  the locational value of its generation assets in each of the markets where the Company participates, as well as opportunities for the development of new generation.\n\nThe following table summarizes NRG's generation portfolio as of December 31, 2023:\n\n|                                                                                               | (In MW) (a)   | (In MW) (a)   | (In MW) (a)              | (In MW) (a)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| Type                                                                                          | Texas         | East          | West/Services/ Other (b) | Total         |\n| Natural gas    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 4,353         | 80            | 1,279                    | 5,712         |\n| Coal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 4,174         | 1,948         | 605                      | 6,727         |\n| Oil   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -             | 455           | -                        | 455           |\n| Utility Scale Solar  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | -             | -             | 216                      | 216           |\n| Battery Storage   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 2             | -             | -                        | 2             |\n| Total generation capacity                                                                     | 8,529         | 2,483         | 2,100                    | 13,112        |\n\nPlant Operations is responsible for operating the Company's generation facilities at the highest standards of safety and regulatory compliance, and includes (i) operations and maintenance, (ii) asset management, and (iii) development, engineering and construction.\n\n## Operations & Maintenance\n\nNRG operates and maintains its generation portfolio, as well as approximately 6,500 MW of additional coal, natural gas and wind generation capacity at 15 plants operated on behalf of third parties, as of December 31, 2023, using prudent industry practices  for  the  safe,  reliable  and  economic  generation  of  electricity  in  compliance  with  all  local,  state  and  federal requirements.  The  Company  follows  a  consistent  set  of  operating  requirements,  including  a  solid  base  of  training,  required adherence to specific safety and environmental limits, procedure and checklist usage, and the implementation of continuous process improvement through incident investigations.\n\nNRG  uses  best-in-class  maintenance  practices  for  preventive,  predictive,  and  corrective  maintenance  planning.  The Company's  strategic  planning  process  evaluates  equipment  condition,  performance,  and  obsolescence  to  support  the development of a comprehensive work scope and schedule for long-term performance.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nNRG manages all aspects  of  its  generation  portfolio  to  optimize  the  lifecycle  value  of  the  assets,  consistent  with  the Company's goals. The Company evaluates capital projects required for continued operation and strategic enhancement of the assets,  provides  quality  assurance  on  capital  outlays,  and  assesses  the  impact  of  rules,  regulations,  and  laws  on  business profitability. In addition, the Company manages its long-term contracts, PPAs, and real estate holdings and provides third-party asset management services.\n\n## Development, Engineering & Construction\n\nNRG develops, engineers and executes major plant modifications, 'new build' generation and energy storage projects that enhance the value of its generation portfolio and provide options to meet generation growth needs in the retail markets it serves, in  accordance  with  the  Company's  strategic  goals.

Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account.\n\nNet Heat Rate - The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.\n\nNet Capacity Factor - The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation by the station.",

        "page_content": "## Competition\n\nWhile  there  has  been  consolidation  in  the  competitive  retail  energy  space  over  the  past  few  years,  there  is  still considerable competition for customers. In Texas, there is healthy competition in deregulated areas and customers can choose providers based on the most appealing offers. Outside of Texas, electricity retailers compete with the incumbent utilities, in addition to other retail electric providers, which can inhibit competition depending on the market rules of the state. There is a high degree of fragmentation, with both large and small competitors offering a range of value propositions, including value, rewards, and sustainability-based offerings.\n\nWholesale generation is highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure by region. As such, there is wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the Company's competitors depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.\n\nThe smart home market is an expanding global opportunity and is in the early stages of broad consumer adoption. It is highly competitive and fragmented. Major competitors range from large-cap technology companies seeking to expand their core market opportunity who predominantly offer do-it-yourself (\"DIY\") devices that put a large burden on homeowners to selfinstall and support many devices, to security-based providers, as well as industrial and telecommunications companies that offer connected home experiences. Vivint Smart Home provides the full smart home experience, with an end-to-end solution that includes  a  wide  range  of  unique  capabilities  and  use  cases.  Currently,  the  vast  majority  of  competitors  do  not  offer comprehensive smart home solutions and accompanying services.\n\n## Seasonality and Price Volatility\n\nThe  sale  of  power  and  natural  gas  to  retail  customers  are  seasonal  businesses  with  the  demand  for  power  generally peaking  during  the  summer,  and  the  demand  for  natural  gas  generally  peaking  during  the  winter.  As  a  result,  net  working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer and winter months along with the higher  revenues,  and  then  decline  during  off-peak  months.  Weather  may  impact  operating  results  and  extreme  weather conditions could have a material impact. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices  and  market  dynamics,  such  as  the  price  of  natural  gas,  transmission  constraints,  competitor  actions,  and  changes  in market heat rates.\n\nAnnual and quarterly operating results of the Company's generation portfolio can be significantly affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the regions in which the Company operates.\n\n## Market Framework\n\nNRG sells electricity, natural gas and related products and services, and smart home products and services to customers throughout  the  U.S.  and  Canada.  In  most  of  the  states  and  regions  that  have  introduced  retail  consumer  choice,  NRG competitively  offers  electricity,  natural  gas,  portable  power  and  other  value-enhancing  services  to  customers.  Each  retail consumer choice state  or  province  establishes  its  own  retail  competition  laws  and  regulations,  and  the  specific  operational, licensing, and compliance requirements vary by state or province. Regulated terms and conditions of default service, as well as any movement to replace default service with competitive services, as is done in ERCOT, can affect customer participation in retail competition. In Canada, NRG sells energy and related services to residential and commercial customers in the province of Alberta pursuant both to a regulated rate service governed by provincial regulations as well as a competitive service with rates set  by  market  forces.  Sales  of  energy  to  commercial  customers  take  place  in  other  provinces  as  well.  The  attractiveness  of NRG's  retail  offerings  may  be  impacted  by  the  rules,  regulations,  market  structure  and  communication  requirements  from public utility commissions in each state and province.\n\nNRG's fleet of power plants which it owns, operates or manages are located in organized energy markets, known as RTOs or  ISOs.  Each  organized  market  administers  day-ahead  and  real-time  centralized  bid-based  energy  and  ancillary  services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates.\n\nOther  than  ERCOT  and  AESO,  each  of  the  ISO  regions  also  operates  a  capacity  or  resource  adequacy  market  that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations.",

        "page_content": "## Texas\n\nNRG's  business  in  Texas  is  subject  to  standards  and  regulations  adopted  by  the  PUCT  and  ERCOT 1 ,  including  the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and, historically, fastest growing power markets. ERCOT is an energy-only market. The majority of the retail load in the ERCOT market region is served by competitive retail suppliers, except certain areas that have not opted into competitive consumer choice and are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives.\n\n## East\n\nWhile most of the states in the East region of the U.S. have introduced some level of retail consumer choice for electricity and/or natural gas, the incumbent utilities currently provide default service in most of the states and as a result typically serve the majority of residential customers. NRG's retail activities in the East are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the ISOs, state public utility commissions and legislators, including the requirement for retailers to be certified in each state in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity.\n\nPower plants owned, operated or managed by NRG and NRG's demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of PJM, NYISO and MISO. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, the assets in the East region receive a significant portion of their revenues from capacity markets. PJM uses a forward capacity auction, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction. MISO has an annual auction. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. PJM operates a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on realtime generator performance. In such markets, NRG's actual capacity revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MW cleared, plus the net of any over-performance \"bonus payments\" and any under-performance charges. Additionally, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids.\n\n## West\n\nIn the West region of the U.S., NRG owns equity interests, operates or manages power plants located entirely within the CAISO footprint.  The  CAISO operates  day-ahead  and  real-time  locational  markets  for  energy  and  ancillary  services,  while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity  products  at  market-based  rates,  either  within  the  CAISO's  centralized  energy  and  ancillary  service  markets  or bilaterally. The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas. Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly.\n\n## Canada\n\nIn Canada, NRG sells to residential and commercial retail customers in Alberta, within the AESO footprint, under both regulated  rates  approved  by  the  AUC  as  well  as  through  competitive  service.  The  Company's  regulated  rates  are  approved through periodic rate applications that establish rates for power and gas sales as well as for recovery of other costs associated with operating the regulated business. In addition, the Company sells energy to commercial customers in other provinces. All sales and operations are subject to applicable federal and provincial laws and regulations.\n\n## Vivint Smart Home\n\nVivint  Smart  Home  operates  in  states  that  regulate  in  some  manner  the  sale,  installation,  servicing,  monitoring  or maintenance of smart home and electronic security systems. Vivint Smart Home and Vivint Smart Home sales representatives are typically required to obtain and maintain licenses, certifications or similar permits from governmental entities as a condition to engaging in the smart home and security service business. Vivint Smart Home is subject to federal and state laws related to consumer financing  which  may  include  rules  related  to  fees  and  charges,  disclosures  and  regulation  of  the  party  extending consumer credit.",

        "page_content": "## Energy Regulatory Matters\n\nAs participants in wholesale and retail energy markets and owners and operators of power plants, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal, state and provincial agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, and the PUCT, as well as  other  public  utility  commissions  in  certain  states  where  NRG's  generation  or  distributed  generation  assets  are  located.  In addition,  NRG  is  subject  to  the  market  rules,  procedures  and  protocols  of  the  various  ISO  and  RTO  markets  in  which  it participates. These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that may impact NRG's wholesale and retail operations. NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.\n\nNRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT.\n\n## Regional Regulatory Developments\n\nNRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 -  Note 24, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Texas\n\nPublic  Utility  Commission  of  Texas's  Actions  with  Respect  to  Wholesale  Pricing  and  Market  Design  The  PUCT continues  to  analyze  and  implement  multiple  options  for  promoting  increased  reliability  in  the  wholesale  electric  market, including the adoption of a reliability standard for resource adequacy and market-based mechanisms to achieve this standard. During the 88th Regular Session, the Texas Legislature authorized deployment of the Performance Credit Mechanism (\"PCM\"), which will measure real-time contribution to system reliability and provide compensation for resources to be available, subject to certain \"guardrails\" such as an annual net cost cap, as part of its adoption of the PUCT Sunset Bill (House Bill 1500). The Texas  Legislature  also  directed  the  PUCT  to  implement  additional  market  design  changes  such  as  the  creation  of  a  new ancillary service called Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service (\"DRRS\") to further increase ERCOT's capability to manage net load variability and firming requirements for new generation resources which penalize poor performance during periods of low grid reserves. The PUCT directed ERCOT to implement DRRS as a standalone product which will delay implementation until late 2025 or 2026. Additionally, through Senate Bill 2627, the Texas Legislature created the Texas Energy Fund, which received voter approval in November 2023, and will provide grants and low-interest loans to incentivize the development of more dispatchable generation and smaller backup generation in ERCOT. The PUCT has initiated a rulemaking proceeding to establish  the  process  by  which  the  Texas  Energy  fund  loan  proceeds  will  be  distributed.  A  final  rule  creating  the  general structure of the loan program is expected to be adopted in March 2024.\n\nOperating  Reserve  Demand  Curve  (\"ORDC\") -  On  August  3,  2023,  the  PUCT  approved  implementation  of  an enhancement to the ORDC as a bridge solution that was recommended by the ERCOT Technical Advisory Committee and the ERCOT board of directors. The ORDC enhancement will install price floors of $10 and $20 at reserve levels of 7,000 MW and 6,500 MW or below, respectively. ERCOT completed implementation on November 1, 2023.\n\nRuling  on  Pricing  during  Winter  Storm  Uri -  On  March  17,  2023,  the  Third  Court  of  Appeals  issued  a  ruling  in Luminant Energy Co. v. PUCT, which is an appeal relating to the validity of two orders issued by the PUCT on February 15 and 16, 2021, respectively, governing scarcity pricing in the ERCOT wholesale electricity market during Winter Storm Uri. The Third Court found that the PUCT exceeded its statutory authority by ordering the market price of energy to be set at the high system wide offer cap due to scarcity conditions as a result of firm load shed occurring in ERCOT. The Third Court reversed the PUCT's orders and remanded the case. On March 23, 2023, the PUCT filed a petition for review to the Supreme Court of Texas seeking reversal of the Third Court's decision, which was granted on September 29, 2023. The Court received briefing on the merits and oral arguments occurred on January 30, 2024. The outcome of this appeal could potentially require a retroactive repricing of the ERCOT market prices during the subject time period.\n\nVoluntary Mitigation Plan (\"VMP\") Changes - On March 13, 2023, the PUCT Staff determined that a portion of NRG's VMP should be terminated due to the increase in procurement of ancillary services by ERCOT, specifically non-spin reserve services, following Winter Storm Uri. As such, PUCT Staff terminated part of the VMP for NRG which provides protection from wholesale market power abuse accusations related to offers for ancillary services. NRG agreed with these changes to the VMP. At the March 23, 2023 open meeting, the PUCT approved the amended VMP. On February 23, 2024, NRG filed a notice of intent with the PUCT to terminate its existing VMP as of March 1, 2024.\n\nERCOT Request for Proposals for Winter Capacity - On October 2, 2023, ERCOT issued a Request for Proposals for Capacity (\"RFP\") for Winter 2023-2024. Proposals were due in early November to provide capacity for the December 1, 2023 to February 29, 2024 period. The RFP requirements were limited to demand response resources that have not participated in ERCOT or price responsive products. Ultimately, ERCOT cancelled the procurement due to lack of participation by qualified participants.",

Starting in January 2024, LP&L customers can shop for a REP. Customers who do not select a REP by February 15, 2024 will be assigned to one of three default REPs, one of which is Reliant. LP&L customers will start transitioning to their chosen REP or a default REP on March 4, 2024.\n\n## PJM\n\nRevisions to  PJM Local Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement -The Base Residual Auction for the 2024/2025 delivery year commenced on December 7, 2022 and closed on December 13, 2022. On December 19, 2022, PJM announced that it  would delay the publication of the auction results. On December 23, 2022, PJM made a filing at FERC to revise the definition of Locational Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement in the Tariff. This would allow PJM to exclude certain resources from the calculation of the Local Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement. On February 21, 2023, FERC accepted PJM's filing.  Multiple  parties,  including  NRG,  filed  for  rehearing.  Rehearing  was  denied  by  operation  of  law,  and  multiple parties,  including  the  Company,  filed  appeals  to  the  Third  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals.  The  price  of  the  auction  cleared significantly lower as a result of the PJM Tariff change.\n\nCapacity Performance Penalties and Bonuses from Winter Storm Elliott - PJM experienced approximately 23 hours of Capacity Performance events from December 23-24, 2022 across PJM's entire footprint. The Company is subject to penalty and bonus payments related to the events. On April 3, 2023, FERC approved PJM's request to allow Winter Storm Elliott penalty payments  to  be  spread  over  9  months  (with  interest)  and  allow  future  penalties  to  have  a  9  month  window  to  be  satisfied without interest. Multiple generators filed various complaints against PJM at FERC alleging that PJM violated its Tariff in, among other things, the manner in which it operated the system during Winter Storm Elliott and the resulting assessment of capacity  performance  penalties.  On  June  5,  2023,  FERC  issued  an  order  setting  the  various  complaints  for  settlement.  A settlement in principle was filed with FERC on September 29, 2023 and was approved on December 19, 2023.\n\nPJM Base Residual Auction Revisions and Delay On April 11, 2023, PJM filed, and FERC subsequently approved, to delay the Base Residual Auctions for the 2025/2026 to 2028/2029 delivery years. On October 13, 2023, PJM made two filings proposing to develop market reforms to improve the operation of the capacity market through changes to the Market Seller Offer  Cap  rules,  changes  to  PJM's  resource  adequacy  risk  modeling  and  capacity  accreditation  processes,  and  changes  to capacity performance enhancements. On January 30, 2024, FERC accepted certain reforms to PJM's resource adequacy risk modeling and accreditation processes; on February 6, 2024, FERC rejected PJM's proposed changes to certain Market Seller Offer  Cap  rules  and  capacity  performance  enhancements.  The  approved  changes  will  be  in  effect  for  the  2025/2026  Base Residual Auction scheduled to occur in July 2024, and will impact both demand and supply characteristics.\n\nPJM Files to Make Changes to the Performance Assessment Interval Trigger - On May 30, 2023, PJM filed proposed tariff revisions at FERC that narrow the definition of Emergency Actions used to determine Performance Assessment Intervals (\"PAIs\"). On July 28, 2023, FERC accepted the tariff revisions, and PJM made its compliance filing on August 28, 2023. The new  definition  narrows  the  instances  of  when  PAIs  can  occur  and  therefore  decrease  the  instances  of  when  capacity performance penalties are assessed.\n\nIndependent Market Monitor Market Seller Offer Cap Complaint On March 18, 2021, finding that the calculation of the default Market Seller Offer Cap was unjust and unreasonable, FERC issued an Order, which permitted the PJM May 2021 capacity auction for the 2022/2023 delivery rule to continue under the existing rules and set a procedural schedule for parties to file briefs with possible solutions. On September 2, 2021, FERC issued an order in response to a complaint filed by the PJM Independent Market Monitor's proposal, which eliminated the Cost of New Entry-based Market Seller Offer Cap, implemented a limited default cap for certain asset classes based on going-forward costs and provided for unit specific cost review by the Independent Market Monitor for all other non-zero offers into the auctions. On October 4, 2021, as required by the Order, PJM submitted  its  compliance  tariff  and  certain  parties  filed  a  motion  for  rehearing,  which  was  denied  by  operation  of  law.  On February 18, 2022, FERC addressed the arguments raised on rehearing and rejected the rehearing requests. Multiple parties filed appeals at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and on August 15, 2023, the Court denied the petitions for review. On January 12, 2024, the generator trade association filed a petition for review with the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the August 15, 2023 judgment.\n\n## California\n\nCalifornia  Resource  Planning  Proceedings -  As  part  of  the  Integrated  Resource  Procurement  docket,  the  CPUC  is requiring that all LSEs procure a pro rata share of 15.5 GW of new non-fossil resource adequacy (\"RA\") from 2023 to 2026. The  new  RA  program  rules  adopted  in  2023  are  now  in  an  implementation  phase  with  a  compliance  process  likely  to  be continually recalibrated through the first quarter of 2024. CPUC jurisdictional retail providers will be required to procure RA that meets their hourly load shape beginning in 2025. The result of these changes may create upward pressure on RA prices through  2024,  and  if  LSEs  cannot  meet  their  RA  obligations,  penalties  and  restrictions  on  serving  new  customers  may  be issued. As relief to the tightness of the RA market, the CPUC adopted a final decision in December 2023 to extend PG&E's",

The decision would allow the RA and GHG-free attributes of this 2-GW facility to be allocated to all LSEs to provide some relief to all LSEs' RA positions.\n\n## Other Regulatory Matters\n\nFrom time to time, NRG entities may be subject to examinations, investigations and/or enforcement actions by federal, state  and  provincial  licensing  agencies  and  may  face  the  risk  of  penalties  for  violation  of  financial  services,  consumer protections and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of power plants. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during operation of power plants. Federal and state environmental laws have become more stringent over time. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the Company's operations including  unit  retirements.  Complying  with  environmental  laws  often  involves  specialized  human  resources  and  significant capital and operating expenses, as well as occasionally curtailing operations. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options and the expected economic returns on capital.\n\nA  number  of  regulations  that  affect  the  Company  have  been  and  continue  to  be  revised  by  the  EPA,  including requirements regarding coal ash, NAAQS revisions and implementation, and effluent limitation guidelines. NRG will evaluate the impact of these regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated revisions and legal challenges are finally resolved.\n\n## Air\n\nThe  CAA  and  related  regulations  (as  well  as  similar  state  and  local  requirements)  have  the  potential  to  affect  air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO 2 , ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified  by  the  EPA  as  not  achieving  certain  NAAQS  (non-attainment  areas).  The  relevant  NAAQS  may  become  more stringent. On February 7, 2024, the EPA released a prepublication version of a final rule that when published in the Federal Register will increase the stringency of the PM2.5 NAAQS. The Company maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address continuing and new requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economic. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below.\n\nCPP/ACE Rules -  The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal and state regulations. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions from the power sector. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \"generation shifting\" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. On May 23, 2023, the EPA  proposed  significantly  revising  the  manner  in  which  new  and  existing  EGU's  GHG  emissions  should  be  regulated including using hydrogen as a fuel, capturing and storing/sequestering CO 2 and requiring new units to be more efficient. The EPA has stated that it intends to finalize these revisions in 2024. The Company expects that the final rule will be challenged in the courts and accordingly uncertain over the next several years.\n\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule (\"CSAPR\") - On March 15, 2023, the EPA signed and released a prepublication of a final rule that sought to significantly revise the CSAPR to address the good-neighbor obligations of the 2015 ozone NAAQS for 23 states after earlier having disapproved numerous state plans to address the issue. Several states, including Texas, challenged the EPA's disapproval of their state plans. On May 1, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the EPA's disapproval of Texas' and Louisiana's state plans, which disapprovals are a condition precedent to the EPA imposing its plan on Texas and Louisiana. Several other states are also similarly situated because of similar stays. Nonetheless, on June 5, 2023, the EPA published this rule in the Federal Register. On July 31, 2023, the EPA promulgated an interim final rule that addresses  the  various  judicial  orders  that  have  stayed  several  State-Implementation-Plan  disapprovals  by  limiting  the effectiveness of certain requirements of the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023 in Texas and five other states. The final rule decreases, over time, the ozone-season NOx allowances allocated to generators in the states not affected by the judicial stays beginning in 2023 by assuming that participants in this cap-and-trade program had or would optimize existing NOx controls and later install additional NOx controls. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal challenges to the: (i) various state disapprovals; (ii) the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023; and (iii) the interim final rule promulgated on July 31, 2023 that seeks to address the judicial orders.",

        "page_content": "Regional Haze Proposal -  On  May  2023,  the  EPA  proposed  to  withdraw  the  existing  Texas  Sulfur  Dioxide  Trading Program  and  replace  it  with  unit-specific  SO 2 limits  for  12  units  in  Texas  to  address  requirements  to  improve  visibility  at National Parks and Wilderness areas. If finalized as proposed, the rule would result in more stringent SO 2 limits for two of the Company's coal-fired units in Texas. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this proposal.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions -  NRG emits CO 2 (and  small  quantities  of  other  GHGs)  when  generating  electricity  at  a majority  of  its  facilities.  Nearly  all  of  NRG's  domestic  GHG  emissions  are  subject  to  federal  (U.S.  EPA)  GHG  reporting requirements.\n\nNRG's climate goals are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2025, from its current 2014 base year, and to achieve  net-zero  emissions  by  2050.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  included  in  NRG's  goals  are  directly  controlled  emissions, emissions from purchased electricity for NRG's consumption and emissions from employee business travel. In March 2021, the Science Based Targets initiative validated NRG's 2025 and 2050 goals as aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory. This validation  was  based  on  NRG's  business  in  2020,  prior  to  its  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy  and  Vivint.  Following  the acquisitions, the magnitude of NRG's indirect emissions changed, and the Company is currently in the process of analyzing these emissions.\n\nFrom the current 2014 base year through 2023, the Company's directly controlled CO 2 e  emissions decreased from 58 million metric tons to 24 million metric tons, representing a cumulative 58% reduction. The decrease is attributed to reductions in  fleet-wide annual net generation and an overall market-driven shift away from coal as a primary fuel to natural gas. The achievement of NRG's 2025 emissions reduction targets could be impacted by volatility within the power markets, driven by market conditions and changes in regulatory policies.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, less than 5% of the Company's consolidated revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets.\n\nThe following charts reflect the Company's domestic generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for  through  equity  method  investments,  but  excluding  the  battery  storage  and  remaining  renewables  activity.  Prior  year information on U.S. CO 2 e emissions and U.S. generation was adjusted to remove divested assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Byproducts\n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized a rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy surface impoundments. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some  of  the  deadlines.  On  November  12,  2020,  the  EPA  finalized  \"A  Holistic  Approach  to  Closure  Part  B:  Alternative Demonstration  for  Unlined  Surface  Impoundments,\"  which  further  amended  the  April  2015  Rule  to,  among  other  things, provide procedures for requesting approval to operate existing ash impoundments with an alternate liner. On May 23, 2023, the EPA proposed establishing requirements for: (i) inactive (or legacy) surface impoundments at inactive facilities and (ii) all CCR management units (regardless of how or when the CCR was placed) at regulated facilities. NRG anticipates further rulemaking related to legacy surface impoundments and the Federal Permit Program.",

        "page_content": "## Domestic Site Remediation Matters\n\nUnder certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances  or  petroleum  products.  NRG  may  be  responsible  for  property  damage,  personal  injury  and  investigation  and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations.\n\nJewett Mine Lignite Contract -The Company's Limestone facility historically burned lignite obtained from the Jewett mine. Active mining ceased as of December 31, 2016; however, the Company remains responsible for reclamation activities and is responsible for all reclamation costs. NRG has recorded an adequate ARO liability. The Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of approximately $112 million for the reclamation of the Jewett mine, which NRG supports through  surety  bonds.  The  cost  of  the  reclamation  may  exceed  the  value  of  the  bonds.  NRG  may  provide  additional performance assurance if required by the Railroad Commission of Texas.\n\n## Water\n\nThe  Company  is  required  under  the  CWA  to  comply  with  intake  and  discharge  requirements,  requirements  for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements.\n\nEffluent  Limitations  Guidelines -  I n  2015,  the  EPA  revised  the  Effluent  Limitations  Guidelines  (\"ELG\")  for  Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that,  among  other  things,  postponed  the  compliance  dates  to  preserve  the  status  quo  for  FGD  wastewater  and  bottom  ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for  bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. In October 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its two plants that have coal-fired units in Texas. On March 29, 2023, the EPA proposed revisions to the ELG and sought comments, which the EPA is analyzing.\n\n## Regional Environmental Developments\n\nAsh  Regulation  in  Illinois -  On  July  30,  2019,  Illinois  enacted  legislation  that  required  the  state  to  promulgate regulations regarding coal ash at surface impoundments. On April 15, 2021, the state promulgated the implementing regulation, which became effective on April 21, 2021. NRG has applied for initial operating permits and construction permits (for closure and retrofits) as required by the regulation and is waiting for permits to be issued by the Illinois EPA.\n\nHouston Nonattainment for 2008 Ozone Standard - During the fourth quarter of 2022, the EPA changed the Houston area's  classification  from  Serious  to  Severe  nonattainment  for  the  2008  Ozone  Standard.  Accordingly,  Texas  is  required  to develop a new control strategy and submit it to the EPA, which is expected by May 2024.\n\n## Customers\n\nNRG sells to a wide variety of customers, primarily end-use customers in the residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale sectors. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers, such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company had no customer that comprised more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries had 18,131 employees, including 5,187 active smart home direct sales and installation individuals, which are largely seasonal. Approximately 4% of the Company's employees were covered by U.S. collective bargaining agreements. During 2023, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.\n\nNRG believes  its  employees  are  vital  to  its  success  and  is  committed  to  offering  employees  a  rewarding  career  that provides opportunities for growth and the ability to make valuable contributions toward the achievement of the Company's business objectives. NRG focuses on safety, health and wellness, diversity, equity and inclusion, talent development and total rewards for its employees.",

In 2023, NRG completed a gender and race pay equity study to analyze the Company's pay decisions in light of gender, race, or other similar factors.  The  study  demonstrated  equitable  pay  practices  after  accounting  for  job  level,  experience,  tenure  and  location.  The Company first conducted this study in 2020 and committed to conduct the study every three years. In 2023, Forbes and Statista recognized NRG as one of The Best Employers for Diversity. Also in 2023, NRG created designated reflection rooms in its headquarters to accommodate religious practices and reflection. NRG held its first Lunar New Year's celebrations hosted by VIVIDH, the Company's Asian American Pacific Islander Business Resource Group. The Company also hosted its inaugural listening  session  in  recognition  of  Canada's  National  Day  for  Truth  and  Reconciliation  sponsored  by  RISE,  its  Indigenous Communities Business Resource Group.\n\n## Talent Development\n\nNRG deploys various talent development strategies and programs with the goal of ensuring a pipeline of leadership that can execute on the Company's strategy and drive value for all stakeholders. The Board of Directors regularly engages with management  on  leadership  development  and  succession  planning,  including  providing  feedback  on  development  plans  and bench strength for key senior leader positions. The Board of Directors also has a structured program that allows directors to interact  directly  with  individuals  deeper  within  the  organization  whom  management,  through  a  robust  talent  assessment program, as well as mentoring relationships, has identified as high potential future leaders. In 2021, the Company launched an annual Emerging Leaders Program to strengthen the identified pipeline of future leaders and create a cohort of high potential candidates for leadership positions. In 2023, the Company launched a front-line leader program called Peak Leadership with the intent to onboard first-level leaders into their leadership role in select business units and is planning to expand its impact in 2024.  The  Company  has  a  performance  management  tool  that  emphasizes  a  continuous  feedback  loop  and  a  robust  online training curriculum with topics including leadership, communication and productivity.",

        "page_content": "## Item 1A - Risk Factors\n\nNRG's risk factors are grouped into the following categories: (i) Risks Related to the Acquisition of Vivint Smart Home; (ii) Risks Related to the Operation of NRG's Business; (iii) Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Laws; and (iv) Risks Related to Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and the Company's Indebtedness.\n\n## Risks Related to the Acquisition of Vivint Smart Home\n\n## The acquisition of Vivint Smart Home may not achieve its intended results and its integration may disrupt or have a negative impact on the Company's business.\n\nAchieving the anticipated cost savings and operating efficiencies from the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home is subject to risks, including whether the businesses of NRG and Vivint Smart Home are integrated in an efficient and effective manner. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 the difficulty of managing and integrating Vivint Smart Home and its operations;\n- \u00b7 difficulties  in  implementing  and  maintaining  uniform  processes,  systems,  standards,  controls,  procedures,  practices, policies and compensation standards;\n- \u00b7 unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications, and other systems;\n- \u00b7 the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n- \u00b7 the potential difficulty in managing an increased number of locations and employees;\n- \u00b7 difficulty addressing any possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies; and\n- \u00b7 the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired.\n\nMany of these  factors  are  outside  of  the  Company's  control.  Failure  to  address  these  risks  effectively  could  result  in increased costs, lower-than-expected revenues or income generated by the combined company and diversion of management's time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial results and prospects.\n\n## Risks Related to the Operation of NRG's Business\n\n## NRG's financial  performance  may  be  impacted  by  price  fluctuations  in  the  retail  and  wholesale  power  and  natural  gas markets, as well as fluctuations in coal and oil markets and other market factors that are beyond the Company's control.\n\nMarket prices for power, capacity, ancillary services, natural gas, coal, oil and renewable energy credits are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially. Electric power generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. Long  and  short-term  power  and  gas  prices  may  also  fluctuate  substantially  due  to  other  factors  outside  of  the  Company's control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in generation capacity in the Company's markets, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new plants, expansion of existing plants, the continued operation of uneconomic power plants due to state subsidies, retirement of existing plants or addition of new transmission capacity;\n- \u00b7 electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions;\n- \u00b7 changes in power and gas transmission infrastructure;\n- \u00b7 transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n- \u00b7 weather  conditions,  including  extreme  weather  conditions  and  seasonal  fluctuations,  including  the  effects  of  climate change;\n- \u00b7 changes in commodity prices and the supply of commodities, including but not limited to natural gas, coal and oil;\n- \u00b7 changes in the demand for power or gas, or in patterns of power or gas usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools and practices, distributed generation, and more efficient end-use technologies;\n- \u00b7 development of new fuels, new technologies and new forms of competition for the production of power;\n- \u00b7 economic and political conditions;\n- \u00b7 changes in law, including judicial decisions, environmental regulations and environmental legislation; and\n- \u00b7 federal, state and provincial power regulations and legislation, and regulations and actions of the ISO and RTOs.\n\nWhile  retail  rates  are  generally  designed  to  allow  retail  sellers  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  to  pass  through  price fluctuations  and  other  changes  to  costs,  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  pass  through  all  such  changes  to  customers.  For example, serving retail power customers in ISOs that have a capacity market exposes the Company to the risk that capacity costs  can  change  and  may  not  be  recoverable,  or  the  Company  may  engage  in  sales  of  power  at  fixed  prices.  Additionally, increases in wholesale costs to retail customers may cause additional customer defaults or increased customer attrition, or may be impacted by regulatory rules.\n\nFurther, in low natural gas price environments, natural gas can be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. The Company enters into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate its base load coal-fired generating facilities. The Company may experience periods where it holds excess amounts of coal if fuel",

In addition, the Company may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of its generating requirements.\n\nSuch factors and the associated fluctuations in power prices have affected the Company's wholesale and retail profitability in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\n\n## Volatile  power  and  gas  supply  costs  and  demand  for  power  and  gas  could  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of NRG's retail operations.\n\nThe Company's earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which the wholesale power or gas prices rise  at  a  greater  rate  than  the  rates  the  Company  can  charge  to  customers.  The  price  of  wholesale  electricity  and  gas supply  purchases  associated  with  the  retail  operations'  energy  commitments  can  be  different  than  that  reflected  in  the  rates charged to customers due to, among other factors:\n\n- \u00b7 varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of entering into related contracts;\n- \u00b7 subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas;\n- \u00b7 daily, monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the price of natural gas relative to the 12-month forward prices;\n- \u00b7 transmission and transportation constraints and the Company's ability to move power or gas to its customers; and\n- \u00b7 changes in market heat rate (i.e., the relationship between power and natural gas prices).\n\nThe Company's earnings and cash flows could also be adversely affected in any period in which its customers' actual usage  of  electricity  or  gas  significantly  varies  from  the  forecasted  usage,  which  could  occur  due  to,  among  other  factors, weather events, changes in usage patterns, competition and economic conditions.\n\n## NRG's trading operations and use of hedging agreements could result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of operations,  and  NRG's  hedging  activities  may  increase  the  volatility  in  the  Company's  quarterly  and  annual  financial results.\n\nThe Company typically enters  into  hedging  agreements,  including  contracts  to  purchase  or  sell  commodities  at  future dates  and  at  fixed  prices,  to  manage  the  commodity  price  risks  inherent  in  its  business.  The  Company's  risk  management policies and hedging procedures may not mitigate risk as planned, and the Company may fail to fully or effectively hedge its commodity  supply  and  price  risk.  In  addition,  these  activities,  although  intended  to  mitigate  price  volatility,  expose  the Company to other risks. When the Company sells or buys power or gas forward, it gives up the opportunity to buy or sell at the future price, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The Company also relies on counterparty performance under its hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the Company's business, operating results or financial position.\n\nNRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the Company's results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity prices.\n\nNRG  may  engage  in  trading  activities,  including  the  trading  of  power,  natural  gas,  fuel,  emissions  allowances, environmental attributes and credits, weather, and other physical and financial commodity related products that are not directly related to the operation of the Company's generation facilities or the management of related risks. These trading activities take place in volatile markets and some of these trades could be characterized as speculative. This trading activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.\n\nNRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts. These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"), which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or a scope exception. As a result, the Company's quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices.\n\n## Competition  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and  the  market  value  of  its assets.\n\nThe Company's retail operations face competition for customers. Competitors may offer different products, lower prices, and other incentives which may attract customers away from the Company. In some retail electricity markets, the principal competitor may be the incumbent utility. The incumbent utility often has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers and strong brand recognition. Furthermore, NRG may face competition from other energy service providers, other",

Over time, the Company's plants may be unable to compete with these more efficient plants, which could result in asset retirements.\n\nNRG's competitors may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more  effective  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  greater  ability  to  incur  losses,  longer-standing  relationships  with customers, greater brand awareness, greater potential for profitability from retail sales or greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary services than NRG does. Competitors may also have better access to subsidies or other out-of-market payments that put NRG at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nNRG's competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or devote greater resources to marketing of retail energy and home services than NRG can. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share.\n\nThere can be no assurance that NRG will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## NRG's  strategy  relies,  in  part,  on  its  ability  to  cross-serve  and  optimize  its  network  of  retail  and  Smart  Home  services customers, and if it is unable to retain existing customers and expand their use of the Company's products and services, its expected growth and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nAs part of NRG's growth strategy, it is important for the Company to cross-sell energy sales and services to smart home services subscribers and smart home services to residential retail customers. As the Company continues pursuing cross-selling opportunities between these customers, there can be no assurances that its efforts in this regard will be successful. Additionally, for the Company to be successful in such cross-selling opportunities, it must retain its existing customers. The length of the terms for which NRG's retail customers are contracted can be for multi-year periods, but many customers are contracted for a period of one year or less. Smart home services customers historically have entered into subscriptions that range from three to five years. These customers are not obligated to, and may not, renew their contracts or subscriptions after the expiration of their original commitments. If customers terminate their contracts, do not renew their contracts or do not expand their use of NRG's products and services, the Company's growth strategy may not be successful and its expected results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n## NRG's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel supplies.\n\nNRG relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel a majority of its power generation facilities. Grid operations depend on the continuing financial viability  of  contractual  counterparties,  as  well  as  the  infrastructure  (including  rail  lines,  rail  cars,  barge facilities,  roadways,  riverways  and  natural  gas  pipelines)  available  to  serve  generation  facilities  and  to  ensure  that  there  is sufficient power produced to meet retail demand. As a result, the Company's wholesale generation facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its generation facilities if no fuel is available at any price, if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.\n\nNRG routinely hedges both its wholesale sales and purchases to support its retail load obligations. In order to hedge these obligations, the Company may enter into long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel. Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company's fuel supplies or power supply arrangements may therefore require it to supply replacement power either by running its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from third-party sources at market prices that could substantially exceed the contract price, or to pay damages to counterparties for failure to deliver power or sell electricity or natural gas as contracted. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG also buys energy and fuel on a short-term or spot market basis. Prices sometimes rise or fall significantly over a relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not rise at",

        "page_content": "all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. Retail rates may also not rise at the same rate or may not rise at all. This may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG's plant operating characteristics and equipment, particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be available at any price or the Company may not be able to transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with different quality coal can lead to emission or operating problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of specific plants and on the Company's results of operations.\n\n## There may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale or purchase obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.\n\nThe  Company  may  sell  fixed  price  gas  as  a  proxy  for  power.  Because  the  obligations  under  most  of  the  Company's forward sale agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company does not have sufficient lower-cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company would be required to supply replacement power either by running its other, higher cost power plants  or  by  obtaining  power  from  third-party  sources  at  market  prices  that  could  substantially  exceed  the  contract  price.  If NRG fails to deliver the contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.\n\n## NRG may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks effectively.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  market  risks  through  its  retail  and  wholesale  operations,  which  involve  the  purchase  of electricity  and  natural  gas  for  resale,  the  sale  of  energy,  capacity  and  related  products,  and  the  purchase  and  sale  of  fuel, transmission services and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from location and timing differences that may be associated with buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and delivering energy to a buyer.\n\nNRG undertakes to hedge these market activities through agreements with various counterparties. Many of the Company's agreements  with  counterparties  include  provisions  that  require  the  Company  to  provide  guarantees,  offset  or  netting arrangements, letters of credit, a first lien on assets and/or cash collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the Company's default or insolvency. The amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price  of  the  commodity  in  a  given  contract  and  the  market  price  of  the  commodity.  Significant  movements  in market prices can result in the Company being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company's strategy may depend on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to the Company's counterparties may negatively affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\nFurther,  if  retail  customers  use  more  power  or  gas  than  expected,  or  if  any  of  NRG's  facilities  experience  unplanned outages,  the  Company  may  be  required  to  procure  additional  power  or  gas  at  spot  market  prices  to  fulfill  contractual commitments.  Without  adequate  liquidity  to  meet  margin  and  collateral  requirements,  the  Company  may  be  exposed  to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.\n\n## The operation of the Company's businesses is subject to advanced persistent cyber-based security threats and integrity risk. Attacks  on  NRG's  infrastructure  that  breach  cyber/data  security  measures  could  expose  the  Company  to  significant liabilities,  reputational  damage,  regulatory  action,  and  disrupt  business  operations,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse effect.\n\nNumerous  functions  affecting  the  efficient  operation  of  NRG's  businesses  depend  on  the  secure  and  reliable  storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems, much of  which  is  connected  (directly  or  indirectly)  to  the  internet.  As  a  result,  NRG's  information  technology  systems  and infrastructure, and those of its vendors and suppliers, are susceptible to cyber-based security threats which could compromise confidentiality, integrity or availability. While the Company has controls in place designed to protect its infrastructure, such breaches and threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, requiring continuing evolution of its program. Any such breach, disruption or similar event that impairs NRG's information technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations  and  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  control  its  generation  assets,  provide  smart  home  services,  maintain",

Concerns about data privacy have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact NRG's businesses and changes in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company's business and financial results. NRG's retail, Home, Services and Smart Home businesses may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such  as  call  center  operations,  to  such  businesses.  The  services  and  the  networks  and  information  systems  utilized  by  the Company may be at risk for breaches as a result of third-party actions, employee or vendor error, malfeasance or other factors.\n\nAlthough the Company takes precautions to protect its infrastructure, it has been, and will likely continue to be, subject to attempts at phishing and other cybersecurity intrusions. International conflict increases the risk of state-sponsored cyber threats and  escalated  use  of  cybercriminal  and  cyber-espionage  activities.  In  particular,  the  current  geopolitical  climate  has  further escalated  cybersecurity  risk,  with  various  government  agencies,  including  the  U.S.  Cybersecurity  &  Infrastructure  Security Agency, issuing warnings of increased cyber threats, particularly for U.S. critical infrastructure. While the Company has not experienced a cyber/data event causing any material operational, reputational or financial impact, it recognizes the growing threat within the general marketplace and the industry, and there is no assurance that NRG will be able to prevent any such impacts  in  the  future.  If  a  material  breach  of  the  Company's  information  technology  systems  were  to  occur,  the  critical operational capabilities and reputation of its business may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, and NRG may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory scrutiny and claims, any of which may contribute to potential legal or regulatory actions against the Company, loss of customers, fines, penalties or other sanctions and otherwise have a material adverse effect. Any loss or disruption of critical operational capabilities to support the Company's generation, commercial or retail operations, loss of customers, or loss of confidential or proprietary data through a breach, unauthorized access, disruption, misuse or disclosure could adversely affect NRG's reputation, expose the Company to material legal or regulatory claims and impair the Company's ability to execute its business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect. In addition, NRG may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its information technology infrastructure. NRG cannot provide any assurance that such events and impacts will not be material in the future, and the Company's efforts to deter, identify and mitigate future breaches may require additional significant capital and may not be successful.\n\n## NRG relies on storage, transportation assets and suppliers, which it does not own or control, to deliver natural gas.\n\nThe Company depends on natural gas pipelines and other transportation and storage facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale and retail markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. The Company's ability to provide natural gas for its present and projected customers will depend upon its suppliers' ability to obtain and deliver supplies  of  natural  gas,  as  well  as  NRG's  ability  to  acquire  supplies.  Factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  Company  and  its suppliers may affect the Company's ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties' control over the drilling of new wells and the facilities to transport natural gas to the Company's receipt points, development of additional interstate pipeline infrastructure, availability of supply sources competition for the acquisition of natural gas, priority allocations, impact of  severe  weather  disruptions  to  natural  gas  supplies  and  the  regulatory  and  pricing  policies  of  federal  and  state  regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the U.S. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of the Company to sell and deliver its products and services may be hindered. As a result, the Company may be responsible for damages incurred by its customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. These conditions could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on NRG's revenues and results of operations, and NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.\n\nThe ongoing operation of NRG's facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and the inability to transport the Company's products to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled  outages  due  to  mechanical  failures  or  other  problems  occur  from  time  to  time  and  are  an  inherent  risk  of  the",

        "page_content": "Company's business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Company's operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce the Company's revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or incurring non-performance penalties and/or require NRG to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market or running one of its higher cost units to satisfy the Company's forward power sales obligations. NRG's inability to operate the Company's plants efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate earnings and cash flow from the Company's asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn  addition,  NRG  provides  plant  operations  and  commercial  services  to  a  variety  of  third  parties.  There  is  a  risk  that mistakes, mis-operations or actions taken by these third parties could be attributed to NRG, including the risk of investigation or penalties being assessed to NRG in connection with the services it offers, or that regulators could question whether NRG had the appropriate safeguards in place.\n\nPower  generation  involves  hazardous  activities,  including  acquiring,  transporting  and  unloading  fuel,  operating  large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company's operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties.\n\nNRG  maintains  an  amount  of  insurance  protection  that  it  considers  adequate,  obtains  warranties  from  vendors  and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, but the Company cannot provide any assurance that these measures will  be  sufficient  or  effective  under  all  circumstances  and  against  all  hazards  or  liabilities  to  which  it  may  be  subject.  A successful claim for which the Company is not adequately insured or protected could hurt its financial results and materially harm NRG's financial condition. NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage will continue to be available at all  or  at  rates  or  on  terms  similar  to  those  presently  available.  Any  losses  not  covered  by  insurance  could  have  a  material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Supplier and/or customer concentration, the inability of suppliers to meet their obligations and dependence on third-party service providers may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks and adversely affect NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nNRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision and transportation of fuel, chemicals and other services required for the operation of certain of its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform these services, the Company utilizes the marketplace. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as, when and where required or at comparable prices. The Company also relies on a number of sole or limited source suppliers for critical  components  for  its  smart  home  products  and  services,  and  those  services  are  dependent  on  third-party  cellular, telecommunications and/or internet providers.\n\nThe  failure  of  any  supplier  or  customer  to  fulfill  its  contractual  obligations  to  NRG,  the  inability  of  NRG  to  source products and services on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure of third parties to provide services to its customers that are necessary for the Company's smart home services could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results. As a result, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers, which cannot be guaranteed.\n\n## Maintenance,  expansion  and  refurbishment  of  power  generation  facilities  involve  significant  risks  that  could  result  in unplanned power outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nNRG's  facilities  require  periodic  maintenance  and  repair.  Any  unexpected  failure,  including  failure  associated  with breakdowns,  forced  outages  or  any  unanticipated  capital  expenditures  could  result  in  reduced  profitability.  NRG  cannot  be certain  of  the  level  of  capital  expenditures  that  will  be  required  due  to  changing  environmental  and  safety  laws  (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist  attacks).  The  unexpected  requirement  of  large  capital  expenditures  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## NRG  relies  on  power  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  that  it  does  not  own  or  control  and  that  are  subject  to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's core regions.\n\nNRG depends on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by others to deliver power to its customers. If  transmission  or  distribution  is  disrupted,  including  by  force  majeure  events,  or  if  the  transmission  or  distribution infrastructure  is  inadequate,  NRG's  ability  to  deliver  power  may  be  adversely  impacted.

If NRG were liable for such congestion costs, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected.\n\n## Rates and terms for service of certain residential and commercial customers in Alberta are subject to regulatory review and approval.\n\nThe  Company  owns  Direct  Energy  Regulated  Services,  which  serves  as  a  regulated  rate  supplier  for  residential  and commercial energy customers in portions of the province of Alberta. It is required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as  a  part  of  the  process  of  establishing  the  terms  and  rates  for  sales  of  power  and  natural  gas.  These  proceedings  typically involve multiple parties,  including  governmental  bodies  and  officials,  consumer  advocacy  groups  and  various  consumers  of energy,  who  have  differing  concerns  but  also  have  the  common  objective  of  limiting  rate  increases  or  even  reducing  rates. Decisions  are  subject  to  appeal,  potentially  leading  to  additional  uncertainty  associated  with  the  approval  proceedings.  The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient  for  the  Company  to  recover  its  costs  by  the  time  the  rates  become  effective.  Established  rates  are  also  subject  to subsequent  reviews  by  regulators,  whereby  various  portions  of  rates  could  be  adjusted,  subject  to  refund  or  disallowed.  In certain instances, the Company could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters and other cost recovery elements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the Company to recover its costs or earn an adequate return. In addition, subsequent legislative or regulatory  action  could  alter  the  terms  on  which  the  regulated  business  operates  and  future  earnings  could  be  negatively impacted. The Company also operates a competitive energy supply business in Alberta that is not subject to rate regulation and is  subject  to  stringent  requirements  to  segregate  operations  and  information  relating  to  the  competitive  business  from  the regulated business. Failure to comply with these and other requirements on the business could subject the Company's regulated and competitive businesses in Alberta to fines, penalties, and restrictions on the ability to continue business.\n\n## Because NRG owns less than a majority of the ownership interests of some of its project investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over their operations.\n\nNRG  has  limited  control  over  the  operation  of  some  project  investments  and  joint  ventures  because  the  Company's investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a degree  of  influence  with  respect  to  the  management  and  operation  of  projects  in  which  it  owns  less  than  a  majority  of  the ownership  interests  by  negotiating  to  obtain  positions  on  management  committees  or  to  receive  certain  limited  governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may  be  dependent  on  its  co-venturers  to  operate  such  projects.  The  Company's  co-venturers  may  not  have  the  level  of experience, technical expertise, human resources management or other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the Company's interest in projects.\n\n## Future acquisition or disposition activities could involve unknown risks and may have materially adverse effects and NRG may be subject to trailing liabilities from businesses that it disposes of or that are inactive.\n\nNRG may in the future acquire or dispose of businesses or assets, acquire or sell books of retail customers, or pursue other business activities, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries that involve a number of risks. The acquisition of companies and assets,  and  their  integration,  is  subject  to  substantial  risks,  including  the  failure  to  identify  material  problems  during  due diligence, the risk of over-paying for assets or customers, the inability to retain customers and the inability to arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company's acquisitions may not be successfully integrated. In the case of dispositions, such risks may relate to employment matters, counterparties, regulators and other stakeholders in the disposed business,  the  separation  of  disposed  assets  from  NRG's  business,  the  management  of  NRG's  ongoing  business,  and  other financial, legal and operational matters related to such disposition, which may be unknown to NRG at the time. In addition, NRG may be subject to material trailing liabilities from disposed businesses. Any such risk may result in one or more costly disputes or litigation. There can be no assurances that any future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them. There can also be no assurances that NRG will realize the anticipated benefits from any such dispositions. The failure to realize the anticipated returns or benefits from an acquisition or disposition could adversely affect NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.",

Additionally, the Company is from time to time named  in  investigations,  claims  and  lawsuits  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  and  customers  have  in  the  past communicated complaints to consumer protection organizations, regulators or the media. Negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, offerings, practices or customer service may damage its brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. The Company may also experience criticism or backlash from media, customers, employees, government entities, advocacy groups and other stakeholders that disagree with positions taken by the Company or its executives. If the Company's brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees.\n\n## The  Company  has  made  investments  focused  on  consumer  products  that  may  not  be  successful,  may  not  achieve  the intended financial results or may result in product liability and reputational risk that could adversely affect the Company.\n\nThe Company may be liable to customers for any damage caused to customers' homes, facilities, belongings or property during the installation of Company products and systems, such as smart home systems, home back-up generators and residential HVAC system  repairs,  installation  and  replacements.  Where  such  work  is  performed  by  independent  contractors,  such  as repairs performed under the Company's home protection plan products, the Company may nonetheless face claims and costs for damage. In addition, shortages of skilled labor for Company projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase its costs. The products that the Company sells or manufactures may expose the Company to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although the Company maintains liability insurance and its service contracts limit Company liability, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to the Company on economically  reasonable  terms,  or  at  all,  or  that  contractual  limitations  will  be  enforced.  The  laws  of  some  states  limit  or prohibit  insurance  coverage  for  certain  liabilities  and  actions,  and  any  significant  uninsured  damages  could  have  a  material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and cash flows. Further, any product liability claims or damage caused  by  the  Company  could  significantly  impair  the  Company's  brand  and  reputation,  which  may  result  in  a  failure  to maintain customers and achieve the Company's desired growth initiatives in these new businesses.\n\n## Changes  in  technology  may  impair  the  value  of,  and  the  attractiveness  of,  its  retail  products,  smart  home  services  and NRG's generation facilities.\n\nResearch and development activities are ongoing in the industry to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to produce  power,  including  wind,  photovoltaic  (solar)  cells,  hydrogen,  energy  storage,  and  improvements  in  traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies, including through artificial intelligence, could reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect its cash flows, results of operations or competitive position. Technology, including distributed technology  or  changes  in  retail  rate  structures,  may  also  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  ability  to  retain  retail customers.  Further,  technological  innovation  and  changes  could  cause  the  Company's  smart  home  products  and  services  to become  obsolete,  or  otherwise  more  expensive  and  less  effective  than  those  of  competitors,  putting  the  Company  at  a competitive disadvantage.\n\nSome emerging technologies,  such  as  distributed  renewable  energy  technologies,  broad  consumer  adoption  of  electric vehicles and energy storage devices, could affect the price of energy. These emerging technologies may affect the financial viability of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on wholesale market prices, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## The Company's smart home services rely on intellectual property and any failure to adequately protect such intellectual property, or claims that the Company has infringed on others' intellectual property rights, could have an adverse effect on its business and operations and result in a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe Company relies on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the United States and other countries and a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other methods, to protect its intellectual property, all of which offer only limited protection. If the Company fails to acquire the necessary intellectual property rights or adequately  protect  or  assert  its  intellectual  property  rights,  competitors  may  manufacture  and  market  similar  products  and services or convert customers, which could adversely affect market share and results of operations for smart home services. In addition, patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing, using or selling products or services that are similar to or address the same market as the Company's smart home products and services. Certain of the Company's smart home solutions contain  software  modules  licensed  under  'open-source'  licenses,  which  may  entail  greater  risks  than  the  use  of  third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding",

Further,  if  proprietary  software  is  combined  with  open-source  software,  in certain  cases  the  Company  could  be  required  to  release  the  source  code  of  the  proprietary  software  to  the  public,  allowing competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time.\n\nIt is possible that certain of the Company's smart home products and services or those of third parties incorporated into its offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, Vivint Smart Home has been subject to claims based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. If the  Company  is  unable  to  successfully  defend  against  such  claims  or  license  necessary  third-party  technology  or  other intellectual  property  on  acceptable  terms  it  may  be  required  to  develop  alternative,  non-infringing  technology,  which  could require significant time, effort, and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\n\n## NRG's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees or inability to replace employees as they retire.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 4% of NRG's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company's union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the Company could experience reduced power  generation  or  outages.  Although  NRG's  ability  to  procure  such  labor  is  uncertain,  contingency  staffing  planning  is completed as part of each respective contract negotiation. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a number of the Company's employees at NRG's plants are close to retirement. The Company's inability to replace retiring workers could create potential knowledge and expertise gaps as such workers retire.\n\n## NRG's  failure  to  manage  key  executive  succession  and  retention  and  to  continue  to  attract  qualified  personnel  could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe loss of one or more of the Company's key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could adversely affect the Company's business. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees, the effectiveness of the Company's leaders, and any further transition, could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks that are beyond NRG's control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nNRG's generation facilities and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well  as  events  occurring  in  response  to  or  in  connection  with  such  activities,  all  of  which  could  cause  environmental repercussions  and/or  result  in  full  or  partial  disruption  of  the  facilities  ability  to  generate,  transmit,  transport  or  distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than  other  domestic  targets.  Any  such  environmental  repercussions  or  disruption  could  result  in  a  significant  decrease  in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant  weather  events  or  terrorist  actions  could  damage  or  shut  down  the  power  or  gas  transmission  and  distribution facilities upon which the Company is dependent, which may reduce retail volume for extended periods of time. Power or gas supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant loss of retail customer demand.\n\n## Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Laws\n\n## NRG's  business  is  subject  to  substantial  energy  regulation  and  may  be  adversely  affected  by  legislative  or  regulatory changes,  as  well  as  liability  under,  or  any  future  inability  to  comply  with,  existing  or  future  energy  regulations  or requirements.\n\nNRG's business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign laws. Compliance with, or changes to, the requirements under these legal regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, reduce the Company's ability  to  hedge  exposure  or  to  sell  retail  power  within  certain  states  or  to  certain  classes  of  retail  customers,  or  restrict  the Company's marketing practices, its ability to pass through costs to retail customers, or its ability to compete on favorable terms with competitors, including the incumbent utility. Retail competition and home protection services are regulated on a state-bystate or at the province-by-province level and are highly dependent on state and provincial laws, regulations and policies, which could  change  at  any  moment.  Failure  to  comply  with  such  requirements  could  result  in  the  shutdown  of  a  non-complying facility or line of business, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.\n\nPublic  utilities  under  the  FPA  are  required  to  obtain  FERC  acceptance  of  their  rate  schedules  for  wholesale  sales  of electricity.  Except  for  ERCOT  generation  facilities  and  power  marketers,  all  of  NRG's  non-qualifying  facility  generating companies and power marketing affiliates in the U.S. make sales of electricity in interstate commerce and are public utilities for",

        "page_content": "purposes  of  the  FPA.  FERC  has  granted  each  of  NRG's  generating  and  power  marketing  companies  that  make  sales  of electricity outside of ERCOT the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC's orders that grant NRG's generating and  power  marketing  companies  market-based  rate  authority  reserve  the  right  to  revoke  or  revise  that  authority  if  FERC subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG's market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of NRG's generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated those rules, they are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority. If NRG's generating and power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain FERC's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates NRG charges for power from its facilities.\n\nThe  Company's  generation  assets  are  also  subject  to  the  reliability  standards  promulgated  by  the  designated  Electric Reliability  Organization  (currently  NERC)  and  approved  by  FERC.  If  NRG  fails  to  comply  with  the  mandatory  reliability standards, NRG could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties and increased compliance obligations. NRG is also affected by legislative  and  regulatory  changes,  as  well  as  changes  to  market  design,  market  rules,  tariffs,  cost allocations,  and  bidding  rules  that  occur  in  the  existing  ISOs.  The  ISOs  that  oversee  most  of  the  wholesale  power  markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps, non-performance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of  price  limitations  and  other  regulatory  mechanisms  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  profitability  of  NRG's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.\n\nThe regulatory  environment  is  subject  to  significant  changes  due  to  state  and  federal  policies  affecting  wholesale  and retail competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases,  transmission.  These  changes  are  ongoing,  and  the  Company  cannot  predict  the  future  design  of  the  wholesale  power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on NRG's business. In addition, in some of these  markets,  interested  parties  have  proposed  material  market  design  changes.  If  competitive  restructuring  of  the  electric power markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, the Company's business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the United States and internationally. These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG's  ability  to  hedge  its  portfolio  in  an  efficient,  cost-effective  manner  by,  among  other  things,  potentially  decreasing liquidity  in  the  forward  commodity  and  derivatives  markets  or  limiting  NRG's  ability  to  utilize  non-cash  collateral  for derivatives transactions.\n\n## NRG's business may be affected by interference in the competitive wholesale marketplace.\n\nNRG's  generation  and  competitive  retail  operations  rely  on  a  competitive  wholesale  marketplace.  The  competitive wholesale marketplace may be impacted by out-of-market subsidies, imports of power from Canada, renewable mandates or subsidies, mandates to sell power below its cost of acquisition and associated costs as well as out-of-market payments to new or existing  generators.  These  out-of-market  subsidies  to  existing  or  new  generation  undermine  the  competitive  wholesale marketplace, which can lead to premature retirement of existing facilities, including those owned by the Company. If these measures continue, capacity and energy prices may be suppressed, and the Company may not be successful in its efforts to insulate the competitive market from this interference. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in competitive retail markets or own and operate facilities that could be provided by competitive market participants.\n\n## Additions or changes in tax laws and regulations could potentially affect the Company's financial results or liquidity.\n\nNRG is subject to various types of tax arising from normal business operations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Any additions or changes to tax legislation, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,  including  income  tax provision and accruals reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Beginning in 2023, the Company is now subject to a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act. The CAMT may lead to volatility in the Company's cash tax payment obligations, particularly in periods of significant commodity or currency variability resulting from potential changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. The Company continuously monitors and assesses proposed tax legislation that could negatively impact its business.",

Capacity  market  prices  are  sensitive  to  design  parameters,  as  well  as  additions  of  new  capacity.  NRG  may experience substantial changes in capacity income and incur non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## NRG is subject  to  environmental  laws  that  impose  extensive  and  increasingly  stringent  requirements  on  the  Company's ongoing  operations,  as  well  as  potentially  substantial  liabilities  arising  out  of  environmental  contamination.  These environmental requirements and liabilities could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nNRG is subject to the environmental laws of foreign and U.S., federal, state and local authorities. The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and obtain numerous governmental permits and approvals to build and operate the Company's plants. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time. Should NRG fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its operations, the Company could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions seeking to curtail the Company's operations. In  addition,  when  new  requirements  take  effect  or  when  existing  environmental  requirements  are  revised,  reinterpreted  or subject to changing enforcement policies, NRG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n## NRG's businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change, and policies  at  the  national,  regional  and  state  levels  to  regulate  GHG  emissions  and  mitigate  climate  change  which  could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nFluctuations in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, may affect consumer demand for electricity or natural gas. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause it  to  incur  significant  costs  in  preparing  for  or  responding  to  these  effects.  These  or  other  changes  in  climate  could  lead  to increased operating costs or capital expenses. NRG's customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including changing the fuel mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply.\n\nThe contribution of climate change to the frequency or intensity of weather-related events could affect NRG's operations and planning process. Climate change could also affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for the continued operation of NRG's generation plants. NRG monitors water supply risk carefully. If  it  is  determined  that  a  water  supply  risk  exists  that  could  impact  projected  generation  levels  at  any  plant,  risk  mitigation efforts are identified and evaluated for implementation.\n\nFurther, demand for NRG's energy-related services could be similarly impacted by consumers' preferences or market or regulatory factors favoring energy efficiency, lower carbon energy sources or reduced electricity or natural gas usage.\n\nNRG's GHG emissions reduction  targets  can  be  found  in  Item  1, Business  -Environmental  Regulatory  Matters .  The Company's ability to achieve these targets depends on many factors, including the ability to retire high emitting assets, ability to reduce  emissions  based  on  technological  advances  and  innovation,  and  ability  to  source  energy  from  less  carbon  intense resources. In addition, any future decarbonization efforts may increase costs, or NRG may otherwise be limited in its ability to apply  them.  The  cost  associated  with  NRG's  GHG  emissions  reduction  goals  could  be  significant.  Failure  to  achieve  the Company's emissions targets could result in a negative impact on access to and cost of capital, changing investor sentiment regarding investment in the Company or reputation harm.\n\n## Enhanced data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or any non-compliance with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect NRG's business and financial results.\n\nThe consumer privacy landscape continues to experience momentum for greater privacy protection and reform at the state and federal level in response to precedents set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"). The development and evolving nature of domestic and international privacy regulation and  enforcement  could  impact  and  potentially  limit  how  NRG  processes  personally  identifiable  information.  California residents now have increased access rights (including the right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information), which are enforced by a new state privacy regulator, resulting in more scrutiny of business practices and disclosures. Additional states  including  Virginia,  Utah,  Connecticut,  Colorado,  Nevada  and  Texas  have  similarly  adopted  enhanced  data  privacy legislation and patterned after the standards set forth by CCPA, including broader data access rights, with Virginia going a step further  requiring  businesses  to  perform  data  protection  assessments  for  certain  processing  activities.

It is possible that the Company may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and its ability to develop new home services and features could be limited. Any noncompliance  with  laws  may  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  the  Company  by  governmental  entities  or  individuals. Moreover, any inquiries or investigations, government penalties or sanctions, or civil actions by individuals may be costly to comply with, resulting in negative publicity, increased operating costs, significant management time and attention, and may lead  to  remedies  that  harm  the  business,  including  fines,  demands  or  orders  that  existing  business  practices  be  modified  or terminated.\n\n## NRG's retail operations and smart home services are subject to changing rules and regulations that could have a material impact on the Company's profitability.\n\nThe competitiveness of NRG's retail operations partially depends on regulatory policies that establish the structure, rules, terms  and  conditions  upon  which  services  are  offered  to  retail  customers.  These  policies  can  include,  among  other  things, controls on the retail rates that NRG can charge, the imposition of additional costs on sales, restrictions on the Company's sell certain types of products or ability to obtain new customers through various marketing channels and disclosure requirements. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in  competitive  retail  markets  or  own  and  operate  facilities  that  could  be  provided  by  competitive  market  participants. Additionally, state, federal or provincial imposition of net metering or RPS programs can make it more or less expensive for retail customers to supplement or replace their reliance on grid power.\n\nThe Company's smart home services focus on transactions with residential customers, subjecting it to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements governing interactions with residential consumers, including those pertaining to privacy and data security, consumer financial and credit transactions, home improvements, warranties and door-to-door solicitation. In certain jurisdictions, the Company is required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing marketing and sales  efforts,  installation  of  equipment  or  servicing  of  subscribers,  and  monitoring  station  employee  selection  and  training. Increased regulation of matters relating to interactions with residential consumers could require modification to the Company's home services operations and the incurrence of additional expenses. Further, any expansion of the scope of products or services into  new  markets  may  require  additional  licenses  and  expenditures  to  otherwise  maintain  compliance  with  additional  laws, regulations or licensing requirements. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, and any new laws, regulations or  licensing  requirements  could  negatively  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  acquire  new  residential  customers.  Any  of  these measures could increase costs for providing, or reduce customer satisfaction with respect to, smart home services.\n\nThe  Federal  Trade  Commission  (\"FTC\")  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  have  issued  regulations  that restrict direct-to-home marketing, telemarketing, email marketing and other sales practices, including limitations on methods of communication, requirements to maintain a 'do not call' list, cancellation rights and required training for personnel to comply with these restrictions. Any noncompliance, or alleged noncompliance, of applicable regulations by the Company, third-party vendors used for marketing, telemarketing or lead generation activities or independent, third-party authorized dealers of smart home  services  could  result  in  private  rights  of  actions  or  enforcement  actions  for  civil  or  criminal  penalties.  Changes  in regulations or interpretations that further restrict lead generating activities also could result in a reduction in the number of new smart home services customers.\n\n## The Company's smart home business exposes it to risks of liability for the acts or omissions of its employees, including with respect to sales practices.\n\nActivities in connection with sales efforts by employees, independent contractors, and other agents, including predatory door-to-door sales tactics and fraudulent misrepresentations, have in the past subjected it to, and could in the future subject the Company to, governmental investigations and class action lawsuits for, among others, false advertising and deceptive trade practice  damage  claims.  Any  litigation  or  regulatory  proceedings  resulting  from  such  activities  could  adversely  impact  the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n## The Company is subject to various risks in connection with Vivint Smart Home's ongoing settlement administration process involving the FTC, and may be subject to FTC Actions in the future.\n\nIn 2021, Vivint Smart Home entered into a settlement with the FTC where Vivint Smart Home paid a total of $20 million to  the  United  States  and  agreed  to  implement  various  compliance-related  measures.  The  settlement  requires  an  initial assessment  and  thereafter  biennial  assessments  by  an  independent  third-party  assessor  of  Vivint  Smart  Home's  compliance",

If  any  assessments  identify  deficiencies  in  the  Company's  efforts  to  comply,  and  should  the  FTC determine that Vivint Smart Home is not in full compliance with the settlement, the FTC could take further action, such as seeking  judicial  remedies  for  any  noncompliance,  and  Vivint  Smart  Home  could  be  subject  to  additional  sanctions  and restrictions on its smart home operations. In addition, the filing of an application with the court for noncompliance with the settlement could lead to regulatory actions by other agencies or private litigation, which could impact Vivint Smart Home's ability  to  obtain  regulatory  approvals  necessary  to  carry  out  present  or  future  plans  and  operations,  and  result  in  negative publicity.\n\n## The  Company's  international  operations  are  exposed  to  political  and  economic  risks,  commercial  instability  and  events beyond  the  Company's  control  in  the  countries  in  which  it  operates,  which  risks  may  negatively  impact  the  Company's business.\n\nThe  Company's  international  operations  depend  on  products  manufactured,  purchased  and  sold  in  the  U.S.  and internationally.  In  some  cases,  these  countries  have  greater  political  and  economic  volatility  and  greater  vulnerability  to infrastructure labor, and supply chain disruptions than in NRG's other markets. Operating a business in a number of different regions  and  countries  exposes  the  Company  to  a  number  of  risks,  including:  imposition  of  burdensome  tariffs  or  quotas, multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change, imposition of currency restrictions on  repatriation  of  earnings  or  other  restraints,  national  and  international  conflict,  including  terrorist  acts  and  political  and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries and result in increased cost. The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Related to Economic and Financial Market Conditions and the Company's Indebtedness\n\nNRG's level  of  indebtedness  could  adversely  affect  its  ability  to  raise  additional  capital  to  fund  its  operations  or  return capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry.\n\nNRG's substantial amount of debt could have negative consequences, including:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing NRG's vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n- \u00b7 requiring  a  substantial  portion  of  NRG's  cash  flow  from  operations  be  used  to  pay  principal  and  interest  on  its indebtedness,  which  reduces  NRG's  ability  to  pay  dividends  or  fund  its  operations,  capital  expenditures  and  future business opportunities;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases, which require credit support;\n- \u00b7 adversely impacting NRG's credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs;\n- \u00b7 limiting  NRG's  ability  to  obtain  additional  financing  for  working  capital,  including  collateral  postings,  capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors, who may have less debt; and\n- \u00b7 exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest.\n\nThe Company's debt agreements contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's ability to return capital to stockholders, including by paying dividends, or otherwise engage in activities that may be in its long-term best interests. NRG's failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness, which in turn could cause a cross default to NRG's other indebtedness. NRG's assets and available cash balances may not be sufficient to fully repay all outstanding indebtedness if accelerated upon an event of default. If NRG is unable to repay, refinance, or restructure its indebtedness as required, or amend the covenants contained in those agreements, the lenders or other creditors may be entitled to obtain a lien or institute foreclosure proceedings against its assets, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company's Revolving Credit Facility and sustainability-linked bonds include a sustainability-linked metric, which could result in  increased  interest  expense  for  the  Company  if  the  sustainability  metrics  set  forth  therein  are  not  achieved.  Furthermore, financial  and  other  restrictive  covenants  contained  in  any  subsidiary  or  project  level  debt  may  limit  the  ability  of  NRG  to receive distributions from such subsidiary.\n\nIn addition, NRG's ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including: general economic and capital market conditions,  credit  availability  from  banks  and  other  financial  institutions,  investor  confidence  in  NRG,  its  partners  and  the regional wholesale power markets, NRG's financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries, NRG's level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, cash flow and provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.",

NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital on terms acceptable to NRG, or at all, from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.\n\n## NRG's preferred stock is senior to its common stock, and a failure to pay dividends on its preferred stock will prohibit the payment of dividends on its common stock.\n\nNRG has outstanding 650,000 shares of 10.25% Series A Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a $1,000 liquidation preference per share. The Series A Preferred Stock is senior to NRG's common stock in right of payment  of  dividends  and  other  distributions  and  could  adversely  affect  NRG's  ability  to  declare  or  pay  dividends  or distributions on its common stock. In the event of NRG's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock must receive their $1,000 per share, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, prior to any distributions to holder of common stock. NRG must be current on dividends payable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock before any dividends can be paid on its common stock.\n\nWhenever dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the number of directors on the Company's Board of Directors will be increased by two, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to elect two members of the Company's Board of Directors to fill such newly created openings.\n\n## Adverse  economic  conditions  could  adversely  affect  NRG's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash flows.\n\nAdverse  economic  conditions,  including  inflation,  and  declines  in  wholesale  energy  prices,  partially  resulting  from adverse  economic  conditions,  may  impact  NRG's  results  of  operations,  including  by  reducing  the  demand  for  energy commodities. In general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact NRG's unhedged future energy margins,  liquidity,  earnings  growth  and  overall  financial  condition.  Macroeconomic  factors  may  also  impact  consumer spending,  which  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  Smart  Home  services,  and  increase  the  Company's  costs  for  such products and services, which it may not be able to pass on to customers. In addition, adverse economic conditions, declines in wholesale  energy  prices,  reduced  demand  for  energy  and  other  factors  may  negatively  impact  the  trading  price  of  NRG's common stock and impact forecasted cash flows, which may require NRG to evaluate its goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Any such impairment could have a material impact on NRG's financial condition.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets that NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject to impairment evaluations and, as a result, the Company could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nGoodwill  is  not  amortized  but  is  reviewed  annually  or  more  frequently  for  impairment.  Other  intangibles  are  also reviewed at least annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and are amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect NRG's reported results of operations and financial position in future periods.",

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made and NRG undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as otherwise required  by  applicable  laws.  The  foregoing  factors  that  could  cause  NRG's  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those contemplated  in  any  forward-looking  statements  included  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  should  not  be  construed  as exhaustive.\n\n## Item 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C - Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nThe Company leverages a comprehensive, multi-tiered cybersecurity strategy to manage cybersecurity risk based on criteria established  by  the  NIST  Cybersecurity  Framework.  As  part  of  the  cybersecurity  strategy  the  Company  utilizes  a  range  of industry and regulatory standards including, but not limited to, NERC-CIP, PCI DSS, and IoT Security Assurance Framework. Compliance with NERC-CIP standards is mandated for entities involved in power generation, transmission, and distribution by regulatory bodies to which the purpose of is to protect critical infrastructure within the United States. NRG engages certified external assessors to ensure compliance with standards.\n\nThe Company's strategy seeks to align underlying processes not only with industry standards but also mirror best practices among peer organizations.  The  strategy  ensures  a  standardized  method  across  all  activities  at  NRG  allowing  for  consistent recognition,  assessment  and  potential  mitigation  of  significant  cybersecurity  risks.  To  further  the  strategy,  the  Company established the NRG Cybersecurity Integration Center (\"CIC\") which is composed of experienced team members from across cybersecurity disciplines with relevant educational and industry experience. The CIC provides the following functions to the Company: cyber governance, operations, detection and response, engineering, testing, cyber risk management (including thirdparty),  compliance,  training  and  awareness,  and  reporting.  The  CIC  utilizes  advanced  continuous  monitoring  systems  and investigative techniques for real-time threat detection. The systematic monitoring approach allows for risk classification and prioritization  based  on  potential  impacts,  facilitating  targeted  resource  allocation  according  to  risk  severity.  The  Company conducts  regular  penetration  testing  to  proactively  identify  vulnerabilities  and  enhance  its  defense  measures.  The  Company engages third-party assessors to gain comprehensive insights into its cyber risk profile's composition.\n\nThe Company relies on third-party  service  providers  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  Company  has  established  a comprehensive approach to identify and manage cybersecurity risks associated with providers including, but not limited to, rigorous  due  diligence  and  assessments  of  third-party  service  providers'  cybersecurity  protocols  before  engagement, requirements  relating  to  information  handling,  incident  notification  and  assessment  against  the  Company's  cybersecurity requirements. Furthermore, the Company has implemented additional control measures and procedures in business processes to enable  continuous  risk  identification,  assessment  and  to  support  monitoring  mechanisms  to  oversee  and  manage  supplier cybersecurity practices.\n\nThrough December 31, 2023, no cybersecurity threats have been identified or are anticipated to have a material adverse effect on NRG's business strategy, financial standing, or operational performance.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Management\n\nThe  Chief  Information  Security  Officer  (\"CISO\")  is  the  head  of  cybersecurity  for  the  Company  and  leads  the  NRG Cybersecurity  Integration  Center.  The  CISO  has  decades  of  professional  experience,  education,  and  certification  in  security analysis, design, implementation, and management, with a particularly strong background in technical vulnerability assessment and  program  development.  Within  various  roles  throughout  the  CISO's  career,  he  has  overseen  information  assurance  and cybersecurity efforts, including critical infrastructure protection in government agencies and industry.\n\nAt  least  twice  per  year,  the  CISO  provides  comprehensive  updates  to  the  Board  on  cybersecurity  and  any  recent developments impacting the Company. These updates include, among other items:\n\n- \u00b7 Incident reports and developments from any cybersecurity events;\n- \u00b7 Current  cybersecurity  landscape  and  emerging  cybersecurity  threats,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  Company  and industry-specific threats; and\n- \u00b7 Status of ongoing initiatives to strengthen the Company's cybersecurity program.\n\nIn addition, the CISO regularly informs other members of senior management, including the Interim President and CEO, of all aspects related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. This is intended to ensure that the highest levels of management remain",

Furthermore,  significant  cybersecurity matters and strategic risk management decisions are escalated to the Board of Directors ensuring that they have comprehensive oversight and can provide guidance on critical cybersecurity issues.\n\nIn preparation for a potential cybersecurity incident, the Company has implemented structured processes and procedures aligned with the NIST framework. This framework provides a foundation for a systematic and consistent approach to preparing for, identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents. The effectiveness of these protocols is routinely verified through tabletop exercises involving relevant teams and Company leadership. In accordance with the Company's process and procedures, incidents which may have a material impact on the Company are promptly referred to senior leadership and the Board of Directors for review and appropriate determination.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is primarily responsible for the risk oversight of the Company, and has delegated oversight of risks related  to  cybersecurity  to  the  Finance  and  Risk  Management  (\"FARM\")  Committee  of  the  Board.  The  FARM  Committee regularly  reports  on  its  activities  to  the  Board  after  each  meeting.  The  FARM  Committee,  as  well  as  the  overall  Board,  is composed of  members  with  diverse  expertise,  including  risk  management,  incident  response  and  technology.  The  Board  is aware  of  the  critical  nature  of  managing  risks  associated  with  cybersecurity  threats  and  has  worked  with  the  Company's management to establish comprehensive oversight mechanisms to ensure effective cybersecurity governance.\n\nThe  FARM  Committee  and  the  Board  receive  updates  on  any  significant  developments  in  the  cybersecurity  domain, seeking  to  ensure  that  the  Board's  oversight  is  proactive  and  responsive.  The  Board  remains  involved  in  ensuring  that cybersecurity  considerations  are  integrated  into  the  Company's  broader  strategic  objectives.  Pursuant  to  the  charter  of  the FARM Committee, the Committee's responsibilities include an annual review of the Company's cybersecurity program and the effectiveness of its risk management strategies. This review is intended to help identify areas for improvement and ensure the alignment of cybersecurity efforts with the overall risk management framework.",

The Company expects to return the capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends on its common stock.\n\nConsistent with its capital allocation framework, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Company increased the annual dividend on its  common  stock  to  $1.30,  $1.40  and  $1.51  per  share,  respectively,  representing  an  8%  increase  each  year.

The long-term capital allocation policy targets an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share.\n\n## Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nNRG engages in share repurchase programs with the goal of returning excess cash to shareholders. The share repurchase plan permits the execution of the plan through open-market purchases, private transactions, accelerated share repurchases and other similar transactions. The timing, price and volume of repurchases is based on a number of factors, including available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations.\n\nOn  June  22,  2023,  as  part  of  the  updated  capital  allocation  framework,  the  Company  announced  that  the  Board  of Directors has increased the share repurchase authorization of its common stock to $2.7 billion to be executed through 2025. Through December 31, 2023, the Company completed $1.2 billion of share repurchases under the $2.7 billion authorization.

A discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2021  may  be  found  in  Part  II,  Item  7 -Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, sits at the intersection of energy and home services. NRG is a leading energy and  home  services  company  fueled  by  market-leading  brands,  proprietary  technologies  and  complementary  sales  channels. Across the U.S. and Canada, NRG delivers innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names such as NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, and Vivint, while also advocating for competitive energy markets and customer choice. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 8 million residential consumers in addition to commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 13 GW of generation as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Business Environment\n\nThe industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2023 and for the future medium term include:\n\nMarket Dynamics -  The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, global LNG demand, exports of natural gas, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2023, the average natural gas price at Henry Hub was $2.74 per MMBtu compared to $6.64 per MMBtu in 2022, representing a decrease of 59%.\n\nNRG may experience impacts to gross margins due to significant, rapid changes in current natural gas prices, the impact those prices have on power prices, and the lag in its ability to make a corresponding adjustment to the retail rates it charges customers on term and month to month contracts. The Company hedges its load commitments in order to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, and as a result, these gross margin impacts would be realized in future periods until it is able to make the corresponding adjustments to the retail customer rates.\n\nThe relative price of natural gas as compared to coal and prevailing power prices are the primary driver of coal demand. Coal commodity prices decreased slightly in 2023.",

Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the  Company's  profitability.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, Texas, East and West average on-peak power prices decreased as a result of lower natural gas prices.\n\n|                                                                                              | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                              | Year Ended December 31,               | Year Ended December 31,               | 2023 vs 2022                          |\n| Region                                                                                       | 2023                                  | 2022                                  | Change %                              |\n| Texas                                                                                        |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| ERCOT - Houston (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | $  74.32                              | $  90.62                              | (18) %                                |\n| ERCOT - North (a)      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 72.89                                 | 78.34                                 | (7) %                                 |\n| East                                                                                         |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| NY J/NYC (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 38.95                                 | 93.58                                 | (58) %                                |\n| NEPOOL (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 41.36                                 | 92.42                                 | (55) %                                |\n| COMED (PJM) (b)     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 32.72                                 | 71.86                                 | (54) %                                |\n| PJM West Hub (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 39.34                                 | 83.48                                 | (53) %                                |\n| West                                                                                         |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| CAISO - SP15 (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 60.17                                 | 87.67                                 | (31) %                                |\n| MISO - Louisiana Hub (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | 33.64                                 | 71.12                                 | (53) %                                |\n\nIncreased Awareness of, and Action to Combat, Climate Change -Diverse groups of stakeholders, including investors, asset  managers,  financial  institutions,  non-government  organizations,  industry  coalitions,  individual  companies,  consumer groups and academic institutions, are increasingly engaged in efforts to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius. As a result, policymakers and regulators at regional, national, sub-national and local levels of government, both in the U.S. and other parts of the world, are increasingly focused on actions to combat climate change.\n\nNRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate  risks  and  opportunities  to  stakeholders.  The  Company  was  an  early  supporter  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") recommendations after they were issued in 2017, published a TCFD mapping disclosure in December 2020 and issued a stand-alone TCFD report in December 2021.\n\nLower Carbon Infrastructure Development - Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported  and  continue  to  support  the  development  of  renewable  generation,  demand-side  and  smart  grid,  and  other  lower carbon infrastructure technologies. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, is intended to further support  the  deployment  of  lower  carbon  energy  technologies.  As  costs  associated  with  the  development  of  lower  carbon infrastructure,  such  as  wind  and  solar  generating  facilities,  continue  to  evolve  and  impact  the  development  of  lower  carbon infrastructure in the markets where the Company participates, it may impact the ability of the Company's generating facilities to participate in those markets. According to ERCOT, 41% of 2023 energy consumption in the ERCOT market was generated from carbon emission-free resources, with wind power contributing 24%. In addition, as subsidies and incentives contribute to increases in renewable power sources, customer awareness and preferences are shifting toward sustainable solutions. Increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.\n\nDigitization and Customization - The electric industry is experiencing major technological changes in the way power is distributed and consumed by end-use customers. The electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated  from  limited  sources  and  flows  in  one  direction,  to  a  decentralized  multidirectional  system,  where  power  can  be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, smart appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage. Power providers are starting to engage with customers who have transitioned to smart homes with new offerings, including but not limited to behind-the-meter demand",

Companies with large customer bases in competitive market places are poised to create further engagement with their customer bases and help their customers further integrate their smart home into their daily lives.\n\nWeather -  Weather  conditions  in  the  regions  of  the  U.S.  in  which  NRG  conducts  business  influence  the  Company's financial  results.  Weather  conditions  can  affect  the  supply  and  demand  for  electricity  and  fuels  and  may  also  impact  the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures and resultant demand are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG's operations are typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.\n\nOther  Factors -  A  number  of  other  factors  significantly  influence  the  level  and  volatility  of  prices  for  energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:\n\n- \u00b7 seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;\n- \u00b7 extreme peak demands;\n- \u00b7 performance of renewable generation;\n- \u00b7 available supply resources;\n- \u00b7 transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;\n- \u00b7 location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;\n- \u00b7 procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and\n- \u00b7 changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.\n\nThese factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:\n\n- \u00b7 weather conditions;\n- \u00b7 market liquidity;\n- \u00b7 capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;\n- \u00b7 local transportation systems; and\n- \u00b7 the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.\n\nEnvironmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings - Details of environmental matters are presented in Item 15 -  Note 25, Environmental Matters , to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 -Business, Environmental Matters .

        "page_content": "## Dispositions\n\nOn  November  1,  2023,  the  Company  closed  on  the  previously  announced  sale  of  its  44%  equity  interest  in  STP  to Constellation. Proceeds of $1.75 billion were reduced by working capital and other adjustments of $96 million, resulting in net proceeds of $1.654 billion.\n\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company closed on the sale of its 100% ownership in the Gregory natural gas generating facility in Texas for $102 million.\n\nOn January 6, 2023, NRG closed on the sale of land and related assets from the Astoria site, within the East region of operations, for proceeds of $212 million subject to transaction fees of $3 million and certain indemnifications. NRG recognized a gain on the sale of $199 million. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into an agreement to lease the land back for the purpose of operating the Astoria gas turbines. Decommissioning was completed in December 2023 and the lease agreement has been terminated.\n\n## Operations\n\nIn May 2022, W.A. Parish Unit 8 came offline as a result of damage to the steam turbine/generator. The extended forced outage ended in September 2023 and the unit has returned to service.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company announced the planned retirement of the Joliet generating facility in 2023. On September 1, 2023, the Joliet generating facility fully retired.\n\nThe Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2023, NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 1.9 GW with third-party project developers and other counterparties,  of  which  approximately  1.1  GW  are  operational.  The  average  tenor  of  these  agreements  is  eleven years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.\n\n## Capital Allocation\n\nIn June 2023, NRG revised its long-term capital allocation policy to target allocating approximately 80% of cash available for  allocation  after  debt  reduction  to  be  returned  to  shareholders.  As  part  of  the  revised  capital  allocation  framework,  the Company announced an increase to its share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion, to be executed through 2025.\n\nOn  November  6,  2023,  the  Company  executed  Accelerated  Share  Repurchase  agreements  to  repurchase  a  total  of $950 million of NRG's outstanding common stock. Under the ASR, the Company paid a total of $950 million and will receive shares of NRG's common stock on specified settlement dates.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed $1.2 billion of share repurchases, including the $950 million ASR and $200 million of open market repurchases, under the $2.7 billion authorization. See Item 15 - Note 16, Capital Structure , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\nIn  the  first  quarter  of  2023,  NRG  increased  the  annual  dividend  on  its  common  stock  to  $1.51  from  $1.40  per  share, representing an 8% increase from 2022. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, NRG increased the annual dividend by 8% to $1.63 per share. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years.\n\nDuring 2023, the Company reduced its debt by $900 million using funds from cash from operations. Additionally, the Company redeemed $620 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.875% Senior Notes, due 2032, for $502 million using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of STP.\n\nThe  Company intends  to  spend  approximately  $500  million  reducing  debt  during  2024  to  maintain  its  targeted  credit metrics. The Company intends to fund the debt reduction from cash from operations.",

Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not  a  substitute  for  the  Company's  presentation  of  gross  margin,  which  is  the  most  directly  comparable  GAAP  measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to  investors  as  it  is  a  key  operational  measure  reviewed  by  the  Company's  chief  operating  decision  maker.  Economic  gross margin is defined as the sum of retail revenue, energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels, purchased energy and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities,  contract  amortization, emission credit amortization, depreciation and amortization, operations and maintenance, or other costs of operations.\n\nThe following tables present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n|                                                                                                           | Year Ended December 31, 2023   | Year Ended December 31, 2023   | Year Ended December 31, 2023   | Year Ended December 31, 2023   | Year Ended December 31, 2023   | Year Ended December 31, 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| ($ in millions, except otherwise noted)                                                                   | Texas                          | East                           | West/ Services/ Other          | Vivint Smart  Home             | Corporate/ Eliminations        | Total                          |\n| Retail revenue    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                             | $  10,030                      | $  11,946                      | $  3,943                       | $  1,549                       | $  (1)  $                      | 27,467                         |\n| Energy revenue    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                               | 77                             | 291                            | 185                            | -

The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.\n\nThe reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $144 million gain in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in power prices. The $3.0 billion loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period, as well as a decrease in the value of East and West/Other open positions as a result of decreases in natural gas and power prices. This was partially offset by an increase in the value of Texas open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT power prices.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the $83 million loss in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven by a decrease  in  the  value  of  open  positions  as  a  result  of  increases  in  power  prices  across  all  segments,  partially  offset  by  the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period. The $1.3 billion gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of  increases  in  natural  gas  and  power  prices  across  all  segments  partially  offset  by  the  reversal  of  previously  recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy  commodities  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023  and  2022.

        "page_content": "## Market Operations\n\nThe Company's market operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying power before receiving  retail  revenues);  and  (iv)  initial  collateral  for  large  structured  transactions.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $441 million and $3.1 billion outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities. As of December 31, 2023, total funds deposited by counterparties were $84 million in cash and $478 million of letters of credit.\n\nThe Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements related to energy purchases, gas transportation and storage, and fuel and transportation services. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had minimum payment obligations under such  outstanding  agreements  of  $3.4  billion,  with  $573  million  payable  within  the  next  12  months  and  an  additional $978 million of short-term purchase energy commitments. For further discussion, see Item 15 -  Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies .\n\nFuture liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.\n\n## First Lien Structure\n\nNRG has the capacity to grant first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, subject to  various  exclusions  including  NRG's  assets  that  have  project-level  financing  and  the  assets  of  certain  non-guarantor subsidiaries, to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements. The first lien program does not limit the volume that can be hedged or the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program also does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.\n\nThe Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2023, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  Company's  capital  expenditures  for  maintenance,  environmental  and  growth investments for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                    | Maintenance   | Environmental   | Investments  and  Integration   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Texas  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                           | $  455        | $  3            | $  37                           | $  495  |\n| East   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                         | 4             | -               | 1                               | 5       |\n| West/Services/Other   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                    | 21            | -               | 6                               | 27      |\n| Vivint Smart Home (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                     | 17            | -               | 1                               | 18      |\n| Corporate    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                             | 19            | -               | 34                              | 53      |\n| Total cash capital expenditures for 2023   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                 | 516           | 3               | 79                              | 598     |\n| Integration operating expenses and cost to achieve  . . . . . . . . .                                                                            | -             | -               | 81                              | 81      |\n| Investments   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                      | -             | -               | 164                             | 164     |\n| Total cash capital expenditures and investments for the year  ended December 31, 2023    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  516        | $  3            | $  324                          | $  843  |\n\nInvestments and Integration for the year ended December 31, 2023, include growth expenditures, integration, small book acquisitions and other investments.\n\n## Environmental Capital Expenditures Estimate\n\nNRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2024 through 2028 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $66 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company utilized U.S. federal NOLs of $1.9 billion, and tax credits of $73 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has cumulative U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $8.4 billion,  of  which  $6.4  billion  do  not  have  an  expiration  date,  and  cumulative  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  $6.4  billion  for financial statement purposes. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $411 million, most of which have no expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $517 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $317 million of tax credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, due to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, of up to $160 million in 2024. There is no impact on the Company's provision for income taxes from the CAMT for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company has $73 million of tax effected uncertain federal, state and foreign tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $76 million (inclusive of accrued interest) until such final resolution with the related taxing authority.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2020. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2015.\n\n## Guarantor Financial Information\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's outstanding registered senior notes consisted of $375 million of the 2027 Senior Notes and $821 million of the 2028 Senior Notes, as shown in Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases .  These Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the 'Guarantors'). See Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.\n\nNRG  conducts  much  of  its  business  through  and  derives  much  of  its  income  from  its  subsidiaries.  Therefore,  the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered",

In order to mitigate interest risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate debt,  NRG  enters  into  interest  rate  swap  agreements.  In  addition,  in  order  to  mitigate  foreign  exchange  rate  risk  primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\nUnder Flex Pay, offered by Vivint Smart Home, subscribers pay for smart home products by obtaining financing from a third-party financing provider under the Consumer Financing Program.

Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk , NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict  risk  of  loss  based  on  market  price  and  volatility.  NRG's  risk  management  policy  places  a  limit  on  one-day  holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2023, NRG's net derivative asset was $648 million, a decrease to total fair value of $2.9 billion as compared to December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by roll-off of trades that settled during the period, losses in fair value, and Vivint Smart Home contracts acquired during the period.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a change of approximately $2.0 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe  Company's  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  based  upon  the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory  challenges,  and  the  fair  value  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities.  These  judgments,  in  and  of  themselves,  could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed.\n\nNRG evaluates these estimates, on an ongoing basis, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.",

|\n\nRegulatory and political environments and requirements\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe  Company  follows  the  guidance  of  ASC  815, Derivatives  and  Hedging  \"(A SC  815\"),  to  account  for  derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize fair  value  change  in  earnings,  unless  they  qualify  for  the  NPNS  exception.  ASC  815  applies  to  NRG's  energy  related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and Consumer Financing Program.\n\n## Energy-Related Commodities\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, for purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, the Company primarily uses quoted  exchange  prices  and  consensus  pricing.  Consensus  pricing  is  provided  by  independent  pricing  services  which  are compiled from market makers with longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company valued derivatives based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions. The  Company  started  using  consensus  pricing  as  it  offers  data  from  more  market  makers  and  for  longer  dated  tenors  as compared to broker quotes, enhances data integrity, and increases transparency. When external prices are not available, NRG uses  internal  models  to  determine  the  fair  value.  These  internal  models  include  assumptions  of  the  future  prices  of  energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.",

        "page_content": "## Interest Rate Swaps\n\nNRG  is  exposed  to  changes  in  interest  rate  through  the  Company's  issuance  of  variable  rate  debt.  To  manage  the Company's interest rate risk, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Contracts\n\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\n## Consumer Financing Program\n\nThe derivative positions for the Company's Consumer Financing Program are valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions,  such  as  collateral  prepayment  rates,  collateral  default  rates  and  credit  loss  rates.  In  summary,  the  fair  value represents an estimate of the present value of the cash flows Vivint Smart Home will be obligated to pay to the third-party financing provider for each component of the derivative.\n\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that the Company has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on expected load requirements, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives  that  are  considered  to  be  NPNS  are  exempt  from  derivative  accounting  treatment  and  are  accounted  for  under accrual  accounting.  If  it  is  determined  that  a  transaction  designated  as  NPNS  no  longer  meets  the  scope  exception  due  to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.\n\n## Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  NRG's  deferred  tax  assets  were  primarily  the  result  of  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOLs,  the difference between book and tax basis in property, plant, and equipment, deferred revenues and tax credit carryforwards. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\n\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation  allowance  are  appropriate  considering  changes  in  facts  or  circumstances.  As  of  each  reporting  date,  management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the Company's deferred tax assets. Given the Company's current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\n\nThe Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $275 million as of December 31, 2023 against deferred tax assets  consisting  of  state  NOL  carryforwards  and  foreign  NOL  carryforwards  in  jurisdictions  where  the  Company  does  not currently believe that the realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's valuation allowance balance was $224 million.\n\nConsiderable  judgment  is  required  to  determine  the  tax  treatment  of  a  particular  item  that  involves  interpretations  of complex tax laws. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  operations  located  in  Australia  and  Canada.  The  Company continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2020. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2015.\n\nNRG does not intend, nor currently foresee a need, to repatriate funds held at its international operations into the U.S. These funds are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company has not changed its assertion with respect to distributions of funds that would require the accrual of U.S. income tax.",

        "page_content": "## Evaluation of Assets for Impairment\n\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (\" ASC 360\"), the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events include:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n- \u00b7 Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n- \u00b7 Adverse business climate;\n- \u00b7 Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amounts originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n- \u00b7 Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n- \u00b7 Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power and natural gas prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nFor assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets heldfor-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. The Company considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence  of  such  information,  NRG  may  consider  prices  of  similar  assets,  consult  with  brokers  or  employ  other  valuation techniques. The Company will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative  of  the  risk  involved  with  such  an  investment  or  asset.  The  use  of  these  methods  involves  the  same  inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in NRG's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the Company's projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.\n\nFor further discussion, see Item 15 -  Note 11 , Asset Impairments .\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company reported goodwill of $5.1 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion from the acquisition of Vivint in 2023, $1.3 billion from the acquisition of Direct Energy in 2021 and $0.3 billion from other retail acquisitions.\n\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"), and ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\" ASC 350\") to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized.  Goodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  or  more  frequently  whenever  an  event  or  change  in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the  Company's  operating  segments  constitute  businesses  for  which  discrete  financial  information  is  available  and  whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment  assessment  as  of  December  31  or  when  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  fair  value  of  the reporting unit may be below the carrying amount. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.",

        "page_content": "Fair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying  assumptions  and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\n\nFor  further  discussion,  see Evaluation  of  Assets  for  Impairment caption  above,  and  Item  15  Note  11 , Asset Impairments .\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nNRG accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed under ASC 805. Under this method,  the  Company  is  required  to  record  on  its  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  the  estimated  fair  values  of  the  acquired company's assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities from the Vivint Smart Home acquisition that involved the most subjectivity in determining fair value consisted of customer relationships, developed technology, trade names, acquired debt and derivative instruments. NRG describes in detail its acquisitions in Item 15 -  Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe fair  value  of  the  customer  relationships,  technology  and  trade  names  are  measured  using  income-based  valuation methodologies, which include certain assumptions such as forecasted future cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty rates and discount rates.  Customer relationships and technology are amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows. Trade names are amortized to depreciation and amortization, on a straight line basis.\n\nThe acquired Vivint Smart Home debt was measured at fair value using observable market inputs based on interest rates at the acquisition closing date. The difference between the fair value at the acquisition closing date and the principal outstanding is being amortized through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt.\n\nThe derivative liabilities in connection with the contractual future payment obligations with the financing providers under Vivint  Smart  Home's  Consumer  Financing  Program  were  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  closing  date  using  a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. Changes to the fair value are recorded each period through other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nNRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and  the  amount  of  the  loss,  or  range  of  loss,  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Gain  contingencies  are  not  recorded  until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 -  Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments\n\nSee  Item  15  Note  2, Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies, to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a discussion of recent accounting developments.\n\n## Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may  result  from  market  changes  associated  with  the  Company's  retail  operations,  merchant  power  generation,  or  with  an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transactions. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks, the Company uses  various  fixed-price  forward  purchase  and  sales  contracts,  futures  and  option  contracts  traded  on  NYMEX  and  other exchanges, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:\n\n- \u00b7 Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;\n- \u00b7 Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and\n- \u00b7 Hedge fuel requirements for the Company's generating facilities.",

        "page_content": "## Commodity Price Risk\n\nCommodity  price  risks  result  from  exposures  to  changes  in  spot  prices,  forward  prices,  volatilities,  and  correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's load servicing obligations and merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of power and fuel. NRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports and VaR. NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of its energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, gas transportation and storage assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions, based on historical and forward values for factors such as customer demand, weather, commodity availability and commodity prices. The Company's VaR model is based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence interval for the forward 36 months, not including the spot month. The VaR model is not a complete picture of all risks that may affect the Company's results. Certain events such as counterparty defaults, regulatory changes, and extreme weather and prices that deviate significantly from historically observed values are not reflected in the model.\n\nThe following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG's commodity portfolio, calculated using the VaR model for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| VaR as of December 31,   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | $  51  | $  74  |\n| For the year ended December 31,                                                                                                                |        |        |\n| Average  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  62  | $  51  |\n| Maximum   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 82     | 86     |\n| Minimum    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 41     | 26     |\n\nThe Company also uses VaR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-tomarket accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term  of  these  instruments  entered  into  for  both  asset  management  and  trading  was  $185  million  as  of  December  31,  2023, primarily driven by asset-backed transactions.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. NRG is exposed to counterparty credit risk through various activities including wholesale sales,  fuel  purchases  and  retail  supply  arrangements,  and  retail  customer  credit  risk  through  its  retail  load  activities. Counterparty credit risk and retail customer credit risk are discussed below. See Note 6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , to this Form 10-K for discussion regarding credit risk contingent features.\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established  credit  approval  process;  (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation measures  such  as  margin,  collateral,  prepayment  arrangements,  or  volumetric  limits;  (iv)  the  use  of  payment  netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the  amount  and  timing  of  expected  cash  flows.  The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  counterparty  risk  by  having  a  diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.",

NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 63% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off  by  the  end  of  2025.  The  following  table  highlights  the  net  counterparty  credit  exposure  by  industry  sector  and  by counterparty  credit  quality.  Net  counterparty  credit  exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS, and non-derivative  transactions.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  aggregate  credit  exposure  is  shown  net  of  collateral  held,  and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                               | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other                                                                                                                       | 80 %                                 |\n| Financial institutions   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 20                                   |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n| Category                                                                                                                                                               | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n| Investment grade   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 44 %                                 |\n| Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 56                                   |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n\nThe Company has exposure to one wholesale counterparty in excess of 10% of the total net exposure discussed above as of  December  31,  2023.  Changes  in  hedge  positions  and  market  prices  will  affect  credit  exposure  and  counterparty concentration.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, AESO, IESO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in the majority of these markets is approved by FERC, whereas in the case of ERCOT, it is approved by the PUCT, and whereas in the case of AESO and IESO, both exist provincially with AESO primarily subject to Alberta Utilities Commission and the IESO subject to the Ontario Energy Board. These ISOs may include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG's share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE,  NYMEX  and  Nodal.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long-term contracts, primarily solar under Renewable PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company  values  these  contracts  based  on  various  techniques  including,  but  not  limited  to,  internal  models  based  on  a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2023, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $882 million for the next five years.\n\n## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to retail credit risk through the Company's retail electricity and gas providers as well as through Vivint Smart Home. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit  risk  through  the  use  of  established  credit  policies,  which  include  monitoring  of  the  portfolio  and  the  use  of  credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.",

        "page_content": "As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Company's  retail  customer  credit  exposure  to  Home  and  Business  customers  was diversified  across  many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead  to  an  increase  in  credit  losses.  The  Company's  provision  for  credit  losses  resulting  from  credit  risk  was  $251  million, $11 million and $698 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $126 million related to Winter Storm Uri. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for credit losses included $596 million of expenses due to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline, primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts as of December 31, 2023, a $0.50 per  MMBtu  decrease  in  natural  gas  prices  across  the  term  of  the  marginable  contracts  would  cause  an  increase  in  margin collateral posted of approximately $1.5 billion and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh decrease in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately $350 million. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nNRG is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  through  its  issuance  of  variable  rate  debt.  Exposures  to  interest  rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into  account  the  combinations  of  the  variable  rate  debt  and  the  interest  rate  derivative  instrument.  NRG's  risk  management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company entered into $1.0 billion of interest rate swaps through 2027 to hedge the floating rate on the Term Loan acquired with the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps  to  hedge  the  floating  rate  on  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility  extending  through  2024,  which  was  fully  terminated  in conjunction with the pay down of the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's debt fair value was $10.6 billion and carrying value was $10.8 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by $602 million.\n\n## Currency Exchange Risk\n\nNRG is subject  to  transactional  exchange  rate  risk  from  transactions  with  customers  in  countries  outside  of  the  U.S., primarily within Canada, as well as from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the Company's functional currency or the functional currency  of  an  applicable  subsidiary.  NRG  hedges  a  portion  of  its  forecasted  currency  transactions  with  foreign  exchange forward contracts. As of December 31, 2023, NRG is exposed to changes in foreign currency primarily associated with the purchase of U.S. dollar denominated natural gas for its Canadian business and entered into foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $548 million.\n\nThe Company is subject to translation exchange rate risk related to the translation of the financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollars. A hypothetical 10% appreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2023, would have resulted in a decrease of $36 million to net income within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\n## Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe financial statements and schedules are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 9 - Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.",

        "page_content": "## Item 9A - Controls and Procedures\n\n## Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of NRG's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on  this  evaluation,  the  Company's  principal  executive  officer,  principal  financial  officer  and  principal  accounting  officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated under the caption \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" and under the caption \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, Inc. As part of integration, the Company designed and implemented a control structure over Vivint Smart Home's operations. Other than the Vivint  Smart  Home  acquisition,  there  were  no  changes  in  NRG's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  (as  such  term  is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NRG's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls\n\nNRG's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- 1. Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the Company's assets;\n- 2. Provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and\n- 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInternal  control  over  financial  reporting  cannot  provide  absolute  assurance  of  achieving  financial  reporting  objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial reporting,  as  such  term  is  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rule  13a-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the  Company  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company's evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , the  Company's  management  concluded  that  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of December 31, 2023.\n\nOn  March  10,  2023,  NRG  acquired  Vivint  Smart  Home,  Inc.,  and  management  excluded  from  its  assessment  of  the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, Vivint Smart Home, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets) of 5% and  total  revenues  of  5%  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  the  Company  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  related  consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss)/income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  Company  acquired  Vivint  Smart  Home,  Inc.  during  2023,  and  management  excluded  from  its  assessment  of  the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, Vivint Smart Home, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets) of 5% and  total  revenues  of  5%  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2023. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Vivint Smart Home, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also, projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP",

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n## To the Board of Directors and Stockholders\n\nNRG Energy, Inc.:\n\n## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss)/income, stockholders' equity,  and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  2023,  and  the  related  notes  and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the  results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  2023,  in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal  Control -Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  had  $28,823  million  of  revenues. Revenue is derived from various revenue streams in different geographic markets and the Company's processes and related information technology (IT) systems used to record revenue differ for each of these revenue streams.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues as a critical audit matter which required a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  due  to  the  number  of  revenue  streams  and  IT  systems  involved  in  the  revenue recognition process. This included determining the revenue streams over which procedures were to be performed and evaluating the nature and extent of evidence obtained over the individual revenue streams as well as revenue in the aggregate. It also included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the performance of certain procedures.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We, with the assistance of IT professionals, applied auditor judgment to determine the revenue streams over which procedures were performed as well as the nature and extent of such procedures. For certain revenue streams over which procedures were performed,",

        "page_content": "we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's revenue recognition processes. For certain revenue streams, we involved IT professionals, who assisted in testing certain IT applications used by the Company in its revenue recognition processes. In addition, we assessed recorded revenue for a selection of transactions by comparing the amounts recognized to underlying documentation, including contracts with customers,  and  for  certain  revenue  streams,  we  performed  a  software-assisted  data  analysis  to  assess  certain relationships among revenue transactions. In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenues by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of such evidence.\n\n## Fair value of certain acquired intangible assets\n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Vivint Smart Home, Inc. on March 10, 2023 for total consideration of $2,623 million. In connection with the business combination, the Company recorded various intangible assets, which included customer relationships and technology intangible assets with an acquisition-date fair value of $1,740 million and $860 million, respectively.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the acquisition-date fair value of the customer relationships and technology intangible assets as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective and complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate key assumptions used to value these acquired intangible assets. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the key assumptions used to value the intangible assets acquired which required challenging auditor judgment. Specifically, key assumptions included the customer attrition for the customer relationships intangible asset and the discount rate for the customer relationships and technology intangible assets. Changes to these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair value of such assets. In addition, valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were needed to assist in the evaluation of the discount rate.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's acquisition-date valuation process,  including  controls  related  to  the  selection  of  the  customer  attrition  used  in  the  customer  relationships intangible  asset  and  the  discount  rate  used  in  the  customer  relationships  and  technology  intangible  assets.  We evaluated  the  customer  attrition  used  by  the  Company  by  comparing  it  to  historical  attrition  experienced  by  the acquired company and comparable company attrition. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge,  who  assisted  in  evaluating  the  discount  rate  by  assessing  the  relative  risk  profile  of  the  customer relationships  and  technology  intangible  assets  compared  to  the  required  rate  of  return  of  all  acquired  assets  in  the business combination.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2004.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania February 28, 2024",

NRG is a leading energy and  home  services  company  fueled  by  market-leading  brands,  proprietary  technologies,  and  complementary  sales  channels. Across the United States and Canada, NRG delivers innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names such  as  NRG,  Reliant,  Direct  Energy,  Green  Mountain  Energy  and  Vivint,  while  also  advocating  for  competitive  energy markets and customer choice. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 8 million residential consumers in addition to commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 13 GW of generation.\n\nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas, other than Cottonwood;\n- \u00b7 East, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Services/Other, which includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the West and Canada, (ii) the Services businesses (iii) activity related to the Cottonwood facility and other investments;\n- \u00b7 Vivint Smart Home; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  The  ASC, established by the FASB, is the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. In addition, the rules  and  interpretative  releases  of  the  SEC  under  authority  of  federal  securities  laws  are  also  sources  of  authoritative  U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include NRG's accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company  has  a  controlling  interest.  All  significant  intercompany  transactions  and  balances  have  been  eliminated  in consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity.  However,  a  controlling  financial  interest  may  also  exist  through  arrangements  that  do  not  involve  controlling  voting interests. As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810, Consolidations, or  ASC 810, to determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests, referred to as a VIE, should be consolidated.\n\nThe Company identified an error in the previously issued consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the presentation of cash flows associated with certain borrowings and repayments related to the Revolving Credit Facility. The statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been adjusted to present on a gross basis the borrowings from the Revolving Credit Facility of $1.4 billion and the related repayments of $1.4 billion. The change had no impact to the total cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. We evaluated the materiality of this error both qualitatively and quantitatively and have concluded it is immaterial to the impacted period.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri Uplift Securitization Proceeds\n\nThe Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 in May 2021 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute  to  LSEs  that  were  charged  and  paid  to  ERCOT  those  highly  priced  ancillary  service  and  ORDPA  during  Winter Storm Uri.\n\nIn December 2021, ERCOT filed with the PUCT a calculation of each LSE's share of proceeds based on the settlement methodology. The Company accounted for the proceeds by analogy to the contribution model within ASC 958-605, Not-forProfit Entities- Revenue Recognition and the grant model within IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance , as a reduction to expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate. The Company received proceeds of $689 million from ERCOT in June 2022.\n\n## NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

        "page_content": "## Credit Losses\n\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , or ASU No. 2016-13, retail trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet net of the allowance for  credit  losses  within  accounts  receivables,  net.  Long-term  receivables  are  recorded  net  in  other  non-current  assets  on  the consolidated balance sheet. The Company accrues an allowance for current expected credit losses based on (i) estimates of uncollectible  revenues  by  analyzing  accounts  receivable  aging  and  current  and  reasonable  forecasts  of  expected  economic factors  including,  but  not  limited  to,  unemployment  rates  and  weather-related  events,  (ii)  historical  collections  and delinquencies, and (iii) counterparty credit ratings for commercial and industrial customers. The Company writes off customer contract receivable balances against the allowance for credit losses when it is determined a receivable is uncollectible.\n\nThe following table represents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n|                                                                                     | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                       | 2023                      | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Beginning balance   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | $  133                    | $  683                    | $  67                     |\n| Acquired balance from Vivint Smart Home                                             | 22                        | -                         | -                         |\n| Acquired balance from Direct Energy    . . . . . . . . . . . .                      | -                         | -                         | 112                       |\n| Provision for credit losses (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | 251                       | 11                        | 698                       |\n| Write-offs   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | (313)                     | (593)                     | (224)                     |\n| Recoveries collected   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | 39                        | 32                        | 30                        |\n| Other   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 13                        | -                         | -                         |\n| Ending balance (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | $  145                    | $  133                    | $  683                    |\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $126 million related to Winter Storm Uri. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for credit  losses  included  $596  million  of  expense  due  to  the  impacts  of  Winter  Storm  Uri.  The  increase  in  write-offs  for  the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to the resolution of credit losses that occurred during Winter Storm Uri.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.\n\n## Funds Deposited by Counterparties\n\nFunds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by the Company as a result of collateral posting obligations from its  counterparties  related  to  NRG's  hedging  program.  The  decrease  in  funds  deposited  by  counterparties  is  driven  by  the significant decrease in forward positions as a result of decreases in natural gas and power prices compared to December 31, 2022.  Though  some  amounts  are  segregated  into  separate  accounts,  not  all  funds  are  contractually  restricted.  Based  on  the Company's intention, these funds are not available for the payment of general corporate obligations; however, they are available for liquidity management. Depending on market fluctuations and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than twelve months, the funds deposited by counterparties are classified as a current asset on the Company's balance sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities.",

The Company removes natural gas inventory as goods are delivered to customers and as they are used in the production of electricity or steam. The Company removes fuel oil and coal inventories as they are used in the production of electricity. The Company removes spare parts inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects. The Company expects to recover the natural gas, fuel oil, coal and spare parts costs in the ordinary course of business. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a first in first out basis for finished goods and weighted average cost method for all other inventories. The Company removes finished goods inventories as they are sold to customers. Inventories sold to customers as part of a smart home system are generally capitalized as contract costs. Sales of inventory are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of business acquisitions, fair value; however, impairment adjustments  are  recorded  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  their  carrying  values  may  not  be recoverable.  Significant  additions  or  improvements  extending  asset  lives  are  capitalized  as  incurred,  while  repairs  and maintenance that do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation, other  than  nuclear  fuel,  is  computed  using  the  straight-line  method,  while  nuclear  fuel  was  amortized  based  on  units  of production over the estimated useful lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations. For further discussion, see Note 9, Property, Plant and Equipment .\n\n## Business Interruption Insurance\n\nThe Company carries insurance policies to cover insurable risks including, but not limited to, business interruption. As a result of damage at the Limestone 1 and W.A. Parish 8 units, the Company recorded business interruption insurance settlements of  $7  million  and  $81  million  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023  and  December  31,  2022,  respectively.  Business interruption  insurance  is  recorded  to  cost  of  operations  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and  cash  provided  by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Asset Impairments\n\nLong-lived  assets  that  are  held  and  used  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360. An impairment loss is  indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an asset's carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in  operating  costs  and  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Fair  values  are  determined  by  a  variety  of valuation methods, including third-party appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present value techniques.\n\nInvestments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 323, InvestmentsEquity Method and Joint Ventures ,  or  ASC  323,  which  requires  that  a  loss  in  value  of  an  investment  that  is  an  other-thantemporary  decline  should  be  recognized.  The  Company  identifies  and  measures  losses  in  the  value  of  equity  method investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value. For further discussion of these matters, refer to Note 11, Asset Impairments .",

        "page_content": "## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nDebt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, or as an asset if the issuance costs relate to revolving debt agreements or certain other financing arrangements.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible  assets  represent  contractual  rights  held  by  the  Company.  The  Company  recognizes  specifically  identifiable intangible  assets  including  emissions  allowances,  customer  and  supply  contracts,  customer  relationships,  marketing partnerships,  technologies,  trade  names  and  fuel  contracts  when  specific  rights  and  contracts  are  acquired.  These  intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units  of  production  basis.  As  of  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  Company  had  accumulated  amortization  related  to  its intangible assets of $3.0 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.\n\nEmission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.\n\nFor further discussion, see Note 12, Goodwill and Other Intangibles .\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ,  or  ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company may first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment.\n\nIn the absence of sufficient qualitative factors indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that no impairment occurred, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill impairment losses recognized refer to Note 11, Asset Impairments .\n\n## Capitalized Contract Costs\n\nCapitalized  contract  costs  represent  the  costs  directly  related  and  incremental  to  the  origination  of  new  contracts, modification of existing contracts or to the fulfillment of the related subscriber contracts. These costs include installed products, commissions, other compensation and the cost of installation of new or upgraded customer contracts. The Company calculates amortization  by  accumulating  all  deferred  contract  costs  into  separate  portfolios  based  on  the  initial  month  of  service  and amortizes those deferred contract costs on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, consistent with the pattern in which the Company provides services to its customers. The expected period of benefit for customers is approximately five years. The Company updates its estimate of the expected period of benefit periodically and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the expected period of benefit could change significantly. Such changes, if any, are accounted for prospectively as a  change in estimate. Amortization of capitalized contract costs related to fulfillment are included in cost of operations and amortization  of  capitalized  contract  costs  related  to  customer  acquisition  are  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract costs not directly related and incremental to the origination of new contracts, modification of existing contracts or to the fulfillment of the related subscriber contracts are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using  the  liability  method  in  accordance  with  ASC  740, Income  Taxes, or ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences.",

        "page_content": "The Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit - current and deferred, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and\n- \u00b7 Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income\n\nThe Company reports some of its revenues and expenses differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax return purposes, resulting in temporary and permanent differences between the Company's financial statements and income tax returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company measures its deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the deferred tax is realized.\n\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to  income  taxes.  Under  ASC  740,  tax  benefits  are  recognized  when  it  is  more-likely-than-not  that  a  tax  position  will  be sustained  upon  examination  by  the  authorities.  The  benefit  recognized  from  a  position  is  the  amount  of  benefit  that  has surpassed  the  more-likely-than-not  threshold,  as  it  is  more  than  50%  likely  to  be  realized  upon  settlement.  The  Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\nIn  accordance  with  ASC 740 and as discussed further in Note 20, Income Taxes ,  changes  to  existing  net  deferred  tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax benefits, are recorded to income tax (benefit)/expense.\n\n## Contract and Emission Credit Amortization\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  recognized  through  acquisitions  related  to  the  purchase  and  sale  of  energy  and  energy-related products  in  future  periods  for  which  the  fair  value  has  been  determined  to  be  significantly  less  or  more  than  market  are amortized  to  revenues  or  cost  of  operations  over  the  term  of  each  underlying  contract  based  on  actual  generation  and/or contracted volumes.\n\nEmission credits represent the right to emit a specified amount of certain pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, over a compliance period. Emission credits held for use are amortized to cost of operations based on the weighted average cost of the allowances held.\n\n## Gross Receipts and Sales Taxes\n\nIn  connection  with  its  retail  sales,  the  Company  records  gross  receipts  taxes  on  a  gross  basis  in  revenues  and  cost  of operations  in  its  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023,  2022,  and  2021,  the Company's revenues  and  cost  of  operations  included  gross  receipts  taxes  of  $212  million,  $218  million,  and  $184  million, respectively.  Additionally,  the  Company  records  sales  taxes  collected  from  its  taxable  retail  customers  and  remitted  to  the various governmental entities on a net basis; thus, there is no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\n\n## Cost of Operations\n\nCost of operations includes cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization, operations and maintenance, and other cost of operations.\n\n## Cost of Fuel, Purchased Energy and Other Cost of Sales\n\nCost of fuel is primarily the costs associated with procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and coal to operate the generation portfolio, which is expensed as the fuel is consumed. Purchased energy primarily relates to purchases  to  supply  the  Company's  customer  base,  which  includes  spot  market  purchases,  as  well  as  contracts  of  various quantities and durations, including Renewable PPAs with third-party developers, which are primarily accounted for as NPNS (see further discussion in Derivative Instruments below). Other cost of sales primarily consists of TDSP expenses.\n\nThe cost of fuel is based on actual and estimated fuel usage for the applicable reporting period. The cost to deliver energy and related services to customers is based on actual and estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. A portion of the cost of energy, $240 million, $202 million, and $189 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, was accrued and consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities.\n\nIn  estimating  supply  volumes,  the  Company  considers  the  effects  of  historical  customer  volumes,  weather  factors  and usage by customer class. Transmission and distribution delivery fees are estimated using the same method used for electricity sales and services to retail customers. In addition, ISO fees are estimated based on historical trends, estimated supply volumes and initial ISO settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Vivint Smart Home Flex Pay\n\nUnder the Flex Pay plan ('Flex Pay'), offered by Vivint Smart Home, subscribers pay separately for smart home products and services (smart home and security). The subscriber has the ability to pay for Vivint Smart Home products in the following three ways: (i) qualified subscribers may finance the purchase through third-party financing providers (\"Consumer Financing Program\" or 'CFP'), (ii) Vivint Smart Home generally offers a limited number of subscribers not eligible for the CFP, but who qualify under Vivint Smart Home underwriting criteria, the option to enter into a retail installment contract directly with Vivint Smart Home or (iii) subscribers may conduct purchases by check, automatic clearing house payments, credit or debit card or by obtaining short term financing (generally no more than six-month installment terms) through Vivint Smart Home.\n\nAlthough subscribers pay separately for products and services under Flex Pay, the Company has determined that the sale of products and services are one single performance obligation resulting in deferred revenue for the gross amount of products sold.  For  products  financed  through  the  CFP,  gross  deferred  revenues  are  reduced  by  (i)  any  fees  the  third-party  financing provider ('Financing Provider') is contractually entitled to receive at the time of loan origination, and (ii) the present value of expected future payments due to the Financing Providers . Loans are issued on either an installment or revolving basis with repayment terms ranging from 6 to 60 months.\n\nFor certain Financing Provider loans:\n\n- \u00b7 Vivint Smart Home pays a monthly fee based on either the average daily outstanding balance of the installment loans, or the number of outstanding loans.\n- \u00b7 Vivint Smart Home incurs fees at the time of the loan origination and receives proceeds that are net of these fees.\n- \u00b7 Vivint Smart Home also shares liability for credit losses, with Vivint Smart Home being responsible for between 2.6% and 100% of lost principal balances.\n\nDue to the nature of these provisions, the Company records a derivative liability (\"CFP Derivative\") at its fair value when the  Financing  Provider  originates  loans  to  subscribers,  which  reduces  the  amount  of  estimated  revenue  recognized  on  the provision of the services. The derivative liability is reduced as payments are made by Vivint Smart Home to the Financing Provider.  Subsequent  changes  to  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative  liability  are  realized  through  other  income,  net  in  the consolidated statements of operations. For further discussion, see Note 6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities .\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments under ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value  and  changes  in  fair  value  in  earnings,  unless  they  qualify  for  the  NPNS  exception.  The Company's primary derivative instruments are power and natural gas purchase or sales contracts, fuels purchase contracts, the CFP and other energy related commodities used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuation in market prices. In order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In addition, in order to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company did not have derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.\n\nRevenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is delivered. While these contracts are considered derivative instruments under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.\n\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in earnings.\n\n## Mark-to-Market for Economic Hedging Activities\n\nNRG enters into derivative instruments to manage price and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio  and  manage  working  capital  requirements.  The  mark-to-market  for  economic  hedging  activities  are  recognized  to revenues or cost of operations during the reporting period.\n\n## Operations and Maintenance and Other Cost of Operations\n\nOperations and maintenance costs include major and other routine preventative (planned outage) and corrective (forced outage) maintenance activities to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the Company's generation portfolio in compliance",

        "page_content": "with all local, state and federal requirements. Operations and maintenance costs are also costs associated with retaining and maintaining the Company's customer base, such as call center support, portfolio maintenance and data analytics. Other cost of operations primarily includes gross receipts taxes, insurance, property taxes and asset retirement obligation expense.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\n\nThe local currencies are generally the functional currency of NRG's foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the weighted-average  rates  of  exchange  for  the  period.  The  resulting  currency  translation  adjustments  are  not  included  in  the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign entity takes place.  Foreign  currency  transaction  gains  or  losses  are  reported  within  other  income,  net  in  the  Company's  consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction  gains/(losses)  were  immaterial.  The  Company's  cumulative  translation  adjustment  balances  as  of  December  31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $(43) million, $(55) million, and $(8) million, respectively.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trust funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives and investments in debt securities. Trust funds are held in accounts managed by experienced investment advisors. Certain accounts receivable, notes receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other  conditions.  Receivables  and  other  contractual  arrangements  are  subject  to  collateral  requirements  under  the  terms  of enabling  agreements.  However,  the  Company  believes  that  the  credit  risk  posed  by  industry  concentration  is  offset  by  the diversification  and  creditworthiness  of  its  customer  base.  See  Note  5, Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments, for  a  further discussion of derivative concentrations.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  AROs  in  accordance  with  ASC  410-20, Asset  Retirement  Obligations, or  ASC  410-20. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of ASC 410-20 are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC 410-20 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\n\nUpon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. Over time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the  capitalized  cost  is  depreciated  over  the  useful  life  of  the  related  asset.  See  Note  14, Asset Retirement Obligations, for  a further discussion of AROs.\n\n## Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\nThe  Company  offers  pension  benefits  through  a  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  In  addition,  the  Company  provides postretirement  health  and  welfare  benefits  for  certain  groups  of  employees.  The  Company  accounts  for  pension  and  other postretirement  benefits  in  accordance  with  ASC  715, Compensation  -  Retirement  Benefits ,  or  ASC  715 . The  Company recognizes the funded status of the Company's defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records an offset for gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have not been included as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost  to  other  comprehensive  income.  The  determination  of  the  Company's  obligation  and  expenses  for  pension  benefits  is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. The Company's actuarial consultants assist in determining assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. For further discussion, see Note 15, Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits .\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  its  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC  718, Compensation  -  Stock Compensation, or ASC 718 . The fair value of the Company's performance stock units is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo  valuation  model.  NRG  uses  the  Company's  common  stock  price  on  the  date  of  grant  as  the  fair  value  of  the Company's deferred stock units. Forfeiture  rates  are  estimated  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  Company's  historical  forfeitures, employment turnover, and expected future behavior. The Company recognizes compensation expense for both graded and cliff",

For further discussion, see Note 21, Stock-Based Compensation .\n\n## Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method\n\nThe Company has investments in various domestic energy projects, as well as one Australian project. The equity method of accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents the Company from exercising a controlling influence over the operating and financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of its Australian project, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Distributions from equity method investments that represent earnings on the Company's investment are included within cash flows from operating activities and distributions from  equity  method  investments  that  represent  a  return  of  the  Company's  investment  are  included  within  cash  flows  from investing activities. For further discussion, see Note 17, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities .\n\n## Sale-Leaseback Arrangements\n\nNRG is party to sale-leaseback arrangements that provide for the sale of certain assets to a third-party and simultaneously leases back the same asset to the Company. If the seller-lessee transfers control of the underlying assets to the buyer-lessor, the arrangement is accounted for under ASC 842-40, Sale-Leaseback Transactions. These arrangements are classified as operating leases on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Marketing and Advertising Costs\n\nThe Company expenses its marketing and advertising  costs  as  incurred  and  includes  them  within  selling,  general  and administrative  costs.  The  costs  of  tangible  assets  used  in  advertising  campaigns  are  recorded  as  fixed  assets  or  deferred advertising costs and amortized as advertising costs over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the advertising campaign. The  Company  has  several  long-term  sponsorship  arrangements.  Payments  related  to  these  arrangements  are  deferred  and expensed over the term of the arrangement. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $185 million, $82 million, and $109 million, respectively.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business combination. In addition, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nIn recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information  available.  Estimates  are  used  for  such  items  as  plant  depreciable  lives,  tax  provisions,  uncollectible  accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs, the valuation of energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of impaired  assets.  As  better  information  becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  are  determinable,  the  recorded  estimates  are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Adopted in 2023\n\nASU 2021-08 - In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers ,  or  ASU 2021-08, which requires that an entity recognize  and  measure  contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  acquired  in  a  business  combination  as  if  it  had  originated  the contracts in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . As a result, an acquirer should recognize and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistently with how they were recognized and measured in the",

The amendments per ASU 2021-08 apply only to contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers, as defined in Topic 606, such as refund liabilities and upfront payments to customers. Assets and liabilities under related Topics, such as deferred costs under Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, are not within the scope of amendments per ASU 2021-08. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 prospectively effective January 1, 2023 and applied the amended requirements to the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU 2023-07 - In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , or ASU 2023-07. The guidance in ASU 2023-07 enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss, an amount and description of its composition for other  segment  items  and  interim  disclosures  of  a  reportable  segment's  profit  or  loss  and  assets.  The  amendments  of  ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 on its disclosures.\n\nASU 2023-09 -  In  December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income  Tax  Disclosures ,  or  ASU  2023-09.  The  guidance  in  ASU  2023-09  enhances  income  tax  disclosures  by  requiring disclosure  of  specific  categories  in  the  effective  tax  rate  reconciliation  and  additional  information  for  reconciling  items  that meet a quantitative threshold. Further the amendments of ASU 2023-09 require certain disclosures on income tax expense and income  taxes  paid.  ASU  2023-09  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2024,  with  early  adoption permitted. The amendments of ASU 2023-09 may be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\n\n## Note 3 -Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's policies with respect to its various revenue streams are detailed below. The Company generally applies the invoicing practical expedient to recognize revenue for the revenue streams detailed below, except in circumstances where the invoiced amount does not represent the value transferred to the customer.\n\n## Retail Revenue\n\nGross revenues for energy sales and services to retail customers are recognized as the Company transfers the promised goods and services to the customer. Payment terms are generally 15 to 60 days. For the majority of its electricity and natural gas contracts, the Company's performance obligation with the customer is satisfied over time and performance obligations for its electricity and natural gas products are recognized as the customer takes possession of the product. The Company also allocates the contract consideration to distinct performance obligations in a contract for which the timing of the revenue recognized is different. Additionally, customer discounts and incentives reduce the contract consideration and are recognized over the term of the contract.\n\nEnergy sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated. Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading provided by the independent system operators, utilities, or electric distribution companies. Volume estimates are based on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage  by  class.  Unbilled  revenues  are  calculated  by  multiplying  these  volume  estimates  by  the  applicable  rate  by  customer class. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed.\n\nAs contracts for retail electricity and natural gas can be for multi-year periods, the Company has performance obligations under these contracts that have not yet been satisfied. These performance obligations have transaction prices that are both fixed and variable, and that vary based on the contract duration, customer type, inception date and other contract-specific factors. For the fixed price contracts, the amount of any unsatisfied performance obligations will vary based on customer usage, which will depend on factors such as weather and customer activity and therefore it is not practicable to estimate such amounts.\n\n## Vivint Smart Home Retail Revenue\n\nVivint Smart Home offers its subscribers combinations of smart home products and services, which together create an integrated  smart  home  system  that  allows  the  Company's  subscribers  to  monitor,  control  and  protect  their  homes.  As  the products and services included in the subscriber's contract are integrated and highly interdependent, and because the products (including installation) and services must work together to deliver the monitoring, controlling and protection of their home, the Company has concluded that the products and services contracted for by the subscriber are generally not distinct within the context of the contract and, therefore, constitute a single, combined performance obligation. Revenues for this single, combined performance obligation are recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscriber's contract term, which is the period in which the parties to the contract have enforceable rights and obligations. The Company has determined that certain contracts that do not require a long-term commitment for monitoring services by the subscriber contain a material right to renew the contract,",

Proceeds  allocated  to  the  material  right  are recognized over the expected period of benefit. The majority of Vivint Smart Home's subscription contracts are five years and are generally non-cancelable. These contracts generally convert into month-to-month agreements at the end of the initial term, while  some  subscribers  are  month-to-month  from  inception.  Payment  for  Vivint  Smart  Home  services  is  generally  due  in advance  on  a  monthly  basis,  with  payment  terms  up  to  30  days.  Product  sales  and  other  one-time  fees  are  invoiced  to subscribers  at  time  of  sale.  Revenues  for  any  products  or  services  that  are  considered  separate  performance  obligations  are recognized upon delivery. Payments received or billed in advance are reported as deferred revenues.\n\n## Energy Revenue\n\nBoth physical and financial transactions consist of revenues billed to a third-party at either market or negotiated contract terms to optimize the financial performance of the Company's generating facilities. Payment terms vary from 5 to 55 days. Electric  energy  revenue  is  recognized  upon  transmission  to  the  customer  over  time,  using  the  output  method  for  measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations. Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to meet supply and demand,  are  recorded  on  a  gross  basis  in  the  Company's  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  The  Company  applies  the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is equal to the value to the customer of NRG's performance obligation completed to date. Financial transactions used to hedge the sale of electricity are recorded net within revenues in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 815.\n\nAncillary revenues, included in Other revenue, are recognized over time as the obligation is fulfilled, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations.\n\n## Capacity Revenue\n\nThe Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM and NYISO. Capacity revenues also include  revenues  billed  to  a  third-party  at  either  market  or  negotiated  contract  terms  for  making  installed  generation  and demand response capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. Payment terms vary from 15 to 55 days. Capacity revenues are recognized over time, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is equal to the value to the customer of NRG's performance obligation completed to date.\n\n## Performance Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, estimated future fixed fee performance obligations are $1.4 billion, $1.0 billion, $756 million, $468 million and $176 million for fiscal years 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. These performance obligations include Vivint Smart Home products and services as well as cleared auction MWs in the PJM, NYISO and MISO capacity auctions. The cleared auction MWs are subject to penalties for non-performance.",

        "page_content": "The  Company's  capitalized  contract  costs  consist  of  commission  payments,  broker  fees  and  other  costs  that  represent incremental  costs  of  obtaining  the  contract  with  customers  for  which  the  Company  expects  to  recover.  Capitalized  contract costs  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  expected  period  of  benefit  of  five  years.  As  a  practical  expedient,  the Company expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less.\n\nWhen the Company receives consideration from the customer that is in excess of the amount due, such consideration is reclassified  to  deferred  revenue,  which  represents  a  contract  liability.  Smart  home  products  and  services  performance obligations are recognized over the customer's contract term, which is generally three to five years. Energy contract liabilities are generally recognized to revenue in the next period as the Company satisfies its performance obligations.\n\n## Note 4 Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## 2023 Acquisitions\n\n## Vivint Smart Home Acquisition\n\nOn March 10, 2023 (the \"Acquisition Closing Date\"), the Company completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, Inc., pursuant  to  the  Agreement  and  Plan  of  Merger,  dated  as  of  December  6,  2022,  by  and  among  the  Company,  Vivint  Smart Home, Inc. and Jetson Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ('Merger Sub') pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Vivint Smart Home, Inc., with Vivint Smart Home, Inc. surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Dedicated to redefining the home experience with intelligent products and services, Vivint Smart Home brought approximately two million subscribers to NRG. Vivint Smart Home's single, expandable platform incorporates artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning  into  its  operating  system  and  its  vertically  integrated  business  model  includes hardware, software, sales, installation, customer service and technical support and professional monitoring, enabling superior subscriber experiences and a complete end-to-end smart home experience. The acquisition accelerated the realization of NRG's consumer-focused  growth  strategy  and  creates  a  leading  essential  home  services  platform  fueled  by  market-leading  brands, unparalleled insights, proprietary technologies and complementary sales channels.\n\nNRG paid $12 per share, or approximately $2.6 billion in cash. The Company funded the acquisition using:\n\n- \u00b7 proceeds of $724 million from newly issued $740 million 7.000% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2033, net of issuance costs and discount;\n- \u00b7 proceeds of $635 million from newly issued $650 million 10.25% Series A Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs;\n- \u00b7 proceeds  of  approximately  $900  million  drawn  from  its  Revolving  Credit  Facility  and  Receivables  Securitization Facilities; and\n- \u00b7 cash on hand.\n\nIn February 2023, the Company increased its Revolving Credit Facility by $600 million to meet the additional liquidity requirements related to the acquisition. For further discussion, see Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases.\n\nAcquisition  costs  of  $38  million  and  $17  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  respectively,  are included in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\n\nThe  acquisition  has  been  recorded  as  a  business  combination  under  ASC  805,  with  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities acquired recorded at their estimated Acquisition Closing Date fair value.

        "page_content": "## Fair Value Measurement of Intangible Assets\n\nThe  fair  values  of  intangible  assets  as  of  the  Acquisition  Closing  Date  were  measured  primarily  based  on  significant inputs that are observable and unobservable in the market and thus represent Level 2 and Level 3 measurements, respectively. Significant inputs were as follows:\n\nCustomer relationships Customer relationships, reflective of Vivint Smart Home's subscriber base, were valued using an excess earning method of the income approach, and is classified as Level 3. Under this approach, the Company estimated the present value of expected future cash flows resulting from existing subscriber relationships, considering attrition and charges for  contributory  assets  (such  as  net  working  capital,  fixed  assets,  workforce,  trade  names  and  technology)  utilized  in  the business,  discounted  based  on  the  required  rate  of  return  on  the  acquired  intangible  asset.  The  subscriber  relationships  are amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows. The weighted average amortization period is twelve years.\n\nTechnology Developed technology was valued using a \"relief from royalty\" method of the income approach, and is classified as Level 3. Under this approach, the fair value was estimated to be the present value of royalties saved which assumed the value of the asset based on discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the asset and instead licensed the asset from another company. The estimated cash flows from the developed technology  considered  the  obsolescence  factor  and  was  discounted  based  on  the  required  rate  of  return  on  the  acquired intangible asset. The developed technology is amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows. The weighted average amortization period is five years.\n\nTrade names Trade names were valued using a \"relief from royalty\" method of the income approach, and is classified as Level 3. Under this approach, the fair value is estimated to be the present value of royalties saved which assumed the value of the asset based on discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned  the  asset  and  instead  licensed  the  asset  from  another  company.  The  estimated  cash  flows  from  the  trade  names considered  the  expected  probable  use  of  the  asset  and  was  discounted  based  on  the  required  rate  of  return  on  the  acquired intangible asset. The trade names are amortized to depreciation and amortization, on a straight line basis, over an amortization period of ten years.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement of Acquired Vivint Smart Home Debt\n\nThe Company acquired $2.7 billion in aggregate principal of Vivint  Smart  Home's  2027  Senior  Secured  Notes,  2029 Senior notes and 2028 Senior Secured Term Loan (together, the \"Acquired Vivint Smart Home Debt\") which were recorded at fair value as of the Acquisition Closing Date. The difference between the fair value at the Acquisition Closing Date and the principal outstanding of the Acquired Vivint Smart Home Debt, of $152 million, is being amortized through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Acquired Vivint Smart Home Debt is classified as Level 2 and were measured at fair value using observable market inputs based on interest rates at the Acquisition Closing Date. For additional discussion, see Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement of Derivatives Liabilities\n\nThe derivative liabilities are recorded in connection with the contractual future payment obligations with the financing providers  under  Vivint  Smart  Home's  Consumer  Financing  Program.  The  fair  values  of  the  derivatives  liabilities  as  of  the Acquisition Closing Date were valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as  market  yield  discount  rates,  as  well  as  unobservable  internally  derived  assumptions,  such  as  collateral  prepayment  rates, collateral  default  rates  and  credit  loss  rates.  These  derivatives  are  classified  as  Level  3  and  changes  to  the  fair  value  are recorded  through  other  income,  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  For  additional  discussion,  see  Note  6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\n\n## Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information\n\nThe following table provides unaudited pro forma combined financial information of NRG and Vivint Smart Home, after giving effect to the Vivint Smart Home acquisition and related financing transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2021.  The  pro  forma  financial  information  has  been  prepared  for  illustrative  and  informational  purposes  only,  and  is  not intended to project future operating results or be indicative of what the Company's financial performance would have been had the transactions occurred on the date indicated.

These adjustments include the following:\n\n- (i) Income  statement  effects  of  fair  value  adjustments  based  on  the  purchase  price  allocation  including  amortization  of intangible  assets,  reversal  of  historical  Vivint  Smart  Home  amortization  of  capitalized  contract  costs  and  reversal  of historical Vivint Smart Home other income recorded for the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities, as the warrants are assumed to be cashed out upon the Acquisition Closing Date.\n\n## 2021 Acquisitions\n\n## Direct Energy Acquisition\n\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Direct Energy, which had been a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthened its integrated model. It  also  broadened  the  Company's  presence  in  the  Northeast  and  into  states  and  locales  where  it  did  not  previously  operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.\n\nThe  Company  paid  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $3.625  billion  in  cash  and  total  purchase  price  adjustment  of $99 million, resulting in an adjusted purchase price of $3.724 billion.\n\nAcquisition costs of $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 are included in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.",

NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs  include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives, and trust fund investments.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or  indirectly  observable  through  corroboration  with  observable  market  data.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forward contracts.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset  or  liability  at  the  measurement  date.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include infrequently-traded,  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingled  investment  funds,  and  are  measured  using present value pricing models.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.",

These  trust  fund  investments  held  debt  and  equity securities directly and equity securities indirectly through commingled funds. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds were based on quoted prices in active markets and were categorized in Level 1. In addition, U.S. government and federal agency obligations were categorized as Level 1 because they traded in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair  values of corporate debt securities were based on evaluated prices that reflected observable market information, such as actual  trade  information  of  similar  securities,  adjusted  for  observable  differences  and  were  categorized  in  Level  2.  Certain equity securities, classified as commingled funds, were analogous to mutual funds, were maintained by investment companies, and held certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The fair value of the equity securities classified as commingled funds were based on net asset values per fund share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying equity securities. However, because the shares in the commingled funds were not publicly quoted and not traded in an active market, the commingled funds were measured using net asset value practical expedient. See also Note 7, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.\n\n## Derivative fair value measurements\n\nThe Company's contracts consist of non-exchange-traded contracts valued using prices provided by external sources and exchange-traded contracts with readily available quoted market prices. Beginning in of the fourth quarter of 2023 and as of December 31, 2023, the fair value of non-exchange traded contracts were based on consensus pricing provided by independent pricing services. The pricing data was compiled from market makers with longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes, enhancing reliability and increasing transparency.\n\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company valued derivatives based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions. For the majority of markets that NRG participates in, the Company would receive broker quotes from multiple sources and reflected the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices. The terms for which such price information  is  available  vary  by  commodity,  region  and  product.  The  Company  believes  both  sources  of  price  quotes  are executable.\n\nThe remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. As of December 31, 2023, contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques make up 5% of derivative assets and 6% of derivative liabilities. As a result of NRG switching to consensus pricing as of December 31, 2023, there was a significant decrease in the number of contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques. The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit risk, which for foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated utilizing the bilateral method based on published default probabilities. For commodities, to the extent that NRG's net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty's default swap rate. If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company  uses  NRG's  default  swap  rate.  For  foreign  exchange  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps,  and  commodities,  the  credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG's liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for NRG's assets. As of December 31, 2023, the credit  reserve  resulted  in  a  $18  million  decrease  primarily  within  cost  of  operations.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  the  credit reserve resulted in $9 million decrease primarily within cost of operations.",

        "page_content": "The fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2023 and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange, consensus and over-the-counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices  could  vary  from  those  used  in  recording  assets  and  liabilities  from  energy  marketing  and  trading  activities  and  such variations could be material.\n\nNRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial natural gas, power, capacity contracts and renewable energy certificates  executed  in  illiquid  markets  as  well  as  financial  transmission  rights  (\"FTRs\").  The  significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid natural gas and power location pricing, which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward  market  prices  from  similar  observable  markets  when  not  available.  Forward  capacity  prices  are  based  on  market information, forecasted future electricity demand and supply, past auctions and internally developed pricing models. Renewable energy certificate prices are based on market information and internally developed pricing models. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value. The Consumer Financing Program derivatives are valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates.\n\nThe  following  tables  quantify  the  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  in  developing  the  fair  value  of  the  Company's Level 3 positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n|                                                  | Significant Unobservable Inputs December 31, 2023   | Significant Unobservable Inputs December 31, 2023   | Significant Unobservable Inputs December 31, 2023   | Significant Unobservable Inputs December 31, 2023   | Significant Unobservable Inputs December 31, 2023   | Significant Unobservable Inputs December 31, 2023   | Significant Unobservable Inputs December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                  | Fair Value                                          | Fair Value                                          | Fair Value                                          |                                                     | Input/Range                                         | Input/Range                                         | Input/Range                                         |\n| (in millions, except as  noted)                  | Assets                                              | Liabilities                                         | Valuation  Technique                                | Significant  Unobservable  Input                    | Low                                                 | High                                                | Weighted  Average                                   |\n| Natural Gas  Contracts   . . . . . . . . .       | $  39                                               | $  65                                               | Discounted Cash  Flow                               | Forward Market  Price ($ per  MMBtu)                | $  1                                                | $  15                                               | $  3                                                |\n| Power Contracts   . . .                          | 197                                                 | 66                                                  | Discounted Cash  Flow                               | Forward Market  Price ($ per  MWh)                  | 1                                                   | 210                                                 | 47                                                  |\n| Capacity Contracts   .                           | 21                                                  | 33                                                  | Discounted Cash  Flow                               | Forward Market  Price ($ per MW/ Day)               | 49                                                  | 658                                                 | 285                                                 |\n| Renewable Energy  Certificates   . . . . . . .   | 58                                                  | 14                                                  | Discounted Cash  Flow                               | Forward Market  Price ($ per  Certificate)          | 2                                                   | 320                                                 | 15                                                  |\n| FTRs   . . . . . . . . . . . .                   | 19                                                  | 37                                                  | Discounted Cash  Flow                               | Auction Prices ($  per MWh)                         | (58)                                                | 252                                                 | 0                                                   |\n| Consumer Financing  Program  . . . . . . . . . . | -

to offset cash collateral posted or received against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under the same master netting agreements. The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $441 million of cash collateral posted and $84 million of cash collateral received on its balance sheet.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nIn addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation  measures  such  as  margin,  collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements  that  allow  for  the  netting  of  positive  and  negative  exposures  of  various  contracts  associated  with  a  single counterparty.  Risks  surrounding  counterparty  performance  and  credit  could  ultimately  impact  the  amount  and  timing  of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.",

        "page_content": "## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  counterparty  credit  exposure,  excluding  credit  exposure  from  RTOs,  ISOs,  and  registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $1.6 billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $426 million, resulting in a net exposure of $1.2 billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 63% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2025. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate. The following  tables  highlight  net  counterparty  credit  exposure  by  industry  sector  and  by  counterparty  credit  quality.  Net counterparty  credit  exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with  counterparties  where  netting  is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                               | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other                                                                                                                       | 80 %                                 |\n| Financial institutions   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 20                                   |\n| Total    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n| Category                                                                                                                                                               | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n| Investment grade   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 44 %                                 |\n| Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 56                                   |\n| Total    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n\nThe Company currently has exposure to one wholesale counterparty in excess of 10% of the total net exposure discussed above as of December 31, 2023. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, AESO, IESO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in the majority of these markets is approved by FERC, whereas in the case of ERCOT, it is approved by the PUCT, and whereas in the case of AESO and IESO, both exist provincially with AESO primarily subject to Alberta Utilities Commission and the IESO subject to the Ontario Energy Board. These ISOs may include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG's share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE,  NYMEX  and  Nodal.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, primarily solar  under  Renewable  PPAs.  As  external  sources  or  observable  market  quotes  are  not  always  available  to  estimate  such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2023, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $882 million for the next five years.\n\n## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  retail  credit  risk  through  the  Company's  retail  electricity  and  gas  providers,  which  serve Home and Business customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.",

        "page_content": "As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Company's  retail  customer  credit  exposure  to  Home  and  Business  customers  was diversified  across  many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses. The Company's provision for credit losses was $251 million, $11 million, and $698 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $126 million related to Winter Storm Uri. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for credit losses included $596 million of expenses due to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri.\n\n## Note 6 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. The Company may elect to designate  certain  derivatives  as  cash  flow  hedges,  if  certain  conditions  are  met,  and  defer  the  change  in  fair  value  of  the derivatives to accumulated OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Certain derivative instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and Consumer Financing Program.\n\nAs the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing of its generation assets and retail operations, some of NRG's  commercial  activities  qualify  for  NPNS  accounting.  Most  of  the  retail  load  contracts  either  qualify  for  the  NPNS exception or fail to meet the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the retail supply and fuels supply contracts are recorded under mark-to-market accounting. All of NRG's hedging and trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy.\n\n## Energy-Related Commodities\n\nTo  manage  the  commodity  price  risk  associated  with  the  Company's  competitive  supply  activities  and  the  price  risk associated with wholesale power sales from the Company's electric generation facilities and retail power and gas sales from NRG's  retail  operations,  NRG  enters  into  a  variety  of  derivative  and  non-derivative  hedging  instruments,  utilizing  the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Forward contracts, which commit NRG to purchase or sell energy commodities or fuels in the future;\n- \u00b7 Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument;\n- \u00b7 Swap agreements, which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity;\n- \u00b7 Option contracts, which convey to the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a commodity; and\n- \u00b7 Weather derivative products used to mitigate a portion of lost revenue due to weather.\n\nThe objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated as hedges include:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated power and gas purchases for the Company's retail sales;\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales that provides an acceptable return on the Company's electric generation operations; and\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of the Company's power plants.\n\nThese contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, NRG's derivative assets and liabilities consisted primarily of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Forward and financial contracts for the purchase/sale of electricity and related products economically hedging NRG's generation assets' forecasted output or NRG's retail load obligations through 2036;\n- \u00b7 Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG's generation assets through 2025;\n- \u00b7 Other energy derivatives instruments extending through 2029.",

        "page_content": "Also, as of December 31, 2023, NRG had other energy-related contracts that did not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or qualified for the NPNS exception and were therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Load-following forward electric sale contracts extending through 2036;\n- \u00b7 Load-following forward natural gas purchase and sale contracts extending through 2032;\n- \u00b7 Power tolling contracts through 2036;\n- \u00b7 Coal purchase contracts through 2024;\n- \u00b7 Power transmission contracts through 2029;\n- \u00b7 Natural gas transportation contracts through 2034;\n- \u00b7 Natural gas storage agreements through 2030; and\n- \u00b7 Coal transportation contracts through 2029.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Contracts\n\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements through 2027.\n\n## Interest Rate Swaps\n\nNRG  is  exposed  to  changes  in  interest  rate  through  the  Company's  issuance  of  variable  rate  debt.  To  manage  the Company's interest rate risk, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company entered into $1.0 billion of interest rate swaps through 2027 to hedge the floating rate on the Term Loan acquired with the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the floating rate on the Revolving Credit Facility extending through 2024, which was fully terminated in conjunction with the pay down of the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n## Consumer Financing Program\n\nUnder the Consumer Financing Program, Vivint Smart Home pays a monthly fee to Financing Providers based on either the average daily outstanding balance of the loans or the number of outstanding loans. For certain loans, Vivint Smart Home incurs fees at the time of the loan origination and receives proceeds that are net of these fees. Vivint Smart Home also shares the liability for credit losses, depending on the credit quality of the subscriber. Due to the nature of certain provisions under the Consumer Financing Program, the Company records a derivative liability that is not designated as a hedging instrument and is adjusted to fair value, measured using the present value of the estimated future payments. Changes to the fair value are recorded through other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations. The following represent the contractual future payment obligations with the Financing Providers under the Consumer Financing Program that are components of the derivative:\n\n- \u00b7 Vivint  Smart  Home  pays  either  a  monthly  fee  based  on  the  average  daily  outstanding  balance  of  the  loans,  or  the number of outstanding loans, depending on the Financing Provider;\n- \u00b7 Vivint Smart Home shares the liability for credit losses depending on the credit quality of the subscriber; and\n- \u00b7 Vivint Smart Home pays transactional fees associated with subscriber payment processing.\n\nThe derivative is  classified  as  a  Level  3  instrument.  The  derivative  positions  are  valued  using  a  discounted  cash  flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. In summary, the fair value represents  an  estimate  of  the  present  value  of  the  cash  flows  Vivint  Smart  Home  will  be  obligated  to  pay  to  the  Financing Provider for each component of the derivative.",

The collateral potentially required for contracts with adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as of December 31, 2023 was $600 million. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately $80 million as of December 31, 2023.

NRG accounted for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund  in  accordance  with  ASC  980, Regulated  Operations ,  or  ASC  980,  because  the  Company's  nuclear  decommissioning activities were subject to approval by the PUCT, with regulated rates that are designed to recover all decommissioning costs and that can be charged to and collected from the ratepayers per PUCT mandate. Since the Company was in compliance with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts and the cost of decommissioning was the responsibility of the Texas ratepayers, not NRG, all realized and unrealized gains or losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) related to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund were recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust liability and were not included in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, consistent with regulatory treatment.\n\nFollowing  the  sale  of  the  Company's  44%  equity  interest  in  STP  on  November  1,  2023,  the  Company  is  no  longer responsible for the decommissioning of STP and no longer holds the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund assets. For further discussion of the sale, see Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\n\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and unrealized gains and losses for the securities held in the trust funds as of December 31, 2022, as well as information about the contractual maturities of those securities as of that date.\n\n|                                                                                                               | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions, except otherwise noted)                                                                         | Fair Value                | Unrealized Gains          | Unrealized Losses         | Weighted- average maturities (in years) |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | $  15                     | $  -                      | $  -                      | -                                       |\n| U.S. government and federal agency obligations                                                                | 86                        | -                         | 5                         | 11                                      |\n| Federal agency mortgage-backed securities    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                          | 101                       | -                         | 11                        | 26                                      |\n| Commercial mortgage-backed securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                          | 35                        | -                         | 4                         | 30                                      |\n| Corporate debt securities   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | 114                       | -                         | 13                        | 12                                      |\n| Equity securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 486                       | 346                       | 3                         | -                                       |\n| Foreign government fixed income securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                           | 1                         | -                         | -                         | 17                                      |\n| Total   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  838                    | $  346                    | $  36                     |                                         |\n\nThe following table summarizes proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities and the related realized gains and losses from these sales for the ten months ended October 31, 2023, and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Operating leases with an initial term greater than twelve months are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company made an accounting policy election, as permitted by ASC 842, for all asset classes not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for its short-term leases, which are leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less. For the initial measurement of lease liabilities, the discount rate that the Company uses is either the rate implicit in the lease, if known, or its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term an amount equal to the payments for the lease. The Company recognizes lease expense for all operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the future, should another systematic basis become more representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects to consume the remaining economic benefit of the right-of-use asset, the Company will use that basis for lease expense.\n\nThe Company considers a contract to be or to contain a lease when both of the following conditions apply: 1) an asset is either explicitly or implicitly identified in the contract and 2) the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. The Company has the right to control the use of the identified asset when the Company has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use.\n\nLease payments are typically fixed and payable on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. Lease payments under certain agreements may escalate over the lease term either by a fixed percentage or a fixed dollar amount. Certain leases may provide for variable lease payments in the form of payments based on unit availability, usage, a percentage of sales from the location under lease, or index-based (e.g., the U.S. Consumer Price Index) adjustments to lease payments. The Company has no leases which contain residual value guarantees provided by the Company as a lessee.",

The  fair  value  of  the  assets  was  determined  using  an  income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for each facility. The income approach utilized  estimates  of  after-tax  cash  flows,  which  were  Level  3  fair  value  measurements,  and  included  key  inputs  such  as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\n\nGladstone The Company recorded impairment losses of $102 million on its equity method investment in Gladstone within the West/Services/Other segment as a result of changes in the long-term outlook of the Gladstone facility, prompted by evolving energy policy conditions in Australia and an assessment of the long-term operational landscape of the facility, which concluded  with  the  annual  budget  process.  For  further  discussion  of  the  Gladstone  investment,  see  Note  17,  Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities.\n\nOther Impairments - The Company  additionally recorded impairment losses related to property plant and equipment and leases of $2 million, $4 million and $20 million in the Texas, East and West/Services/Other segments, respectively.\n\n## 2022 Impairment Losses\n\nAstoria Redevelopment Impairment - During the third quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of the land and related assets at the Astoria generating site and the planned withdrawal and cancellation of its proposed Astoria redevelopment project. As a result, the Company impaired $43 million of Astoria project spend in the East segment. For further discussion of the transaction, see Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions .\n\nPJM Asset Impairments -  During  the  second  quarter  of  2022,  the  results  of  the  PJM  Base  Residual  Auction  for  the 2023/2024 delivery year were released leading the Company to revise its long-term view of certain facilities and announce the planned retirement of the Joliet generating facility. The Company considered the near-term retirement date of Joliet and the decline in PJM capacity prices to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. The Company measured the impairment losses on the PJM generating assets and  Midwest  Generation  goodwill  as  the  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  and  the  fair  value  of  the  PJM  generating assets and Midwest Generation reporting unit, respectively. Fair values were determined using an income approach in which the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for the plants and reporting unit. Significant inputs impacting the income approach include the Company's long-term view of capacity and fuel prices, projected generation, the physical and economic characteristics of each plant and the reporting unit as a whole, and the discount rate applied to the after-tax cash flow projections. Impairment losses of $20 million and $130 million were recorded in the East segment on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.\n\nOther Impairments - The Company  additionally recorded impairment losses of $13 million in the East segment.\n\n## 2021 Impairment Losses\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed its annual budget and analyzed the corresponding impact on estimated  cash  flows  associated  with  its  long-lived  assets.  The  fair  value  of  the  assets  was  determined  using  an  income approach  by  applying  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  to  the  long-term  budget  for  the  facility.  The  income  approach utilized  estimates  of  after-tax  cash  flows,  which  were  Level  3  fair  value  measurements,  and  included  key  inputs  such  as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\n\nJoliet -The Company recognized an impairment loss of  $213 million in the East segment as a result of changes in the long-term outlook of the Joliet facility prompted by market conditions and an assessment of various alternatives for the longterm operational landscape of the facility including the impact of the CEJA in Illinois, which concluded with the annual budget process.\n\nOther Impairments -  The  Company additionally recorded impairment losses of $16 million and $9 million related to various power plants in the East and West/Service/Other segments, respectively.\n\nThe Company also recorded the following impairment in 2021 based on a specific triggering event that occurred using the same methodology previously discussed:\n\nPJM Asset Impairments During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  the  results  of  the  PJM  Base  Residual  Auction  for  the 2022/2023 delivery year were released leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of a significant portion of its PJM  coal  generating  assets  in  June  2022.  The  Company  considered  the  decline  in  PJM  capacity  prices  and  the  near-term retirement dates of certain assets to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. Impairment losses of $271 million and $35 million were recorded in the East segment on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.",

Emission  allowances  held-for-sale  are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are not amortized, but rather expensed as sold.  As  of  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  value  of  emission  allowances  held-for-sale  was  $4  million  and  $8  million, respectively, within the Corporate segment.

The full amount of the Initial Incremental Commitment was made available from and after the Revolving Credit Facility Sixth Amendment Effective Date and the full amount of the Incremental Commitment was made available from and after the Revolving Credit Facility Seventh Amendment Effective Date. A portion of the nonextended revolving commitments terminated on July 5, 2023, with the remaining portion thereof terminating on May 28, 2024, unless otherwise extended.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by NRG's existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with customary and agreed-upon exceptions for, among other exceptions, unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries, project subsidiaries, immaterial subsidiaries, captive insurance subsidiaries and securitization vehicles. The Revolving Credit Facility is also secured by a first priority (subject to certain customary permitted liens) perfected security interest in a substantial portion of the property and  assets  owned  by  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  that  are  guarantors  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility,  subject  to  certain exceptions  that  include,  among  other  things,  the  capital  stock  of  certain  specified  subsidiaries,  including  unrestricted subsidiaries and certain excluded subsidiaries, equity interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting equity interests of  certain  foreign  subsidiaries,  equity  interests  the  pledge  of  which  is  prohibited  by  applicable  agreements  binding  on  such subsidiaries and other assets that may be designated by NRG as excluded from the collateral that, when taken together with all other assets so designated since the Revolving Credit Facility Sixth Amendment Effective Date, have an aggregate fair market value  not  exceeding  $750  million.  The  Revolving  Credit  Facility  is  secured  on  a  pari  passu  basis  with  certain  interest  rate, foreign  currency  and  commodity  hedging  obligations  of  NRG,  the  Senior  Secured  First  Lien  Notes  and  certain  other indebtedness. The collateral securing the Revolving Credit Facility will be released at the Company's request if both the senior unsecured  long-term  debt  securities  of  the  Company  and  the  revolving  loans  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility  are  rated investment grade by any two of the three rating agencies and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, subject to reversion if such rating agencies withdraw such investment grade rating or downgrade such rating below investment grade (or, with respect to the revolving loans, crease to publish a rating).\n\nThe  Revolving  Credit  Facility  contains  customary  covenants,  which,  among  other  things,  require  NRG  to  maintain  a maximum  first  lien  leverage  ratio  on  a  consolidated  basis  when  amounts  outstanding  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility (subject to certain exceptions) exceed a certain threshold and limit, subject to certain exceptions, NRG's ability to:\n\n- \u00b7 incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions;\n- \u00b7 make investments, loans and advances;\n- \u00b7 return capital to shareholders;\n- \u00b7 repay material subordinated indebtedness;\n- \u00b7 consummate mergers, consolidations and asset sales;",

The 2033 Senior Secured First Lien Notes are senior secured obligations of NRG and are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The 2033 Senior Secured First Lien Notes are secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, which collateral consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by the Company and the guarantors. The collateral securing the 2033 Senior Secured First Lien Notes will be released at the Company's request if the senior unsecured long-term debt securities of the Company are rated investment grade by any two of the three rating agencies and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, subject to reversion if such rating agencies withdraw such investment grade rating or downgrade such rating below investment grade. Interest is paid semi-annually beginning on September 15, 2023 until the maturity date of March 15, 2033. The proceeds of the 2033 Senior Secured First Lien Notes, along with cash on hand and proceeds from certain other financings, were used to fund the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home.\n\n## Senior Note Redemptions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company redeemed $620 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.875% Senior Notes, due 2032, for $509 million, which included the payment of $7 million of accrued interest, using cash on hand  at  an  average  early  redemption  percentage  of  81%.  In  connection  with  the  redemption,  a  $109  million  gain  on  debt extinguishment was recorded, which included the write-off of previously deferred financing costs and other fees of $9 million.\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  redeemed  approximately  $1.9  billion  in  aggregate  principal amount of its Senior Notes for $1.9 billion using the proceeds of the 2032 Senior Notes and cash on hand, as detailed in the table below. In connection with the redemptions, a $77 million loss on debt extinguishment was recorded, which included the write-off of previously deferred financing costs of $12 million.\n\n| (In millions, except percentages)                                          | Principal Repurchased   | Cash Paid (a)   | Average Early Redemption  Percentage   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 7.250% Senior Notes, due 2026                                              | 1,000                   | 1,056           | 103.625 %                              |\n| 6.625% Senior Notes, due 2027                                              | 855                     | 893             | 103.313 %                              |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 1,855                   | 1,949           |                                        |\n\n## 2048 Convertible Senior Notes\n\nAccounting for Convertible Senior Notes Upon issuance in 2018, the Convertible Senior Notes were separated into liability  and  equity  components  for  accounting  purposes.  The  carrying  amount  of  the  liability  component  was  initially calculated  by  measuring  the  fair  value  of  similar  liabilities  that  do  not  have  an  associated  convertible  feature.  The  carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Senior Notes. This difference represented the debt discount that was amortized to interest expense over seven years, which was determined to be the expected life of the Convertible Senior Notes, using the effective interest rate method. The equity component was recorded in additional paid-in capital and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification.\n\nFollowing the adoption of ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2022, the Company no longer records the conversion feature of its  convertible  senior  notes  in  equity.  Instead,  the  Company  combined  the  previously  separated  equity  component  with  the liability  component,  which  together  is  now  classified  as  debt,  thereby  eliminating  the  subsequent  amortization  of  the  debt discount as interest  expense.  As  a  result  of  the  provisions  of  the  amended  guidance,  the  Company  recorded  a  $100  million decrease to additional paid-in capital, a $57 million decrease to debt discount, a $57 million increase to retained earnings, and a $14 million decrease to long-term deferred tax liabilities.\n\nModification to Convertible Senior Notes -  On  February  22,  2022,  the  Company irrevocably elected to eliminate the right  to  settle  conversions  only  in  shares  of  the  Company's  common  stock,  such  that  any  conversion  after  such  date,  the Company  will  pay  cash  per  $1,000  principal  amount  and  will  settle  in  cash  or  a  combination  of  cash  and  the  Company's common stock for the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount.",

As of December 31, 2022, the Convertible Senior Notes were convertible at a price of $43.46 per common share, which is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 23.0116 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes. The net carrying amounts of the Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $572 million and $570 million, respectively. The Convertible Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2048, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible at  the  option  of  the  holders  under  certain  circumstances.  Prior  to  the  close  of  business  on  the  business  day  immediately preceding December 1, 2024, the Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, including, among others, during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sales price per share of the Company's common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Thereafter during specified periods as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 from December 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before June 1, 2025; and\n- \u00b7 from  December  1,  2047  until  the  close  of  business  on  the  second  scheduled  trading  day  immediately  before  the maturity date\n\nAll  conversions  with  a  conversion  date  that  occurs  within  the  specific  periods  above  will  be  settled  after  such  period pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  indenture.

The  indentures  also  provide  for  customary  events  of  default,  which  include,  among  others: nonpayment  of  principal  or  interest;  breach  of  other  agreements  in  the  indentures;  defaults  in  failure  to  pay  certain  other indebtedness; the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts of money against the Company and its subsidiaries; the failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% or 30% (depending on the series of Senior Notes) in principal amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately. The terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the Company's ability and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to return capital to stockholders, grant liens on assets to lenders and incur additional debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on the Senior Notes until their maturity dates.",

The assets of NRG Receivables  are  not  available  to  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  or  creditors  unless  and  until  distributed  by  NRG Receivables.  Under  the  Receivables  Facility,  certain  indirect  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  sell  their  accounts  receivables  to NRG Receivables, subject to certain terms and conditions. In turn, NRG Receivables grants a security interest in the purchased receivables  to  the  Lenders  as  collateral  for  cash  borrowings  and  issuances  of  letters  of  credit.  Pursuant  to  the  Performance Guaranty, the Company has guaranteed, for the benefit of NRG Receivables and the Lenders, the payment and performance by each indirect subsidiary of its respective obligations under the Receivables Facility.

        "page_content": "Company's consolidated balance sheet and any amounts funded by the Lenders to NRG Receivables will be reflected as shortterm borrowings. Cash flows from the Receivables Facility are reflected as financing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company continues to service the accounts receivables sold in exchange for a servicing fee.\n\nOn June 22, 2023, NRG Receivables amended its existing Receivables Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date to June 21, 2024, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments from $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion (adjusted seasonally) and (iii) add a new originator. On October 6, 2023, the Receivables Facility was further amended to replace the benchmark interest rate of the Receivable Facility's subordinated note from LIBOR to SOFR. The weighted average interest rate related to usage under the Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2023 was 0.841%. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $1.0 billion in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.\n\n## Repurchase Facility\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  entered  into  the  Repurchase  Facility  related  to  the  Receivables  Facility.  Under  the  Repurchase Facility,  the  Company  can  currently  borrow  up  to  $150  million,  collateralized  by  a  subordinated  note  issued  by  NRG Receivables to NRG Retail LLC in favor of the originating entities representing a portion of the balance of receivables sold to NRG Receivables under the Receivables Facility.\n\nIn  addition,  in  connection  with  the  amendments  to  the  Receivables  Facility,  on  June  22,  2023,  the  Company  and  the originators thereunder renewed the existing uncommitted Repurchase Facility. Such renewal, among other things, extended the maturity  date  to  June  21,  2024  and  joined  an  additional  originator  to  the  Repurchase  Facility.  On  October  6,  2023,  the Repurchase Facility was further amended to reflect the concurrent amendment to the Receivables Facility's subordinated note. The Repurchase Facility has no commitment fee and borrowings will be drawn at SOFR + 1.55%. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility.\n\n## Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities\n\nOn May 19, 2023, May 30, 2023 and October 17, 2023 the Company increased the size of its bilateral letter of credit facilities by $25 million, $100 million and $50 million, respectively, to provide additional liquidity and to allow for the issuance of up to $850 million of letters of credit. These facilities are uncommitted. As of December 31, 2023, $671 million was issued under these facilities.\n\n## Tax Exempt Bonds\n\n|                                                                                                   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| (In millions, except rates)                                                                       | 2023                 | 2022                 | Interest Rate % |\n| NRG Indian River Power 2020, tax exempt bonds, due 2040                                           | $  57                | $  57                | 1.250           |\n| NRG Indian River Power 2020, tax exempt bonds, due 2045                                           | 190                  | 190                  | 1.250           |\n| NRG Dunkirk 2020, tax exempt bonds, due 2042    . . . . . . . . . . . .                           | 59                   | 59                   | 4.250           |\n| City of Texas City, tax exempt bonds, due 2045    . . . . . . . . . . . . .                       | 33                   | 33                   | 4.125           |\n| Fort Bend County, tax exempt bonds, due 2038   . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                        | 54                   | 54                   | 4.750           |\n| Fort Bend County, tax exempt bonds, due 2042   . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                        | 73                   | 73                   | 4.750           |\n| Total   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  466               | $  466               |                 |\n\n## Dunkirk Bonds\n\nOn April 3, 2023, NRG remarketed $59 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% tax-exempt refinancing bonds of the Chautauqua County Capital Resource Corporation (the \"Dunkirk Bonds\").

The collateral securing the Dunkirk Bonds will, at the request of NRG, be released if NRG satisfies certain conditions, including receipt of an investment grade rating on its senior, unsecured debt securities from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to reversion if those rating agencies withdraw their investment grade rating of the Dunkirk Bonds or any of NRG's senior, unsecured debt securities or downgrade such ratings below investment grade. The Dunkirk Bonds are subject to mandatory tender and purchase on April 3, 2028 and have a final maturity date of April 1, 2042.",

The  Trust  invested  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  the  P-Caps  in  a portfolio of principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities (the 'Eligible Treasury Assets'). The P-Caps replaced the Company's existing pre-capitalized trust securities  redeemable 2023 issued by Alexander Funding Trust, which matured on November 15, 2023.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  sale  of  the  P-Caps,  the  Company  and  the  guarantors  named  therein  entered  into  a  facility agreement, dated August 29, 2023 (the 'Facility Agreement'), with the Trust and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as notes trustee (the 'Notes Trustee'). Under the Facility Agreement, the Company has the right, from time to time, to issue to the Trust,  and  to  require  the  Trust  to  purchase  from  the  Company,  on  one  or  more  occasions  (the  'Issuance  Right'),  up  to $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.467% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2028 (the 'P-Caps Secured Notes') in exchange for all or a portion of the Eligible Treasury Assets corresponding to the portion of the Issuance Right  under  the  Facility  Agreement  being  exercised  at  such  time.  The  Company  pays  to  the  Trust  a  facility  fee  equal  to 3.13427% applied to the unexercised portion of the Issuance Right on a semi-annual basis.\n\nThe P-Caps are to be redeemed by the Trust on July 31, 2028 or earlier upon an early redemption of the P-Caps Secured Notes. Following any distribution of P-Caps Secured Notes to the holders of the P-Caps, the Company may similarly redeem such P-Caps Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption price described in the P-Caps Indenture (as defined below), plus accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Any P-Caps Secured Notes outstanding and held by the Trust as a result of the exercise of the Issuance Right that remain outstanding will also mature on July 31, 2028.\n\nThe Issuance Right will be exercised automatically in full if (i) the Company fails to pay the facility fee when due or any amount due and owing under the trust expense reimbursement agreement or fails to purchase and pay for any Eligible Treasury Assets  that  are  due  and  not  paid  on  their  payment  date  and  such  failure  is  not  cured  within  30  days  or  (ii)  upon  certain bankruptcy  events  of  the  Company.  The  Company  will  be  required  to  mandatorily  exercise  the  Issuance  Right  if  certain mandatory exercise events occur upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Facility Agreement.\n\nThe P-Caps Secured Notes that may be sold to the Trust from time to time will be governed by the base indenture, dated August 29, 2023 (the 'Base Indenture'), between the Company and the Notes Trustee, as supplemented by the supplemental indenture,  dated  August  29,  2023  (the  'Supplemental  Indenture'  and,  together  with  the  Base  Indenture,  the  'P-Caps Indenture'), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and the Notes Trustee.\n\nThe P-Caps Secured Notes will, if sold to the Trust, be guaranteed on a first-priority basis by each of the Company's subsidiaries  that  guarantee  indebtedness  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility.  The  P-Caps  Secured  Notes  will,  if  sold  to  the Trust, be secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by the Company and the guarantors. The collateral securing the P-Caps Secured Notes will be released at the Company's request if the senior unsecured long-term  debt  securities  of  the  Company  are  rated  investment  grade  by  any  two  of  the  three  rating  agencies,  subject  to reversion if such rating agencies downgrade such rating below investment grade or withdraw such investment grade rating.\n\nIn connection with the issuance of the P-Caps, on August 29, 2023, the Company entered into a letter of credit facility agreement (the 'LC Agreement') with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent (the 'Collateral Agent') and administrative agent, and certain financial institutions (the 'LC Issuers') for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $485 million. The LC Agreement replaced the Company's existing letter of credit facility agreement, effective August 29, 2023. In addition, on August 29, 2023, the Trust entered into a pledge and control agreement (the 'Pledge Agreement'), among the Company, the Trust and the Collateral Agent, under which the Company and the Trust agreed to grant a security interest over the Eligible Treasury Assets in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the LC Issuers. Pursuant to the LC Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent is entitled to withdraw Eligible Treasury Assets in the amount  of  any  drawn  letters  of  credit  issued  pursuant  to  the  LC  Agreement  from  the  Company's  and  the  Trust's  pledged accounts, following notice to the Company, in the event the Company has failed to reimburse such drawn amounts and the LC Issuers  have  the  right  to  instruct  the  Collateral  Agent  to  enforce  the  pledge  over  the  Eligible  Treasury  Assets  upon  the occurrence of any event of default under the LC Agreement.\n\n## Non-recourse Debt\n\nThe following are descriptions of certain indebtedness of NRG's subsidiaries. All of NRG's non-recourse debt is secured by the assets in the subsidiaries as further described below.",

In addition, the Company has also identified conditional AROs for asbestos removal and disposal, which are specific to certain power generation operations.\n\nFollowing the sale of the Company's 44% equity interest in STP on November 1, 2023, the Company no longer has asset retirement obligations related to nuclear decommissioning. Prior to the sale, accretion for the nuclear decommissioning ARO and  amortization  of  the  related  ARO  asset  were  recorded  to  the  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Trust  Liability  and  were  not included in net income, consistent with regulatory treatment per ASC 980, Regulated Operations .",

NRG pension benefits are available to eligible non-union and union employees through various defined benefit pension plans. These benefits are based on pay, service history and age at retirement. Most pension benefits are provided through tax-qualified plans. NRG also provides postretirement health  and  welfare  benefits  for  certain  groups  of  employees.  Cost  sharing  provisions  vary  by  the  terms  of  any  applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nNRG maintains three separate qualified pension plans, the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees, the NRG Pension Plan and the Pension Plan for Employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (\"DEML\"). Participation in the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees depends upon whether an employee is covered by a bargaining agreement. The NRG Pension plan was frozen for non-union employees on December 31, 2018. The Pension Plan for Employees of DEML is closed to new participants.\n\nNRG expects  to  contribute  $43  million  to  the  Company's  pension  plans  in  2024,  of  which  $23  million  relates  to  the GenOn plan.\n\n## NRG Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe annual net periodic benefit cost/(credit) related to NRG's pension and other postretirement benefit plans include the following components:\n\n|                                                                                                      | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                        | 2023                                       | 2022                                       | 2021                                       |\n| Service cost benefits earned   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  5                                       | $  7                                       | $  9                                       |\n| Interest cost on benefit obligation    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 50                                         | 41                                         | 27                                         |\n| Expected return on plan assets   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | (39)                                       | (47)                                       | (66)                                       |\n| Amortization of unrecognized net loss  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 6                                          | 3                                          | 1                                          |\n| Curtailment and special termination benefits (income)/expense                                        | (1)                                        | 14                                         | 2                                          |\n| Net periodic benefit cost/(credit)   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  21                                      | $  18                                      | $  (27)                                    |\n\n|                                                                                                         | Year Ended December 31, Other Postretirement Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Other Postretirement Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Other Postretirement Benefits   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                           | 2023                                                    | 2022                                                    | 2021                                                    |\n| Interest cost on benefit obligation    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | $  4                                                    | $  2                                                    | $  2                                                    |\n| Amortization of unrecognized prior service cost                                                         | (8)                                                     | (8)                                                     | (10)                                                    |\n| Amortization of unrecognized net loss  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | 1                                                       | 2                                                       | 1                                                       |\n| Curtailment expense   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -                                                       | -                                                       | 1                                                       |\n| Net periodic benefit credit   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  (3)  $                                               | (4)  $                                                  | (6)                                                     |",

The fair value of the common/collective trust investments is valued at fair value which is equal to the sum of the market value of all of the fund's underlying investments. Certain common/collective trust investments have readily determinable fair value as they publish daily net asset value, or NAV, per share and are categorized as Level 2. Certain other common/collective trust investments and partnerships/joint ventures use NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient for valuation, and thus have been removed from the fair value hierarchy table.\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit obligations:\n\n|                                                                                 | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average Assumptions                                                    | 2023                 | 2022                 | 2023                          | 2022                          |\n| Discount rate   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 4.97 %               | 5.18 %               | 4.96 %                        | 5.19 %                        |\n| Interest crediting rate  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 5.67 %               | 5.21 %               | 4.66 %                        | 4.00 %                        |\n| Rate of compensation increase                                                   | 3.06 %               | 3.06 %               | -                             | -                             |\n| Health care trend rate    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | -                    | -                    | 7.7% grading  to 4.5% in 2033 | 7% grading to  4.4% in 2031   |\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit expense:\n\n|                                                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average  Assumptions                       | 2023                 | 2022                 | 2021                 | 2023                          | 2022                          | 2021                          |\n| Discount rate   . . . . . . .                       | 5.18 %               | 2.89%/4.71%/5.41%    | 2.55 %               | 5.19 %                        | 2.82 %                        | 2.81 %                        |\n| Interest crediting rate  .                          | 5.21 %               | 3.07 %               | 3.13 %               | 4.00 %                        | 1.94 %                        | 1.62 %                        |\n| Expected return on  plan assets   . . . . . . .     | 5.55 %               | 4.99 %               | 5.62 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Rate of compensation  increase    . . . . . . . . . | 3.06 %               | 3.06 %               | 3.06 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Health care trend rate                              | -                    | -                    | -                    | 7.2% grading  to 4.5% in 2028 | 6.9% grading  to 4.4% in 2028 | 7.0% grading to  4.4% in 2028 |",

        "page_content": "NRG  uses  December  31  of  each  respective  year  as  the  measurement  date  for  the  Company's  pension  and  other postretirement benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG's defined benefit retirement plans as of December 31. The discount rate assumptions represent the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at December 31. The Company utilizes the Aon AA Above Median, or AA-AM, yield curve and the AON Canada yield curve to select the appropriate discount rate assumption for its retirement plans. The AA-AM yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 6 months to 99 years. Under the AA-AM yield curve, each bond issue used to build this yield curve must be non-callable, and have an average rating  of  AA  when  averaging  available  Moody's  Investor  Services,  Standard  &  Poor's  and  Fitch  ratings.  The  AON Canada yield curve is based on high quality corporate bonds. Under the AON Canada yield curve, expected plan cash flows were discounted using the yield curve, and then a single rate is determined which produces an equivalent present value.\n\nNRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize  the  long-term  return  of  plan  assets  for  a  prudent  level  of  risk.  Risk  tolerance  is  established  through  careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The Investment Committee reviews the asset  mix  periodically  and  as  the  plan  assets  increase  in  future  years,  the  Investment  Committee  may  examine  other  asset classes such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building block approach to determining the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.\n\nThe target allocations of NRG's pension plan assets were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\n| U.S. equity   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 19 %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Non-U.S. equity                                                                                                                                                                 | 12 %   |\n| Non-core assets    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 17 %   |\n| Fixed Income   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 52 %   |\n\nPlan  assets  are  currently  invested  in  a  diversified  blend  of  equity  and  fixed-income  investments.  Furthermore,  equity investments are diversified across U.S., non-U.S., global, and emerging market equities, as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization stocks.\n\nInvestment risk and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly portfolio reviews of each asset fund class to a related performance benchmark, if applicable, and annual pension liability measurements.

Although NRG did not sponsor the STP plan, it reimbursed STPNOC for 44% of the contributions made towards its retirement plan obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, NRG reimbursed STPNOC $3 million and $18 million, respectively, for its contribution to the plans. On November 1, 2023, the Company closed on the sale of its 44% equity interest in STP. Following the sale, the Company is no longer responsible for further reimbursements to the STP pension plan.\n\nThe Company recognized the following in its statement of financial position, statement of operations and accumulated OCI related to its former 44% interest in STP:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | As of December 31,    | As of December 31,                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Pension Benefits 2022 | Other  Postretirement  Benefits 2022 |\n| Funded status - STPNOC benefit plans    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                           | $  (7)  $             | (13)                                 |\n| Net periodic benefit cost/(credit)    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                 | 2                     | (4)                                  |\n| Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive  income  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (27)                  | 1                                    |\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nNRG's employees are also eligible to participate in defined contribution 401(k) plans.\n\nThe Company's costs related to these plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                | Year Ended December 31,   |   Year Ended December 31, |   Year Ended December 31, |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                  | 2023                      |                      2022 |                      2021 |\n| Cost recognized for defined contribution plans | $  61                     |                        37 |                        35 |\n\nThe Company's costs, which are primarily related to employer matching of a portion of employee contributions to defined contribution  plans,  increased  during  2023  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  retirement  saving  plan  match  and  the  Vivint acquisition.",

On June 22, 2023, following the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, NRG revised its long-term capital allocation policy to target allocating approximately 80% of cash available for allocation, after debt reduction, to be returned to shareholders. As part of the revised capital allocation framework, the Company announced an increase to its share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion, to be executed through 2025.\n\nOn  November  6,  2023,  the  Company  executed  Accelerated  Share  Repurchase  agreements  to  repurchase  a  total  of $950 million of NRG's outstanding common stock. Under the ASR agreements, the Company paid a total of $950 million and will receive shares of NRG's common stock on specified settlement dates. The total number of shares purchased pursuant to the ASR agreements will generally be based on the volume-weighted average prices of NRG's common stock during the term of each  ASR  agreement,  less  a  discount.  The  Company  received  initial  shares  of  4,494,224  on  November  8,  2023  and  an additional 13,181,918 shares on December 27, 2023, which were recorded in treasury stock at fair value based on the volumeweighted  average  closing  prices  of  $833  million,  with  the  remaining  $117  million  recorded  in  additional  paid  in  capital, representing the value of the forward contracts to purchase additional shares.

        "page_content": "## Note 18 (Loss)/Income Per Share\n\nBasic (loss)/income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss)/income less cumulative dividends attributable to preferred stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding. Diluted (loss)/income per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic (loss)/income per share, while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.\n\nDilutive effect for equity compensation and other equity instruments - The relative performance stock units, non-vested restricted  stock  units,  market  stock  units  and  non-qualified  stock  options  are  not  considered  outstanding  for  purposes  of computing  basic  (loss)/income  per  share.  However,  these  instruments  are  included  in  the  denominator  for  purposes  of computing  diluted  (loss)/income  per  share  under  the  treasury  stock  method  for  periods  when  there  is  net  income.  The Convertible  Senior  Notes  are  convertible,  under  certain  circumstances,  into  cash  or  combination  of  cash  and  Company's common stock. Prior to adoption of ASU 2020-06, there was no dilutive effect for the Convertible Senior Notes due to the Company's expectation to settle the liability in cash. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, on January 1, 2022, the Company is including the potential share settlements, if any, in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted (loss)/income per share under  the  if  converted  method  for  periods  when  there  is  net  income.  The  potential  shares  settlements  are  calculated  as  the excess of the Company's conversion obligation over the aggregate principal amount (which will be settled in cash), divided by the average share price for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there was no dilutive effect for the Convertible Senior Note since there was a net loss. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there was no dilutive effect for the Convertible Senior Notes since there were no potential share settlements for the period.\n\nThe reconciliation of NRG's basic and diluted (loss)/income per share is shown in the following table:\n\n|                                                                                                                        | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions, except per share amounts)                                                                                | 2023                      | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Basic and diluted (loss)/income per share:                                                                             |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net (loss)/income    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  (202)  $               | 1,221                     | $  2,187                  |\n| Less: Cumulative dividends attributable to Series A Preferred Stock    . . . . . . . . .                               | 54                        | -                         | -                         |\n| (Loss)/Income Available to Common Stockholders   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                         | $  (256)  $               | 1,221                     | $  2,187                  |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic and diluted                                               | 228                       | 236                       | 245                       |\n| (Loss)/Income per weighted average common share - basic and diluted  . . . .                                           | $  (1.12)  $              | 5.17                      | $  8.93                   |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 6 million of outstanding equity instruments that are anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of the Company's diluted loss per share.

        "page_content": "## Deferred tax assets and valuation allowance\n\nNet  deferred  tax  balance -  As  of December  31,  2023  and  2022,  NRG  recorded  a  net  deferred  tax  asset,  excluding valuation allowance, of $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The Company believes certain state net operating losses may not  be  realizable  under  the  more-likely-than-not  measurement  and  as  such,  a  valuation  allowance  was  recorded  as  of December 31, 2023 as discussed below.\n\nNOL carryforwards -  As  of December 31, 2023, the Company had tax-effected cumulative U.S. NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $1.8 billion and $367 million, respectively. In addition, NRG has tax-effected  cumulative  foreign  NOL  carryforwards  of  $110  million.  The  majority  of  NRG's  NOL  carryforwards  have  no expiration date.\n\nValuation allowance -  As of December 31, 2023, the Company's tax-effected valuation allowance was $275 million, consisting of state NOL carryforwards and foreign NOL carryforwards. The valuation allowance was recorded based on the assessment  of  cumulative  and  forecasted  pre-tax  book  earnings  and  the  future  reversal  of  existing  taxable  temporary differences.\n\n## Taxes Receivable and Payable\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  NRG  recorded  a  current  federal  payable  of  $20  million,  a  current  net  state  payable  of $3 million and a current net foreign receivable of $7 million.\n\n## Uncertain tax benefits\n\nNRG has identified uncertain tax benefits with after-tax value of $73 million and $22 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, for which NRG has recorded a non-current tax liability of $76 million and $24 million, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company recognized $1 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, $1 million for the year ended 2022 and an immaterial amount for the year ended 2021. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, NRG had cumulative interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax benefits of $3 million and $2 million, respectively.\n\nTax jurisdictions - NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Australia and Canada.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2020. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2015.\n\nThe following table summarizes uncertain tax benefits activity:\n\n|                                                                                                                                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                       | 2023                 | 2022                 |\n| Balance as of January 1   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  22                | $  13                |\n| Increase due to current year positions   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 28                   | 9                    |\n| Increase due to acquired balance from Vivint Smart Home                                                                             | 23                   | -                    |\n| Uncertain tax benefits as of December 31  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | $  73                | $  22                |\n\n## Note 21 Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company's stock-based compensation consists of awards granted under the NRG LTIP and following the Acquisition in March 2023, the Vivint LTIP.\n\n## NRG Energy, Inc.

Fair value of the DSUs, which is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant, is recorded as compensation expense in the period of grant.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's outstanding DSU awards and changes during the year:\n\n|                                                                                                                                   | Units    | Weighted Average Grant  Date Fair Value per Unit   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | 418,014  | $  27.63                                           |\n| Granted   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 79,072   | 34.40                                              |\n| Converted to Common Stock   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | (53,799) | 25.11                                              |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2023                                                                                                  | 443,287  | 29.07                                              |\n\nThe  aggregate  intrinsic  values  for  DSUs  outstanding  as  of  December  31,  2023,  2022  and  2021  were  approximately $23 million, $13 million and $17 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs converted to common stock for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $3 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of DSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $34.40, $45.49 and $32.27, respectively.\n\n## Relative Performance Stock Units\n\nRPSUs entitle the recipient to stock upon vesting. The amount of the award is subject to the Company's achievement of certain performance measures over the vesting period. RPSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\"), relative to the TSR of the Company's current proxy peer group and the total returns of select indexes, or Peer Group. For RPSU's granted in 2022 and forward, the peer group consists of the  companies  that  comprise  the  Standard  &  Poor's  500  Index  on  the  first  day  of  the  performance  period.  Each  RPSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of NRG common stock to be paid (if any) as of the vesting date for each RPSU will depend on the Company's percentile rank within the Peer Group. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as  of  the  vesting  date  for  each  RPSU  is  linearly  interpolated  for  TSR  performance  between  the  following  points:  (i)  0%  if ranked below the 25th percentile; (ii) 25% if ranked at the 25th percentile; (iii) 100% if ranked at the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if the Company's absolute TSR is less than negative 15%); and (iv) 200% if ranked at the 75th percentile or above.",

Long-Term Incentive Plan, or Vivint LTIP. In addition to the rollover awards converted as part of the Acquisition, the Vivint LTIP provides for issuances of time-based restricted stock units and  performance-based  restricted  stock  units.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  17,500,000  shares  of  NRG  common  stock  were authorized for issuance under the Vivint LTIP, and there were 12,749,736 shares of common stock remaining available for grants.\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, RSUs under the Vivint LTIP include RSUs which were granted prior to the Acquisition and were converted into awards that will vest as NRG common stock (\"Rollover RSUs\"). These awards typically had four-year graded vesting schedules beginning on the grant date. The fair value of the Rollover RSUs is based on the fair value of NRG common stock on the Acquisition date after applying the conversion ratio as per the Merger Agreement. The RSUs that were granted following the Acquisition date are typically subject to the same terms as the RSUs under the NRG LTIP.\n\nThe following table summarizes the non-vested RSUs under the Vivint LTIP and changes during the year:\n\n|                                                                         | Rollover RSUs   | Rollover RSUs                                    | RSUs granted following the Acquisition   | RSUs granted following the Acquisition           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                         | Units           | Weighted Average Grant  Date Fair Value per Unit | Units                                    | Weighted Average Grant  Date Fair Value per Unit |\n| Non-vested at December 31, 2022   . . . . . . . . . . .                 | -               | $  -                                             | -                                        | $  -                                             |\n| Rollover RSUs at the Acquisition date   . . . . . .                     | 4,553,998       | 31.63                                            | -                                        | -                                                |\n| Granted following the Acquisition date  . . . . . .                     | -               | -                                                | 895,827                                  | 35.24                                            |\n| Forfeited  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | (288,776)       | 31.63                                            | (110,531)                                | 35.21                                            |\n| Vested    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (1,280,321)     | 31.63                                            | (4,998)                                  | 35.21                                            |\n| Non-vested at December 31, 2023  . . . . . . . . . .                    | 2,984,901       | 31.63                                            | 780,298                                  | 35.24                                            |\n\nThe total fair value of RSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $66 million.",

        "page_content": "## Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Commitments\n\nNRG has entered  into  long-term  contractual  arrangements  related  to  energy  products,  including  power  purchases,  gas transportation and storage, and fuel and transportation services. These contracts are not included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's minimum commitments under such outstanding agreements are estimated as follows:\n\n| Period                                                                                                                                                                              | (In millions)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 2024  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | $  573          |\n| 2025  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 836             |\n| 2026  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 540             |\n| 2027  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 364             |\n| 2028  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 292             |\n| Thereafter                                                                                                                                                                          | 823             |\n| Total (a)         . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  3,428        |\n\nThe  Company's  actual  costs  may  be  significantly  higher  than  these  estimated  minimum  unconditional  long-term  firm commitments with remaining term in excess of one year. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the costs of fuel and purchased energy were $13.4 billion, $19.6 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively.\n\n## First Lien Structure\n\nNRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors of its senior debt. NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedges. To the extent  that  the  underlying  hedge  positions  for  a  counterparty  are  out-of-the-money  to  NRG,  the  counterparty  would  have  a claim  under  the  first  lien  program.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  all  hedges  under  the  first  liens  were  in-the-money  on  a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe Company's material legal proceedings are described below. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously. NRG records accruals for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. As  applicable,  the  Company  has  established  an  adequate  accrual  for  the  applicable  legal  matters,  including  regulatory  and environmental matters as further discussed in Note 24, Regulatory Matters , and Note 25, Environmental Matters . In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred. Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success. Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings  or  reasonably  estimate  the  scope  or  amount  of  any  associated  costs  and  potential  liabilities.  As  additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded accruals and that such difference could be material.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  proceedings  noted  below,  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  other  litigation  or  legal proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  management's  opinion,  the  disposition  of  these  ordinary  course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## Environmental Lawsuits\n\nSierra club et al. v. Midwest Generation LLC - In 2012, several environmental groups filed a complaint against Midwest Generation  with  the  Illinois  Pollution  Control  Board  (\"IPCB\")  alleging  violations  of  environmental  law  resulting  in groundwater  contamination.  In  June  2019,  the  IPCB  found  in  an  interim  order  that  Midwest  Generation  violated  the  law because it had improperly handled coal ash at four facilities in Illinois and caused or allowed coal ash constituents to impact groundwater.  On  September  9,  2019,  Midwest  Generation  filed  a  Motion  to  Reconsider  numerous  issues,  which  the  court granted in part and denied in part on February 6, 2020. In 2023, the IPCB held hearings to determine the appropriate relief. Midwest Generation has been working with the Illinois EPA to address the groundwater issues since 2010.",

        "page_content": "## Consumer Lawsuits\n\nSimilar  to  other  energy  service  companies  operating  in  the  industry,  from  time-to-time,  the  Company  and/or  its subsidiaries may be subject to consumer lawsuits in various jurisdictions where they sell natural gas and electricity.\n\nVariable  Price  Cases  In  the  cases  set  forth  below,  referred  to  as  the  Variable  Price  Cases,  such  actions  involve consumers alleging that one of the Company's ESCOs promised that consumers would pay the same or less than they would have paid if they stayed with their default utility or previous energy supplier. The underlying claims of each case are similar and the  Company  continues  to  deny  the  allegations  and  is  vigorously  defending  these  matters.  These  matters  were  known  and accrued for at the time of each acquisition.\n\n## XOOM Energy\n\nMirkin v. XOOM Energy (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 2019) is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit pending in New York. The Court denied XOOM's motion for summary judgment and granted class certification. The Second Circuit denied XOOM's request to appeal the class certification grants. XOOM plans to challenge Mirkin's expert testimony to further hamper Mirkin's ability to support its case.\n\n## Direct Energy\n\nThere was one putative class action pending against Direct Energy: Richard Schafer v. Direct Energy (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 2019; on appeal 2nd Cir. N.Y.) - The Second Circuit sent the matter back to the trial court in December 2021. After discovery, Direct  Energy  filed  summary  judgment.  Direct  Energy  won  summary  judgment  and  Schafer  appealed.  The  appeal  is  fully briefed. Oral argument occurred on October 25, 2023. The Second Circuit upheld the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Direct Energy.\n\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") Cases - In the cases set forth below, referred to as the TCPA Cases, such actions involve consumers alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended, by receiving calls,  texts  or  voicemails  without  consent  in  violation  of  the  federal  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule,  and/or  state  counterpart legislation.  The  underlying  claims  of  each  case  are  similar.  The  Company  denies  the  allegations  asserted  by  plaintiffs  and intends to vigorously defend these matters. These matters were known and accrued for at the time of the acquisition.\n\nThere are two putative class actions pending against Direct Energy: (1) Holly Newman v. Direct Energy, LP (D. Md Sept 2021) - Direct Energy filed its Motion to Dismiss asserting the ruling in the Brittany Burk v. Direct Energy (S.D. Tex. Feb 2019) preempts the Plaintiff's ability to file suit based on the same facts. The Court denied Direct Energy's motion stating the Court does not have the benefit of all of the facts that were in front of the Burk court to issue a similar ruling. On October 19, 2022, Direct Energy filed a Motion to Transfer Venue asking the Court to transfer the case to the Southern District where the Burk case was filed. On April 12, 2023, the Court granted Direct Energy's Motion to Transfer Venue, moving to the case to the Southern District of Texas; and (2) Matthew Dickson v. Direct Energy (N.D. Ohio Jan. 2018) - The case was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal to the Sixth Circuit based on the unconstitutionality of the TCPA during the period from 2015-2020. The Sixth Circuit found the TCPA was in effect during that period and remanded the case back to the trial court. Direct Energy refiled its motions along with supplements. On March 25, 2022, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Direct Energy and dismissed the case.  Dickson  appealed.  The  Sixth  Circuit  found  that  Dickson  has  standing  and  reversed  the  trial  court's dismissal of the case. The matter is back at the trial court. The parties will conduct further fact discovery and expert discovery and are likely to resubmit motions for further review by the Court.\n\n## Sales Practice Lawsuits\n\nThere are three litigation matters relating to claims made by Vivint Smart Home competitors against Vivint Smart Home alleging, among other things, that Vivint Smart Home's sales representatives used deceptive sales practices. These matters were known and accrued for at the time of the acquisition. The three matters are: (1) CPI Security Systems, Inc. (\"CPI\") v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc. (W.D.N.C. Sept. 2020). The CPI matter that was filed in 2020 went to trial, and in February 2023, the jury issued  a  verdict  against  Vivint  Smart  Home,  in  favor  of  CPI  for  $50  million  of  compensatory  damages  and  an  additional $140 million of punitive damages. Vivint Smart Home has filed its notice of appeal and is awaiting a briefing schedule. While Vivint  Smart  Home believes the CPI jury verdict is  not  legally  or  factually  supported  and  intends  to  pursue  post  judgment remedies  and  file  an  appeal,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  defense  efforts  will  be  successful;  (2)  ADT  LLC,  et  al. (\"ADT\") v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc. f/k/a Mosaic Acquisition Corporation, et al.(S.D.Fl. Aug. 2020). The parties mediated in May 2023 and agreed on a settlement. In June 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlement, which was paid in June 2023; and (3) Alert 360 Opco, Inc, et al. (\"Alert 360\") v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc., et al (N.D.Ok. March 2023). On March 1, 2023,  Alert  360  filed  a  complaint  against  Vivint  Smart  Home  alleging,  among  other  things,  deceptive  sales  practices.  The parties settled the dispute in October 2023 and the case was dismissed.",

        "page_content": "## Patent Infringement Lawsuits\n\nSB IP Holdings LLC ('Skybell') v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc. - O n October 23, 2023, a jury in the U.S. District Court, Eastern  District  of  Texas,  Sherman  Division,  issued  a  verdict  against  the  Company  in  favor  of  Skybell  for  $45  million  in damages for patent infringement. The patents that were the basis for the claims made by Skybell were ruled invalid by the U.S. International Trade Commission in November 2021. In accordance with advice by legal counsel, the Company does not believe the  verdict  is  legally  supported  and  will  pursue  post-judgment  and  appellate  remedies  along  with  any  other  legal  options available.\n\n## Contract Disputes\n\nAlarm.com In September 2022, Vivint Smart Home sent Alarm.com a notice asserting that it was no longer obligated to pay certain license fees under the Patent Cross License Agreement between the parties on the basis that Vivint Smart Home no longer  practices  any  claim  under  any  valid  Alarm.com  patent  and,  therefore,  no  license  fees  are  due.  Alarm.com  filed  an arbitration demand against Vivint Smart Home alleging, among other things, breach of the agreement due to continued use of the patents in question. The parties have resolved all outstanding litigation and entered into a long-term intellectual property licensing agreement.\n\nSTP In July 2023, the partners in STP, CPS and Austin Energy, initiated a lawsuit and filed to intervene in the license transfer application with the NRC, claiming a right of first refusal exists in relation to the proposed sale of NRG South Texas' 44% interest in STP to Constellation. NRG believes the claims set forth by CPS and Austin Energy in the lawsuit and the NRC proceedings are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. For further discussion of the transaction, see Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri Lawsuits\n\nThe Company has been named in certain property damage and wrongful death claims that have been filed in connection with  Winter  Storm  Uri  in  its  capacity  as  a  generator  and  a  REP.  Most  of  the  lawsuits  related  to  Winter  Storm  Uri  are consolidated into a single multi-district litigation matter in Harris County District Court. NRG's REPs have since been severed from the multi-district litigation and will be seeking dismissal in any remaining cases. As a power generator, the Company is named in various cases with claims ranging from: wrongful death; personal injury only; property damage and personal injury; property  damage  only;  and  subrogation.  The  First  Court  of  Appeals  conditionally  granted  the  generators'  mundamus  relief, ordering the trial court to grant the generator defendents' Motions to Dismiss. The Company expected the Plaintiffs to challenge this ruling. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters.\n\n## Indemnifications and Other Contractual Arrangements\n\nWashington-St. Tammany and Claiborne Electric Cooperative v. LaGen On June 28, 2017, plaintiffs Washington-St. Tammany Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Claiborne Electric Cooperative, Inc. filed a lawsuit against LaGen in the United States District  Court  for  the  Middle  District  of  Louisiana.  The  plaintiffs  claimed  breach  of  contract  against  LaGen  for  allegedly improperly charging the plaintiffs for costs related to the installation and maintenance of certain pollution control technology. Plaintiffs  sought  damages  for  the  alleged  improper  charges  and  a  declaration  as  to  which  charges  were  proper  under  the contract. On February 4, 2019, NRG sold the South Central Portfolio, including the entities subject to this litigation. However, NRG has agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain losses suffered in connection with this litigation. In February 2020, the federal court dismissed this lawsuit without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On March 17, 2020, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge in Louisiana alleging substantially the same matters, which was dismissed on October 2, 2023 pursuant to a settlement agreement.\n\n## Note 24 Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to regulation by various federal, state and provincial agencies. As such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at the federal, state and provincial levels and in the regions in which NRG operates.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  regulatory  proceedings  noted  below,  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  parties  to  other  regulatory proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  or  have  other  regulatory  exposure.  In  management's  opinion,  the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nCalifornia  Station  Power  As  the  result  of  unfavorable  final  and  non-appealable  litigation,  the  Company  accrued  a liability associated with consumption of station power at the Company's Encina power plant facility in California after August 30, 2010. The Company has established an appropriate accrual pending potential regulatory action by San Diego Gas & Electric regarding the Company's Encina facility.",

        "page_content": "Federal Trade Commission Investigation - In 2019, Vivint Smart Home received a civil investigative demand from the staff of the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') concerning potential violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the 'Red Flags  Rule'  thereunder,  and  the  FTC  Act.  In  April  2021,  Vivint  Smart  Home  entered  into  a  settlement  with  the  FTC  that resolved this investigation. As part of this settlement, which was approved by a federal court on May 3, 2021, Vivint Smart Home paid $20 million and agreed to implement various additional  compliance  related  measures  (\"Stipulated  Order\").  The Company is currently in the process of administering the terms of the Stipulated Order, which includes multiple undertakings by  the  Company.  The  Company  is  engaged  in  ongoing  discussions  with  the  staff  of  the  FTC  regarding  the  Company's compliance with the terms of the Stipulated Order. Under the terms of the Stipulated Order, Vivint Smart Home is required to undertake biennial assessments by an independent third-party assessor (the \"Assessor\"), which reviews Vivint Smart Home's compliance program and provides a report on Vivint Smart Home's ongoing compliance with the Stipulated Order. Since its inception until December 31, 2023, Vivint Smart Home has completed its initial assessment and its first biennial assessment as required  by  the  Stipulated  Order.  In  addition,  Vivint  Smart  Home  has  voluntarily  undertaken  six  quarterly  audits  by  the appointed Assessor. In all the assessments, Vivint Smart Home received a report from the Assessor with no findings of noncompliance of any kind.\n\nNew York State Public Service Commission (\"NYSPSC\") - Notice of Apparent Violation - The NYSPSC issued an order referred to as the Retail Reset Order in December 2019 that limited ESCO's offers for electric and natural gas to three compliant products: guaranteed savings from the utility default rate, a fixed term capped at 5% of the rolling 12-month average utility default rate, or NY-sourced renewable energy that is at least 50% greater than the prevailing NY Renewable Energy Standard for load serving entities. The order effectively limited ESCO offers to natural gas customers to only the guaranteed savings and capped fixed term compliant products because no equivalent renewable energy product exists for natural gas. NRG took action to comply with the order when it became effective April 16, 2021. On January 8, 2024, the NYSPSC notified eight of NRG's retail  energy  suppliers  (serving  both  electricity  and  natural  gas)  of  alleged  non-compliance  with  New  York  regulatory requirements. Among other items, the notices allege that the NRG suppliers did not transition existing residential customers to one of the three compliant products authorized by the NYSPSC following the effective date of the order. NRG responded to the notices in February 2024. The outcome of this process has the potential to negatively impact the retail business in New York.\n\n## Note 25 Environmental Matters\n\nNRG is subject  to  a  wide  range  of  environmental  laws  in  the  development,  construction,  ownership  and  operation  of power  plants.  These  laws  generally  require  that  governmental  permits  and  approvals  be  obtained  before  construction  and maintained  during  operation  of  power  plants.  The  electric  generation  industry  has  been  facing  increasingly  stringent requirements  regarding  air  quality,  GHG  emissions,  combustion  byproducts,  water  discharge  and  use,  and  threatened  and endangered species. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose additional restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  or  cash  flows.  The  Company  has  elected  to  use  a $1 million disclosure threshold, as permitted, for environmental proceedings to which the government is a party.\n\n## Air\n\nCPP/ACE Rules - In 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions from the power sector. The ACE rule required states that have coal-fired EGUs to develop plans to seek heat rate improvements from coal-fired EGUs. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \"generation shifting\" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. On May 23, 2023, the EPA proposed significantly revising the manner in which new and existing EGU's GHG emissions should be regulated including using hydrogen as a fuel, capturing and storing/sequestering CO 2 and requiring new units to be more efficient. The EPA has stated that it intends to finalize these revisions in 2024. The Company expects that the final rule will be challenged in the courts and accordingly uncertain over the next several years.\n\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule (\"CSAPR\") - On March 15, 2023, the EPA signed and released a prepublication of a final rule that sought to significantly revise the CSAPR to address the good-neighbor obligations of the 2015 ozone NAAQS for 23 states after earlier having disapproved numerous state plans to address the issue. Several states, including Texas, challenged the EPA's disapproval of their state plans. On May 1, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the EPA's disapproval of Texas' and Louisiana's state plans, which disapprovals are a condition precedent to the EPA imposing its plan on Texas and Louisiana. Several other states are also similarly situated because of similar stays. Nonetheless, on June 5, 2023, the EPA published this rule in the Federal Register. On July 31, 2023, the EPA promulgated an interim final rule that addresses  the  various  judicial  orders  that  have  stayed  several  State-Implementation-Plan  disapprovals  by  limiting  the effectiveness of certain requirements of the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023 in Texas and five other states. The final rule decreases, over time, the ozone-season NOx allowances allocated to generators in the states not affected by the judicial stays",

        "page_content": "beginning in 2023 by assuming that participants in this cap-and-trade program had or would optimize existing NOx controls and later install additional NOx controls. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal challenges to the: (i) various state disapprovals; (ii) the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023; and (iii) the interim final rule promulgated on July 31, 2023 that seeks to address the judicial orders.\n\nRegional Haze Proposal -  On  May  2023,  the  EPA  proposed  to  withdraw  the  existing  Texas  Sulfur  Dioxide  Trading Program  and  replace  it  with  unit-specific  SO 2 limits  for  12  units  in  Texas  to  address  requirements  to  improve  visibility  at National Parks and Wilderness areas. If finalized as proposed, the rule would result in more stringent SO 2 limits for two of the Company's coal-fired units in Texas. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this proposal.\n\n## Water\n\nEffluent  Limitations  Guidelines -  In  2015,  the  EPA  revised  the  ELG  for  Steam  Electric  Generating  Facilities,  which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash,  and  flue  gas  mercury  control.  On  September  18,  2017,  the  EPA  promulgated  a  final  rule  that,  among  other  things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. In October 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls  by  the  end  of  2025  at  its  two  plants  that  have  coal-fired  units  in  Texas.  On  March  29,  2023,  the  EPA  proposed revisions to the ELG and sought comments, which the EPA is analyzing.\n\n## Byproducts\n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized a rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds  and  legacy  surface  impoundments.  On  August  28,  2020,  the  EPA  finalized  \"A  Holistic  Approach  to  Close  Part  A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some  of  the  deadlines.  On  November  12,  2020,  the  EPA  finalized  \"A  Holistic  Approach  to  Closure  Part  B:  Alternative Demonstration  for  Unlined  Surface  Impoundments,\"  which  further  amended  the  April  2015  Rule  to,  among  other  things, provide procedures for requesting approval to operate existing ash impoundments with an alternative liner. On May 23, 2023, the EPA proposed establishing requirements for: (i) inactive (or legacy) surface impoundments at inactive facilities and (ii) all CCR management  units  (regardless  of  how  or  when  the  CCR  was  placed)  at  regulated  facilities.  NRG  anticipates  further rulemaking related to legacy surface impoundments and the Federal Permit Program.\n\n## Note 26 Cash Flow Information\n\nDetail of supplemental disclosures of cash flow and non-cash investing and financing information was:\n\n|                                                                                                              | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                | 2023                      | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Interest paid, net of amount capitalized   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  548                    | $  383                    | $  433                    |\n| Income taxes paid, net of refunds    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 48                        | 66                        | 32                        |\n| Non-cash investing activities:                                                                               |                           |                           |                           |\n| Decreases to fixed assets for accrued capital expenditures                                                   | -                         | (68)                      | (16)                      |\n\n## Note 27 Guarantees\n\nNRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. Examples of these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements, commodity sale  and  purchase  agreements,  retail  contracts,  joint  venture  agreements,  EPC  agreements,  operation  and  maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties, as well as affiliates. These contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. The Company is obligated with respect to customer deposits associated with the Company's retail operations. In some cases, NRG's maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability.",

Most of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in support of the Company's obligations to perform under commodity agreements and obligations associated with future closure and maintenance of ash sites, as well as for financing or other arrangements. A majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company to renew them on similar terms.\n\nThe material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as follows:\n\nAsset  sales -  The  purchase  and  sale  agreements  which  govern  NRG's  asset  or  share  investments  and  divestitures customarily contain guarantees and indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, changes in tax laws or for pre-existing  environmental  matters.  These  obligations  generally  have  a  discrete  term  and  are  intended  to  protect  the  parties against  risks  that  are  difficult  to  predict  or  estimate  at  the  time  of  the  transaction.  In  several  cases,  the  contract  limits  the liability of the indemnifier. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company currently has any material liability relating to such routine indemnification obligations included in the table above, except for the California property tax indemnity for estimated increases in California property taxes of certain solar properties that the Company agreed to indemnify, as part of the agreement to sell NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform. The California property tax indemnity is estimated to be $126 million as of December 31, 2023 and is included in the above table under asset sales guarantee obligations.\n\nOther guarantees - NRG has issued other guarantees of obligations including payments under certain agreements with respect to certain of its unconsolidated subsidiaries, payment or performance by fuel providers and payment or reimbursement of credit support and deposits. The Company does not believe that it will be required to perform under these guarantees.\n\nOther  indemnities -  Other  indemnifications  NRG  has  provided  cover  operational,  tax,  litigation  and  breaches  of representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who have provided services to the Company. NRG's maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications  can  range  from  a  specified  dollar  amount  to  an  indeterminate  amount,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.\n\nBecause many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company's liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the Company's liability would be, until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these contracts.\n\n## Note 28 Jointly Owned Plant\n\nNRG  owns  an  undivided  interest  in  Cedar  Bayou.  Cedar  Bayou  is  maintained  and  operated  pursuant  to  its  joint ownership participation and operating agreement. NRG is responsible for its subsidiaries' share of operating costs and direct expenses and includes its proportionate share of the facility and related revenues and direct expenses in the jointly-owned plant in the corresponding balance sheet and income statement captions of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  NRG's  proportionate  ownership  interest  in  the  Company's  jointly-owned  facility: (In millions unless otherwise stated)\n\n| As of December 31, 2023         | Ownership Interest   |   Property, Plant & Equipment | Accumulated Depreciation   |   Construction in Progress |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Cedar Bayou Unit 4, Baytown, TX | 50.00 % $            |                           222 | (115)  $                   |                          2 |",
