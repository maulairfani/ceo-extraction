Even in the face of ongoing global challenges this past year, we stay true to our long-term ambitions and see a bright future with emerging opportunities.\n\nNutrition, Health and Wellness is our past, present and future, and within that frame we continue to set new priorities. Our innovation capabilities enable us to consistently meet the rising expectations of a growing population. Portfolio optimization over the past years allows us to focus our e/fforts on our proven brands. Our operational excellence enables us to dependably deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And we continue to do business in a way that creates shared value for both our shareholders and society.\n\n## Encouraging balanced diets\n\nFoods and beverages are major drivers of long-term health, and consumers increasingly recognize this. We will continue to develop nutritious products that support people's well-being, and we believe that such products will see increased demand in the years to come.\n\nIn fact, in 2023, we reconfirmed our ambition to prioritize the development of our more nutritious products. This entails launching new products and renovating existing ones. It involves expanding micronutrient fortification, growing our a/ffordable o/fferings, reducing sugar and salt content, and increasing our use of plant-based ingredients in our recipes.\n\nAdditionally, we are actively guiding people towards a more balanced diet by making the nutritional value of our portfolio more transparent. We are strengthening our responsible marketing of indulgent products, providing clear front-of-pack portion guidance, and engaging with and informing consumers through our various online communities around the world.\n\n## Supporting healthy aging\n\nNestl\u00e9's food and beverage portfolio caters to people at each stage of their life. It starts with the first 1000 days and continues into adulthood and old age. With a rapidly aging global population, we see an opportunity to provide products that can support the nutrition, health and wellness of older people. We can help boost their energy levels, enhance their cognitive health, support their mobility, and improve their general physical and mental health.\n\nWe already o/ffer several Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and dairy products that are specifically targeted to seniors. Take, for example, successful brands like Boost, Pure Encapsulations or Molico . With our capabilities, we believe that we can leverage this trend across all of our categories to further grow.\n\n## Investing in innovation\n\nWe are investing in our future through innovation and entrepreneurship. Through our main research center in Switzerland and 23 sites globally, and with an industry-leading R&D budget, we develop products tailored to the diverse needs of people and pets while reducing our environmental footprint. Experts at our newly inaugurated Institute of Agricultural Sciences, for example, develop solutions in the areas of plant science, agricultural systems and dairy livestock. This is in addition to our four other research institutes looking at health sciences, food sciences, food safety and packaging.\n\nDigital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), are supporting sharper decision-making and increased speed across the entire company.

Nestl\u00e9's long-term success is supported by this approach.\n\nAn example of this is Nestl\u00e9's e/fforts to advance regenerative food production by helping protect, renew and restore natural resources. To that end, we are supporting farmers and strengthening their communities. We are delivering on our commitments in a way that appeals to consumers' increased expectations.\n\n## Remaining dedicated and dependable\n\nEvery year, our people show us how much can be achieved when we steadfastly pursue opportunities.

To achieve this, we pursue growth through rapid innovation, operational e/fficiency, and disciplined resource and capital allocation.\n\nOur portfolio is diversified, both in terms of geography and category. We have products for people at all life stages that can be consumed as part of a balanced diet. We want to contribute to people's health through nutrition and aim to help people of all ages live better. Our innovation capabilities ensure we deliver products that meet consumer needs and preferences, and are good for the planet. Through digital technologies, we are able to be more agile and make better and faster decisions.\n\n## Driving organic sales growth\n\nOrganic sales growth is key to our growth ambition. Our portfolio is geared to deliver sustained mid singledigit organic sales growth based on investment in attractive categories and regions, impactful innovation and execution discipline. Our knowledge of local consumers coupled with our scientific and technological expertise help us deliver innovations that support business growth, while meeting consumer needs. We also see many opportunities for growth through cross-fertilization between categories and geographies.\n\nIn addition to core innovation activities focused on food safety, taste, nutrition and sustainability, we have intensified research in high-growth categories, such as early-life and therapeutic nutrition, alternative proteins, and co/ffee and systems technology. Ecosystem building and business model innovation are also increasingly a focus of our categories.\n\nAlongside innovation, we continue to optimize our portfolio to focus on stronger brands and products.\n\n## Innovating across life stages and health needs\n\nThe foods and beverages people consume play a pivotal role in their overall health. From pre-conception to early life, through to childhood, adulthood and old age, we aim to meet people's nutritional and health needs throughout their lives.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has deep roots in infant nutrition. For years, we have researched the composition of nutrients and bioactives present in breastmilk as well as the role of probiotics in nutrition and health. Exploring the interaction between these di/fferent components, Nestl\u00e9 experts discovered a proprietary probiotic strain, B. infantis , that unlocks beneficial aspects of six human\n\nmilk oligosaccharides (HMOs). This led to the launch in 2023 of our proprietary blend, Sinergity , for use in infant formulas to support immunity and gut health.\n\nAs we continue our tradition of supporting children's health, we also need to consider an aging population that is living longer. Under our R+D Accelerator initiative, we developed the Nestl\u00e9 Goodnes range of products in 2023 to support healthy aging. It helps optimize people's energy levels, restore their sleep quality and improve their focus through patented nutritional blends. The products were piloted in France, Singapore and the UK. Additionally, we launched the Nestl\u00e9 N3 range in China that helps people maintain their overall health and wellbeing as they age.\n\n## Expanding alternative proteins\n\nIn 2023, we added to our plant-based portfolio by launching a range of vegan alternatives to fish filets, nuggets and fingers that stand out for their strong nutrition credentials, as well as their great taste and texture that is close to white fish. Garden Gourmet launched Marine-Style Crispy Filet and Marine-Style Crispy Nuggets in Europe, and Harvest Gourmet launched Crispy Fish-Free Fingers in Asia.\n\nWe also continued to explore new concepts for dairy alternatives. Made with a blend of oat and fava, the new natural bliss beverages are a good source of high-quality protein. Our teams chose fava beans because of their many health benefits and good taste.\n\nIn addition, we combined the goodness of milk with plant-based ingredients in our new Nido Milk & Soya instant powder launched in Central and West Africa and\n\nNestl\u00e9 is exploring emerging technologies like animal-free dairy beverages made with precision fermentation, which led to a pilot for Cowabunga in the United States.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our new recipe optimization tool uses advanced algorithms to help product developers better manage tradeo/ffs between ingredients, nutrition, cost and sustainability, while still meeting consumer expectations.\n\nIn the development of the new Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce Gusto Neo co/ffee system, our experts optimized the manufacturing process through virtual simulations before applying technical settings on the physical machine. This helped them make quick and e/fficient decisions to manage the complex interaction between co/ffee, paper packaging material and the machine to ensure the perfect co/ffee cup for consumers.\n\n## Improving e/fficiency with digital technologies\n\nDigitalization is enabling better and faster decisionmaking, in addition to improving cost e/fficiencies. We are harmonizing our data framework to be able to take advantage of di/fferent technologies, like AI.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Supplier Portal, a global digital collaboration platform, supports quality document management, sustainability data collection and supplier performance management. With over 7000 active suppliers in over 40 markets, it covers almost three-quarters of our direct material spend.\n\nGrown by only 59 Colombian farmers and developed to create a unique tasting experience, the new Nespresso N\u00b020 encapsulates over 20 years of expertise.\n\n## Leveraging always-on analytics\n\nWe are responding to fast-changing consumer needs in real time, using data to streamline our business processes. Our strategic procurement decisions are more informed, as we increasingly leverage advanced statistical modeling with machine learning and automated price-trend analytics. And by deploying new marketing analytics capabilities at scale, we are building data foundation pipelines that automatically refresh our marketing e/ffectiveness models for faster and smarter investment decisions.\n\nIn 2023, we spent 68% of our media budget digitally and acquired 308 million first-party data records. We are on track to meet our 2025 goals of 70% and 400 million respectively. Using AI, this data helps our brands reach target audiences more e/fficiently and deliver more relevant, personalized messages online.\n\n## Accelerating e-commerce\n\nOur ambition for 2025 is that a quarter of our sales come from e-commerce. This will have a significant impact on all markets, brands and roles. To support this, we launched an e-commerce academy that o/ffers personalized learning paths. Over 1500 employees were trained and certified in 2023.\n\nWe have also launched our own eB2B platforms in key markets such as Brazil, India, Mexico and Vietnam, and have partnered with other leading platforms, such as the eB2B platform BEES.",

Made from cow's milk, it has all the essential nutrients found in milk, including proteins, vitamins and minerals. In addition, it also contains beneficial prebiotic fibers and has\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe N3 milk products are the result of development work done by experts at R&D Nutrition, R&D Singapore, R&D Beijing and Nestl\u00e9 Research.\n\na low lactose content and over 15% fewer calories.\n\nUsing a proprietary technology, we use specialized enzymes to break down lactose, a sugar found in cow's milk, while generating prebiotic fibers. Clinical studies showed that the fibers promote the growth of multiple types of bifidobacteria, delivering gut microbiome benefits in healthy adults.\n\nN3 milk was first introduced in 2023, in a range of powdered dairy products in China, tailored to meet the dietary needs of local consumers. The N3 range includes a full cream and a skimmed milk product, both high in protein and perfect for the whole family. To support specific needs for healthy aging, the range includes two products with vitamins, minerals and probiotics to support bone health, muscle growth and strength, and immunity.\n\nN3 milk will be introduced in other product categories later, enabling us to support health and well-being across life stages.\n\nIN FIGURES\n\n## up to 3x\n\nbeneficial bifidobacteria growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOUR VOICES\n\n'N3 /m\\_ilk wi/l\\_l s/e\\_rve as a basis f/o\\_r nu/t\\_riti/o\\_us s/o\\_luti/o\\_ns f/o\\_r people with la/c\\_tose s/e\\_nsitivity /o\\_r who w/a\\_nt to /i\\_mprove the/i\\_r gas/t\\_ro/i\\_nt/e\\_st/i\\_nal health.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIsabelle Bureau-Franz Head of Nestl\u00e9's R&D for Nutrition Switzerland",

And to help people enjoy our products as part of a balanced diet, we will provide more guidance, including recipes, menu planning, healthy lifestyle tips and recommendations for nutritious choices.\n\n## Delivering food safety and quality\n\nHigh standards of food safety and quality are non-negotiable at Nestl\u00e9 and are fundamental in our engagement with consumers. Quality is integral to our Corporate Business Principles and embedded in our purpose and values. The end-to-end approach we take to food safety and quality applies to design, delivery and consumption. We apply international standards and help raise the bar in our industry using rigorous processes and leading scientific techniques.\n\nWe update our food safety and quality systems to respond to considerations, such as tightening regulations, changes to suppliers or ingredients, introduction of regenerative agriculture practices, new packaging and geopolitical developments. In 2023, our Quality Assurance Centers performed more than 4.1 million analytical tests for quality and food safety risk assessment and management.\n\n## Progressing to net zero\n\nWe are more than halfway to our 2025 goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions included in our Net Zero Roadmap and are progressing well. Most of the reductions are due to changes in the way we source raw materials, such as investments in deforestation prevention and regenerative agriculture in our agricultural supply chains.\n\nWe have identified more than 80% of the supply chain initiatives needed to hit the 2025 target and are seeking further reductions to reach our planned 50% cut by 2030. For example, through the newly inaugurated Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Agricultural Sciences, our experts are exploring novel approaches in dairy farming that have the potential to reduce GHG emissions in the areas of cow feed and manure management.\n\nHelping prevent deforestation plays a major role. By the end of 2023, 93.4% of our primary supply chains for cocoa, co/ffee, meat, palm oil, pulp and paper, soy and sugar were assessed as deforestation-free. The decrease from 99.1% in 2022 is due to the inclusion of co/ffee and cocoa in this indicator for the first time, where deforestation risk has not been assessed for as long.",

The SBTi has validated Nestl\u00e9's net-zero science-based target by 2050.\n\n## Promoting regenerative agriculture practices\n\nWe continue making progress in responsible sourcing, which ensures our raw materials are traceable to point of origin and are farmed using methods aligned to our Responsible Sourcing Standard, while progressively delivering benefits to people, nature and climate. We have set requirements for 14 priority raw materials: cereals and grains; cocoa; coconut; co/ffee; dairy; fish and seafood; hazelnuts; meat, poultry and eggs; palm oil; pulp and paper; soy; spices; sugar; and vegetables. Our aim is for 100% of these materials to be responsibly sourced by end of 2030. In 2023, this figure reached 36.2%.\n\nReforestation within or near our sourcing locations is an essential part of decarbonizing our operations and supply chain. Nestl\u00e9 became the first food and beverage company to pilot Airbus's new Pl\u00e9iades Neo satellites. We are using high-resolution images to monitor trees planted in our sourcing regions to ensure they thrive in the long term.\n\nWe continue to expand our regenerative agriculture program across a wider range of raw materials and regions, supporting farmers with training. Our farmer relationship management system collects data for over 250 000 farms, helping us track progress on GHG emission reductions and regenerative agriculture practices.\n\nWe are working with partners on packaging solutions, including a pilot of reusable stainlesssteel packaging for Nesquik in over 60 German grocery stores.\n\nRegeneration is important for water resources as well. Over 40 water regeneration projects are now underway around our water bottling sites. Each one is tailored to local challenges and based on a mix of natural and technical solutions for improving the quality and quantity of water available.\n\n## Implementing our vision for packaging and circularity\n\nOur vision remains that none of Nestl\u00e9's packaging ends up in landfill or as litter. Our strategy addresses both product design and infrastructure systems for reuse and recycling. By reducing unnecessary packaging, designing better packaging, modeling fair collection systems and supporting good regulation, we aim to support the transition to a waste-free future.\n\nPackaging innovations in 2023 support this transition. Redesigned jars for Malher Bouillon are saving 156 tonnes of plastic annually, with a format that is easy to recycle in local systems in Guatemala. In Latin America, Nescaf\u00e9 reduced single-serve sticks packaging, saving 44 tonnes of plastic annually.\n\nInnovations to reach this goal go beyond packaging redesign. In Indonesia, we collaborated with a team of start-ups and retail partners to pilot a reusable and refillable dispenser, and single-serve reusable packaging, for Milo and Koko Krunch brands. Shipping innovations also help. Reusable shipping boxes and reusable pallet bands that replace plastic shrink wrap are cutting plastic use by 100 tonnes annually in China.",

For each level, the farmer receives an extra bonus in pay per liter of milk. At the end of 2023, 179 Nature por Ninho farms were in the gold category, supplying 17 million liters of milk per month.\n\nIn 2023, the Ninho team embarked on a mission to communicate these best farming practices to consumers, sharing progress on three pillars: animal welfare, soil and water.

They include among others:\n\n- -Organic growth, Real internal growth and Pricing;\n- -Underlying trading operating profit margin and Trading operating profit margin;\n- -Net financial debt;\n- -Free cash flow; and\n- -Underlying earnings per share (EPS) and EPS in constant currency.\n\nManagement believes that these non-IFRS financial performance measures provide useful information regarding the Group's financial and operating performance.\n\nThe Alternative Performance Measures document published under www.nestle.com/investors/ publications defines these non-IFRS financial performance measures.\n\n## Group sales\n\nOrganic growth was 7.2%. Pricing was 7.5%, reflecting cost inflation over the last two years. RIG was - 0.3%, impacted by soft consumer demand, capacity constraints and a temporary supply disruption for vitamins, minerals and supplements in the second half. As expected, RIG turned positive in both the fourth quarter and the second half, supported by the benefits from portfolio optimization, improving customer service levels and increased brand support.\n\nGrowth was broad-based across most geographies and categories. In developed markets, organic growth was 6.4%, led by pricing with negative RIG. In emerging markets, organic growth was 8.4%, driven by pricing and positive RIG.\n\nBy product category, Purina PetCare was the largest contributor to organic growth, with strong momentum across all channels. Purina ONE , Purina Pro Plan and Friskies all recorded doubledigit growth. Sales of Purina Pro Plan reached almost CHF 3 billion. Co/ffee saw high singledigit growth, with positive sales developments across brands, supported by strong demand in out-of-home channels. Infant Nutrition posted high single-digit growth, based on continued momentum for premium infant formula, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) products as well as specialty formulas. Dairy reported mid single-digit growth, led by fortified milks, co/ffee creamers and home-baking products. Confectionery recorded high single-digit growth, fueled by continued double-digit growth for KitKat . Prepared dishes and cooking aids posted mid single-digit growth, with robust demand for Maggi across geographies and segments. Water posted mid single-digit growth, led by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna . Nestl\u00e9 Health Science recorded low single-digit growth, as continued strong momentum for Medical Nutrition was partly o/ffset by temporary supply constraints in vitamins, minerals and supplements.",

Organic growth of out-of-home channels was 15.9%.\n\nNet divestitures decreased sales by 0.9%, largely related to the divestment of a majority stake in Freshly as well as the disposal of the Gerber Good Start infant formula brand in 2022. The impact on sales from foreign exchange was negative at 7.8%, following significant and broad-based appreciation of the Swiss franc.

We strive to create longterm value through a balance of sustainable growth and resource e/fficiency. Our culture and values - rooted in respect for ourselves, others, diversity and the future guide our decisions and actions. Our Creating Shared Value approach helps us prioritize those areas that maximize value creation for shareholders and cultivate positive societal and environmental impacts.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is designed to assess and mitigate risks in order to minimize their potential impact and support the achievement of Nestl\u00e9's long-term purpose and business strategy. A top-down assessment is performed at Grouplevel once a year. A bottom-up assessment occurs in parallel, resulting in aggregation of the individual market assessments. This creates a good understanding of the company's key risks in order to allocate ownership to drive specific actions around them and take any relevant steps to address them.\n\nAdditionally, Nestl\u00e9 engages with external stakeholders to better understand the issues that are of most concern to them. The materiality assessment (included in the Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report ) rates the degree of external stakeholder concern and potential business impact. This helps to ensure that wider sustainability issues are incorporated into the risks and opportunities under consideration across the company.\n\nRisk assessments and any mitigating actions are the responsibility of the individual line management. If Group-level intervention is required, responsibility for mitigating actions will generally be determined by the Executive Board. The annual Group risk assessment is reported annually to the Executive Board, Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Under the Group's governance, the full Board is responsible for risk oversight. Further details of the ERM processes can be found in the Corporate Governance Report .\n\nWe are committed to transparency and action on climate-related risks and opportunities. We have aligned our reporting disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which can be found in our Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report.\n\nThe risks listed below are considered the most relevant for our business and performance. Many of the longer-term mitigation strategies are expanded on in our Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report.",

We progress on our path to gradually reduce absolute GHG emissions in our supply chain and continue to support the transition to a regenerative food system. Our engagement on climate action is in line with our detailed Net Zero Roadmap, which our shareholders endorsed at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. As of 2024, we will submit our report on non-financial matters to a vote by shareholders as required by Swiss law. While making our portfolio good for the planet, we further intensified our e/fforts to provide consumers with nutritious, healthy and enjoyable products and to establish new global best practice in product nutrition transparency.\n\nNestl\u00e9's Board of Directors is engaged in overseeing the direction of the company. We have continued to strengthen the Board by adding new independent directors with diverse experience and skillsets directly relevant to Nestl\u00e9, for example, with respect to food systems, food and beverage, digitalization, marketing, sustainability, geopolitics and other topics. Engagement with our shareholders takes place through our roadshows, investor meetings, analyst calls and Chairman's Roundtables, where we meet with investors from Asia, North America, Switzerland, Germany, the UK, France and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Chair's and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews all aspects of our governance. In 2023, it reviewed the roles and responsibilities with regards to our ESG/sustainability reporting. Our Board approves the ESG/sustainability strategy proposed by management and submits our report on non-financial matters to the Annual General Meeting. Advising on our environmental and social sustainability, including our response to climate change and our human rights due diligence program, the Sustainability Committee has oversight over the structure and content of the ESG/sustainability reporting. The Audit Committee oversees internal and external audit and reviews reports regarding internal controls, compliance, fraud and risk management; it has oversight over the accuracy of our financial and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnon-financial reporting. Chaired by our Lead Independent Director, the Nomination Committee evaluates Board composition, performance, structure and succession planning, and assesses candidates for nomination to the Board. The Compensation Committee ensures alignment of our remuneration systems with our values, strategies and performance. In 2023, it continued its work to refine the KPIs in our short- and long-term incentive plans and to enhance the related disclosure.",

        "page_content": "## Compliance\n\nCompliance is our commitment to act with honesty, integrity and respect for our own values, principles and policies, and for the laws and regulations where we operate. It is a non-negotiable requirement for everything we do and enables sustainable business growth. Our comprehensive Compliance Management System, comprised of policies, processes, controls and tools, is regularly reviewed to ensure we proactively uphold our values and address relevant risks, while also meeting the multiple and incremental regulatory requirements.\n\nNestl\u00e9's Board of Directors and Executive Board oversee and promote good practices throughout the company. Management is supported by our Legal and Compliance function, which provides guidance and functional leadership, as well as by all other functions engaged in our risk- and principles-based compliance program. The Group Compliance Committee ensures a continuous evolution of our Integrated Assurance Framework, while market compliance o/fficers and committees ensure a consistent approach across the Group and help identify local compliance priorities. Compliance is monitored through our corporate functions, including Audit, and external auditors.\n\nIn 2023, employees completed more than 970 000 e-modules on topics such as our Corporate Business Principles , compliance, human rights, security, sexual harassment, antitrust, and diversity and inclusion. We also launched a new mandatory training on transacting ethically and responsibly (with a focus on anti-money laundering) for a selected subset of people managers and a recommended training on anti-bribery and corruption for all employees.\n\nThis year marks the last year of the 2021-2023 CARE program cycle, through which we assess our sites on specific aspects of our social compliance including health and safety, environment and working conditions, with the help of independent external auditors. A total of 194 audits were performed in 2023, covering 440 sites. We have enhanced the program in preparation for the new 2024-2026 CARE cycle, particularly in assessing human rights in our sites.\n\nOur Speak Up system, independently operated by a third party, allows us to investigate and address potential non-compliance concerns from employees\n\nand external stakeholders. We have addressed substantiated complaints on issues such as abuse of power and/or mobbing/bullying, labor practices, sexual harassment and conflicts of interest, among others. As a consequence of all the substantiated cases in 2023, 122 employees had to leave our company and 15 service providers were terminated as a result of non-compliance incidents. In 2023, we developed a new training, Conducting Investigations on BehaviorRelated Allegations, to guide our markets and serve as a comprehensive toolkit of best practices.\n\nAn annual compliance communication plan strengthens and sustains a business ethics and compliance culture. This enables good business decisions and enhances the trust in Nestl\u00e9 by our stakeholders.",
