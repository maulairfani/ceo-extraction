Although Nordea believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct.  Results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements due to various factors. These include but are not limited to (i) macroeconomic developments, (ii) changes in the competitive environment, (iii) changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions, and (iv) changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rate levels. This Report does not imply that Nordea has undertaken to revise these forward-looking statements beyond what is required by applicable law or stock exchange regulations if and when circumstances arise that lead to changes following their publication.",

        "page_content": "## CEO LETTER\n\n## Dear stakeholder ,\n\n2023 was another strong year for Nordea. We further improved our position in all of our four home markets. Our performance makes us one of the strongest banks in Europe - giving us a great capacity to support our customers and Nordic societies in these uncertain times.\n\n2023 was in many ways a challenging year. Geopolitical tensions were high as Russia continued its tragic war in Ukraine. We also witnessed the difficult and very sad situation in the Middle East, which further reminded us of the world's fragility.\n\nThe economic environment was tough for many individuals and corporates. Rising prices forced central banks to raise interest rates to their highest levels in 15 years. Nordic households and businesses consequently became more careful. This led to reduced consumption and investment, but in general the region adjusted well in the changing environment and showed considerable resilience.\n\nDespite the challenging conditions, Nordea had a strong year - with our results making us one of the best-performing banks in Europe.\n\nThroughout our 200-year history we have always aimed to be a safe and strong bank, supporting our customers in all economic cycles. 2023 was no different. We stayed close to our customers, making sure we understood their changing circumstances and needs.\n\nOur proactive approach helped us maintain good business momentum and deliver strong financial results. Return on equity was 16.9%, clearly exceeding our outlook of above 15%. Full-year operating profit was up 18% at EUR 6.3bn.\n\nBeyond the numbers, I was pleased to see us progress on several fronts. Our customer satisfaction scores improved, our business volumes grew, and we strengthened our position in our four Nordic markets.\n\nOur performance shows that our strategy is continuing to work well for us, even in testing circumstances. Every action we take is in pursuit of our key priorities: to deliver best-in-class omnichannel experiences for our customers, drive focused and profitable growth, and increase operational and capital efficiency.\n\nTo support our business plan, we have also made bolt-on acquisitions. A great example of this is the purchase of Danske Bank's Norwegian personal customer and private banking business which we announced last summer. Expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, the transaction will increase our mortgage market share in\n\nNorway to around 16% from the current 11%. We look forward to welcoming our new customers and colleagues.\n\nWe also continued to make other important long-term investments to ensure that we are well positioned for the future, including in areas such as risk management and financial crime prevention. These investments will strengthen our ability to be a safe and trusted partner for our customers.\n\nThroughout the year customer activity was high. This was evident in the record-high use of our digital services. In 2023 customer logins to our mobile and online banking services increased by 13% year on year, to 1.4 billion. We have steadily expanded the range of digital options available to our customers and continue to invest to become the digital leader in the Nordics.\n\nAs we grow our digital offering, we are constantly finding new ways to be personal, expert and responsible in our interactions with customers. The human touch of Nordea will never go away, no matter how our customers choose to bank with us. During the year we assisted individuals, households and businesses in more than one million advisory meetings, a year-on-year increase of 9%.\n\nSustainability naturally remains a key focus for us. As the largest financial services group in the Nordics, we have an important role to play in supporting our customers' transitions to a low-carbon economy. Over the past two years we have facilitated EUR 135bn in sustainable financing, bringing us closer to our 2025 target of EUR 200bn. We are also progressing with reducing our carbon emissions. So far, our lending portfolio financed emissions are down 29% compared with 2019 levels, putting us on track to reach our 40-50% reduction target by 2030.\n\nIn 2023 all four of our business areas grew income faster than costs and delivered solid returns. Group income increased by 14%, to EUR 11.7bn. Despite the slower pace of activity in the Nordic housing market, we either maintained or improved our housing loan market shares, and mortgage lending volumes were stable. Corporate lending grew by 1% year on year and we increased our share of the corporate lending market, particularly in Norway and Sweden.",

We welcomed 3,800 new Private Banking clients during the year, demonstrating the quality of our business franchise.\n\nOur risk position and credit quality remain strong, supported by a uniquely well-diversified pan-Nordic credit portfolio. We have a well-managed loan portfolio, which is spread across markets and sectors and supported by prudent credit policies. We have de-risked our portfolio in recent years, which has helped us keep loan losses low, as was the case in 2023.\n\nCapital generation also remains strong. At the end of 2023 our CET1 ratio was 17.0%, 4.9 percentage points above the current regulatory requirement.\n\nOur Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of EUR 0.92 per share for 2023, a year-on-year increase of 15%. Including our share buy-backs during the past year, the total distribution to our shareholders will amount to approximately EUR 1.27 per share, or 11% of our current market capitalisation.\n\nDividends and buy-backs are important to our shareholders. Our extensive shareholder base in the Nordics includes more than 570,000 private individuals, pension funds, insurance companies, and foundations. This means that the capital we return helps support economic activity across the Nordic region. Through our distributions, our lending and financing activities, and our contributions as a major Nordic taxpayer, we are pleased to do our part to help make the Nordic societies stronger.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to sustain high profitability. In February 2024 we updated our financial target and are now targeting a return on equity of above 15% for 2025, up from above 13% previously.\n\n'Our proactive approach helped us maintain good business momentum and deliver strong financial results .'\n\nOur confidence is grounded in the progress we have made in recent years. When we set a new direction for Nordea back in 2019, we promised to focus on improving customer experience and driving profitable growth. Despite the constant changes in the external environment, this is exactly what we have done. The significant structural improvements we have made across the Group have laid the foundation for consistent high-quality earnings. Stable and predictable - that is what investors and customers should expect from Nordea.\n\nToday, we have a clear, proven strategy that is working for us. Our business franchise is strong and supported by a well-diversified business model. And we have leading positions in all our markets and business areas, and a leading position in the Nordics as a whole. These qualities equip us well to drive sustainable high performance and deliver on our priorities and purpose.\n\nTo our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders, I am grateful for your feedback and cooperation throughout 2023. I would also like to thank all employees for their great efforts and relentless drive during the year.\n\nEvery day, we will continue to work to earn the trust and loyalty of all our stakeholders. This is our way forward - supporting our customers and the communities we serve to the very best of our ability.\n\nOur ambition is unchanged: to be the preferred partner for customers in need of a broad range of financial  services.\n\nFrank Vang-Jensen President and Group CEO",

        "page_content": "## Banking in an unpredictable world\n\nIn 2023 the business environment was marked by continued high  uncertainty and volatility. While the economic outlook has weakened, the Nordic countries have weathered the changes well. The financial industry continues to evolve, driven by technological advancements, changing customer expectations and the imperative to support the sustainability transition.\n\nGlobal geopolitical tensions were high in 2023 as Russia continued its war in Ukraine. We also saw renewed conflict in the Middle East in the latter part of the year. Amid these geopolitical shifts, Europe's economy faced its own challenges. In an effort to bring down inflation, which for most of the year remained high in many parts of the economy, central banks continued to raise interest rates. Economic growth faltered, largely due to weakened consumer confidence and reduced spending and investment.\n\nIn the face of these pressures, European labour markets showed strong resilience, with much of the continent continuing to experience relatively low unemployment.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nInflation stands at a two-year low, yet is still above central banks' 2% target. The rising costs of energy, agricultural products and commodities have created inflationary pressures in the economy and could lead central banks to maintain higher interest rates in the medium term, despite expectations of softer economic growth and rate cuts.\n\nThe economic forecast is clouded by uncertainty. Russia's war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East remain primary catalysts for global instability. Meanwhile, China's political direction and unstable economic recovery have raised questions about what lies ahead for that country after a 40-year boom.\n\nThe Nordic countries in which we operate - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - showed continued relative strength in 2023. However, the weak global economic picture suggests that our home markets will also see a period of muted economic activity, at least in the short term. The construction industry is currently the most impacted sector in the Nordic region, and its slowdown could contribute to a rise in unemployment.\n\n## An attractive banking market\n\nOur Nordic operating markets are based in politically stable democracies with high levels of trustworthiness and\n\ncompliance. Individual and property rights are well protected. The Nordic economies boast some of the world's highest per capita GDPs, supported by high levels of social mobility, strong welfare systems and modern technological infrastructure. All this helps make the region a steady business environment.\n\nThe Nordic region also benefits from having a reliable and profitable banking sector, with financial institutions notable for their high degrees of digitalisation. These characteristics ensure the sector is well equipped to weather downturns and financial market disturbances such as those which occurred in the Swiss and American financial sectors in the early part of 2023. Nordea itself is one of the strongest and most profitable banks in Europe, with a pan-Nordic business model and a very well diversified lending portfolio - giving us a great capacity to support our customers.\n\n## Key trends shaping the financial industry\n\nThe financial industry continues to be shaped by multiple forces, ranging from macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions to various market, technology and regulatory trends.\n\n## An uncertain operating environment\n\nThe operating environment remains unpredictable for most businesses and industries, including the financial sector. Alongside the climate emergency, in recent years the world has faced a pandemic, outbreaks of war, and an energy crisis, as well as high inflation and a dramatic shift away from a highly expansionary monetary policy. A key source of uncertainty concerns how well housesholds and businesses will adjust to interest rates potentially normalising at higher levels after a decade of low or even negative rates. Asset prices and investments are adapting to a new reality. The resilience of households and corporates is being tested.",

Overall, our four home markets continue to show considerable resilience. Naturally, we continue to follow the impacts of key trends on our customers closely.\n\n## Digitalisation and AI\n\nDigitalisation and technological development are moving at a rapid and unprecedented pace, and continue to shape the way we live, work, communicate and manage our finances. People and businesses value speed and convenience and are finding that more of their banking needs are met through digital channels. As a digital leader in the financial industry, Nordea offers mobile banking applications that are increasingly rich in terms of features and user experience, and deploys advanced virtual assistants to support customers around the clock.\n\nCore operational processes in banking have also transformed significantly in the digital era.

        "page_content": "In step with these developments, the regulatory demands placed on financial services firms are growing. The resulting costs may pose a challenge for fintech companies but will be well handled by the largest financial services providers. As many large established banks have spent the past decade developing their digital capabilities, products and services in parallel with their fintech peers, their relative position is now very strong and raises the prospect of closer bank-fintech ties in the future.\n\n## The climate crisis and biodiversity loss\n\nThe climate crisis is one of the defining challenges of our time. As the world warms, extreme weather events such as floods and droughts are becoming more frequent and severe. The rapid loss of biodiversity is also endangering human well-being, putting our economy, food security and health at risk.\n\nEfforts to tackle the climate crisis centre on reducing the world's fossil fuel dependency and decarbonising the global economy. Pledges to reach carbon net zero now cover approximately 90% of the global economy. However, overall progress on climate action needs to accelerate. In many parts of the world, a lack of political will has hindered efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. An important and encouraging step was taken in 2023, when the European Emissions Trading System was further sharpened to accelerate the phase-out of free emission allowances, and widened to include a larger number of activities.\n\nThe financial sector has an important role to play in driving and accelerating the transition to more sustainable economies. While many banks seek to run their own operations as sustainably as possible, it is primarily\n\nthrough their business that they can make the most positive impact. At Nordea, for example, this involves making financing decisions aimed at driving progress on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, and actively engaging with  customers, partners and investees to help them steer towards sustainable business practices and operations. We also promote positive biodiversity action and help customers pursue investment opportunities related to protecting and restoring nature.\n\n## Increased regulation\n\nRegulatory demands on businesses have generally increased in recent years, especially in areas such as information security, business continuity and sustainability. The financial sector is also subject to a wide range of regulations aimed at ensuring financial stability, protecting consumers and preventing fraud. Our focus and investments reflect our commitment to continuously improve our defences against financial crime and adapt to new and emerging risks in the external environment. In 2023 we further strengthened our financial crime prevention capabilities through new investments in technology, additional employees, training, and more sophisticated prevention and detection techniques.\n\nAs global economies have become more interconnected, the importance of harmonised banking regulations across borders has grown. This has led to increased coordination between national and international governing bodies and central banks, particularly in Europe. We expect the trend towards greater harmonisation to continue in the future, driven by the need to safeguard the financial system, tackle financial crime and ensure a level playing field for banks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our strategy - centred on offering a great customer experience - guides us forward.\n\nNordea's roots date back to 1820s Copenhagen, when a local savings bank first opened its doors for business. Over time, and via multiple mergers, we have grown into the largest financial services group in the Nordics, helping customers across the region to realise their dreams and aspirations.\n\nOur values reflect the open, progressive and collaborative societies of the Nordics, and our activities directly contribute to the region's long-term economic development. We serve a diverse range of customers, from individuals and families to businesses and institutions of all sizes. We have developed strong and lasting relationships with the most prominent Nordic companies and continue to support their global growth and sustainability ambitions.\n\n## 2022-2025 strategic plan\n\nWe are halfway through our 2022-2025 strategy period and have made good progress in implementing our strategic objectives. Our focus remains on delivering best-in-class omnichannel experiences for our customers. We are also driving focused and profitable growth, and increasing operational and capital efficiency.\n\nTo deliver on these priorities, we have activated two key levers within the Group. One is to become a digital leader, recognising that digital technologies are key to providing exceptional banking services today and in the future. The other is to integrate sustainability into the core of our business, as we aim to support our customers in their transition to sustainable business models.\n\nTo become the preferred financial partner in the Nordics, we want to take the lead in all areas where we choose to compete. Our strategy is designed to accelerate momentum where we have a competitive edge and close gaps in areas where we aspire to have a leading position. This guides our decisions regarding how to allocate our people, technology investments and capital. Our leading market position, strong balance sheet and strong profitability mean we are ideally positioned to address growth opportunities, including bolt-on acquisitions.\n\n## Outstanding omnichannel experiences\n\nCreating best-in-class omnichannel customer experiences is our way to modernise relationship banking. Both private and corporate customers want to bank and interact with us in ways that suit them. Whether they use our digital banking apps and services, visit a branch, call us, or meet with an adviser, our aim is to offer them a consistent and seamless experience. Our approach combines the personal advice and human touch of our expert advisers with the convenience and personalisation that modern technology offers.\n\n## Focused and profitable growth\n\nIn recent years our profitability has consistently improved, giving us the capacity to invest in key growth areas in support of our vision. Our focus is always on profitable growth opportunities that support our  ability to grow income faster than costs. Our investments in 2023 supported the development of our lending,  savings and payments offerings. We also developed our offering for large corporates in areas such as cash management, risk management and trade finance.\n\n## Operational and capital efficiency\n\nBeing the largest Nordic financial services group brings strategic and cost advantages, creating opportunities for greater operational efficiency and superior value creation. We use digital technologies, analytics and, increasingly, AI to simplify bank processes, drive productivity improvements and deliver digital banking services efficiently. Such technologies also play a critical role in our efforts to combat financial crime and bolster cybersecurity, thus ensuring Nordea is a safe and strong partner. Where feasible, we seek to deploy common technology assets and solutions across our different operating countries and customer segments. Our initiatives to build scale advantages are an ongoing, multi-year effort.\n\nAnother key driver of profitability is capital efficiency. We aim for low capital intensity and optimal capital deployment across the Group and in each of our four",

This has enabled us to distribute excess capital to shareholders through substantial dividend payouts and share buy-backs.\n\n## Expansion in key markets\n\nWith our Group priorities as a foundation, our four business areas are pursuing strategic initiatives to enhance their competitiveness. One key initiative is to strengthen our position in the savings market. The Nordic savings market is structurally attractive and supported by growing demand for retirement and ESG-related savings solutions and wealth management. During the year we further accelerated our strategic ambitions within savings by completing the acquisition of Swedish digital pension broker platform Advinans. We also worked to integrate the life and pension business we acquired from Topdanmark. The acquired business, now called Nordea Pension, strengthens our position in long-term savings.\n\nAnother key focus for us is strengthening the market position and profitability of our Swedish business. In particular, we have been developing our digital capabilities with a view to creating a larger retail, private wealth and SME customer footprint. During 2023 we made good progress in Sweden, increasing our market share in mortgage lending. In Business Banking we ranked first in the annual Prospera customer satisfaction survey, and we increased assets under management in Private Banking.\n\nFinally, we have also been investing to bolster our position in Norway. In July we took a significant step by announcing the agreement to acquire Danske Bank's Norwegian personal customer and private banking business and associated asset management portfolios. The acquisition is expected to increase our mortgage market share in Norway to around 16% from the current 11%. The transaction is expected to close in late 2024. We look forward to welcoming our new customers and extending to them the same products and services used by our existing customers in Norway.\n\n## 'We are protected by a profitable, resilient business  model and a welldiversifed credit  portfolio.'\n\n## A well-diversified and resilient risk profile\n\nDespite the challenging market conditions in 2023, our risk profile has remained stable. We are protected by a profitable, resilient business model and a well-diversified credit portfolio, which have cushioned the impact of financial market volatility and the economic slowdown. Credit quality has remained strong. Although impacts from higher interest rates and inflation are now materialising to some degree, they remain at low levels.\n\nWe remain focused on our Nordic customers and aspire to grow in our four home markets. Overall, we continue to have a well-balanced credit portfolio, a limited need for loan loss provisions, and low earnings volatility. These have translated into lower funding costs and a better capital position than our peers.\n\nWe continue to optimise our risk management strategy and practices. During 2023 we invested to strengthen the management of climate and environmental risks. Our solid risk position, strong balance sheet and capital generation enable selected bolt-on acquisitions to support our portfolio and growth. The acquisition of Topdanmark Life at the end of 2022 and the agreement to acquire Danske Bank's Norwegian personal customer and private banking business are good examples of this. Whether growing organically or through acquisitions, we are committed to increasing income, keeping costs under control and driving market-leading shareholder returns.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We use our knowledge and the latest technological developments to continually expand our range of digital products and services for the benefit of our customers.\n\nWe have invested significantly in developing our digital capabilities for many years with the goal of making banking easy and accessible for our customers. Our digital platforms offer customers the freedom and independence to manage their finances when it is most convenient for them - and they have embraced this opportunity. In 2023 we had more than 1.4 billion logins to our digital services, and more than 4.6 million digitally active customers.\n\nCustomers can apply for a mortgage via the mobile banking app, receive a digital loan promise within minutes, sign mortgage agreements digitally, and easily switch between variable and fixed interest rates. Savings through digital channels now correspond to 63% of all retail savings transactions.\n\nMoreover, through a chat function on our websites, customers can receive a quick answer to any question. We have also developed a digital adviser that gives customers a savings recommendation matching their finances, expected return, attitude to risk and investment horizon.\n\nWe continue to expand our self-service features, making it easier for customers to manage their finances in real time. Our target is to have doubled the number of available digital products and services by 2025 compared with 2022.\n\n'We continue to expand our self-service features , making it easier for customers to manage their finances in real time.'\n\nCustomer satisfaction with our digital services remains high, with the mobile app averaging over 4 out of 5 stars in the Apple and Google Play app stores in all four Nordic countries at the end of 2023. Autonomous Research, a leading provider of research on financial companies, ranks our digital capabilities among the top three banks worldwide.\n\n## The possibilities of AI\n\nBuilding digital leadership is an ongoing effort requiring significant investment in advanced data processing, analytics and cybersecurity capabilities. One key area of focus for us in the coming years is scaling AI across the organisation. We are piloting AI in several areas across the bank to improve customer experience, speed up internal processes, tackle financial crime and provide insights for better decision-making. Given the rapid rate of development in AI technologies around the world, we aim to continuously build on this foundation and identify and deliver new AI use cases that enhance our problem-solving efficiency and help us stay competitive. We are committed to responsible AI, assess all AI applications from a privacy and ethical perspective, and follow regulatory developments in the field closely.\n\n## Open banking and digital payments\n\nEmerging technologies are crucial for the evolution of the financial sector. Our approach allows us to embrace and deploy modern digital products and solutions by innovating in-house or partnering with relevant third parties that can help us rapidly deliver tangible benefits for personal and corporate customers. We have been a first mover in the Nordics with our Open Banking and Application Programming Interface (API) platform. Our APIs enable us to participate in the open market ecosystem, improve  customer experience and change the way financial services are used.\n\nDigital payments is one area where our customers have benefited from our open banking approach.

We believe that the transition should be balanced and just, creating opportunities for all.\n\nThe financial industry has a key role to play in supporting the transition to a sustainable future. Even when economic and geopolitical challenges threaten to undermine progress towards a sustainable future, we believe that financial services providers should continue facilitating the transition by enabling customers to make sustainable choices and by reducing their own adverse impacts. At Nordea, we strive to do exactly that - and more.\n\nFor almost fifteen years, we have been recognised internationally as a leader within responsible investments, and in the past five, we have established ourselves as a global front-runner in offering ESG investments. Today, we provide our customers with a range of ESG-focused products aligned with both the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) framework and our own internal Sustainable Selection framework. As an active owner, we use our influence to improve the practices of the companies we invest in. As well as engaging in dialogues with companies on ESG issues, we exercise our voting rights at annual general meetings (AGMs) to support initiatives related to the environment, biodiversity and human rights. In 2023 we exercised such rights at more than 3,700 AGMs.\n\nSupported by our size and scale, we have also started to build a strong position within sustainable financing. We have committed to facilitate more than EUR 200bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin sustainable financing between 2022 and 2025. By the end of 2023 we had already delivered EUR 135bn towards this target.

Helping our customers build resilience therefore goes hand in hand with future-proofing our business.\n\nAs a financial services provider, we believe that the transition to a low-carbon economy should be balanced and just, creating opportunities for all and ensuring no community is left behind.\n\n## Sustainability in our strategy\n\nSustainability is integral to how we organise our operations, run the bank and manage our risks.\n\nOur sustainability work is built on four strategic  pillars: financial strength, climate and environmental action, social responsibility, and governance and culture. For each pillar, we have identified relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals and specific sustainability- related matters that impact us or where we can have a significant impact - through our financing, investments and internal   operations.\n\nDefinitions of our four strategic pillars are presented on the next page. Our targets, supplementary information, and data related to our sustainability disclosures are presented in the Sustainability notes on pages 329-380.\n\nIn relation to climate and environmental action, we have set a long-term objective to become a net-zero emissions bank by 2050 at the latest. To support this aim, we have introduced measurable medium-term objectives. For example, we are working to ensure that 90% of our exposure to large corporate customers in climate-vulnerable sectors is covered by transition plans by the end of 2025.\n\nWe are also steering lending towards customer initiatives that help decarbonise the economy, and have set carbon emission reduction targets for various key industry sectors. In 2022 we announced our first set of sector targets, which covered Shipping, Residential Real Estate, Oil & Gas and Mining. Since October 2023 we have added targets for Agriculture, Power Production and Motor Vehicles. The sector targets are important tools",

As a major taxpayer in the Nordics, we contribute significantly to the region's economic growth and development. Further information on our role as a responsible taxpayer can be found in Note S5 \"Governance and culture\" on pages  364-373.\n\n## Supporting the sustainability transition\n\nOur role as an active partner in society involves supporting the transition to more sustainable economies. Climate change and environmental degradation are major threats to the world and our region, and we aim to be part of the solution. We focus on making a positive impact through our business dealings with customers and seek to run our own operations as sustainably as possible.\n\n## Engaging with local communities\n\nOur community engagement efforts are wide ranging. Through three core programmes, we help people develop their financial skills, foster entrepreneurship, and support refugees with language tuition and digital skills. For example, our Matteutmaningen initia-\n\ntive invites families in Sweden to solve maths challenges and provides parents with tips on how to teach maths at home. Another successful initiative is Fearless Founders, a mentoring scheme where seasoned entrepreneurs share advice with women and recent graduates who want to start or grow a business. Through this initiative, we seek to promote a more equal and sustainable society.\n\nTo deliver on our community engagement programmes, we work closely with  various local and national non-profit organisations in the Nordic countries, Poland and Estonia. Our employees get involved too: in 2023 more than 1,600 of them collectively volunteered a total of 10,415 hours to support our community engagement initiatives.\n\n## Engaging with regulatory authorities\n\nA robust and secure financial sector requires close cooperation between financial services groups and sector supervisors. At Nordea, we are in active dialogue with regulatory authorities, both EU-level and national, on topics ranging from prudential requirements and risk management to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism. Our goal is to serve as a dependable source of insight and expertise and support the work of regulators in safeguarding the integrity and stability of the financial system.\n\n## 10,415\n\nhours  volunteered by employees in our community engagement  programmes in 2023\n\n## 216,000\n\nchildren and young people supported in building their financial skills in 2023\n\n50\n\nlocal and national partners involved in our community engagement  work",

With 140 subsidiaries in 45 countries, it has 5,500 employees and is listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm.\n\nSustainability is a central part of Beijer Ref's strategy.

We strive to offer a comprehensive and attractive range of financial products and services, along with a great omnichannel customer experience.\n\n## How we do business\n\nWe offer individuals and households a wide range of banking services, from savings accounts and investment products to home loans and payment services. Most of our customers' banking needs are met by our comprehensive range of self-service online and mobile banking solutions. Our digital offering is complemented by the expertise of our advisers. However our customers choose to bank with us, our goal is to always provide advice that is personal and relevant. We have been expanding our sustainability-related advisory services and today offer a range of green lending and savings products. Our Nordic footprint, scale and local adaptability help us drive efficiencies in each of our markets.\n\n## Business development\n\nNordea customers value flexibility in choosing when and how they bank with us, and our focus has therefore been to provide a comprehensive range of self-service mobile and online banking solutions. In today's uncertain economic environment, customers have appreci-\n\nated being able to easily access the information they need and manage their finances at the most convenient time for them. In 2023 the number of private mobile app users increased by 8% year on year and logins were up 11%.\n\nWhile customers can attend to most banking matters digitally, our advisers are also on hand to provide advice on personal finance matters. They were again proactive in 2023, using leads from our digital channels to connect with customers and offer assistance. We also invited customers to webinars providing advice on managing personal finances. Overall, we held more in-person and online meetings and handled more traffic through our contact centres than in 2022.\n\nReflecting the economic climate, customer demand for new loan promises fell, as did overall customer investment activity. However, customers increased their activity in recurring investments and their monthly savings topups. To cater to customer demand, we launched new deposit products and increased the interest paid on all savings accounts as well as on transaction accounts in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.",

For example, in Sweden, our online mortgage portal, Mitt bostadsk\u00f6p, handled 60% of incoming mortgage applications in 2023, up from 55% in 2022.\n\nOverall customer satisfaction continued to improve in 2023, with a positive development relative to peers. Customers rate our iOS and Android applications for household customers highly. We performed well in external benchmarks too: D-Rating named us the best digital performer among European retail banks and we won Global Finance's award for best digital user experience among banks in Western Europe.\n\nTo build on this momentum, we continued to update the digital experience for our customers in 2023. Customers can now, within a single pane, search for products, submit questions to and interact with a digital adviser, and get help from a Nordea expert. We also launched a new savings experience that allows customers to set savings goals, search for investments by theme, view detailed profit and loss information, and enjoy an improved trading flow with real-time prices.\n\nCustomers continue to show strong interest in making a positive ESG impact through their savings. Our ESG products have performed well and in 2023 the ESG share of gross inflows into funds remained high at 31%. During the year we further expanded our sustainability-linked product offering. Across our Nordic markets, customers can now use the Nora digital savings adviser to kickstart their children's savings through ESG-balanced funds. We also issued our second green covered bond, in the process becoming the largest green covered bond issuer in Finland.\n\nIn July we announced an agreement to acquire Danske Bank's Norwegian personal customer business, thereby strengthening our market position in Norway. We expect to close the acquisition in late 2024.\n\n## Results\n\nTotal income grew by 21% year on year, driven by improved deposit margins linked to higher policy rates in all markets. As a result of the slowing housing market, mortgage volumes were stable year on year in local currencies. Deposit volumes were up 1% year on year in local currencies.\n\nNet interest income grew by 34% year on year, reflecting higher deposit margins across the Nordics. The development was partly offset by lower mortgage margins in Finland, Norway and Sweden resulting from rate changes, and lower lending margins in Denmark due to a changed product mix.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 5% year on year, mainly driven by lower lending fee income in Denmark. This was partly offset by higher investment and insurance income (including net insurance result).\n\nTotal expenses increased by 8% year on year due to salary inflation, investments in technology and risk management in line with our business plan, and lower capitalisation of development costs.\n\nTotal net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 112m (7bp), compared with EUR 56m (3bp) in 2022, and was in line with our expectations. This was driven by the macro development in our markets.\n\nOperating profit increased by 32% and return on capital at risk improved to 27% from 19%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'In 2023, thanks to expanded self-service options, customers used our digital services more than ever before .'\n\n## Sara Mella\n\nHead of Personal Banking\n\n## Achievements in 2023\n\nImproved ROCAR by 8 percentage points, to 27%.\n\nDrove record-high use of digital services, with mobile app logins up 11%.\n\nWon Global Finance award for best digital user experience among banks in Western Europe.\n\nDrove strong ESG share of gross fund inflows at 31%.\n\nTotal income:\n\nEUR 4,639m\n\nCosts:\n\nEUR -2,030m\n\nOperating profit: EUR 2,497m\n\nCost-to-income ratio: 44%\n\nROCAR:\n\n27%\n\n## 2025 priorities\n\nCreate best-in-class omnichannel customer experiences through personalised digital services and competent advice.\n\nIncrease profitability by growing savings, strengthening our position in Sweden and offering sustainable choices and advice.\n\nIncrease operational efficiency through our digital capabilities and Nordic scale.\n\n## 2025 targets\n\nWe plan to disclose updated ROCAR and cost-to-income ratio targets in conjunction with our first quarter 2024 financial report.",

By improving our digital customer experience and self-service feature coverage in all digital channels, we have been able to decrease average contact centre waiting times.\n\nIn response to increased customer focus on managing liquidity and working capital, we launched a digital trade guarantee service, upgraded our digital invoicing experience and made cash flow insights available in Nordea Business.\n\nSustainability remains a key focus area, both for us as a bank and for our customers. Our green asset portfolio increased to 11% of total lending and we saw strong customer demand for the new sustainability guarantee launched in May in collaboration with the European Investment Fund. In the fourth quarter we launched an SME Net-Zero Commitment Loan - the first of its kind in the Nordics - which is currently available to customers in Denmark and Sweden. During the year we also completed the Nordic roll-out of our business carbon calculator, which enables customers to better understand their emissions and identify climate transition opportunities.\n\n## Results\n\nTotal income increased by 18% year on year, driven by higher lending volumes, improved deposit margins and higher net result from items at fair value. Lending volumes increased by 1% in local currencies, driven by Sweden and Norway.\n\nNet interest income increased by 29% year on year, driven by higher lending volumes and improved deposit margins. Deposit margin increases were linked to policy rate hikes in all markets. The growth was partly offset by lower lending margins.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 5% year on year, driven by lower mortgage refinancing activity and lower savings income. These were partly offset by growth in payment and card fee income.\n\nNet result from items at fair value increased by 1% year on year, driven by higher trading income.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 5% year on year, mainly driven by investments in technology and risk management in line with our business plan.

Net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 80m (8bp). This included a positive impact of EUR 8m (1bp) from the revaluation of Nordea Kredit's mortgage portfolio.\n\nOperating profit amounted to EUR 2.1bn, a year-on-year increase of 26%.

The market environment was predominantly volatile, with a rebound in equity and credit market activity towards the end of the year. We maintained our intense focus on cost control and capital footprint optimisation, enabling continued customer support and solid results, and made further progress with our digitalisation efforts. Customer use of our automation offering for managing foreign currency flows increased by approximately 32% year on year.\n\nWe continued to be a leading player within sustainable finance and customer demand for sustainable advisory services remained strong. During the year we further raised the bar in the area of sustainability, launching a strategic data collection tool for emissions and a climate transition plan maturity ladder to follow up on transition progress and enhance customer ESG dialogues.\n\nWe remain on track to facilitate EUR 200bn in sustainable financing for our large corporate and institutional customers by 2025, and we have now delivered EUR 128bn towards this target. By the end of the year we once again ranked first for Nordic corporate sustainable bonds.\n\nIn the 2023 Prospera customer satisfaction survey we were recognised as the Best Corporate Bank in Denmark and our Nordic corporate banking score remained high.\n\nWe were also the winner of Global Finance's 2023 Sustainable Finance Awards for Denmark, Finland and Norway, and received the award for outstanding leadership in transition/sustainability-linked loans for Western Europe.\n\n## Results\n\nTotal income was up 7% year on year. Net interest income increased by 24%.\n\nLending volumes were broadly unchanged, while deposit volumes were down 8%. Deposit volumes showed significant volatility over the course of year, driven by measures taken by our customers to handle the market turbulence. We continued to see a pick-up in deposit volumes following the drop in the second quarter.\n\nNet fee and commission income was down 1% year on year amid continued weak capital markets. Net result from items at fair value decreased by 18% due to challenging market conditions and following a strong 2022.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 3%, mainly driven by additional technology and risk management investments. These were partly offset by continued strict cost control and lower regulatory fees. Net loan losses and similar net result amounted to net reversals of EUR 22m (3bp), reflecting the strong underlying credit quality of our loan book. At the end of the year the total provisioning level stood at approximately EUR 345m or 0.66% of LC&I lending.\n\nOperating profit increased by 7% year on year, to EUR 1.6bn, mainly driven by solid income and net loan loss reversals.\n\nWe continued to exercise solid capital discipline. Return on capital at risk increased from 19% to 20% for the full year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'As the world and our customers' needs change, we continue to provide outstanding customer support .'\n\nMartin A Persson\n\nHead of Large Corporates & Institutions\n\n## Achievements in 2023\n\nImproved ROCAR by 1 percentage point, to 20%.\n\nAchieved #1 core league table and customer rankings.\n\nReduced financed greenhouse gas emissions by 49% compared with 2019.\n\nDelivered strong and stable customer support in turbulent and uncertain times.\n\nTotal income: EUR 2,397m\n\nCosts:\n\nEUR -866m\n\nOperating profit: EUR 1,553m\n\nCost-to-income ratio: 36%\n\nROCAR:\n\n20%\n\n## 2025 priorities\n\nDrive core income growth.\n\nStructurally lower our cost to serve.\n\nAccelerate capital excellence through efficient balance sheet use, new capital models and risk-sharing transactions.\n\nBe the preferred sustainability partner for our core Nordic corporate and institutional customers.\n\n## 2025 targets\n\nWe plan to disclose updated ROCAR and cost-to-income ratio targets in conjunction with our first quarter 2024 financial report.",

        "page_content": "We also took steps to bolster our position in our four Nordic markets in support of our ambition to be the leading Nordic wealth manager. In July we announced plans to strengthen our position in Norway by acquiring Danske Bank's Norwegian private banking business and associated asset management portfolios. In recognition of our progress, we were named Best Private Bank in the Nordics and Finland by Professional Wealth Management in their 2023 Global Private Banking Awards.\n\nAssets under management (AuM) increased by 5% year on year, to EUR 378bn, driven by appreciating stock markets and higher interest rates. Investment performance remained strong despite the challenging environment, with 76% of aggregated composites providing excess return on a three-year basis. Net flows were impacted by the market environment, which prompted international institutions and third-party partners to favour fixed-term or money market funds, traditional banking products and direct government bond investments.\n\nOur long-standing focus on ESG continued to gain recognition among investors. We won the 2023 Environmental Finance Sustainable Investment Awards for infrastructure fund of the year and social fund of the year with our Global Sustainable Listed Real Assets Fund and Global Climate and Social Impact Fund, respectively. And we strengthened our position in Broadridge's Fund Brand 50 report, rising to ninth best in Europe for asset management and second best for sustainability. At the end of the year around 69% of total AuM were in ESG products.\n\nIn Life & Pension we continued to put our growth plans into action. We further integrated the Topdanmark life and pension business we acquired in late 2022, now called Nordea Pension, to bolster our position in long-term savings. We also completed the acquisition of the Swedish digital pensions platform Advinans AB, strengthening our digital occupational pension offering in Sweden. Moreover, we further integrated our digital pensions adviser, Nora Pension, into our advisory process, and strengthened our position in the pension transfer market in both Sweden and Norway to support our strategic ambitions within the savings area. Gross written premiums reached an all-time high at EUR 8.5bn.\n\n## Results\n\nTotal income increased by 10% year on year, to EUR 1.4bn, mainly driven by higher deposit income. Net interest income was EUR 308m, up 82% year on year, mainly driven by improved deposit margins.\n\nLending volumes decreased by 2% year on year. Deposit volumes decreased by 8%, while deposit margins improved.\n\nNet fee and commission income was EUR 977m, down 5%\n\nyear on year, driven by lower asset management commissions.\n\nNet insurance result increased by 5%, to EUR 85m, mainly due to the inclusion of Nordea Pension.\n\nNet result from items at fair value amounted to EUR 35m, up from EUR 2m in 2022, mainly due to gains on shareholders' equity portfolios in Life & Pension and the inclusion of Nordea Pension.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 7% year on year, mainly driven by the inclusion of the acquired Nordea Pension business and investments in nearshoring and risk management.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result was unchanged at EUR 2m.\n\nOperating profit was EUR 813m, up 12% year on year. The cost-to-income ratio with amortised resolution fees improved to 42% from 43% in 2022.

He started out as a customer in  Private Banking and the positive experiences he had convinced him to move his business accounts to Nordea as well. Over the years, the relationship has deepened and now Jakob and Nordea are working together to manage both his  private and business-related banking needs.\n\n'The relationship with Private Banking has always been very close and professional. It's the people and continuity that build trust - which is really important to me. Over the years, in both good and bad times, the mutual trust between the advisers and me has made things easy. Of course, every relationship has its ups and downs but the open and honest dialogue has helped resolve every situation.'\n\n'Private Banking has combined my personal and business needs perfectly. It's great to have a single point of contact for whatever I want to get done, whether it concerns me personally, my business or any members of my family. Private Banking has also given me an opportunity to expand my network. One example of this is a round table discussion I had with Nordea's other Private Banking customers. For me, meeting new people and forging new relationships is imperative so it's nice that Private Banking caters to this need as well.'\n\n'It's great to have a single point of contact for whatever I want to get done.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main drivers were increased deposit margins across the business areas supported by corporate lending volume growth. This was partly offset by lending margin pressure as well as a negative impact from exchange rate effects of approximately EUR 519m.\n\n## Lending volumes\n\nLoans to the public excluding repurchase agreements and securities borrowing were up 1% in local currencies. Lending volumes increased in Business Banking (1% in local currencies), were stable in Personal Banking (0% in local currencies) and decreased in Large Corporates & Institutions (-2% in EUR).\n\n## Deposit volumes\n\nTotal deposits from the public excluding repurchase agreements and securities borrowing were down 3% in local  currencies. Deposit volumes increased in Personal Banking (1% in local currencies) and in Business Banking (1% in local currencies) and decreased in Large Corporates & Institutions (-8% in EUR).\n\n## Net fee and commission income\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 5%, mainly driven by a negative impact from exchange rate effects of approximately EUR 122m, lower lending-related commissions and lower income from savings and investments following a decline in average assets under management.\n\n## Net insurance result\n\nNet insurance result increased by 25% driven by the inclusion of Nordea Pension and a higher interest rate level in 2023 affecting guaranteed life insurance products in scope for IFRS 17.\n\n## Net result from items at fair value\n\nNet result from items at fair value amounted to EUR 1,014m, decreased by 13%, mainly driven by lower result in Treasury and lower market-making result in Markets due to falling market rates and increased interest rate volatility in the latter part of the year. This was partly offset by solid customer risk management activity focused on foreign exchange and interest rate products.\n\n## Equity method and other operating income\n\nIncome from companies accounted for under the equity method was EUR -3m, up from EUR -8m. Other operating income was EUR 43m, down from EUR 83m.\n\n## Expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses were up 8% compared with 2022. Higher costs were driven by inflation and additional technology and risk management investments. Staff costs were up 4%. Other expenses were up 9%. Depreciation and amortisation was up 32% mainly due to write-offs of intangible assets, including EUR 130m related to a change in treatment of development costs of digital services.\n\n## Staff costs and FTEs\n\nStaff costs, significant agreements with key management personnel, gender distribution and the number of employees by country are disclosed in Note G8. More information is presented on pages 183-197.\n\n## Net loan losses and similar net result\n\nNet loan losses for 2023 were low at EUR 187m (EUR 112m), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 7bp (4bp) for lending at amortised cost. Including fair value gains from the Danish mortgage portfolio at EUR 20m, 'Net loan losses and similar net result' amounted to EUR 167m, corresponding to 5bp (4bp).\n\nIndividually calculated losses amounted to EUR 191m and were driven by write-offs, while provisions and reversals were low. The individual provisions were partly driven by construction and consumer-related industries which were affected by cost increases and lower consumer demand.\n\nManagement judgements were reduced by EUR 90m during the year, from EUR 585m to EUR 495m. The cyclical management judgement allowance was EUR 414m at the end of the year, down from EUR 430m, fully due to foreign exchange fluctuations. The management judgement was assessed to be at an appropriate level. During the fourth quarter of 2023 the requirement to automatically make full provisions for aged",

        "page_content": "non-performing retail loans was implemented. As a result, EUR 74m was transferred from the structural management judgement allowances to collective provisions, as planned.\n\nOverall provisioning levels and coverage were maintained. At the end of 2023 the structural management judgement amounted to EUR 81m, covering planned improvements to provisioning models and processes.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit increased by 18% to EUR 6,338m, driven by growth in total income.\n\n## Taxes\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2023 was 22.2%, largely unchanged in comparison with the effective tax rate of 22.1% in 2022 (excluding items affecting comparability).\n\n## Net profit and return on equity\n\nNet profit increased by 18% to EUR 4,934m. Return on equity was 16.9% (13.8%).\n\n## Capital position\n\nThe CET1 capital ratio was 17% at the end of 2023, up from 16.4% last year, while CET1 capital was EUR 23.6bn (EUR 23.9bn last year). The Group's total capital ratio was 22.2% and total own funds were EUR 30.8bn at the end of 2023.\n\nA description of the capital position is available under 'Capital management' on pages 55-58 and in the Capital and Risk Management Report at nordea.com.\n\n## Nordea's funding operations\n\nDuring 2023 Nordea continued to benefit from prudent liquidity risk management in terms of maintaining a diversified and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity buffer. Nordea Bank Abp issued approximately EUR 4.2bn in senior longterm funding. Throughout 2023 Nordea Bank Abp remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis. Nordea Bank Abp reduced its participation in the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) provided by the European Central Bank. For more information, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nDuring the year the Nordea Group issued approximately EUR 21.5bn in long-term funding and capital instruments, excluding Danish covered bonds and long-term CDs. Nordea's liquidity management is presented on pages 209-244. A maturity analysis is presented in Note G10.3 'Maturity analysis'.

The decrease was mainly explained by decreases in 'Cash and balances with central banks' and 'Derivatives', in total EUR 21bn, partly offset by increases in 'Shares' and 'Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts'.\n\nThe decrease in 'Cash and balances with central banks' was driven by liquidity management, while the decrease in 'Derivatives' was primarily driven by changes in FX and interest rates impacting the fair value of the instruments. A similar decrease can be seen in 'Derivatives' on the liability side.\n\nThe increase in 'Shares' and 'Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts' was mainly due to favourable equity markets. The increase in 'Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts' was offset by a similar increase in 'Deposits in pooled schemes and unitlinked investment contracts' on the liability side.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities decreased by EUR 10bn compared with 2022. The decrease was mainly explained by decreases in 'Derivatives' and 'Deposits and borrowings from the public', in total EUR 17bn, driven by changes in FX and interest rates impacting the fair value of the instruments, and liquidity management, respectively. The decreases were partly offset by an increase of EUR 7bn in 'Deposits in pooled schemes and unitlinked investment contracts', reflecting the increase on the asset side mentioned above.",

As a result of the slowing housing market, mortgage volumes were stable year on year in local currencies. The deposit volumes were up 1% year on year in local currencies.\n\nNet interest income grew by 34% year on year, reflecting higher deposit margins across the Nordics. The development was partly offset by lower mortgage margins in Finland, Norway and Sweden resulting from rate changes, and lower lending margins in Denmark due to a changed product mix.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 5% year on year, mainly driven by lower lending fee income in Denmark.\n\nThis was partly offset by higher investment and insurance income (including net insurance result).\n\nTotal expenses increased by 8% year on year due to salary inflation, investments in technology and risk management in line with Nordea's business plan, and lower capitalisation of development costs.\n\nTotal net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 112m (7bp), compared with EUR 56m (3bp) in 2022, and was in line with expectations. This was driven by the macro development in Nordea's markets.\n\nOperating profit increased by 32% and return on capital at risk improved to 27% from 19%.",

Lending volumes increased by 1% in local currencies, driven by Sweden and Norway.\n\nNet interest income increased by 29% year on year, driven by higher lending volumes and improved deposit margins. Deposit margin increases were linked to policy rate hikes in all markets. The growth was partly offset by lower lending margins.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by 5% year on year, driven by lower mortgage refinancing activity and lower savings income. These were partly offset by growth in payment and card fee income.\n\nNet result from items at fair value increased by 1% year on year, driven by higher trading income.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 5% year on year, mainly driven by investments in technology and risk management in line with Nordea's business plan. The cost-to-income ratio improved to 38% from 42% in 2022.\n\nDespite the weakening macroeconomic outlook, credit quality remained robust and Nordea maintained a diversified portfolio across segments and countries. Net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 80m (8bp). This included a positive impact of EUR 8m (1bp) from the revaluation of Nordea Kredit's mortgage portfolio.\n\nOperating profit amounted to EUR 2.1bn, a year-on-year increase of 26%. Return on capital at risk increased from 19% to 23% for the full year, driven by higher income.\n\n## Large Corporates & Institutions\n\nTotal income was up 7% year on year. Net interest income increased by 24%.\n\nLending volumes were broadly unchanged, while deposit volumes were down 8%. Deposit volumes showed significant volatility over the course of year, driven by measures taken by customers to handle the market turbulence. Large Corporates & Institutions continued to see a pick-up in deposit volumes following the drop in the second quarter.\n\nNet fee and commission income was down 1% year on year amid continued weak capital markets. Net result from items at fair value decreased by 18% due to challenging market conditions and following a strong 2022.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 3%, mainly driven by additional technology and risk management investments. These were partly offset by continued strict cost control and lower regulatory fees. Net loan losses and similar net result amounted to net reversals of EUR 22m (3bp), reflecting the strong underlying credit quality of the loan book. At the end of the year the total provisioning level stood at approximately EUR 345m or 0.66% of LC&I lending.\n\nOperating profit increased by 7% year on year, to EUR 1.6bn, mainly driven by solid income and net loan loss reversals.\n\nLC&I continued to exercise solid capital discipline. Return on capital at risk increased from 19% to 20% for the full year.\n\n## Asset & Wealth Management\n\nTotal income increased by 10% year on year to EUR 1.4bn, mainly driven by higher deposit income. Net interest income was EUR 308m, up 82% year on year, mainly driven by improved deposit margins.\n\nLending volumes decreased by 2% year on year. Deposit volumes decreased by 8%, while deposit margins improved.\n\nNet fee and commission income was EUR 977m, down 5% year on year, driven by lower asset management commissions.\n\nNet insurance result increased by 5%, to EUR 85m, mainly due to the inclusion of Nordea Pension.\n\nNet result from items at fair value amounted to EUR 35m, up from EUR 2m in 2022, mainly due to gains on shareholders' equity portfolios in Life & Pension and the inclusion of Nordea Pension.\n\nTotal expenses increased by 7% year on year, mainly driven by the inclusion of the acquired Nordea Pension business and investments in nearshoring and risk management.\n\nNet loan losses and similar net result was unchanged at EUR 2m.\n\nOperating profit was EUR 813m, up 12% year on year. The cost-to-income ratio with amortised resolution fees improved to 42% from 43% in 2022. Return on capital at risk was 53%, a year-on-year increase of 18 percentage points.",

This has entailed the Group winding down its operations in Russia as announced in December 2020. The liquidation of the remaining Russian subsidiary is pending finalisation.\n\n## Impacts from Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nDuring 2023 Nordea continued to closely monitor and assess its direct exposure to Russian counterparties. At the end of 2023 the direct credit exposure after provisions was less than EUR 50m. Nordea furthermore assessed the impact of uncertainty after the onset of the war - reflected in higher inflation and higher interest rates etc. - on the global and Nordic economies. The assessment informed the regular update of the Nordea's macroeconomic scenarios, which are used to update its financial forecasts and model IFRS 9 expected credit losses. Nordea will continue to follow developments closely and comply with applicable EU, US, UN and UK sanctions. The sanctions currently include freezing of assets, deposit restrictions, restrictions on economic relations with certain regions in Ukraine, restrictions focusing on the energy and finance sectors, import and export restrictions and overflight bans. See Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 209-244.\n\n## EBA stress test results\n\nOn 28 July 2023 the European Banking Authority (EBA) published the results of the EU-wide stress test conducted in cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. The forward-looking analysis covered the period 2023-2025 and considered the resilience of financial institutions to adverse economic shocks. The exercise confirmed Nordea's well-managed risk profile and resilient capital position. The methodology and scenario assumptions used were relatively severe for the Nordic countries in which Nordea operates. Under the severe stress scenario, Nordea's CET1 capital ratio was estimated to decline from 16.4% at the end of 2022 to a low of 13.0% at the end of 2023, remaining well above capital and internal buffers. The 2023 EBA stress test has not resulted in changes to Nordea's risk management or capital strategy.\n\n## Acquisition of Advinans completed\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023 Nordea (through Nordea Livf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring Sverige AB) entered into an agreement to acquire all shares in Advinans AB, a digital pension broker platform in Sweden. Advinans offers digital solutions for corporate administration, pension advice and employee benefits. The company has 37 employees and approximately 100 corporate customers. The acquisition was completed in May after the necessary regulatory approvals had been received. Advinans will be integrated into Nordea and operated under the Nordea brand. The acquisition will strengthen Nordea's life and pension offering in Sweden and accelerate its ambition to become a digital leader in corporate pensions. See Note G9.6 'Acquisitions' for more information.\n\n## Acquisition of Danske Bank's personal customer and private banking business in Norway\n\nNordea entered into an agreement with Danske Bank to acquire its Norwegian personal customer and private banking business and associated asset management portfolios on 19 July 2023. The Norwegian Competition Authority announced its approval of the acquisition on 15 December 2023. The Financial Supervisory Authority in Norway announced its approval relating to the acquisition of the personal customer and private banking business on 7 February 2024. The Financial Supervisory Authority will evaluate the acquisition of the associated asset management portfolios at a later stage. Nordea expects to close the acquisition in late 2024. At the end of 2022 the business to be transferred comprised approximately 285,000 customers, lending and deposit volumes of EUR 18bn and EUR 4bn, respectively, and approximately EUR 2bn in assets under management. The acquisition fits well into Nordea's strategy to grow in the Nordic region both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. The acquired business will be integrated into Nordea after the closing of the transaction. Any movement in the net carrying amount of assets and liabilities between the signing and the closing of the transaction will be reflected in the consideration paid at the closing. The expectation is that the transaction will improve the cost-to-income ratio and return on capital at risk of Nordea's Personal Banking business in Norway and positively impact Nordea's earnings per share and return on equity. The gross impact on the CET1 ratio resulting from the increase in the risk exposure amount is currently expected to be approximately 40bp.\n\n## Pillar 2 Global Anti-Base-Erosion tax reform\n\nIn October 2021 the OECD countries agreed to implement rules to ensure that multinational companies pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in all jurisdictions where they operate. In December 2022 the European Union member states adopted a directive to implement the Global Anti-Base-Erosion (GloBE) Rules as of 1 January 2024. The definitions of taxable income and tax expense differ between the GLoBE Rules and the local tax/accounting requirements in the jurisdictions where Nordea operates. Nordea will therefore be required to make new tax calculations based on the IFRS-adjusted result under the GLoBE Rules. If the GloBE effective tax rate ends up below 15% in any jurisdiction, Nordea will have to pay a topup tax. Statutory tax rates in the Nordics are clearly above 15% and therefore Nordea does not expect to end up in any significant top-up tax position although this remains to be confirmed. See Note 1 'Accounting policies' for more information on new disclosure requirements for the 2023 Annual Report.\n\n## Joint venture with OP Financial Group to improve payment services in Finland\n\nNordea has established a joint venture with OP Financial Group to support payment-related needs in Finland. The joint venture will develop solutions for paying with phone numbers and managing e-invoices that benefit both consumers and businesses. The solutions will be designed so as to be open to other market participants as well. Nordea and OP plan to move the existing merchant services of Siirto to Siirto Brand Oy, in which they already own equal shares, and to expand the operations of the latter. The planned changes are scheduled to be implemented in 2024, pending approval from the relevant competition authorities.",

        "page_content": "## Change in treatment of development costs related to customer-facing digital services\n\nNordea's accounting policies, based on the IFRS, require IT development costs to be capitalised when development initiatives are expected to provide benefits over a longer period of time. During the fourth quarter, as part of its ordinary impairment testing, Nordea reviewed its portfolio of current development initiatives supporting customer-facing digital services. Nordea concluded that the rapid pace of digital portfolio development, including the continuous and agile introduction of new features and implementation of new cloud-based solutions, was making it more difficult to evidence such benefits for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the bank changed its treatment of development costs related to digital services. As a result, an impairment charge of EUR 130m was recognised in the fourth quarter. The total impairment charge amounted to EUR 193m for 2023 and included individually insignificant impairments identified in the course of the ordinary impairment testing. Nordea holds EUR 1.5bn in internally developed intangible IT assets on its balance sheet where no significant impairment needs were identified during the fourth quarter and where capitalisation is currently expected to continue.\n\n## Main legal structure 1\n\nas of 1 January 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2) Held through the holding company Nordea Pension Holding Danmark A/S.\n\n- Branch - Nordea Bank Abp also operates branches in Estonia, Poland, London, New York and Shanghai.\n\n## Share buy-back programme\n\nOn 26 April 2023 Nordea's Board decided on a fourth ECB approved share buy-back programme of up to EUR 1.0bn. The programme commenced on 28 April 2023 and will end no later than 5 March 2024. The purpose of Nordea's share buy-backs is to pursue an efficient capital structure and generate sustainable shareholder returns by reducing its excess capital. Under its share buy-back programmes during 2023, Nordea acquired 121 million shares in total.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of operational and legal risks potentially resulting in reputational impacts, fines, sanctions, disputes, losses and/or litigation. This includes potential claims related to the provision of banking and investment services and other areas in which Nordea operates. Currently, such claims are mainly related to lending and insolvency situations, various investment services, and sub-custody and withholding taxation matters. At present, none of the current claims are considered likely to have any significant adverse effect on Nordea or its financial position. See Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note G6 'Provisions' for more information.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe 2024 Annual General Meeting will be held in Helsinki on Thursday 21 March 2024.

        "page_content": "## Risks and risk management\n\n## Risk management\n\nMaintaining risk awareness and proper risk management in the organisation is an integral part of Nordea's business strategies. Nordea manages risk through the three lines of defence model. The first line of defence is responsible for risk management and for compliance with the applicable rules in the day-to-day work. The second line of defence is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the implementation of Nordea's Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management Framework. The third line of defence is responsible for independent assurance and advisory activities related to the Internal Control Framework.\n\nRisk culture is an integral part of Nordea's risk management. Nordea is deeply engaged in fostering a sound risk culture by focusing on four main objectives: tone from the top, accountability, effective communications, and enforcement and incentives. Furthermore, Nordea has defined clear risk management frameworks, including policies and instructions for different risk types.\n\nThe Board has overarching risk management responsibilities and decides on the Group risk strategy supported by the Risk Appetite Framework and the Risk Appetite Statement. Moreover, the Board oversees and monitors the implementation of the risk strategy and the Risk Appetite Framework, including breaches of risk appetite.\n\nThe President and Group CEO ensures that the risk strategy and the risk management framework decided by the Board are implemented, the necessary practical measures are taken and risks are monitored within the Risk Appetite Statement established by the Board. The President and Group CEO is supported in decision-making by senior management within the Group Leadership Team, including the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer.\n\nGroup-wide committees have been established in order to drive coordination within the Group, thus ensuring commitment to and ownership of Group-wide prioritisations, decisions and implementation. The composition and areas of responsibility of each committee are established in the Group Board directives or Group CEO instructions for the respective committees.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework covers the whole Group and ensures effective and efficient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules. ESG factors are fully integrated into Nordea's risk management and control frameworks as drivers of the various financial and non-financial risks.\n\nFor further information, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 209-244.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties\n\nNordea is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These include but are not limited to\n\n- \u00b7 unfavorable economic developments and conditions in Nordea's operating markets and geographies that can adversely affect Nordea's business, financial condition and results of operations or Nordea's ability to access capital and funding markets\n\n- \u00b7 risks to Nordea's balance sheet and profitability from potential adverse commercial developments\n- \u00b7 loss due to failure of a borrowers to meet their obligations\n- \u00b7 losses stemming from Nordea's counterparties not fulfilling their contractual obligations\n- \u00b7 losses related to Nordea's positions due to changes in market rates and parameters affecting the value of financial positions and/or negative shifts in net interest income flows\n- \u00b7 losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, including legal risk\n- \u00b7 risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial, regulatory, tax and ESG reporting and disclosures\n- \u00b7 risks associated with Nordea's ability to service its cash flow obligations related to lending, investment, funding, off-balance sheet exposures and other performance activities which result in a negative cash flow mismatch, its ability to meet cash flow obligations without incurring additional funding costs\n\n\u00b7\n\nadverse effects on capital adequacy, financial loss, poor\n\nbusiness and strategic decision-making and damage to\n\nNordea's reputation from the use of models\n\n- \u00b7 unexpected actuarial losses due to changes in the level, trend or volatility of mortality rates, longevity rates, disability rates and surrender/lapse rates (insurance risk)\n- \u00b7 failure to comply with applicable regulations and related internal rules, potentially resulting in reputational impacts, fines, sanctions, disputes, losses and/or litigation\n- \u00b7 claims in civil lawsuits and disputes\n- \u00b7 ESG risks, covering transitional and physical risks related to climate, nature and social factors\n- \u00b7 cyber threats, attacks and fraud, misuse of existing and new technology against Nordea or violations or failures regarding information security in relation to Nordea's data or IT environment (cyber security risk).\n\nFor further information, see 'Non-financial statement' on pages 84-98, 'Sustainability notes' on pages 329-380, Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 209-244, Note G6 'Provisions' on page 180 and Note G7.1 'Contingent liabilities' on page 181.\n\n## Economic uncertainty\n\nThe uncertain and rapidly changing geopolitical situation related to multiple ongoing conflicts and wars and technological and environmental changes, combined with a volatile interest rate environment driven by monetary policy targeting normalised inflation levels, represents risks to the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThe impact of higher commodity prices and broader inflationary pressure could dampen consumer spending and lead to cost increases, reinforcing recessionary trends. This potential shift in business and consumer expectations could cause a deeper recession, prompting a rise in unemployment with additional price pressure in the Nordic housing market. Such macroeconomic trends could feed through to Nordea's credit portfolio resulting in losses. Furthermore, potential adverse impacts on income could arise due to financial market volatility and reduced banking activity, impacting transaction volumes and customer activity. Potential future credit risks are addressed in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 209-244.",

Heatmaps are developed at industry and geography levels, as relevant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransitional risk vulnerability\n\nIndustry names are selectively identified to illustrate the population and distribution across vulnerability bands.",

        "page_content": "## Macroeconomy and financial markets\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe world economy slowed in 2023 as policy tightening started to bite and foreign trade declined amid geopolitical tensions and increased protectionism. Global growth is estimated to have been around 3% in 2023 compared with 3.6% in 2022. Survey data point to a further slowdown in 2024. However, labour markets remain strong and inflation has come down as transport costs and commodity and energy prices have fallen sharply. This points to a soft landing for the world economy. Risks, however, remain tilted to the downside.\n\nCentral banks have tightened monetary policy aggressively to combat the high inflation. This has led to increased volatility in financial markets and heightened financial vulnerability. Monetary policy rates are expected to be at their peaks now in most advanced economies. While fiscal policy has tightened due to the phase-out of pandemic-related temporary measures, it is likely to remain supportive of the green and digital transformation of societies, just as defence expenditure will be increased markedly in many countries amid the new uncertain security situation.\n\nThe Nordic economies slowed during 2023 after some years of robust performance. The outlook remains uncertain due to high inflation, tighter financial conditions and weaker global growth.\n\n## Denmark\n\nThe Danish economy slowed in 2023 and real GDP fell by 0.7% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2023. During the year residential investment fell markedly, while exports continued higher. The labour market remained strong and employment reached new record highs. Since the peak in the autumn of 2022 both headline and core inflation have fallen. In 2023 average inflation stood at 3.3%, down from 7.7% in 2022. Real estate prices increased from the start of 2023 following a period with falling prices. However, the turnover was lower compared with previous years. At the beginning of the year Danmarks Nationalbank increased its deposit rate less than the ECB to defend the fixed exchange rate policy. The deposit rate stood at 3.60% by the end of 2023, up from 1.75% at the beginning of the year.\n\n## Finland\n\nThe Finnish economy contracted in 2023 amid headwinds from weak purchasing power, higher interest rates and a slowing construction sector. Real GDP fell by 0.9% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2023. The near-term outlook is weak, and employment has started to decline from record-high levels. The manufacturing sector's output has been relatively robust, while the flow of new orders has declined significantly. Towards the end of 2023, higher wages and inflation declining below 3% improved households' purchasing power. Average inflation stood at 4.3% in 2023. Rising interest rates have also cooled housing prices and transactions. The ECB hiked its policy rates to 4.0% in September.\n\n## Norway\n\nActivity in the Norwegian economy flattened out at a high level in 2023. Real mainland GDP increased by 0.1% quarter on quarter during the third quarter of 2023. Registered unemployment was at a low level of 1.9% in December, while employment was high. Consumer price inflation decreased, while core inflation remained high. In 2023 headline CPI inflation came in at 5.5% year on year and, excluding energy and taxes, underlying inflation stood at 6.2% year on year. Norges Bank has increased its key rate 14 times since 2021, bringing the key rate to 4.5% as of December. Housing prices moved broadly sideways during 2023. The Norwegian krone weakened broadly against most currencies in 2023 but gained ground in the last two weeks of 2023.\n\n## Sweden\n\nThe Swedish economy contracted in 2023 and real GDP fell by 0.3% quarter on quarter during the third quarter of 2023. Domestic demand fell, while exports were stable. Inflation (CPIF) fell during the course of the year and averaged 6.0% in 2023. The situation of the labour market deteriorated as job vacancies fell through the year and unemployment increased. The unemployment rate averaged 7.7% in 2023. Home prices levelled out but were down 13% in December 2023 from their peak in February 2022. The central bank hiked its policy rate from 2.5% at the beginning of the year to 4.00% in September. The central bank continued to reduce its balance sheet and started to sell its bond holdings as from April 2023. The trade-weighted Swedish krona index (KIX) strengthened by 1.9% during the course of 2023.",

Ranked by market capitalisation, Nordea was the fifth-largest company in the Nordic region and among the ten largest European financial groups.\n\nNordea's ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq Nordic, the stock exchanges in Helsinki (in euro), Stockholm (in Swedish kronor) and Copenhagen (in Danish kroner), and its American Depository Receipts are traded in the US in US dollars.\n\n## Total shareholder return 2023\n\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) is the market value growth per share and reinvested dividends. Total shareholder return in 2023 was 22% in EUR (0% in 2022). During 2023 Nordea paid out dividends of EUR 0.80 per share and bought back 121 million shares. Nordea's total shareholder distributions amounted to around EUR 4.5bn in 2023. Total shareholder return in 2021 was 75% and -8% for 2020.\n\n## Share price performance\n\nIn 2023 the Nordea share price appreciated by approximately 12% on the Nasdaq Helsinki exchange from EUR 10.03 to EUR 11.23. The daily closing prices listed for the Nordea share in 2023 ranged between EUR 9.18 and EUR 12.11. In 2023 the Nasdaq OMXH index depreciated by approximately 7% and the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index appreciated by approximately 20%. Since 6 March 2000, the date of the merger between MeritaNordbanken and Unidanmark, the Nordea share has appreciated by 177%, clearly outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index (-50%) and the Nasdaq OMXH index (-45%).\n\nNordea's share price can be monitored at nordea.com, where it is also possible to compare the performance of the Nordea share with competitors and general indices as well as find historical prices for the Nordea share.\n\n## Turnover - the most liquid Nordic bank share\n\nTurnover on all exchanges combined totalled EUR 42.9bn in 2023. 66% of the total volume traded in Nordea shares in 2023 took place over Nasdaq, of which approximately 29% was SEK-denominated, 33% EUR-denominated and 4% DKK-denominated. The remaining 34% of the traded volume took place over other exchanges such as Cboe European Equities, Turquoise and Aquis.\n\n## Total shareholder return - Nordea vs Nordic peers (indexed): Jan to Dec 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSOURCE: Thomson Reuters Datastream\n\n## Share and voting rights\n\nNordea's Articles of Association do not contain any provisions on share classes or voting rights. Consequently Nordea has one class of shares and all shares in Nordea are ordinary shares. Each share confers one vote at Nordea's general meetings as well as an equal right to any dividend. On 31 December 2023 the total number of shares in Nordea was 3,528,279,508. See also 'Statement of changes in equity' on pages 106-109.\n\nThere are no restrictions in the Articles of Association regarding the right to transfer shares and Nordea is not aware of any agreements between shareholders in this respect. However, as Nordea is a credit institution, a direct or indirect acquisition of shares in Nordea which results in the acquirer's total holdings being considered qualified holdings (representing 10% or more of the equity capital or of the voting rights, or a holding that otherwise enables the acquirer to exercise a substantial influence over the management of Nordea) or an increase in qualified holdings may only occur following approval by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority according to the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions. Under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the European Central Bank is the authority that ultimately decides (in cooperation with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority) whether to approve an acquisition of a qualifying holding in Nordea as Nordea is subject to the direct supervision of the European Central Bank.\n\nOn 31 December 2023 BlackRock was the largest individual shareholder with a holding of 5.1%. Nordea has no shareholders with holdings of more than 10%. A table showing the largest registered shareholders in Nordea as at the end of 2023 is provided on page 53.\n\nOn 31 December 2023 employees had an indirect shareholding of 0.7% in Nordea through the Nordea Profit-Sharing Foundation and a minor indirect shareholding in Nordea through the pension foundation. The voting rights are in neither case exercised directly by the employees.\n\nFor information on share-based payment plans, see Note G8 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration' on pages 183-197.\n\nNordea share price performance compared with European banks, 2000-2023, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSOURCE: Macrobond and Nordea.",

The notes will be convertible into shares at a price not exceeding a specific nominal amount applicable to the respective notes, subject to adjustments.\n\nUpon conversion of the notes into shares, Nordea's existing shareholders have preferential rights to all newly issued Nordea shares. Nordea has no convertible bonds in issue that provide holders with an option to acquire shares in Nordea.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe share capital of Nordea amounts to EUR 4,049,951,919.\n\n## Dividend paid in 2023\n\nOn 23 March 2023 Nordea's Annual General Meeting authorised the Board to decide on a dividend payment of a maximum of EUR 0.80 per share based on the annual accounts adopted for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 in accordance with the proposal of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn accordance with the mandate received from the Annual General Meeting, the Board decided on the payment of an ordinary dividend in a single instalment of EUR 0.80 per share to shareholders. The dividend was paid to shareholders who on the record date for the dividend on 27 March 2023 were recorded in the company's shareholders' register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy in Finland, Euroclear Sweden AB in Sweden and VP Securities A/S in Denmark. The dividend payment date was 3 April 2023.\n\n## Share buy-backs\n\nIn line with its capital and dividend policy, Nordea continuously assesses the opportunity to use share buy-backs as a tool to distribute excess capital. The purpose of such share\n\nbuy-backs is to pursue an efficient capital structure and generate sustainable shareholder returns for the benefit of all shareholders by reducing the capital of Nordea.\n\nOn 18 July 2022 the Board approved Nordea's third share buy-back programme of up to EUR 1.5bn, to be carried out in accordance with the authorisation granted to the Board by the 2022 Annual General Meeting. From 20 July 2022 to 16 March 2023 Nordea repurchased 150,069,276 of its own shares at an average price per share of EUR 9.99. In the third share buy-back programme, the shares were repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of Nordea's shareholders (directed repurchases) in public trading.\n\nOn 26 April 2023 the Board approved a fourth share buyback programme of up to EUR 1.0bn, to be carried out in accordance with the authorisation granted to the Board by the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The programme commenced on 28 April 2023. The shares are repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of Nordea's shareholders (directed repurchases) in public trading and the repurchases will end no later than 5 March 2024.\n\nThe total price paid for own shares acquired under Nordea's share buy-back programmes during the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (120,953,361 shares in total, corresponding to 3.3% of all shares in Nordea as at 1 January 2023) amounted to approximately EUR 1.3bn, with an average price of EUR 10.44 per share.\n\n## Share issue resolutions\n\nThe 2023 Annual General Meeting resolved that Nordea, before the end of the 2024 Annual General Meeting, may transfer own shares in the ordinary course of its securities trading business as a credit institution, with deviation from the shareholders' preemptive rights, by way of a directed share issuance. The facilitation of the company's securities trading business, in which the ability to trade also in own shares is required, is a weighty financial reason for a directed issue. The number of own shares to be transferred may not exceed 175,000,000 shares.\n\nTurnover of the Nordea share on stock exchanges, 2000-2023 1\n\nSOURCE: NASDAQ, FIDESSA, SIX FINANCIAL INFORMATION.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1)  Nasdaq exchanges from 2000.

The maximum number of shares that may be issued based on this authorisation is 350,000,000.\n\nMoreover, the 2023 Annual General Meeting authorised the Board to resolve, on one or several occasions, on the issuance of new shares or transfer of the company's own shares of not more than 30,000,000 shares in the company.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 Nordea held 9,090,189 shares, 0.3% of the total number of shares in Nordea, a decrease of 4,319,652 shares compared with 31 December 2022. Nordea holds treasury shares partly for capital optimisation and remuneration purposes and partly for trading purposes in its securities trading business. For information on share-based incentive programmes, see Note G8 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration' on pages 183-197.\n\n## Holding of own shares and share cancellations\n\nDuring 2023 an aggregated amount of 1,292,469 and 3,038 own shares held by Nordea were transferred without consideration to participants in Nordea's variable remuneration plans in April and May, respectively.\n\nDuring 2023 Nordea cancelled 126,001,788 treasury shares, which were held for capital optimisation purposes and acquired through share buy-backs.

The long-term ratings for Nordea are all at the AA level: Standard & Poor's AA- (stable outlook), Moody's Aa3 (stable outlook) and Fitch AA- (stable outlook). The shortterm ratings are at the highest level: A-1+ from S&P, P-1 from Moody's and F1+ from Fitch.\n\nThe covered bond ratings are all Aaa/AAA for the  covered bonds issued by Nordea Eiendoms kreditt AS (in Norway), Nordea Hypotek AB (publ) (in  Sweden), Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab (in Denmark) and Nordea Mortgage Bank Plc (in Finland).\n\nThe analysis from the rating agencies is in broad terms focused on credit risks and other risks, profitability, capitalisation, the strength of the business franchise as well as on the funding profile and liquidity strength. For these areas, the views on Nordea were stable or improved during the year as the view on profitability and asset quality strengthened.\n\n## External credit ratings, 31 Dec 2023\n\n|                                        | Moody's   | Moody's   | Standard & Poor's   | Standard & Poor's   | Fitch   | Fitch   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                        | Short     | Long      | Short               | Long                | Short   | Long    |\n| Nordea Bank Abp                        | P-1       | Aa3       | A-1+                | AA-                 | F1+     | AA-     |\n| Senior preferred (SP) issuances        |           | Aa3       |                     | AA-                 |         | AA      |\n| Senior non-preferred (SNP) issuances   |           | A3        |                     | A                   |         | AA-     |\n| Tier 2 (T2) issuances                  |           | Baa1      |                     | A-                  |         | A       |\n| Additional Tier 1 (AT1) issuances      |           |           |                     | BBB                 |         | BBB+    |\n| Nordea Eiendomskreditt AS 1            |           | Aaa 1     |                     |                     |         |         |\n| Nordea Hypotek AB (publ) 1             |           | Aaa 1     |                     |                     |         |         |\n| Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab 1 |           |           |                     | AAA 1               |         |         |\n| Nordea Mortgage Bank Plc 1             |           | Aaa 1     |                     |                     |         |         |\n\n- 1)  Covered bond rating.",

        "page_content": "## Capital management and new regulations\n\nNordea strives to be efficient in its use of capital and therefore actively manages its balance sheet with respect to different asset, liability and risk categories. The goal is to enhance returns to shareholders while maintaining a prudent capital structure. The Board decides ultimately on the targets for capital ratios, the capital and dividend policies and the overall framework of capital management at Nordea. The ability to meet targets to maintain minimum capital requirements is reviewed regularly by the Asset & Liability Committee and the Risk Committee.\n\n## Capital and dividend policy\n\nNordea maintains a strong capital position in line with its capital  policy.  Nordea now targets a management buffer of 150bp above the CET1 requirement. This is a change compared to the previous policy and is supported by Nordea's strong capital generation. It also enables efficient capital management, while Nordea still maintains a prudent buffer to requirements.\n\nThe dividend policy is to distribute 60-70% of the net profit for the year to shareholders. Excess capital in relation to capital targets will be used for organic growth and strategic business acquisitions as well as be subject to buy-back considerations.\n\nOn 26 April 2023 the Board of Directors approved a new share buy-back programme of up to EUR 1.0bn. The programme commenced on 28 April 2023 and will end no later than 5 March 2024. Since the start of the first buy-back programme in 2021, approximately 520 million shares have been bought back for a total value of EUR 5.3 billion.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements\n\nThe calculation method for the risk exposure amount (REA) is subject to regulatory approval. Nordea had 89% of its credit risk exposure amount covered by the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach by the end of 2023. Nordea is approved to use its own internal value-at-risk (VaR) models to calculate capital requirements for the major portion of the market risk in its trading book. For operational risk, the standardised approach is applied. Based on the total REA, Nordea needs to meet the applicable minimum and combined buffer requirements. In addition, competent authorities require Nordea to hold capital for other risks which are identified and communicated as part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.\n\nNordea received the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process decision on 30 November 2023 which maintains the Pillar 2 requirement (P2R) at 1.60% as decided last year. The P2R must be met with at least 56.25% of CET1 capital.\n\n## Internal capital requirement\n\nFor internal risk and capital assessment purposes, Nordea uses the internal capital requirement (ICR) in line with Article 73 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The ICR specifies the amount, type and distribution of internal capital considered adequate to cover the nature and level of all risks to which the Group or any of its subsidiaries are or might become exposed over a foreseeable future, including during periods of stress.\n\nThe ICR is one of the main inputs for the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process together with regulatory views on the required amount of capital as expressed under the regulatory perspective.\n\nNordea defines the ICR as the internal capital requirement for all material risks from an internal economic perspective, taking account of the regulatory, normative and through- thecycle perspective, adequate to withstand periods of stress. This ensures that Nordea's ICR is aligned with, but not restricted by, the regulatory perspective.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital is a method to allocate capital held by Nordea to its business areas and is a central component in the Value Creation Framework. The framework supports the operational decision-making process at Nordea to enhance performance management and ensure shareholder value creation.\n\nThe economic capital aligns to the Group's target CET1 ratio, which is set by the capital policy to ensure sustainable longterm capitalisation for the Nordea Group. In addition, the economic capital framework includes the following items: (a) equity contribution of the insurance business\n\n(b)  certain capital deductions.\n\nThe economic capital was EUR 21.9bn at the end of 2023 (EUR 23.2bn at the end of 2022). The decrease was mainly driven by reduced credit risk.\n\n## Own funds\n\nOwn funds are the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of both Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Additional Tier 1 capital. CET1 capital is considered to be capital of the highest quality with ultimate loss-absorbance characteristics and consists predominately of paid-in capital and retained earnings. Profit may only be included after permission from the European Central Bank and after deducting the proposed dividend. Additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital consist mostly of undated and dated subordinated loans, respectively. Holdings of other financial sector entities' subordinated loans are deducted from the corresponding tier.\n\n## Further information - capital adequacy and the Capital and Risk Management Report\n\nFurther information on capital management and capital adequacy is presented in the Capital and Risk Management Report. On the basis of its consolidated situation, Nordea provides Capital and Risk Management Report disclosures quarterly according to Part Eight of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR). The disclosures constitute a comprehensive disclosure of risks, risk management and capital management. It includes disclosures, or references to other disclosures, required according to Part Eight of the CRR and by the EBA guidelines and standards on disclosure requirements.\n\nAccompanying the Capital and Risk Management Report are the required disclosures for the subsidiaries Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab, Nordea Hypotek AB, Nordea Mortgage Bank Plc and Nordea Eiendomskreditt AS.\n\nThe Capital and Risk Management Report is available at nordea.com. The subsidiaries' disclosures are included as appendices and are published on the same website after the publication date of each subsidiary's annual report.\n\n## Country-by-country reporting\n\nFurther information on country-by-country reporting in accordance with the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions is presented on page 372.",

        "page_content": "## New regulations on capital requirements\n\nThis section highlights recent news and updates on regulatory developments and capital requirements, mainly related to the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). In general, it addresses news deemed relevant from a Nordea Group perspective. For additional details on new regulations and capital requirements, see Nordea's Capital and Risk Management Report (Pillar 3).\n\nOn 27 June 2022 the Finnish FSA decided to increase the other systemically important institutions (O-SII) buffer for Nordea to 2.5% from the previous 2.0%. The change took effect on 1 January 2023.\n\nDue to the financial impact of COVID-19, the countercyclical buffer rates were decreased in Sweden, Denmark and Norway. During 2022 and 2023 the countercyclical buffers in the Nordic countries started to increase again. In Norway, it was decided to increase the buffer rate from 1.0% to 1.5% from June 2022 and from 1.5% to 2.0% from 31 December 2022. From 31 March 2023 it was increased to 2.5%. In Denmark, the buffer rate was increased from 0% to 1.0% from September 2022 and then to 2.0% from 31 December 2022. From 31 March 2023 it was increased to 2.5%. In Sweden, the buffer rate was increased from 0% to 1.0% from September 2022 and to 2.0% from 30 June 2023. In Finland, the buffer rate remains at 0%.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023 the Finnish FSA concluded that the sector's macroprudential buffers were below the assessed structural risks after the reduction in buffer requirements due to COVID-19. As a result, on 29 March 2023 the Finnish FSA decided to impose a requirement on Finnish credit institutions to maintain a systemic risk buffer (SyRB) of 1.0%. The decision on the SyRB is applicable to Nordea and will enter into force on 1 April 2024 after a transitional period.\n\nIn May 2023 Nordea received the Single Resolution Board's decision on the updated minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) for the Nordea Group. The MREL requirements are 23.30% of the risk exposure amount (REA) plus the combined buffer requirement (CBR) and 7.19% of the leverage ratio exposure (LRE). The subordination requirements are 20.66% of the REA plus the CBR and 7.19% of the LRE. The Single Resolution Board assesses and updates the requirements annually.\n\nOn 28 June 2023 the Finnish FSA decided to approve a partial reciprocation of the Norwegian SyRB requirement at a level of 3.5% (full Norwegian measure: 4.5%) to be applied to Norwegian exposures from 1 July 2024.\n\nOn 27 September the Finnish FSA decided to reciprocate the risk weight floors for corporate credit exposures secured by real estate collateral set by the Swedish FSA in accordance with Article 458 of the CRR. The risk weight floor is set at 35% for corporate exposures secured by commercial real estate and at 25% for corporate exposures secured by residential real estate. The floors have applied since 30 September and are not constraining for Nordea.\n\nOn 3 October the Systemic Risk Council in Denmark announced that the Council had recommended to the Minis-\n\nter for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs to activate a SyRB of 7% for exposures to real estate companies applicable from 30 June 2024. However, the buffer needs to be decided by the Minister and approved by the European Commission before it comes into force in Denmark and furthermore be reciprocated by the Finnish FSA before applicable to the Nordea Group.\n\nOn 19 December the Finnish FSA decided to maintain the reciprocation of the Swedish risk weight floor on residential real estate of 25% until 30 December 2025.\n\n## Finalisation of Basel III framework ('Basel IV')\n\nBasel III is a global regulatory framework for bank capital adequacy, stress testing and liquidity risk. In December 2017 the finalised Basel III framework, often called Basel IV, was published. Basel IV entered into force from 2023 and includes revisions to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and the leverage ratio and also introduces a new output floor.\n\nBefore being applicable to Nordea, Basel IV needs to be implemented into the EU regulatory framework, which is achieved by amending the CRR and the CRD. The first version of the new regulation was published by the European Commission on 27 October 2021. Compared with the original Basel IV standard, the Commission proposed to set the start date to 1 January 2025 in the EU. During 2022 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament agreed on counterproposals to the Commission's proposal after which negotiations started in the so-called trilogue to agree on the final set of rules implementing Basel IV into EU regulation.\n\nOn 26 June 2023 a provisional agreement was reached between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament and on 7 December 2023 the Council formally adopted the agreement. The final implementation is still pending technical work on the amendment to the CRD and the CRR as well as formal adoption by the Parliament. Final publication in the Official Journal is expected in the first half of 2024.\n\nFor credit risk, the new regulations include revisions to both the IRB approach, where restrictions on the use of the IRB approach for certain exposures are implemented, and the standardised approach. For market risk, the internal model approach and the standardised approach are revised. For operational risk, the three existing approaches will be replaced by one standardised approach to be used by all banks. For CVA risk, the internally modelled approach can no longer be applied and the standardised approach is revised.\n\nFurthermore, the new regulatory framework introduces an output floor of 72.5% of the standardised approaches on an aggregate level. This means that the capital requirement under the floor will be 72.5% of the total Pillar 1 REA calculated using the standardised approaches for credit, market and operational risk. The floor will be phased in, starting with 50% from 1 January 2025 to be fully implemented at 72.5% from 1 January 2030. For the calculation of the REA for the output floor, there are transitional rules until end-2032.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Statement 2023\n\nCorporate governance refers to relations between a company's senior management, its board of directors, its shareholders and other stakeholders, such as employees and their representatives. It also determines the structure used to define a company's objectives as well as the means of achieving them and of monitoring the results obtained. Strong corporate governance is thus about having clear and systematic decision-making processes, providing clarity about responsibilities, avoiding conflicts of interest and ensuring satisfactory internal control, risk management, transparency and accountability.\n\nNordea Bank Abp (the Company or Nordea) is a Finnish public limited liability company and the parent company of the Nordea Group (comprising the Company and its subsidiaries). Nordea's shares are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchanges in Helsinki, Stockholm and Copenhagen, and its American Depository Receipts (ADR) are traded in the US in US dollars. As part of its funding operations Nordea issues long-term debt instruments that are usually listed on various stock exchanges.\n\nNordea is subject to and applies the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 (the 'Code'). All the recommendations of the Code are complied with, apart from the appointment procedure for the Employee Elected Board members (the Code, Recommendation 5), as described further below.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Statement describes Nordea's approach to the key elements of corporate governance and is prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Securities Market Act, the Decree of the Ministry of Finance on the obligation of securities issuers to disclose periodic information and the Code 1 .\n\nNordea's Corporate Governance Statement is available at nordea.com and the Code is available at https://cgfinland.fi/ en/corporate-governance-code/.\n\n## Corporate Governance structure\n\nThe corporate governance of Nordea is comprehensive and proportionate with respect to the nature, scope and diversity of the Company's operations to ensure effective management in accordance with the prudent conduct of business principles.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the administration and appropriate organisation of the Company's operations, while the President and Group CEO is responsible for the executive management of the Company. The main emphasis is on the Board undertaking its role in Nordea's corporate governance structure and the interaction with the other governing bodies to ensure sound corporate governance, including systems for internal control and risk management regarding financial reporting.\n\n- 1)   Nordea complies with the Code of its domicile as well as other applicable governance rules and regulations, and this Corporate Governance Statement is prepared in accordance with these requirements. The Code deviates in certain aspects from the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the 'Swedish Code') available at corporategovernanceboard.se and the Danish Recommendations on Corporate Governance (the 'Danish Code') available at corporategovernance.dk due to differences in legislation and corporate governance rules and practices. Nordea deviates from the Swedish Code in terms of decision proposals of the nomination committee, independence of the Board Remuneration and People Committee members and by having the possibility of holding virtual shareholder meetings. With regards to the Danish Code, Nordea deviates in certain aspects from the Code in terms of the appointment of an audit committee chair, management remuneration and performance evaluation of the board of directors as well as recommendations regarding takeover bids, corporate social responsibility and tax policy. Nordea also deviates in certain aspects regarding the overall tasks and responsibilities of the board of directors, with respect to the company's purpose, value creation as well as share and capital structure and the annual review of guidelines for the executive management. Nordea further deviates in certain aspects regarding the composition of the board of directors and disclosure about individual board members in the management commentary.\n\n## Corporate governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNumbers in brackets refer to the numbered sections below from pages 61-75.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal framework\n\nArticles of Association, the Group Board and Group Board  Committee charters, the mandate of the President and Group CEO and Nordea's   Internal Control Framework, including Group internal rules, Risk  Management Framework, risk culture and strategy",

        "page_content": "Corporate Governance Statement 2023, cont.\n\nCorporate governance and the duties of the governing bodies of Nordea are defined by the applicable internal and external frameworks. The external framework that regulates corporate governance includes EU law, such as Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV), Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (MiFIR), as well as rules and guidelines issued by the relevant financial supervisory authorities, such as the EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance and the Joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders, as well as national level laws, including the Finnish Companies Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Accounting Act and the relevant FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines. Nordea also complies with rules and guidelines issued by other relevant financial supervisory authorities as well as EU legislation for the financial industry, stock exchange rules for each relevant stock exchange and the rules and principles of the Code.\n\nThe Board has adopted instructions for the President and Group CEO specifying the responsibilities of this role as well as other charters, policies and instructions for the operations of the Nordea Group. Furthermore, Nordea's Code of Conduct provides an ethical framework for the conduct of all members of governing bodies and employees. These mechanisms, together with the Articles of Association, the Charter (as defined below) and the Committee Charters (as defined below), as well as applicable directives, instructions and policies of the Nordea Group constitute the internal framework that regulates corporate governance at Nordea.\n\nThe internal framework is designed to enable the prudent conduct of business by defining the powers and responsibilities of the corporate bodies and employees. For more information on the directives, instructions and policies in the internal framework, see 'Sustainability notes' on pages 329-380 .\n\n## ECB supervision and governance\n\nNordea is supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Single Supervisory Mechanism/SSM), and the branches and subsidiaries are supervised by the financial supervisory authorities in their respective countries, as applicable. Under ECB supervision, Nordea is subject to the same banking supervision and single resolution mechanisms as the majority of other European banks in the eurozone. The authority interaction function at Nordea is placed in Group Legal, which acts as the single point of contact and the coordinator for supervisory requests and interactions, to enable coordinated and consistent communcation between Nordea and its supervisors. Nordea uses standardised practices to process supervisory requests and on-site inspections, including a case management system where all interactions are documented. The Group Leadership Team (GLT) and the relevant committees receive authority interaction reports on a regular basis. The Board is informed about key authority interactions, including supervisory review and evaluation process decisions and on-site inspection reports. Furthermore, the Board oversees key supervisory remediation programmes and approves the remediation action plans required by the ECB.\n\n## ESG governance\n\nThe Board has a leading role in approving the sustainability strategy and is assisted by its committees in fulfilling its environmental, social and governance ('ESG') oversight responsibility. At management level, the ESG area is organisationally\n\nintegrated into the existing processes for decision-making, risk management and control as well as escalation, including management committee structures. The first line of defence is responsible for managing sustainability and financial impacts, while the second line of defence is responsible for developing the ESG-related risk management framework.\n\nThe Nordea Chief of Staff is accountable for overseeing and facilitating the Group-wide integration of ESG factors into the Risk Management Framework and business processes. The relevant policy framework owner in the second line of defence is responsible for ensuring that requirements are reflected in Nordea's Sustainability and ESG Policy Framework and for overseeing their consistent cascading to the subsidiary strategy, risk and control frameworks. Additionally, the Chief of Staff is accountable for the development of the Group's strategic sustainability priorities and analysis of emerging topics, ensuring that Nordea's sustainability agenda remains aligned with the business environment developments, such as geopolitical and regulatory trends, and Nordea's long-term net zero commitment.\n\nNordea considers ESG factors to be significant potential drivers of credit, market, liquidity, capital, compliance and operational risks. The principle of embedding ESG factors in Nordea's risk management and business strategy is based on the importance of each ESG factor as a driver of these financial and non-financial risks. For each risk area framework, progress to embed ESG factors as risk drivers was made during 2023 with key risk indicators and, if relevant, risk appetite limits quantified, set, monitored and reported. The Chief of Staff is responsible for Nordea's ESG implementation programme and co-chairs its operational steering committee together with the Head of Credit Risk in the second line of defence. The programme monitors the integration of ESG implementation programme and development activities, aiming to ensure an efficient and consistent implementation of sustainability targets and objectives as well as ESG-related risk management frameworks across key processes, risk assessments, reporting and regulatory compliance. The programme integrates and provides ESG data to ensure transparent and consistent use across key processes and disclosures. For more information on ESG governance at Nordea, see 'Non-financial statement' on pages 84-98 and 'Sustainability notes' on pages 329-380 .\n\n## Division of powers and responsibilities\n\nThe management and control of Nordea is divided among the shareholders (at general meetings), the Board and the President and Group CEO, pursuant to the provisions of the external framework, the Articles of Association and the internal framework set forth by the Board.\n\n## General meetings of shareholders (1)\n\nThe general meeting is the Company's highest decision-making body, at which shareholders participate in the supervision and control of the Company through their voting rights and right to speak. Applicable regulations and the Articles of Association of the Company determine the matters to be dealt with at a general meeting. At the general meeting, decisions are taken regarding matters such as the financial statements, dividend, election of Board members and auditor as well as remuneration for Board members and the auditor. In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies are presented and adopted through an advisory vote at the general meeting.

General meetings are usually held in Helsinki. The 2023 Annual General Meeting was held on 23 March 2023 at the Messukeskus Helsinki, Expo and Convention Centre.\n\nThe 2023 Annual General Meeting approved an amendment to the Articles of Association enabling general meetings also to be held without a meeting venue, so-called virtual meetings, as an alternative to physical or hybrid meetings. Information on the decisions of the 2023 Annual General Meeting and the minutes are available at nordea.com. The 2024 Annual General Meeting will be held at Scandic Marina Congress Center on Thursday 21 March 2024.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nNordea's Articles of Association do not contain any provisions on share classes or voting rights. Consequently, all shares issued are ordinary shares and carry equal voting rights, with each share carrying one vote at general meetings. At general meetings, each shareholder is entitled to vote according to the full number of shares they hold or represent. Nordea is not entitled to vote on its own shares at general meetings under applicable legislation. More information about the Nordea share is presented in 'The Nordea share and external credit ratings' on pages 51-54 and in 'Financial review 2023' on pages 40-41.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles of Association are available at nordea.com. Amendments to the Articles of Association are determined by the general meeting pursuant to Finnish law and are subject to the review of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board (2)\n\nPursuant to the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, a significant credit institution must have a nomination committee that consists of board members or a shareholders' nomination board that consists of members appointed by the shareholders. The Annual General Meeting held in 2019 decided to establish a permanent Shareholders' Nomination Board. According to its Charter, the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to prepare, annually and otherwise when appropriate, proposals for the Annual General Meeting for the election of and remuneration for the Chair and members of the Board and present the proposals to the Annual General Meeting. The Shareholders' Nomination Board must also participate in the evaluation and succession planning of the Board and in its work consider the diversity policy of Nordea as well as perform certain other tasks assigned in its Charter.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board consists of the Chair of the Board of Directors and the four largest shareholders who on 31 August represent the largest number of voting rights in the company and wish to participate in the work of the Nomination Board.\n\nThe composition of the Shareholders' Nomination Board was made public on 29 September 2023. Cevian Capital had appointed Niko Pakal\u00e9n, Nordea-fonden had appointed Lars Ingemann Nielsen, Alecta had appointed Daniel Kristiansson and Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company had appointed Timo Sallinen as members of the Shareholders' Nomination Board. Niko Pakal\u00e9n had been appointed Chair of the Shareholders' Nomination Board. On 31 August 2023 the appointed members of the Shareholders' Nomination Board represented approximately 12% of all shares in the Company.\n\n## Succession planning and process for proposing Board members for election by the Annual General Meeting\n\nIn order to ensure orderly Board member succession, the Shareholders' Nomination Board works with a succession pipeline on an ongoing basis consisting of prospective Board member candidates, taking into account the skills needed on the Board as a whole and on the various committees of the Board.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board evaluates the recruitment needs and, if needed, starts the process for proposing new Board members. To allow for seamless and orderly succession planning throughout the year, the Shareholders' Nomination Board may continue its work after it has prepared the proposal for the coming Annual General Meeting until the new Shareholders' Nomination Board has been appointed. The Shareholders' Nomination Board can employ, at Nordea's expense, a recruitment consultant and other external resources needed for the Shareholders' Nomination Board to perform its duties.\n\nAs part of the evaluation of recruitment needs, the Chair of the Board provides input on the competencies and skills needed on the Board and identified potential competencies and skill gaps. The Shareholders' Nomination Board is also presented with the results of the Board's annual self-evaluation and suitability assessment.\n\nThe process for proposing new Board members normally starts with the Shareholders' Nomination Board deciding on a shortlist of prospective candidates. The profiles and qualifications of these prospective candidates are assessed and interviews with the candidates are arranged. As part of the process, the President and Group CEO may be offered the possibility to give views on needed Board member skills and profiles and to meet with the Board candidates.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board proposals on the number of Board members and on the election of the Chair of the Board and the members of the Board to the Annual General Meeting are published in a stock exchange release and on Nordea's website. The proposals must be made in such time that they can be included in the notice of the Annual General Meeting. The proposals are presented at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nPrior to the 2024 Annual General Meeting, the Shareholders' Nomination Board, constituted in the autumn of 2023, held five meetings. Each member participated in all the meetings and decision-making of the Shareholders' Nomination Board apart from the Chair of the Board, who did not participate in the preparation or decision-making where he had a conflict of interest.\n\n## Members of the Shareholders' Nomination Board Niko Pakal\u00e9n, Chair of the Shareholders' Nomination Board\n\nMaster of Science (Economics)\n\nBorn 1986\n\nPartner, Cevian Capital\n\n## Lars Ingemann Nielsen\n\nMaster of Science (Mathematical Finance and Economics) Born 1961\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Nordea-fonden\n\n## Daniel Kristiansson\n\nMaster of Science (Business Administration) Born 1974\n\nGovernance and Stewardship Specialist, Alecta",

The term of office for Board members is one year and expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting following the election. Nordea does not have a specific retirement age for Board members nor a specific time limit for how long a Board member may serve on the Board. In its work, the Shareholders' Nomination Board considers both the need for continuity and for retaining adequate experience on the Board as well as the need for gradual refreshment of knowledge and experience on the Board. According to the Code, if a Board member has served as a member for more than ten consecutive years, this must be taken into consideration when conducting the overall evaluation of independence. Furthermore, applicable European regulatory requirements of the banking sector are taken into account in the evaluation.\n\nThe Board has adopted a diversity policy that establishes the principles of diversity. According to the diversity policy, all Board member nominations must be based on merit with the prime consideration being to maintain and enhance the Board's overall effectiveness. Within this, a broad set of qualities and competencies is sought for and it is recognised that diversity, including age, gender 1 , geographical provenance and educational and professional background, is an important factor to take into consideration. Nordea's objective is to have a fair, equal and balanced representation of gender and other diversifying factors on the Board collectively. With regard to gender balance, the Board's composition is aimed to be aligned with the Nordea Group's ambition of each gender to have at least 40% representation.\n\nThe composition of the Board must reflect the requirements of Nordea's operations and development stage. A Board member must have the competencies required by the position and the possibility to devote sufficient time to attend to the Board duties. The number of Board members and the composition of the Board must be such that they enable the Board to undertake its duties efficiently.\n\nTo support meeting the above requirements and objectives, the Shareholders' Nomination Board strives to ensure\n\nthat the Board as a collective forms a fair, equal and balanced representation of gender and other diversifying factors, including: i) the Board's composition being aligned with Nordea's Diversity Policy, ii) the Board having members representing each of Nordea's operating countries in the Nordics: Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, iii) an educational and professional background, and iv) age diversity.\n\nThe Board conducts a self-evaluation process annually, through which the performance and the work of the Board are evaluated for the purpose of continuously improving the Board's work and efficiency. The evaluation is based on methodology that includes questionnaires to evaluate the Board as a whole, the Chair and the individual Board members. The result of the self-evaluation process is further discussed by the Board and presented to the Shareholders' Nomination Board by the Chair of the Board.\n\nIn accordance with applicable European regulatory requirements, a suitability assessment of the individual Board members and of the Board as a whole is completed annually and in connection with the selection process for new Board members. The annual suitability assessment of 2023 concluded that the Board members individually and collectively possess the requisite knowledge of and experience in the social, business and cultural conditions of the regions and markets in which the main activities of Nordea and the Nordea Group are carried out, exhibiting adequate diversity and breadth of qualities and competencies, and that the gender distribution is well-balanced.\n\n## Board training\n\nTo enable a good understanding of Nordea's organisation and structure, business model, risk profile and governance arrangements, new Board members participate in a tailor-made induction programme, covering areas related to Nordea's governance, business strategy, financials and risk management. Board members may at any time ask for further training on a specific subject and are continuously provided with opportunities to maintain and deepen their knowledge.\n\nIn addition, the Board members receive annual training based on their individual and collective needs as well as regulatory and supervisory requirements. The annual training plan is designed to cover the key risk areas of Nordea and ensure up-to-date knowledge of identified relevant knowledge areas. The training activities also take into account the results of the annual self-evaluation and suitability assessments of the Board as well as input on identified training needs from senior management.\n\nIn 2023 the Board received approximately 20 hours of training as part of the annual training plan, requested ad hoc training and strategy sessions in line with industry best practice. As part of the annual training plan, the Board received training in several key areas, including data governance and data privacy, information security, capital, liquidity and funding, market and model risk, reputational risk, ESG topics, business continuity, remuneration and people matters as well as compliance and governance topics.\n\n## Work of the Board\n\nThe Board elects the Vice Chair and appoints the members of the Board committees. The Board has adopted written working procedures governing its work, which also describe the management and risk reporting to the Board (the Charter), and separate working procedures for the work carried out by each of the Board committees (the Committee Charters). For example, the Charter determines the Board's and the Chair's respective areas of responsibility, documentation and quorum",

It also contains rules regarding conflicts of interest, confidentiality and the Board Secretary.\n\nThe Board is charged with the organisation of Nordea, the administration of the Company's operations and the overall management of the Nordea Group's affairs in accordance with the external and internal frameworks and its Charter. The Board must ensure that Nordea's legal and organisational structure is appropriate and transparent with a clear allocation of functions and areas of responsibility that ensures sound and effective governance, avoids the creation of complex structures and enables supervisors to conduct efficient supervision.\n\nThe Board regularly follows up on Nordea's strategy, business development as well as the Company's financial position and performance. Furthermore, the Board regularly updates the policies and internal rules on governance and control on which it has decided. The Board also reviews the risk appetite and regularly follows up on relevant risks, capital and liquidity.\n\nSignificant organisational changes, certain senior management appointments as well as mergers and acquisitions and other resolutions of significance are other matters dealt with by the Board. For example, in 2023 the Board approved the Nordea Group strategy, monitored and analysed the macroeconomic and geopolitical developments as well as handled matters related to sustainability, digitalisation, cyber defence, internal control and compliance, financial crime, M&A, share buy-backs and dividends. The Board must also ensure that the Company's organisation in respect of accounting, management of funds and the Company's financial position in general includes satisfactory controls. The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that an adequate and effective system of internal control is established and maintained. Group Internal Audit annually provides the Board with an assessment of the overall effectiveness of governance and the risk and control framework, together with an analysis of themes and trends emerging from internal audit work and their impact on the organisation's risk profile.  Further information regarding internal control at Nordea is provided on page 75 under 'Internal Control Framework'.\n\nThe Board regularly meets the external auditor. In addition, the auditor in charge regularly attends the meetings of the Board Audit Committee.\n\nIn 2023 the Board of the Company held 12 meetings, 3 of which were held per capsulam. For more information, see the table on page 70.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nBoard members must be able to commit sufficient time to perform their duties and comply with the rules on the limitation on the number of directorships. The acceptable number of directorships is subject to both the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions and market expectations. Based on the regulatory requirements and market expectations, reflected for example in the policies of proxy advisers and institutional investors, a Board member, including the position on the Nordea Board, may\n\n- 1.  hold a maximum of one (1) executive directorship and two (2) non-executive directorships, or four (4) non-executive directorships, unless the ECB has granted an exemption which may be sought on a case-by-case basis\n\n- 2.  subject to fulfilling the requirements under item 1 above, hold no more than five (5) mandates in publicly listed companies, where a non-executive directorship counts as one (1) mandate, a non-executive chair position counts as two (2) mandates and a position as executive director (or a comparable role) is counted as three (3) mandates\n- 3.  regardless of the above, not hold the position of an executive director (or a comparable role) in a publicly listed company and of a non-executive chair in another publicly listed company.\n\nThere are certain exceptions to the requirements above, for example directorships held within the same group of undertakings and in entities with predominantly non-commercial objectives.\n\nThe Board consists of 13 ordinary members and 1 deputy member. Of these Board members, 10 (6 men and 4 women) were elected by the Annual General Meeting held on 23 March 2023. The Board members elected by the 2023 Annual General Meeting are Sir Stephen Hester (Chair), Lene Skole (Vice Chair), Petra van Hoeken, John Maltby, Risto Murto, Birger Steen, Per Str\u00f6mberg, Jonas Synnergren, Arja Talma and Kjersti Wiklund. Additionally,  Torbj\u00f6rn Magnusson and Robin Lawther were members of the Board until the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn addition to the Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting, 3 ordinary members and 1 deputy member are elected by the employees of the Nordea Group. The Employee Elected Board members until the end of the 2024 Annual General Meeting are Gerhard Olsson, Hans Christian Riise, Joanna Koskinen (deputy member) and Kasper Skovgaard Pedersen (replaced Dorrit Groth Brandt in September 2023). The election procedure for the Employee Elected Board members deviates from Recommendation 5 'Election of the Board of Directors' of the Code. The reason for this deviation is an agreement on employee representation entered into by Nordea and an employee representation body under the Finnish Act on Employee Involvement in European Companies and European Social Cooperatives as well as the Finnish Act on Personnel Representation in the Company Administration in connection with the cross-border merger effectuating the redomiciliation to Finland in 2018.\n\nThe President and Group CEO of Nordea is not a member of the Board. The composition of the Board is set out on page 63, and further information regarding the Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting and the Employee Elected Board members is presented in the sections 'Board of Directors' and 'Employee Elected Board members' on pages 66-67.\n\n## Board shareholdings\n\nIn 2023 the Board of Nordea adopted a shareholding recommendation for Board members whereby the shareholding of a Board member should correspond to a minimum of 33% of the member's total annual fees. The recommendation aligns the Board members' interests with the long-term interests of the shareholders in an appropriate and balanced manner. For more information, see the Board shareholdings on pages 66-67.",

Under the Code, the majority of the board members must be independent of the company, and at least two board members who are independent of the company must also be independent of the significant shareholders of the company. The Board meets this requirement.\n\nThe Board considers all its members to be independent of the Company's significant shareholders and all the members elected by the shareholders at the 2023 Annual General Meeting to be independent of the Company in accordance with the Code 1 .

The duties of the Board committees, as well as working procedures, are defined in the Committee Charters. In general, the Board committees do not have autonomous decision-making powers and each committee regularly reports on its work to the Board. Nordea follows the legal requirements and complies with the Code in terms of Board committees.\n\n## Board Audit Committee (4)\n\nThe Board Audit Committee (BAC) assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, for instance by monitoring the Nordea Group's financial reporting process and system and by providing recommendations or proposals to ensure their reliability (including the efficiency of the internal control and risk management system), by monitoring the effectiveness of Group Internal Audit, by keeping itself informed as to the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts, and by reviewing and monitoring the impartiality and independence of the external auditors, including the offering of services other than auditing services by the auditors, by preparing a recommendation of appointment of the Company's auditor and by reviewing the Group's tax strategy and tax policy as well as by taking care of the responsibilities of the audit committee pursuant to applicable legal requirements. The BAC also assists the Board in monitoring and assessing how related party transactions meet the requirements of ordinary activities and are at arm's length terms. The committee also reviews the external auditor's report on Nordea's sustainability reporting and associated disclosures as well as the integrity, independence and effectiveness of the whistleblowing mechanism Raise Your Concern.\n\nFurther information is presented in the section 'Principles for related party transactions' on page 77.\n\nMembers of the BAC are John Maltby (Chair), Petra van Hoeken, Lene Skole and Arja Talma.

Under the Internal Control Framework, all business areas, Group functions and units are responsible for managing the risks they incur when conducting their activities and responsible for having controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of the Internal Control Framework, Nordea has established Group control functions with appropriate and sufficient authority, independence and access to the Group Board to fulfil their mission in line with the Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework ensures effective and efficient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nThe internal control process is carried out by the governing bodies, management, risk management functions and other staff at Nordea. The internal control process is based on five main components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication as well as monitoring. The internal control process aims to create the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisation to contribute to the effectiveness and high quality of internal controls through, for instance, clear definitions, assignment of roles and responsibilities and common tools and procedures.\n\n## Group Risk (9)\n\nGroup Risk is an independent risk function structured to carry out risk monitoring and control in line with Nordea's Internal Control Framework. As part of the second line of defence, Group Risk is responsible, in cooperation with Group Compliance, for maintaining the Risk Management Framework as part of the Internal Control Framework and for monitoring the implementation of the policies and procedures within this framework. The risk function oversees the implementation of the financial and the non-financial risk policies and, according to a risk-based approach, monitors and controls the Risk Management Framework and must, among other things, ensure that all risks to which Nordea is or could become exposed are identified, assessed, monitored, managed and reported. The risk function is headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who is also a member of the GLT, and reports to the President and Group CEO. The CRO is appointed, suspended and dismissed by decision of the Board after prior consultation with the President and Group CEO. The CRO regularly reports to the Board Risk Committee (BRIC) and the Board on the Nordea Group's risk exposure.\n\n## Group Compliance (10)\n\nGroup Compliance is an independent second line of defence control function responsible for monitoring and overseeing the compliance risks that Nordea is or could be exposed to. Group Compliance is also responsible for developing and maintaining the Compliance Risk Management Framework, which ensures effective and efficient identification and management of compliance risks in accordance with regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. The compliance risk management lifecycle covers key compliance processes for risk identification, independent risk assessment, oversight planning, testing and monitoring, training, advice and reporting.\n\nThe compliance function is headed by the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), who is also a member of the Group Leadership Team. The CCO is appointed, suspended and dismissed by decision of the Board after prior consultation with the President and Group CEO. The CCO regularly reports to the Group Board, the Group CEO, the BRIC and other relevant committees.\n\n## Group Internal Audit (11)\n\nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) is an independent function commissioned by the Board. The Board Audit Committee (BAC) is responsible for guidance on and evaluation of GIA within the Nordea Group. The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) has the overall responsibility for GIA. The CAE reports on a functional basis to the Board and the BAC and reports on an administrative basis to the President and Group CEO. The Board approves the appointment and dismissal of the CAE.\n\nThe purpose of GIA is to support the Board and the GLT in protecting the assets, reputation and sustainability of the organisation. GIA does this by assessing whether all significant risks are identified and appropriately reported by management and the risk functions to the Board, its committees and the GLT, by assessing whether all significant risks are adequately controlled and by challenging the GLT to improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls. GIA does not engage in consulting activities unless approved by the BAC. Consulting activities are the range of services, beyond assurance services, performed specifically at the request of management for a pre-defined scope and provided to assist management in meeting its objectives.\n\nAll activities and entities of the Group fall within the scope of GIA. GIA makes a risk-based decision as to which areas within its scope should be included in the audit plan approved by the Board. GIA must operate free from interference in determining the scope of internal auditing, in performing its audit work and in communicating its results. This means for example that GIA, via the CAE, is authorised to inform the financial supervisory authorities of any matter without further approval. The CAE has unrestricted access to the President and Group CEO and the Chair of the BAC and should meet with the Chair of the BAC throughout the year, including without the presence of executive management. GIA is authorised to conduct all investigations and obtain all information required to discharge its duties. This includes the right to sufficient and timely access to the organisation's records, systems, premises and staff. GIA has the right to attend and observe the meetings of the Board committees, the GLT, overall committees and forums for the Nordea Group and other key management decision-making forums when relevant and necessary.\n\n## External audit (12)\n\nAccording to the Articles of Association, the auditor of the Company must be an audit firm with the auditor in charge being an authorised public accountant. The term of office of the auditor expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting following the election. The current auditor of the Company is PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy. Jukka Paunonen, Authorised Public Accountant, has been the auditor in charge since the 2023 Annual General Meeting. Further information about the fees paid for audit services and non-audit services is presented in Note G2.7 'Other expenses' on pages 124-125.\n\n## Report on internal control and risk management regarding financial reporting\n\nThe systems for internal control and risk management of financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance about the reliability of financial reporting and the",

The internal control and risk management activities are included in Nordea's planning and resource allocation processes. Internal control and risk management of financial reporting at Nordea are described below.\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe control environment consists of Nordea's internal controls and centres around the culture and values, established by the Board and the GLT, and the organisational structure with clear roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe primary governance principle is the adherence to the three lines of defence model, which provides the foundation for a crucial clear division of roles and responsibilities in the organisation.\n\nThe first line of defence is responsible for the ongoing risk management and for compliance with applicable rules. Risk owners in the business areas and Group functions are responsible for risk management activities. The Group CFO defines standards that apply to relevant controls Group-wide. Appropriate controls are accordingly implemented, maintained and monitored within significant processes.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisk assessment in relation to reliable financial reporting involves the identification and assessment of risks of material misstatements or deficiencies. Financial reporting risk is defined as the risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting, regulatory reporting, disclosures, tax reporting and reporting of environment, social and governance information.\n\nRisk management is considered to be an integral part of running the business and the main responsibility for performing risk assessments regarding financial reporting risks lies with the business organisation. Performing risk assessments close to the business increases the possibility of identifying the most relevant risks. In order to govern the quality, control functions stipulate in governing documents when and how these assessments are to be performed. Examples of risk assessments are the recurring Risk and Control Self-Assessments and the event-driven Change Risk Management and Approval process.\n\n## Control activities\n\nThe scope of the control framework for financial reporting risk is designed to focus on areas where risk of material financial misstatements could exist, i.e. where the judgement of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the misstated item.\n\nBusiness areas and Group functions are primarily responsible for managing risks associated with the units' operations and financial reporting processes. Group internal rules stipulate how Nordea's operations and organisation are governed and managed (including compliance with regulatory requirements), such as the Group Accounting Manual, Group CEO Instructions on Financial Control and the Group Accountable Executive Protocol - Financial Reporting Risk. The Group Accounting Manual holds information on the accounting policies to be used in the Group and contains detailed reporting instructions and tools needed for producing the financial statements.\n\nThe control structure for financial reporting risk is based on one or a group of controls which are identified as principal\n\ncontrols that may be relied on to prevent, detect or mitigate high and critical financial reporting risks. This involves the identification and assessment of risks of financial reporting misstatements or deficiencies based on end-to-end process flows. A parallel analysis is performed to determine which systems are relied on in financial reporting and the corresponding IT general controls.\n\nThe quality assurance achieved through the management reporting process, where a detailed analysis of the financial outcome is performed, constitutes an important control mechanism associated with the reporting process.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nGroup Finance is responsible for ensuring compliant reporting in relation to accounting standards and applicable regulations and that changes are communicated to the responsible units. These are supported by detailed guidelines and standard operating procedures in the responsible units.\n\nManagement at different levels in the organisation is provided with information related to the performance, self assessment, testing and peer review of the identified internal controls in their processes.\n\nNordea interacts with relevant subject matter experts externally to keep up to date with changes in reporting expectations and ensure fulfilment of financial reporting objectives. Nordea actively participates in relevant national and international forums, such as those established by the financial supervisory authorities, central banks and associations for financial institutions.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nNordea has established a process for regular monitoring of risk metrics, as measures of risk exposure, with the purpose of ensuring proper monitoring of the quality of the financial reporting. The Group CFO reports on the management of financial reporting risk to the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\n\nAn independent risk control function resides in the second line of defence and is responsible for identifying, controlling and reporting on financial reporting risk. In addition, GIA provides the Board with an assessment of the overall effectiveness of the governance, risk management and control processes throughout the organisation, including financial reporting.\n\nThe Board, the BAC, the BRIC, the BOSC, Group Risk, Group Compliance and GIA have important roles in respect to governance and oversight of the internal control of financial reporting at the Nordea Group. For further information, see 'Board of Directors (3)', 'Board Audit Committee (4)', 'Board Risk Committee (5)', 'Board Operations and Sustainability Committee (7)', 'Group Risk (9)', 'Group Compliance (10)' and 'Group Internal Audit (11)' on the previous pages.\n\n## Disclosures and insider administration\n\nThe objective and key principles followed in Nordea's investor communications and the publication of financial reporting are described in Nordea's Disclosure Policy. The Disclosure Policy also describes the disclosure, dissemination and storage of the information within the scope of the disclosure obligation as prescribed by rules and regulations. The Disclosure Policy has been approved by the Board and is available on nordea.com.\n\nInsider administration is organised in accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation No 596/2014 (MAR) and supplementing legislation as well as applicable national level laws and guidance from financial supervisory authorities.

All persons identified and registered as insiders are notified of their insider status and the restrictions and obligations that apply to them, including the prohibition against dealing in the financial instrument(s) to which the inside information relates until that information is made public or otherwise no longer deemed to be inside information and the insider register is closed.\n\nThe responsibilities of Nordea's insider administration also include (i) training and providing information to employees who are exposed to inside information to make sure that they are aware of the restrictions and obligations that apply to them as insiders, (ii) setting up and maintaining insider registers and (iii) monitoring compliance with the insider rules.\n\nThe rules are put in place to mitigate the risk of insider dealing and other forms of market abuse, and the overall responsibility for making sure that a high level of knowledge of and compliance with these rules is maintained lies with Group Compliance.\n\nThe Company has identified the members of the Board and the GLT as well as the Chief Audit Executive as persons discharging managerial responsibilities (as defined by MAR) who, along with persons closely associated with them, are required to notify the Company and the relevant financial supervisory authority of any transaction in financial instruments issued by Nordea, executed on their account or on their behalf. The Company discloses such reported transactions to the market through stock exchange releases. In addition to this reporting duty, persons discharging managerial responsibilities are prohibited from trading in financial instruments issued by Nordea during a period of 30 calendar days prior to (and including) the date of the publication of a Nordea Group interim financial report, half-year report or year-end report and whenever such persons are in possession of inside information regarding Nordea.\n\nFor employees who participate in providing investment services or advice to customers, the Company also applies Group-wide internal trading restrictions and transaction reporting obligations that are based on the trading rules established by, among others, Finance Finland, the Swedish Securities Markets Association and the Swedish Investment Fund Association. Furthermore, in the capacity of a company licensed to provide investment services and as a fund management company, the Company and its subsidiary Nordea Funds Ltd, respectively, maintain insider registers of persons who are classified as 'public insiders' pursuant to the Finnish Act on Investment Services and the Finnish Act on Mutual Funds. The holdings of securities listed in Finland of such persons are public information and uploaded to the public insider register kept by Euroclear Finland Ltd. The register of holders of units in funds managed by Nordea Funds Ltd is also available for viewing at Nordea Funds Ltd.\n\n## Principles for related party transactions\n\nApplicable laws and regulations set requirements for the monitoring and assessment of as well as the decision-making concerning related party transactions and the disclosure of executed related party transactions.\n\nGenerally, the Company's transactions with its related parties are part of the Company's ordinary course of business and carried out according to the same criteria and terms as\n\nthose of comparable transactions with other parties of similar standing. The decision-making processes have furthermore been structured in order to avoid conflicts of interest and to comply with the statutory decision-making requirements.\n\nThe Company has defined its related parties in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and keeps an up-todate record of its related parties. Relevant internal stake holders, such as customer responsible units, other relevant business units and Group functions, are informed of the list of related parties and the related restrictions in order to monitor transactions with such parties.\n\nNordea is also bound by applicable close circle rules and has processes in place for identifying the persons belonging to the close circle of Nordea and for ensuring that any credits and comparable financing granted to such persons as well as any investments in an entity belonging to the close circle are granted in accordance with applicable laws and rules. Pursuant to the Company's Conflict of Interest Policy, employees, management and the members of the Board must not handle matters on behalf of Nordea in cases where they or a closely associated person or company may have an interest that conflicts with the interests of Nordea or its customers. Nordea's business areas and Group functions are obliged to identify, prevent and manage actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring proper processes for the identification, reporting and supervision of related party transactions as well as the proper decision-making in this respect. The BAC must assist the Board in monitoring and assessing how related party transactions meet the requirements of ordinary activities and the arm's length terms.\n\nRelated party transactions that are not part of the Company's ordinary course of business or are made in deviation from customary commercial terms require a decision by the Board for the related party transaction to be carried out, unless otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations. In respect of such related party transactions the Board must ensure that:\n\n- (i)   the relevant transactions have been appropriately identified, reported, and controlled\n- (ii)   the Conflict of Interest Policy has been carefully considered in the preparation and decision-making process and\n- (iii)   the preparation of related party transactions includes adequate reports, statements and/or assessments.\n\nFurthermore, Nordea publicly discloses its related party transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration\n\nNordea has a clear remuneration policy as well as clear remuneration instructions and processes, supporting sound remuneration structures throughout the organisation.\n\n## Aim of Nordea's Remuneration Policy\n\nNordea's Remuneration Policy (internally referred to as the Group Board Directive on Remuneration):\n\n- \u00b7 supports Nordea's ability to recruit, develop and retain highly motivated, competent and performance-oriented employees and hence support the Group strategy\n- \u00b7 ensures that employees are offered a competitive and market-aligned total reward offering\n- \u00b7 supports sustainable results and the long-term interests of shareholders by including goals directly linked to the performance of Nordea and by awarding parts of variable remuneration in shares or other instruments\n- \u00b7 ensures that remuneration at Nordea is aligned with efficient risk management, the Nordea purpose and values and applicable regulations.\n\nNordea has a total remuneration approach to compensation that recognises the importance of well-balanced but differentiated remuneration structures based on business and local market needs as well as the importance of having remuneration that is consistent with and promotes sound and effective risk management and that does not encourage excessive risktaking or counteract Nordea's long-term interests.\n\nThe link between performance, risk and variable remuneration in Nordea's remuneration components is assessed annually to ensure business relevance, that all risks are addressed appropriately and compliance with applicable international and local regulations. This includes non-financial risks related to operational risks, compliance risks, reputational risks and specific remuneration-related risks. Most remuneration-related risks concern variable remuneration which, if not appropriately considered, could lead to excessive risk-taking. Risks are addressed through regular reviews of remuneration structures as well as individual remuneration components, participants in variable remuneration plans and the size of potential awards and by disclosing relevant information.\n\n## Decision-making process for the Remuneration Policy\n\nNordea's Remuneration Policy sets out principles for remuneration within the Nordea Group, including how the policy is to be applied, remuneration governance and risk management as well as how employees with a material impact on Nordea's risk profile ('material risk takers') are defined.\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors decides on the Remuneration Policy, taking possible risks into account, and oversees its functionality by ensuring that it is applied and followed up as proposed by the Board Remuneration and People Committee (BRPC).\n- \u00b7 In addition to Nordea's internal Remuneration Policy, Nordea's shareholders adopted, through an advisory vote, the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, which applies to the remuneration to the Board of Directors, the Group CEO and the Deputy Managing Director and will remain in force until the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe BRPC is responsible for preparing and presenting proposals to the Board of Directors on remuneration issues, considering the adopted Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies, including proposals for Nordea's Remuneration Policy and supplementary instructions. These preparations include an assessment of the Remuneration Policy and the remuneration system. Appropriate control functions participate in this process and provide input within their area of expertise to ensure that the Remuneration Policy is up to date and compliant.\n\nFurthermore, in collaboration with the Board Risk Committee, the BRPC performs assessments to ensure that Nordea's remuneration systems properly account for all types of risks, that liquidity and capital levels are consistent and that the remuneration systems promote sound and effective risk management.\n\nMoreover, the remit of the BRPC also includes supporting the Board of Directors in considering the Group Board Diversity Policy and Statement as well as monitoring the impact of diversity and inclusion policies and practices within Nordea and in reviewing and assessing talent management.\n\nThe BRPC also reviews succession plans for and the performance of the members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and the Chief Audit Executive, reviews the structure and composition as well as the selection criteria and process for the GLT and advises on proposed GLT appointments.\n\nMore information about the composition of the BRPC and its responsibilities is provided in a separate section of 'Corporate Governance Statement 2023' on pages 60-65.\n\n## Alignment with business strategy\n\nNordea has processes to align business and individual goaland target-setting across Nordea with the overall strategy and predefined risk-adjusted criteria.\n\nFinancial and non-financial goals are based on the business's expectations and forecasts, and stretched targets are approved by the Board of Directors to ensure alignment with shareholders' and Nordea's strategic priorities and sustainability and climate objectives. Hence, the main Group performance goals and targets in variable remuneration for the Nordea Group in 2023 were the financial goals: return on equity, income and cost-to-income ratio and non-financial goals relating to customer satisfaction and employee engagement. Nordea has also included ESG goals in the Long Term Incentive Plan for 2023-2025 applicable to the GLT and approximately 50 senior leaders. Further to the integration of ESG goals applicable to remuneration for the GLT and other senior leaders across the Nordea Group, Nordea integrated ESG goals in the variable pay plans applicable to the wider workforce in 2023. The integration of ESG goals into the variable pay plans supports Nordea in fulfilling its sustainability and climate objectives in three key areas: 1) to make progress in relation to Nordea's sustainability implementation plan, 2) to increase the volume of green financing and 3) to improve the gender balance at senior leadership levels.\n\nWhen assessing performance against the predetermined set of well-defined goals and targets, Nordea applies an",

Individual performance is assessed not only on 'what' is delivered but also 'how' it is delivered. A key aspect is performance in relation to specific risk, compliance and conduct targets as well as general compliance and risk conduct, which must be appropriately considered when determining variable remuneration awards.\n\nTo guarantee fair and objective remuneration decisions and to support sound governance, all individual remuneration decisions are subject to separate processes and approved in line with the grandparent principle (approval by the leader's leader).\n\n## Supporting sound risk management\n\nNordea performs an ongoing risk assessment of remuneration risks conducted within the framework of the Risk Committee' and the non-financial risk forums of each business area and Group functions. In addition, an assessment of the Group taxonomy risks is performed as part of the people risk assessment process, the risk and control self-assessment and the compliance independent risk assessment.\n\nNordea also mitigates relevant risks by means of its Internal Control Framework, which is based on the control environment and includes the following elements: values and management culture, goal orientation and follow-up, a clear and transparent organisational structure, three lines of defence, the four eyes principle, the quality and efficiency of internal communication and an independent assessment process.\n\nThe following principles are further examples of how sound risk management is supported:\n\n- \u00b7 Applying a Group variable remuneration funding mechanism which considers prudential and appropriate risk adjustments when setting a Group pool for each performance year.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that the Board of Directors approves the total outcome of variable remuneration before award, which allows for adjustments in outcome if deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors, e.g. considering risk limits.\n- \u00b7 There is an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Relevant control functions provide input on the setting of a Group variable remuneration pool, performance goals and the outcome of such, to ensure that the impact on staff behaviour and the risks of business undertaken are addressed.\n- \u00b7 The effect on long-term results is considered when determining goals and targets for variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 No employee at Nordea can earn variable remuneration exceeding 200% of their annual fixed remuneration. The maximum ratio between fixed and variable remuneration for material risk takers was 200% in 2023 in accordance with the 2019 AGM's decision. In practice, however, a ratio between the fixed and the variable remuneration above 100% of the annual fixed remuneration only applies to a very limited number of employees as the outcome of Nordea's variable remuneration plans is capped at certain levels.\n- \u00b7 The risks set out in Nordea's Risk Appetite Statement are linked to forfeiture conditions (ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustments) to ensure that breaches of risk limits influence variable remuneration awards.\n- \u00b7 Payments related to early termination of employment should reflect performance achieved over time and should be designed to not reward failure or misconduct.\n- \u00b7 Employees engaged in control functions are compensated independently of the performance of the business unit(s) they control and predominantly through fixed remuneration.\n\n## Principles for deferral of variable remuneration awards and awards in instruments\n\nNordea ensures that a substantial part of variable remuneration for material risk takers is deferred and afterwards retained over an appropriate period in line with regulatory requirements. This means that 40-60% of variable remuneration awards are deferred for four to five years, with vesting and subsequent disbursement over the deferral period on a pro rata basis.\n\nThe first disbursement of deferred variable remuneration can take place one year into the deferral period at the earliest.\n\nDeviations may occur subject to local regulations. For material risk takers and certain other categories of staff, 50% of variable remuneration awards (both deferred and non-deferred amounts) are awarded in instruments (as a main rule in Nordea shares, alternatively instruments linked to Nordea's share price) and subject to a post-vesting 12-month retention period. Dividends are excluded from any shares or other instruments during a deferral period.\n\n## Risk adjustments, malus and clawback provisions\n\nThe Risk and Remuneration Alignment Committee (RRAC) supports the management of remuneration risk by providing governance and oversight of risk-adjusted remuneration assessments of relevant Nordea employees in the first line of defence. The work of the RRAC is intended to strengthen personal accountability and develop a consistent approach to risk-adjusted remuneration assessments, through a fair and transparent process, carried out on the basis of clear criteria.\n\nPayment of variable remuneration awards under Nordea's main variable remuneration plans is based on an assessment of the results of the Nordea Group, the concerned Nordea entity, the relevant business unit and the individual employee. Awards may be reduced, in part or in full, if an employee eligible for variable remuneration has for example violated internal or external regulations, participated in or been responsible for an action that has caused Nordea significant losses or in the event of a significant downturn in Nordea's or the relevant business unit's financial results.\n\nEmployees must not use personal hedging strategies to undermine or eliminate the effects of deferred variable remuneration being partly or fully cancelled.\n\n## Audit of Nordea's Remuneration Policy\n\nThe BRPC follows up on the application of the Remuneration Policy and supplementary instructions within Nordea through an independent review by Group Internal Audit. This audit is conducted at least annually.\n\n## Remuneration to the Board of Directors\n\nBy proposal of the Shareholders' Nomination Board and in accordance with the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies, the AGM annually decides on the remuneration to the Board of Directors. In 2023 remuneration was offered in cash to the Board members. Board members are not part of any variable or incentive plan. Remuneration for Board work is not paid to Board members who are employees of the Nordea Group.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration to the CEO and the members of the Group Leadership Team\n\nBy proposal of the BRPC, the Board decides on the remuneration for the CEO and the members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT), considering the adopted Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies. Remuneration for the Chief Audit Executive is also approved by the Board of Directors even though the Chief Audit Executive is not a member of the GLT. This includes a decision on fixed and variable remuneration as well as pension and other employment terms and conditions.\n\nNordea maintains a competitive and market-aligned total reward offering and other employment conditions needed to recruit, motivate and retain the CEO and the members of the GLT and through their leadership, expertise and strategic decision-making to enable Nordea to deliver on its strategy and targets. A key concept is pay-for-performance.\n\nRemuneration for the CEO and members of the GLT in 2023 was decided by the Board of Directors considering the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies and in accordance with Nordea's internal policies and procedures, which are based on the applicable regulations on remuneration systems and other relevant regulations and guidelines.\n\nSalaries and other remuneration in line with market levels constitute the overriding principle for the remuneration for the CEO and the members of the GLT at Nordea. The remuneration for the CEO and the members of the GLT will be consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management and not encourage excessive risk-taking or counteract Nordea's long-term interests.\n\nAnnual remuneration consists of fixed salary, benefits, variable remuneration (short- and long-term), pension and insurances.\n\nFurther information about remuneration to the CEO and the members of the GLT is provided in Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration' on pages 193-197. A more detailed disclosure of remuneration to the CEO and how the Remuneration Policy for Governing Bodies is applied is provided in Nordea's 2023 Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies.\n\n## Variable remuneration to the members of the Group Leadership Team\n\nIn 2023 variable remuneration for the members of the GLT was offered as participation in a short-term incentive plan called Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP 2023). There were no material changes to the structure. Furthermore, the members of the GLT who are not responsible for independent control functions were offered participation in a long-term fully share-based incentive plan called Long Term Incentive Plan 2023-2025 (LTIP 2023-2025), similar to the LTIPs allocated since 2020.\n\nThe Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP 2023) for GLT members has a one-year performance period and includes predetermined performance goals and targets at Group, business area/Group function and individual level. The impact on long-term results was considered when determining the targets.\n\nThe outcome of the NIP 2023 is been based on the Board of Directors' assessment of performance against the predetermined targets, and as described above.\n\nThe outcome of the NIP 2023 is paid to GLT members in equal portions of cash and Nordea shares and is subject to forfeiture clauses (through ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or clawback). 40% of the confirmed outcome of the NIP 2023 is delivered in equal portions of cash and Nordea shares in 2024. The remaining 60% of the NIP 2023\n\noutcome is deferred for annual pro rata delivery over a fiveyear period, meaning that a significant portion of the outcome remains to be delivered at the time of the award. No dividends are paid during the deferral period. Nordea shares are subject to 12 months' retention when delivered to the GLT members. The maximum outcome of the NIP 2023 for GLT members participating in the LTIP 2023-2025 is 75% of the annual fixed base salary.\n\nPerformance goals at Group level included financial goals measuring return on equity, income and cost-to-income ratio as well as non-financial goals measuring employee engagement and customer satisfaction. ESG performance goals support Nordea in fulfilling sustainability and climate objectives in three key areas: 1)to make progress in relation to Nordea's sustainability implementation plan, 2) to increase the volume of green financing and 3) to improve the gender balance at senior leadership levels. Business area/Group function goals included business area-/Group function-specific financial and non-financial goals. At individual level, performance was measured in relation to the individually agreed risk, compliance and conduct targets. The weighting of Group, business area/Group function and individual goals is determined individually for the CEO, reflecting his overall responsibility for the Nordea Group, as well as for the members heading a business area or a Group function. The overall ambition for 2023 was to deliver on Nordea's strategic priorities. Any awards were determined on the basis of achievement in relation to the agreed goals and targets following appropriate risk adjustments.\n\n## Long Term Incentive Plan 2023-2025\n\nIn 2023 the Board of Directors decided to continue the long term incentive plan by launching the LTIP 2023-2025 for the GLT and approximately 50 senior leaders and key employees whose efforts have a direct impact on Nordea's results, profitability, customer vision and long-term growth.\n\nThe main purpose of the LTIP 2023-2025 is to further align the GLT members' and senior leaders' interests with those of shareholders. The LTIP 2023-2025 has a three-year performance period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025 and subsequent deferral and retention according to regulations.\n\nThe total maximum number of shares that can be granted under the LTIP 2023-2025 was nominally allocated to the participants in 2023 as conditional share awards. In 2026 after the end of the performance period, based on Nordea's performance against pre-established performance criteria, the maximum number of shares or a proportion of the shares will be awarded individually to the participants.\n\nThe first portion of shares of the potential award will be delivered in 2026. The rest of the shares will be deferred and delivered annually in five equal portions during 2027-2031. Each share delivery is subject to a 12-month retention period.\n\nShare grants may be reduced in part or in full subject to risk and compliance adjustments. The LTIP 2023-2025 performance requirements have been set so that the maximum outcome will require achieving exceptional performance from a shareholder perspective. The assessment of performance during the performance period will be based on the following performance criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 total shareholder return measured in absolute terms and relative to selected Nordic peer banks (40%).\n- \u00b7 absolute cumulative adjusted earnings per share (absolute EPS) (40%).\n- \u00b7 ESG scorecard comprising measures relating to sustainable financing, net zero committed assets under management, gender balance and credit profile (20%).",

The levels of these benefits are determined by what is considered fair in relation to general market practice. Fixed salary during the period of notice and severance pay will not exceed 24 months of fixed salary in total.\n\nPension and insurance are offered to ensure an appropriate standard of living after retirement as well as personal insurance coverage during employment. The Group CEO and the members of the GLT are offered pension benefits in accordance with market practice in their country of permanent residence. Pension and insurance provisions are in accordance with local laws, regulations and market practice. Pension is generally offered as defined contribution pension plans but can also be offered by means of a pension allowance. Discretionary pension benefits are not used.\n\n## Nordea's remuneration structures\n\nNordea's remuneration structures comprise fixed remuneration and variable remuneration.\n\n## Fixed remuneration components\n\nFixed base salary should remunerate for role and position and is affected by job complexity, responsibility, performance and local market conditions.\n\nAllowance is a predetermined fixed remuneration component tied to the employee's role and position. The fixed base salary is, however, the cornerstone of all fixed remuneration. Allowances are not linked to performance and do not incentivise risk-taking.\n\nPension and insurance aim at ensuring an appropriate standard of living for employees after retirement as well as personal insurance coverage during employment. Pension and insurance provisions are in accordance with local laws, regulations and market practice and are either collectively agreed schemes or company-determined schemes or a combination. Nordea aims to have defined contribution pension schemes.\n\nBenefits at Nordea are awarded as part of the total reward offering that is either individually agreed or based on local laws, market practice, collective bargaining agreements and company-determined practice.\n\n## Nordea's variable remuneration plans for others than the Group CEO and the Group Leadership Team\n\nNordea has, as of 2020, implemented a Group variable remuneration pool model to determine variable remuneration spend at Nordea, except for the Profit Sharing Plan and Nordea's LTIP. The Group variable remuneration pool creates\n\na strong link between Nordea's overall performance and the allocated variable remuneration.\n\nThe Group variable remuneration pool determines the overall variable remuneration for the respective performance years based on a target/expected pool adjusted by Group performance, which is subsequently distributed to business areas/Group functions based on their performance (scorecards). The final allocation is based on individual performance according to the goals set individually under the individual variable remuneration plans.\n\nBesides the Long Term Incentive Plan 2023-2025 only offered to select senior leaders as described above, the following variable remuneration plans were offered to Nordea employees in 2023:\n\nThe Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP) is offered to recruit, motivate and retain senior leaders (including GLT members, see above) and select roles primarily in business areas where the use of variable pay is an established market practice. The NIP aims to reward strong performance and efforts. The assessment of individual performance is based on a predetermined set of well-defined financial as well as non-financial goals. Individual NIP awards will not exceed the annual fixed salary. Awards from the NIP 2023 for people who are defined as material risk takers are allocated partly in cash and partly in instruments with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for participants in the NIP who are material risk takers are subject to a four- to five-year pro rata deferral period, in certain exceptions three years, with forfeiture conditions (ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or clawback) during the deferral period.\n\nBonus schemes are offered only to selected groups of employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board of Directors, e.g. in Large Corporates & Institutions, Nordea Asset Management, Nordea Funds and Group Treasury. The aim is to ensure strong performance and to maintain cost flexibility for Nordea. Individual awards are determined based on detailed performance assessments covering a range of financial and non-financial goals. 2023 bonus awards from bonus schemes are paid in cash. For material risk takers, awards are partly delivered in instruments with subsequent retention. Parts of the awards for material risk takers and certain other participants in a bonus scheme are subject to a four - to five-year pro rata deferral period, in certain exceptions three years, with forfeiture conditions (ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or clawback) during the deferral period.\n\nRecognition Scheme is offered to employees to recognise extraordinary performance. The individual performance is assessed based on a predetermined set of goals. Employees eligible for other formal annual variable remuneration plans, excluding the Profit Sharing Plan, are not eligible for Recognition Scheme awards. The scheme includes forfeiture conditions (ex-post risk adjustments applying either malus or clawback).\n\nProfit Sharing Plan (PSP) is offered Group-wide to all Nordea employees but not to employees who are eligible for any of Nordea's other formal annual variable remuneration plans. For eligible employees, the Profit Sharing Plan is offered irrespective of position and salary and aims to collectively reward employees based on achievement in relation to predetermined financial goals as well as goals relating to customer satisfaction and ESG. The Profit Sharing Plan is capped",

Sign-on can only be paid if Nordea and the employing company have a sound and strong capital base.\n\n## Compensation for contracts in previous employments\n\n(buy-outs) can be offered in exceptional cases only, in the context of hiring new staff, limited to the first year of employment and if Nordea and the employing company have a sound and strong capital base.\n\nRetention bonus can be offered in exceptional cases only if Nordea has a legitimate interest in retaining employees for a predetermined period of time or until a certain event occurs and if Nordea and the employing company have a sound and strong capital base.\n\n## Other qualitative and quantitative information The actual cost of variable remuneration for executive officers (excluding social costs)\n\nFor the NIP 2023 for GLT members, EUR 5.8m will be paid over a five-year period, partly in shares and partly in cash. The estimated maximum cost of the NIP for GLT members in 2024 is EUR 7.0m and the estimated cost assuming 50% fulfilment of the performance goals is EUR 3.5m.\n\n## Cost of variable remuneration for non-Group Leadership Team members (excluding social costs)\n\nThe actual cost of the NIP and the bonus for 2023 is EUR 187m, not including awards to GLT members, which is paid partly now in cash and partly over a four- to five-year period as outlined in the sections above. In 2023 the provision for Nordea's Profit Sharing Plan 2023 was EUR 69m. Each employee can receive a maximum of EUR 3,200. If all stretched performance goals were met, the cost of the Profit Sharing Plan for eligible participants in 2023 would have amounted to a maximum of approximately EUR 75m.\n\n## Other disclosures\n\nSee Note G8 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration' on pages 183-197 of the Annual Report 2023 for more details on remuneration.\n\nSee also Nordea's 2023 Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies, which will be presented for an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2024. The Remuneration Report is disclosed with other required information at nordea.com/en/about-nordea/corporate-governance/ remuneration.\n\nNordea will provide qualitative and quantitative disclosures according to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 (the CRR Regulations), the disclosure requirements in the Basel framework and the EBA guidelines for sound remuneration practices.\n\nFurther disclosures will be published at nordea.com one week before the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Conflicts of interest policy\n\nAs an international financial services provider, Nordea and its subsidiaries regularly face potential or actual conflict of interest situations. Managing conflicts of interest is relevant at both the individual and institutional level of Nordea's organisation. Nordea is committed to promoting market integrity and all employees are required to act in a fair, honest and professional manner and in the best interests of Nordea's customers. In order to act on these commitments and ensure appropriate governance of Nordea, it is essential to have effective controls in place regarding conflicts of interest.\n\nThe purpose of Nordea's Conflicts of Interest Policy (the 'Policy') is to outline Nordea's approach to managing conflicts of interest and to enable the development and maintenance of an effective control environment.\n\nThe Policy applies to all employees and people working on behalf of Nordea, senior management, Board members and the President and Group CEO of Nordea. The Policy also applies to all branches and subsidiaries.\n\nBoth actual and potential conflicts of interest must be identified and effective measures decided upon to prevent or manage risks in respect of Nordea or its customers. Conflicts of interest arising with regard to an employee's private interest or their past or present personal or professional relationships are individual conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest that do not arise from a private interest but in connection\n\nwith Nordea's organisation, Group structure, governance, different activities, roles, products, services or any other circumstances are institutional conflicts of interest. In connection with each identified conflict of interest, the potential customer impact is assessed to ensure fair treatment of customers.\n\nAppropriate preventive or mitigating measures must be implemented in the form of effective organisational and administrative measures for all identified potential or actual conflicts of interest. Identified conflicts of interest are documented in a register.\n\nAll identified individual conflicts of interest or changed circumstances regarding them must be reported to the leader of the individual employee involved. All identified institutional conflicts of interest or changed circumstances regarding an institutional conflict of interest must be reported to the leader responsible for the area that the conflict of interest potentially impacts. Senior management will receive recurring, at least annual, reporting on conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Group Board approves the Policy and is responsible for overseeing its implementation. To ensure objective and impartial decision-making, Group Board members are also subject to the requirements of the Policy. The President and Group CEO and the Group Leadership Team members are accountable for implementing the Policy at Nordea while also being subject to the requirements of the Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Non-financial statement\n\n## This report constitutes Nordea's non-financial statement for the financial year 2023. The report covers the parent company Nordea Bank Abp and its subsidiaries.\n\nIn 2023 Nordea was present in 20 countries, including its four Nordic home markets - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Through its four business areas - Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates & Institutions and Asset & Wealth Management - Nordea offers a wide range of products and services. As a financial institution, Nordea's business model is to create value for its customers, investors, employees, shareholders and society in general. For a sustainable business model to succeed, value cannot only be measured in monetary terms but must encompass environmental and societal responsibility, employee-related matters, anti-corruption measures and respect for human rights.\n\n## Material sustainability topics and targets\n\nAs a member of the core group of founding banks and a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking, Nordea is committed to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Nordea has developed a long-term plan to fully integrate sustainability into its business strategy, focusing on the sustainability topics on which Nordea can have a material impact, by either reducing its negative impact or increasing its positive impact. The identified material topics are grouped into four strategic pillars: financial strength, climate and environmental action, social responsibility, and governance and culture. Nordea has set 2023-2025 targets for all of the strategic pillars. Additionally for the pillar climate and environmental action, Nordea has set a long-term objective to become a net-zero emissions bank by 2050 at the latest.\n\n## Financial strength\n\nUnderstanding and managing environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities is crucial to maintaining Nordea's financial strength and strong capital position. Therefore Nordea integrates ESG factors into risk management processes for both lending and investment portfolios as well as develops and supplies financial products supporting sustainable practices. Nordea manages the ESG-related risks so that the financial strength and position is well supported and the ability to raise funding is maintained. Financial strength is therefore fundamental to Nordea's sustainability strategy and the commitment to service customers.\n\n## ESG-related risk strategy and management\n\nNordea considers that ESG factors can be significant drivers of credit, market, liquidity, compliance or operational risks. Embedding ESG factors in Nordea's risk management and business strategy reflects the importance of each factor as a driver of existing risks.\n\n## ESG-related risks impact our customers and balance sheet\n\nAs a key principle of effective risk management, Nordea maintains a diversified lending portfolio, distributed between corporate and household customers and diversified across geographies, industries and products. For all impacted credit risk categories, existing processes are progressively being enhanced to identify, evaluate and monitor material ESGrelated risks.\n\nFor corporate borrowers, in summary, ESG assessments are performed according to the size and type of the transaction and the customer's internal segmentation. ESG-related risks identified qualitatively as material at customer level provide input to the credit risk assessment at customer group level. For on-balance sheet investments, ESG and impact principles have already been incorporated into the framework for longterm illiquid asset investments, and ESG factors are progressively applied to assess them as drivers of market and liquidity risk categories and the associated portfolios. For more information about ESG-related risks, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on pages 209-213.\n\n## Integrating ESG-related risks into investment decisions\n\nNordea recognises ESG-related risks as a material risk category for assets under management. ESG-related risk considerations are integrated into Nordea's investment decision-making framework as part of the overall risk assessment and considered together with the traditional investment risks (e.g. market, credit or liquidity risk). The identification, evaluation and consideration of ESG-related risks in the investment decision-making process is done in accordance with the characteristics of the investment strategy and may result in a range of actions, including but not limited to: not investing, divesting, engaging or excluding. For more information about ESG-related risks in investment decisions, see Note S2 'Financial strength' on pages 333-336.\n\n## ESG-related opportunities\n\nNordea is well placed to accelerate its customers' and investee companies' transition to a sustainable future due to its experience with sustainability-linked and green lending, ESG-focused investment products as well as active ownership. Sustainable finance solutions are tailored to align with customers' sustainability objectives and material ESG factors while still adhering to Nordea's sector policies. Since 2022 Nordea has helped to facilitate EUR 135bn of sustainable financing, which means Nordea is on track to reach its 2025 objective to facilitate more than EUR 200bn in sustainable financing.\n\nNordea Sustainable Selection (previously Sustainable Choice) is Nordea's framework for assessing and selecting investment products based on Nordea's rigorous ESG criteria. By the end of 2023 the share of gross flows into Nordea Sustainable Selection reached 22%. For more information about ESG-related opportunities, see pages 335-338 in the Sustainability notes.\n\n## Active engagement\n\nEngagements with customers and investee companies are a key enabler to address material sustainability risks and opportunities. In 2023 Nordea engaged with 1,179 companies on environmental and social issues. This corresponds to 52% of the total number of equity assets under management in Nordea Asset Management portfolios. Additionally, Nordea voted at around 3,700 general meetings and achieved a voting frequency of over 95% for its holdings during 2023.",

        "page_content": "Non-financial statement, cont.\n\n## Climate and environment\n\nNordea's objectives are to achieve net-zero emissions by the end of 2050 at the latest and to reduce carbon emissions across its lending and investment portfolios by 40-50% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019. Between 2019 and 2023 emissions from the lending portfolio financed emissions scope decreased by 29%. Each business area has individual climate-related targets and actions for 2023 and 2025, and the progress on these is reported quarterly to the Group Leadership Team and the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee. For more information about the climate agenda, objectives, targets and outcomes, see pages 341-357 in the Sustainability notes.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nIn 2023 Nordea published a thematic guideline on biodiversity, which recognises Nordea's responsibility to contribute to societal goals and describes the current work to address biodiversity issues across the organisation and the commitments to action ahead. This guideline forms an important first step in the roadmap towards 2025 to integrate biodiversity dependency and impact as well as related risks and opportunities into Nordea's sustainability strategy and sustainability governance. Nordea set practice targets in 2023, adopting a progressive approach towards setting impact targets where data availability and quality allow.\n\n## Internal carbon footprint\n\nAlthough Nordea's greatest impact is to engage with customers through financing and investment, work is also ongoing to reduce carbon emissions from internal operations by more than 50% by 2030, with a 40% reduction target by 2025 compared with 2019. So far on its journey towards meeting the targets, Nordea has reduced carbon emissions from internal operations by 51% compared with the 2019 baseline. Travel emissions accounted for the largest part of the reduction since the decision to halve travels compared with 2019, enforced by a new Travel Guideline, and Nordea remains on track to achieve this target.\n\n## Social responsibility\n\nManaging social impacts, both positive and negative, is vital to Nordea's business. Social responsibility is about taking social issues such as human rights, labour rights and gender equality into consideration throughout the entire value chain.\n\n## Human rights\n\nNordea takes the corporate responsibility to respect human rights very seriously and is guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in all business operations. Nordea works to continually integrate human rights considerations into policies, practices and decision-making processes, ensuring that respect for human rights is integral to how Nordea conducts business. Through ongoing awareness-building, training and accountability mechanisms, employees are empowered to uphold human rights in their daily activities.\n\nIn 2023 Nordea published a human rights policy that provides information about Nordea's commitments and efforts to respect human rights in all business activities\n\nNordea-branded investment strategies are subject to norm-based screening, which identifies companies that are allegedly involved in breaches of international law and norms on environmental protection, human rights, labour standards and anti-corruption. If a company is identified in this screening process, an internal assessment of both the company and\n\nthe incident is conducted. Typical actions include engagement, quarantine or exclusion.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nCommunity engagement at Nordea is about creating positive change through its employees across all Nordea's markets. In our three community engagement programmes, Nordea focuses on building financial skills, fostering entrepreneurship and supporting refugees, thus enabling banking and financial expertise to have a positive impact on society. In 2023 more than 1,600 Nordea employees volunteered in 2,600 activities, equating to over 10,400 hours of volunteering\n\n## Inclusive work environment\n\nAt Nordea, all forms of discrimination are condemned. Nordea has zero tolerance of any form of harassment, bullying or victimisation. In 2023 1.4% of the respondents to Nordea's People Pulse survey stated that they had been subject to some sort of harassment or other mistreatment. In 2023 12 discrimination and harassment cases were reported through various channels, including the whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern.\n\nNordea also strives for gender balance in all parts of the organisation and defines gender balance as when neither biological gender is represented by less than 40%. In 2023 the gender balance among the total workforce remained at a stable level of 52%/48% and improved on all leader levels to 40%/60%.\n\n## Employment\n\nNordea's employee survey, People Pulse, enables Nordea to measure the engagement levels and well-being of its people and also to monitor signs of changing trends making it possible to take swift action. In 2023 the response to the People Pulse survey increased to 85% compared with 83% in 2022. Nordea continues to see good results related to overall engagement.\n\n## Governance and culture\n\nOnly by strengthening its purpose-led culture with a sound and strong operating model can Nordea enable speed and scale in the transition to a sustainable and resilient economy.\n\n## Business ethics\n\nThe Code of Conduct and Sustainability Policy define highlevel business principles, how Nordea treats customers and the conduct expected from Nordea's employees. They underpin Nordea's culture and set the parameters for conduct in areas such as care for the environment, labour rights, how to treat customers, human rights, the right to privacy, fair competition, anti-bribery and anti-corruption. The Code of Conduct is reviewed annually and was last updated in June 2023. All employees are required to complete annual Code of Conduct training as part of their Licence to Work to ensure proper awareness and knowledge of the ethical principles.\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nAt Board level, the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee assists the Group Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability, which encompass governance, strategy, risk management and operationalisation. The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning risk management and related frameworks, controls and processes relating to ESG factors as drivers of existing risk. The other Board committees also assist the Group Board with oversight of certain ESG",

The executive-level Group-wide Sustainability and Ethics Committee facilitates the integration of sustainability into the business strategy and supports the integration of ESG factors into the risk management framework. The executive- level Group Risk Committee promotes interaction and coordination within the Group on risk management, including the implementation of ESG factors as drivers of existing risks.\n\nDuring 2023 Nordea continued to integrate ESG KPIs applicable to remuneration for the Group Leadership Team and other senior leaders across the Nordea Group.\n\nFor more information about Nordea's governance, see 'Corporate Governance Statement 2023' on pages 60-65 and pages 364-366 in the Sustainability notes.\n\n## Policies and guidelines\n\nNordea's Sustainability Policy sets out the principles for ensuring the long-term sustainability of operations and, in so doing, strengthening long-term customer relationships and the contribution to a greater good. In addition to the policy, Nordea has position statements as well as thematic and sector guidelines that provide guidance and principles for dealing with both business opportunities and risk mitigation.\n\nNordea's commitments in relation to climate change are described in its Position Statement on Climate Change. The statement explains Nordea's stance on sectors such as thermal coal, coal mining and oil sand extraction.\n\nOn the investment side, Nordea is committed to integrating ESG factors into its analysis, decision-making processes and active ownership practices. Nordea Life & Pension's policy framework for the ESG area and climate change consists of a Responsible Investment Policy and Climate Change Policy. Furthermore, Nordea Asset Management's Responsible Investment Policy sets out the framework for ESG and responsible investments in Nordea Asset Management.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nSustainability is embedded throughout the procurement process. In Nordea's supplier due diligence prior to contracting and in the continuous supplier management after contracting, environmental, social and governance aspects are addressed. During the contracting process, it is ensured that all suppliers sign the Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2023 Nordea prepared a guideline for sustainable procurement that further outlines how to conduct due diligence in the supply chain, to ensure that Nordea does not cause, contribute to or is linked to negative impacts.\n\nFor more information about human rights in the supply chain and sustainable procurement, see pages 359 and 367 in the Sustainability notes.\n\n## Preventing financial crime\n\nNordea fully recognises the threat that societies face from human trafficking, terrorism, corruption, drug smuggling, tax evasion and other forms of illegal activity and have over the years built strong defences to prevent that its resources, products, and services are used to facilitate financial crime. Tracking down and stopping the flow of money from these activities is a key way to disrupt the criminals involved. Therefore, as a financial institution, Nordea is uniquely positioned to be part of the\n\nsolution. Nordea commits to complying with the laws and regulations relevant to anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In 2023 Nordea further strengthened its financial crime prevention capabilities through investments in technology, additional employees, training and more sophisticated assessment techniques. For more information about how Nordea works with financial crime prevention, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' on page 242 and the Sustainability notes on page 366.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nNordea has a holistic Group-wide anti-bribery and corruption programme, which outlines how to prevent, detect and correct matters related to bribery and corruption. Key features include a zero tolerance tone from the top, a Group Accountable Executive for anti-bribery and corruption, an extensive suite of internal policies and procedures, communication and training and a dedicated advisory function. All employees must complete annual awareness training on financial crime risks, including bribery and corruption.\n\n## Data privacy and cyber security\n\nKeeping personal data safe is part of Nordea's commitment to be a safe and trusted bank. Data privacy is therefore an integral part of Nordea's business and operations and an important element of its digital strategy. In 2023 Nordea continued to enhance its ability to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates by further improving the governance structure and by assigning more employees to data privacy operations. Introducing new technologies, exploring new ways of doing business and connecting with customers widen banks' attack surface. At the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming more organised, resourceful and experienced. Banks must also deal with the asymmetry of having to protect all assets, while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need to find one weak spot. Combined, these factors pose an unprecedented risk to the banking industry.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nNordea's whistleblowing function, Raise Your Concern, ensures that all stakeholders, including customers, partners, affected communities as well as employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights, or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in operations, products or services. This includes any action that constitutes a violation of laws or regulations or of Nordea's internal policies, instructions or guidelines. Reporting can be made orally or in writing and Nordea ensures that all reporting is treated with the strictest confidentiality. It is also possible to report anonymously via the electronic reporting channel WhistleB, which is managed by an external party.\n\n## Responsible taxpayer\n\nNordea's approach to tax aims to balance the interests of stakeholders, which include shareholders, customers, governments and tax authorities. This includes handling Nordea's",

Nordea is a substantial corporate income taxpayer in its main countries of operation - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - and pays corporate income tax, social security contributions and bank levies, i.e. contributions to deposit guarantee schemes and resolution funds, in all its countries of operation in line with applicable laws. For more information about tax contribution, see pages 369-372 in the Sustainability notes.\n\n## EU taxonomy disclosures\n\n## EU taxonomy supporting the transition\n\nThe EU taxonomy, Regulation (EU) 2020/852, together with supplementing delegated acts, defines environmentally sustainable economic activities. The environmentally sustainable activities are based on technical screening criteria (TSC), which include criteria for when an activity significantly contributes to one of the EU's climate and environmental objectives while at the same time not significantly harming any of the other objectives. In addition, minimum social safeguard requirements must be met.\n\nIn accordance with the EU taxonomy, Nordea is required to disclose its exposures related to taxonomy-aligned activities for the financial year 2023. The exposure to taxonomy-aligned activities and the related taxonomy KPIs are presented in the tables below. The Green Asset Ratio (GAR) KPIs communicate the proportion of exposures related to taxonomy-aligned activities compared to Nordea's total covered assets1. With reference to Nordea's eligibility disclosures for previous years, Nordea's GAR for the financial year 2023 is in line with expectations2.\n\nLooking forward, the proportion of taxonomy-aligned assets and investments will likely increase over time. This could partly be driven by the future alignment disclosures by Norwegian undertakings from the financial year 2024, with Norway being one of the key markets in which Nordea operates. The widened scope of companies to report on the EU taxonomy disclosures with the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and companies' further transitioning towards alignment with the EU taxonomy criteria are also expected to have an impact.\n\nFor the previous two reporting periods Nordea published taxonomy-eligibility disclosures. Eligible activities are those identified in the EU taxonomy, with the potential to meet the TSC, and which serve as the first step towards assessing the alignment of economic activities with the EU taxonomy.\n\n## Integrating the EU taxonomy regulation\n\nNordea has made sustainability an integral part of its business strategy and in 2021 introduced new measurable long-term and medium-term objectives and 2023-2025 targets, for instance, to increase the facilitation of sustainable financing. A central component of Nordea's strategy is to engage with customers and investees on sustainability topics as well as to enable customers to make sustainable choices and to transition to a more sustainable lifestyle and business model. The products and solutions offered by Nordea are a strategic response to supporting its customers' transition journey, and Nordea edu-\n\ncates its advisers to allow customers to find sustainable offerings in accordance with their sustainability preferences.\n\nNordea is adjusting the requirements for both its investment product providers and its own investment products, including updating pre-contractual disclosures and periodic reporting according to the EU taxonomy requirements. Nordea will continue to analyse options for further alignment of its Green Funding Framework with the EU taxonomy and to prepare for the EU Green Bond Standard.\n\n## Nordea's approach\n\nDuring 2023 Nordea continued its work on interpreting the EU taxonomy requirements and further developing its reporting methodology. This includes the continued development of a data foundation to structure and store data in order to identify and assess the alignment to the EU taxonomy of relevant exposures, thereby enabling reporting according to required regulatory templates. Nordea's disclosure approach for the financial year 2023 reflects its understanding and interpretation of the EU taxonomy requirements and the guidance from the EU Commission pending the development of common standards and approaches.\n\n## Data and methodology\n\nNordea's EU taxonomy disclosures for the financial year 2023 relate to exposures to taxonomy-eligible and -aligned assets. For the two first environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation), the disclosures for 2023 cover eligibility and alignment reporting. For the financial year 2023 eligibility and non-eligibility towards the amended first two environmental objectives and four remaining environmental objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems) are not reported due to limited data availability.\n\nThe assets in scope for disclosures for 2023 are retail exposures as set out in the taxonomy, exposures to undertakings falling under the NFRD, including financial and non-financial undertakings, local government financing, collateral obtained by taking possession (residential and commercial immovable property), and off-balance sheet exposures. Due to the comprehensive level of details required, data on motor vehicle loans (granted after 1 January 2022) is not assessed for alignment. Similarly, due to limitations in data availability, renovation loans are not assessed. As public housing financing does not represent a significant part of Nordea's business model, the KPI on housing financing is not part of the disclosures.\n\nThe reporting is based on data originating from Nordea's internal core banking systems as well as external data for the purposes of (i) NFRD undertakings' disclosed taxonomy eligibility and alignment including gas and nuclear exposures for the financial year 2022, (ii) Energy Performance Certificates (EPC), (iii) the top 15% of the national building stock and (iv) the physical climate risk assessment in relation to residential real estate lending. For non-financial NFRD undertakings, the exposure has been weighted to the undertakings' share of eligible and aligned turnover and capital expenditure (CapEx). For financial NFRD undertakings, Nordea's exposures have been weighted to the undertakings' proportion of",

Exposures to NFRD undertakings which by December 2023 did not publicly disclose their KPIs as well as Norwegian undertakings for which disclosures are not yet mandatory are only included in covered assets. Flow data from the previous disclosure period (disclosure reference date T-1) has not been included in the financial year 2023 disclosures.\n\nThe Complementary Climate Delegated Act (EU) 2022/1214, which includes activities related to the nuclear and fossil gas sectors, forms part of the 2023 disclosures. Data availability regarding nuclear and fossil gas-related activities for nonfinancial NFRD undertakings was limited for the financial year 2022.\n\nFor residential real estate lending in the Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish markets, the gross carrying amount of retail exposures as set out in the taxonomy has been assessed. For residential real estate lending in the Danish market, the gross carrying amount excluding additional credit provided subsequent to the original loan has been assessed. For buildings built before 31 December 2020, substantial contribution has been assessed as a valid EPC class A or as the buildings being within the top 15% of the national or regional building stock with a valid EPC class B. For the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish markets, the top 15% assessment has been determined using EPC class A or B. For the Finnish market, the top 15%\n\nassessment has been determined taking into account the whole building stock, including estimations of building stock that has not been measured, and against which a comparison has been made based on EPCs and energy efficiency numbers. For buildings built after 31 December 2020, no exposure has been assessed due to caution over how to identify the national threshold for nearly zero-energy buildings.\n\nPhysical climate risks assessments for residential real estate lending have been carried out, and any exposures identified to be subject to such risk have not been assessed as taxonomy- aligned assets. The assessments apply a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario of 4.5 for the time period 2011-2040. Minimum safeguards have not been considered for retail exposures with reference to the Platform on Sustainable Finance's report on minimum safeguards.\n\nFor the purpose of the GAR denominator, the exposure to derivatives reflects those not held for trading. Assets held for trading will be included in the calculation of the KPI for the trading book portfolio for the financial year 2025.\n\nDisclosures include subsidiaries on a prudential consolidated basis as per the Disclosure Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2178 Annex V, 1.1.1. Exposures to Nordea Life & Pension are therefore considered in line with the equity method. Since Nordea Life & Pension is not an NFRD company, the exposures are not assessed for alignment in Nordea's taxonomy disclosures for 2023.\n\nTable 1 - 0.

The payment would be distributed based on the annual accounts to be adopted for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and the authorisation would remain in force until the beginning of the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe dividend would be paid from retained earnings. After a maximum dividend payout of EUR 3,239,688,285.20 1 , corresponding to approximately 66% of the net profit for the year, an amount of EUR 14,615,332,238.78 would be carried forward as distributable retained earnings.

After the cancellation on 18 January 2024, the total number of shares in Nordea was 3,521,499,960. In accordance with the terms of its fourth share buy-back programme, Nordea will  continue to cancel repurchased shares on a monthly basis.\n\npaid to shares held by Nordea on the dividend record date, and therefore the final aggregate dividend payout will be determined by the number of outstanding shares in Nordea on the dividend record date.\n\nIt is the assessment of the Board of Directors that the proposed dividend is justifiable considering the demands with respect to the size of the Company's and the Group's equity, which are imposed by the nature, scope and risks, associated with the business, and the Company's and the Group's need for consolidation, liquidity and financial position in general.\n\nFor information on changes in the financial position of Nordea Bank Abp since the end of the financial period, see 'Events after the financial period' below. No other significant events or material changes have taken place in the financial position of the Company since the end of the financial period and the proposed dividend does not compromise the Company's solvency.\n\n## The Board of Directors proposes that earnings be distributed as follows (calculated based on the maximum dividend of EUR 3,239,688,285.20):\n\nEUR\n\n| Dividend paid to shareholders     | 3,239,688,285.20   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Invested unrestricted equity      | 1,062,506,703.15   |\n| Retained earnings 2               | 14,615,332,238.78  |\n| Other free funds                  | 2,762,284,827.88   |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital holders | 749,950,107.64     |\n| Total                             | 22,429,762,162.65  |",

In addition, certain complementary rules in the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines and the Decree of the Finnish Ministry of Finance on the financial statements and consolidated statements of credit institutions and investment firms have also been applied.\n\nThe disclosures, required under the standards, recommendations and legislation above, have been included in the notes or in other parts of the financial statements.\n\nOn 20 February 2024 the Board of Directors approved the financial statements, subject to final adoption by the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2024.\n\nThe accounting policies, methods of computation and presentations are unchanged in comparison with the Annual Report 2022, except for the items presented in 'Changed accounting policies and presentation' below.\n\nAll amounts are in euro million unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Changed accounting policies and presentation\n\nNew accounting policies and changes to the presentation were implemented during 2023. Impacts on Nordea's financial statements are described below.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nThe standard changes the accounting requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 was implemented by Nordea on 1 January 2023 and comparative figures for 2022 have been restated.\n\nThe measurement principles have changed from a non-uniform accounting policy based on the local accounting policies of the life insurance subsidiaries to a uniform accounting policy based on three measurement models: the general measurement model, the variable fee approach and the premium allocation approach. The model application depends on the terms of the contract (long term, long term with a variable fee or short term). The three measurement models include consistent definitions of contractual cash flows, the risk adjustment margin and discounting. These definitions are based on principles similar to those for calculating the technical provisions in the Solvency II Directive. Unearned margins related to premiums from profitable contracts are recognised as a provision on the balance sheet and released to revenue when the service is provided. Losses related to unprofitable contracts are recognised in the income statement at initial recognition.\n\nA net carrying amount of EUR 2,106m was reclassified from insurance to investment contracts at transition. This relates mainly to newer unit-linked endowment contracts where the insurance risk has been assessed to be insignificant.\n\nNordea has applied all three measurement models, but the variable fee approach was applied for 99% of the insurance contracts at transition.\n\nNordea has used the EU carve-out for annual cohorts for two portfolios with a total carrying amount of EUR 6,293m (based on insurance liabilities as at year-end 2021). Nordea has not used the option to disaggregate insurance finance income and expense between profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\nDifferent transition methods have been applied based on the data available at the time of transition (1 January 2022). Nordea did not have enough information to apply the full or modified retrospective approach for the majority of the contracts (91%) and has thus applied the fair value approach. The modified retrospective approach has been applied for the majority of the remaining contracts. The application of the fair value approach in Nordea has resulted in a higher contractual service margin compared with the retrospective approaches, and consequently a larger reduction in equity at transition, as the fair value approach generally requires an additional margin that a potential third-party acquirer would require. This margin is not required in the retrospective approaches. It also means that the contractual service margin to be amortised in the future is higher under the fair value approach compared with the retrospective approaches.\n\nThe quantitative impact on Nordea's financial statements at transition on 1 January 2022 from implementing IFRS 17 was a reduction in equity of EUR 573m. This amount also includes a revaluation of bonds previously measured at 'Amortised cost' but reclassified to 'Fair value through profit or loss' at transition. The impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was a reduction of 23bp at transition.",

        "page_content": "- G1  Accounting policies, cont.\n\nComparative figures have been restated accordingly. For more information, see Note G10.6 'Transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts' in the 2022 Annual Report. The impact on the comparative figures in the income statement for 2022 and the balance sheet as at 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022 can be found in the tables below. For information about accounting policies and more disclosures covering insurance contracts, see Note G4 'Insurance contract liabilities'.\n\n## Changed presentation of financial assets pledged as collateral\n\nOn 1 January 2023 Nordea started presenting financial instruments pledged as collateral together with financial instruments not pledged as collateral on the balance sheet. The former were previously presented separately as 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'. The amendment ensures a consistent presentation of instruments with similar characteristics and is assessed to increase the usefulness of the financial statements.\n\nComparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impact on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2022 and 1 January 2022 can be found in the tables below.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\nOn 1 January 2023 Nordea started applying the amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction.\n\nThe amendments require companies to recognise deferred tax on particular transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to taxable and deductible temporary differences of equal amounts. Such a requirement may apply on the initial recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset at the commencement of a lease. The requirement also applies in the context of decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities where the corresponding amounts are recognised as part of the cost of the related asset.\n\nThe gross deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed but have been set off on the balance sheet if such requirements are met. The impact on the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities disclosed in Note G2.11 'Taxes' amounted to EUR 224m as at 1 January 2022. However, these amounts are set off on the balance sheet so the amendments have not had any other significant impact on Nordea's financial statements or on Nordea's capital adequacy in the period of initial application.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules\n\nIn May 2023 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules. The amendments were effective as of their publication and have been endorsed by the EU. They were implemented by Nordea in the course of 2023. The amendments include a mandatory temporary exemption, which applies retrospectively, from recognising and disclosing information on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the implementation of the Pillar 2 model rules.\n\nThe amendments also include disclosure requirements for periods in which the Pillar 2 legislation is enacted or substantively enacted, but not yet in effect. Known or reasonably estimable information that helps users of financial statements understand the entity's exposure to Pillar 2 income taxes arising from that legislation should be disclosed.\n\nAt the time this Annual Report was published, it was not possible to comment on the impact of the amendments on Nordea's financial statements. This is because Nordea had not completed its full assessment of the financial impact of the enacted Pillar 2 legislation that the amendments provide relief from. The required disclosures can be found in Note G2.11 'Taxes'.\n\n## Other amendments\n\nThe IASB has published the following amendments which were implemented by Nordea on 1 January 2023 but which have not had any significant impact on Nordea's financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statements 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies.\n\nChanges to the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines and the Decree of the Finnish Ministry of Finance on the financial statements and consolidated statements of credit institutions and investment firms have not had any significant impact on the Nordea Group's financial statements.",

The actual outcome can later, to some extent, differ from the estimates and the assumptions made. Such judgements and estimates are disclosed under 'Critical judgement and estimation uncertainty' in the relevant notes, including a description of:\n\n- \u00b7 the sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, and\n- \u00b7 the judgements made when applying accounting policies (apart from those involving estimations) that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nCritical judgements and estimates are in particular associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 Total net result from items at fair value (Note G2.5)\n- \u00b7 Taxes (Note G2.11)\n- \u00b7 Recognition on and derecognition from the balance sheet (Note G3.1)\n- \u00b7 Classification and measurement (Note G3.3)\n- \u00b7 Fair value (Note G3.4)\n- \u00b7 Hedge accounting (Note G3.6)\n- \u00b7 Impairment testing of:\n- - Intangible assets (Note G5.1)\n- - Loans (Note G3.8)\n- \u00b7 Insurance contract liabilities (Note G4)\n- \u00b7 Investment properties (Note G5.3)\n- \u00b7 Leases (Note G5.4)\n- \u00b7 Provisions (Note G6)\n- \u00b7 Pensions (Note G8.2)\n- \u00b7 Consolidated entities (Note G9.1).\n\nNordea applied critical judgements in the preparation of this Annual Report due to the uncertainty concerning the potential long-term impact of higher energy and raw material prices and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors on Nordea's financial statements. Areas particularly important during 2023 were the impairment testing of goodwill and loans to the public/credit institutions.\n\nNo impairment of goodwill was identified during 2023, but estimation uncertainty exists in relation to the long-term impact on Nordea's financial statements and the impairment need will be continuously reassessed. Nordea's total goodwill amounted to EUR 2,227m at the end of 2023 and EUR 2,262m at the end of 2022. Cash flows were projected up until the\n\nend of 2026 and the long-term growth assumption was used for subsequent periods. For more information about impairment testing of goodwill, see Note G5.1 'Intangible assets'.\n\nCritical judgement was also applied in the assessment of when loans had experienced a significant increase in credit risk (staging) and in the application of macro scenarios when estimating the increase in expected credit losses. When calculating allowances for individually significant impaired loans, critical judgement was exercised to estimate the amount and timing of the expected cash flows to be received from the customers under different scenarios, and to value any collateral received. Critical judgement was further applied when assigning the likelihood of the different scenarios occurring.\n\nMore information on the impairment testing of loans to the public/credit institutions can be found under 'Net loan losses and similar net result' on page 40, in Note G3.8 'Loans', covering also critical judgements applied when estimating post-model adjustments, and under 'Other information' on page 46. Information on sensitivities to rating and scoring migrations can be found in the section 2.8 'Sensitivities' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n## Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of each entity (subsidiary or branch) is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Foreign currency is defined as any currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nExchange differences arising on the settlement of transactions at rates different from those on the date of the transactions, and unrealised translation differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nExchange differences arising on internal long-term receivables on, or liabilities to, foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the future (i.e. in substance part of Nordea's net investment in that foreign operation) are recognised in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. For translation of the financial statements of foreign entities and branches, see Note G9.2 'Currency translation of foreign entities/branches'.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\n|                                | Jan-Dec 2023   | Jan-Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| EUR 1 = SEK                    |                |                |\n| Income statement (average)     | 11.4740        | 10.6274        |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year) | 11.1275        | 11.1202        |\n| EUR 1 = DKK                    |                |                |\n| Income statement (average)     | 7.4509         | 7.4395         |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year) | 7.4527         | 7.4365         |\n| EUR 1 = NOK                    |                |                |\n| Income statement (average)     | 11.4238        | 10.1023        |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year) | 11.2120        | 10.5180        |\n\n## Changes to group structure\n\nOn 15 May 2023 Nordea completed the acquisition of all the shares in the digital pension broker platform Advinans.

the total profit of all profitable segments, or\n- - the total loss of all segments that reported a loss.\n- \u00b7 Segment assets amount to 10% or more of the total assets of all operating segments.\n\nTwo or more operating segments are aggregated into a single operating segment if the segments have similar economic characteristics and are similar in respect of products and services, production processes, customers, distribution methods and regulations.\n\nInformation about other business activities and operating segments that are not reported separately is combined and disclosed separately as 'Other operating segments'.\n\n## Income statement 2023\n\n| EURm                                                                                   | Personal  Banking   | Business  Banking   | Large  Corporates  &  Institutions   | Asset &  Wealth   Management   | Other   operating   segments   | Total    operating   segments   | Recon- ciliation   | Total Group   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Net interest income                                                                    | 3,512               | 2,550               | 1,525                                | 316                            | -65                            | 7,838                           | -387               | 7,451         |\n| Net fee and commission income                                                          | 1,066               | 597                 | 485                                  | 989                            | -32                            | 3,105                           | -84                | 3,021         |\n| Net insurance result                                                                   | 120                 | 15                  | 1                                    | 90                             | 0                              | 226                             | -9                 | 217           |\n| Net result from items at fair value                                                    | 71                  | 394                 | 468                                  | 37                             | -100                           | 870                             | 144                | 1,014         |\n| Profit from associated undertakings accounted for  under the equity method             | 0                   | -5                  | 0                                    | -2                             | 5                              | -2                              | -1                 | -3            |\n| Other income                                                                           | 6                   | 36                  | 3                                    | 0                              | -1                             | 44                              | -1                 | 43            |\n| Total operating income                                                                 | 4,775               | 3,587               | 2,482                                | 1,430                          | -193                           | 12,081                          | -338               | 11,743        |\n| -

Nordea applies the use of static planning rates in order to avoid exchange rate fluctuations in the reporting to the CODM. The same exchange rates (e.g. SEK, NOK vs EUR) are used for the current and comparable year. The planning rates used are set during December of the preceding year and calculated as the average spot rates the first five banking days of December of the preceding year. The comparatives are restated annually to reflect the plan exchange rates for the current period as reflected in the internal reporting used by the CODM.\n\n## Basis of segmentation\n\nNordea's main business areas, Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates & Institutions and Asset & Wealth Management, are identified as operating se,gments and reported separately as they are operating segments exceeding the quantitative thresholds in IFRS 8. Other operating segments below the thresholds are included in 'Other operating segments'. Group functions (and eliminations) as well as the result that is not fully allocated to any of the operating segments are shown separately as reconciling items.\n\nThere were no changes in the basis of segmentation during the year.\n\n## Reportable segments\n\nPersonal Banking serves Nordea's household customers and offers a full range of financial services that fulfil the customers' day-to-day financial needs. Personal Banking serves customers through Nordea Netbank, the mobile banking app, over the phone, via online meetings and at Nordea's branch offices. The business area includes advisory and service staff, channels and product units under a common strategy, operating model and governance framework across markets.\n\nBusiness Banking serves, advises and partners with corporate customers, covering all their business needs through a full range of services, including payments, cash management, cards, working capital management and financing solutions. Business Banking also provides services such as payments, cards and financing solutions to personal customers.\n\nLarge Corporates & Institutions provides financial solutions to large Nordic and international corporates and institutional customers. The offering includes a diverse range of financing, cash management and payment services, investment banking, capital markets products and securities services.\n\nAsset & Wealth Management provides high-quality investment, savings and risk management solutions to high net worth individuals and institutional investors and delivers savings solutions to all Nordea's customer segments.\n\n## Total operating income split by product group\n\n| EURm                                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Banking products                       | 8,263  | 6,835  |\n| Capital markets products               | 1,246  | 1,187  |\n| Savings products and asset  management | 1,631  | 1,733  |\n| Life and pension                       | 483    | 357    |\n| Other 1                                | 120    | -391   |\n| Total                                  | 11,743 | 9,721  |\n\nBanking products consist of three different product types. Account products include account-based products such as lending, deposits, cards and Nordea Netbank services. Transaction products consist of cash management as well as trade and project finance services. Financing products include asset-based financing through leasing, hire purchase and factoring as well as sales to finance partners such as dealers, vendors and retailers.\n\nCapital markets products comprise financial instruments, or arrangements for financial instruments, available in the financial marketplace, including currencies, commodities, stocks and bonds.\n\nSavings products and asset management include investment funds, discretionary management, portfolio advice, equity trading and pension accounts. An investment fund is a bundled product where the fund company invests in stocks, bonds, derivatives or other standardised products on behalf of the fund's shareholders. Discretionary management is a service involving the management of an investment portfolio on behalf of the customer, and portfolio advice is a service provided to support customers' investment decisions.\n\nLife and pension includes life insurance and pension products and services.\n\n## Geographical information\n\n|         | Total operating   income, EURm   | Total operating   income, EURm   |              |              | Non-current assets,  EURbn 1   | Non-current assets,  EURbn 1   |\n|---------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|         | 2023                             | 2022                             | 31 Dec  2023 | 31 Dec  2022 | 31 Dec  2023                   | 31 Dec  2022                   |\n| Sweden  | 3,200                            | 2,957                            | 161          | 162          | 2                              | 2                              |\n| Finland | 2,929                            | 1,602                            | 137          | 147          | 2                              | 2                              |\n| Norway  | 2,053                            | 1,959                            | 105          | 104          | 2                              | 2                              |\n| Denmark | 3,107                            | 2,653                            | 169          | 170          | 3                              | 3                              |\n| Other   | 454                              | 550                              | 13           | 12           | 0                              | 0                              |\n| Total   | 11,743                           | 9,721                            | 585          | 595          | 9                              | 9                              |\n\nNordea's main geographical markets comprise the Nordic countries.

        "page_content": "## G2.2  Net interest income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInterest consists of compensation for time value of money plus a margin. The effective interest rate equals the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability at initital recognition.\n\nInterest income and expense are calculated and recognised using the effective interest rate method or, if considered appropriate, a method that provides a reasonable approximation in line with the effective interest rate method as the basis for the calculation. The effective interest rate includes fees considered to be an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for risk). Interest income and expense from financial instruments are, with the exceptions described below, classified as 'Net interest income'.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets and Life & Pension are classified as 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement. Also, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets and Life & Pension and on the net funding of fund investments in Treasury measured at amortised cost is recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value' to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner. See Note G2.5 'Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\nThe interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Net result from items at fair value', except for derivatives used for hedging purposes. In accounting hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability. In economic hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Other interest income' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability.\n\nThe yield on financial assets is presented in three line items in the income statement: 'Interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method', 'Other interest income' and 'Negative yield on financial assets'. In the line item 'Interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method', Nordea presents interest income from financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The income statement line item 'Other interest income' includes other interest income, such as interest income from loans measured at fair value through profit or loss due to the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test failing. Any negative yield on financial assets and liabilities is reported under 'Negative yield on financial assets' and 'Negative yield on financial liabilities'. respectively.\n\n## Net interest income\n\n| EURm                                                                   | 2023    | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Interest income calculated using the effective  interest rate method 1 | 17,303  | 7,937  |\n| Other interest income                                                  | 2,426   | 1,013  |\n| Negative yield on financial assets                                     | -       | -134   |\n| Interest expense                                                       | -12,278 | -3,474 |\n| Negative yield on financial liabilities                                | -       | 322    |\n| Net interest income                                                    | 7,451   | 5,664  |\n\n## Interest income calculated using the\n\n## effective interest rate method\n\n| EURm                                                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Loans to credit institutions                                                 | 2,642  | 682    |\n| Loans to the public                                                          | 12,095 | 6,527  |\n| Interest-bearing securities                                                  | 931    | 325    |\n| Yield fees                                                                   | 201    | 242    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives in  accounting hedges of assets | 1,434  | 161    |\n| Interest income calculated using   the effective interest rate method        | 17,303 | 7,937  |\n\n## Other interest income\n\n| EURm                                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Loans at fair value to the public                                          | 1,608  | 1,064  |\n| Interest-bearing securities measured at fair  value                        | 442    | 170    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives in  economic hedges of assets | 376    | -221   |\n| Other interest income                                                      | 2,426  | 1,013  |\n\n## Interest expense\n\n| EURm                                                                   | 2023    | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Deposits by credit institutions                                        | -865    | -221   |\n| Deposits and borrowings from the public                                | -4,079  | -878   |\n| Deposit guarantee fees                                                 | -80     | -79    |\n| Debt securities in issue                                               | -5,118  | -2,376 |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                               | -222    | -252   |\n| Other interest expense                                                 | -15     | -14    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives in  hedges of liabilities | -1,899  | 346    |\n| Interest expense                                                       | -12,278 | -3,474 |",

The recognition of commission income depends on the purpose for which the fees are received.\n\nThe majority share of the revenues classified as 'Commission income' constitutes revenue from contracts with customers according to IFRS 15. Fee income is recognised when or as an entity satisfies the performance obligation, either over time or at a specific point of time.\n\nLending fees that are not part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument are recognised at a point of time when the performance obligation is satisfied. Fees received for bilateral transactions are generally amortised as part of the effective interest rate of the financial instruments recognised. Loan syndication fees are recognised either as part of the effective interest rate of the participation or, if Nordea is acting as an agent in the transaction, as lending fee income. When the fee income is related to both activities, the fee that is recognised as part of the effective interest rate is based on the margin received by the other parties in the arrangement.\n\nVariable fees, such as performance fees, are recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative recognised amount does not occur.\n\nCommission expenses covering a certain period are expensed over that period, whereas transactional fees are recognised when the services are received.\n\nCommission income and expense related to the fulfilment of insurance contracts accounted for under IFRS 17 are excluded from 'Net fee and commission income' and instead accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies defined in Note G4 'Insurance contract liabilities' and Note G2.4 'Net insurance result'.\n\n## Net fee and commission income 1\n\n| EURm                                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Asset management commissions                       | 1,631  | 1,733  |\n| - of which income                                  | 1,897  | 2,082  |\n| - of which expense                                 | -266   | -349   |\n| Life and pension commissions                       | 138    | 124    |\n| - of which income                                  | 147    | 125    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -9     | -1     |\n| Deposit products                                   | 23     | 25     |\n| - of which income                                  | 23     | 25     |\n| Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance | 194    | 173    |\n| - of which income                                  | 323    | 306    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -129   | -133   |\n| Custody and issuer services                        | 6      | 18     |\n| - of which income                                  | 54     | 63     |\n| - of which expense                                 | -48    | -45    |\n| Payments                                           | 253    | 252    |\n| - of which income                                  | 375    | 372    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -122   | -120   |\n| Cards                                              | 291    | 306    |\n| - of which income                                  | 431    | 427    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -140   | -121   |\n| Lending products                                   | 437    | 477    |\n| - of which income                                  | 461    | 502    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -24    | -25    |\n| Guarantees                                         | 56     | 101    |\n| - of which income                                  | 130    | 144    |\n| - of which expense                                 | -74    | -43    |\n| Other                                              | -8     | -23    |\n| - of which income                                  | 82     | 62     |\n| - of which expense                                 | -90    | -85    |\n| Total                                              | 3,021  | 3,186  |\n\n- 1) Fee income, not included in determining the effective interest rate, from financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss amounted to EUR 435m (EUR 456m).\n\nAsset management commissions are generally recognised over time as services are performed and are normally based on assets under management. These fees are recognised based on the passage of time as the amount (and the right to receive the fee) corresponds to the value received by the customer. The fees are recognised monthly when the market value of the assets under management is determined. Variable fees based on the relative performance versus a benchmark are rare. The uncertainty relating to the variable consideration is normally resolved at least at each reporting date and the fee income can be recognised. The amount cannot generally be recognised if the outcome is still uncertain and subject to market developments.",

The fee income is recognised over time as the services are performed. Fees received on insurance contracts are reported in the 'Net insurance revenue', see Note G2.4 'Net insurance result'.\n\nFees categorised as 'Deposit products', 'Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance', 'Custody and issuer services' and 'Payments' are recognised both over time and at a point of time depending on when the performance obligations are satisfied. Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance are mainly transaction-based in relation to advising customers or executing customer transactions in securities where the services are recognised at a point of time when the services related to the transactions are completed. Payment commissions include fees for cash management and payment solutions that are recognised over time and transactionbased fees for services like domestic and foreign payments that are recognised at a point of time.\n\nCard fees are categorised as interchange fees which are recognised at a point of time when the customer uses the services, or as cardholder fees which are recognised over time or at a point of time if the fee is transaction-based.\n\nLending fees are recognised at a point of time when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when the transaction has been performed, unless they are part of the effective interest rate of the financial instrument.\n\nIncome from issued financial guarantees and expenses for bought financial guarantees are amortised over the duration of the instruments and classified as 'Fee and commission income' and 'Fee and commission expense', respectively.\n\nOther fee income is generally transaction-based.\n\nFor transactional services performed at a point of time, payments are generally made instantly when the services are performed. For services performed over time, the period of the services is normally short. Examples of such services are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset management services. For the services performed over time, the right to payment generally arises at the end of the period of the services when the performance obligations are satisfied and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consideration will occur.\n\nAccount receivables are recognised in 'Other assets', while unbilled receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract assets are recognised in 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income'. Short-term advances received where the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised in 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income'.\n\nCommission expenses are normally transaction-based and recognised in the period in which the services are received.\n\n## Breakdown by business area\n\n| 2023, EURm                                         | Personal  Banking   |

The line item also includes changes to insurance liabilities under the variable fee approach related to changes in corresponding assets.\n- \u00b7 Return on assets backing insurance liabilities, which includes the income on the assets backing the insurance contract liabilities.\n\nMore detailed accounting policies covering the accounting for insurance contracts can be found in Note G4 'Insurance contract liabilities'.\n\n## Net insurance result\n\n| EURm                                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Insurance revenue                                | 613    | 313    |\n| Insurance service expenses                       | -392   | -119   |\n| Net reinsurance result                           | -6     | -6     |\n| Net insurance revenue                            | 215    | 188    |\n| Insurance finance income or expenses             | -2,222 | 1,900  |\n| Return on assets backing insurance liabilities 1 | 2,224  | -1,915 |\n| Net insurance finance income and expenses        | 2      | -15    |\n| Net insurance result                             | 217    | 173    |\n\n- 1) Transferred from Note G2.5 'Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\n## G2.5   Total net result from items at fair value\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Net result from items at fair value\n\nRealised and unrealised gains and losses on financial instruments and investment properties held at fair value are generally presented in 'Net result from items at fair value'. The accounting policies used when estimating fair value can be found in Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\nThe following items are moreover presented in 'Net result from items at fair value':\n\n- \u00b7 Interest on the net funding of operations in Markets and Life & Pension and on the net funding of fund investments in Treasury measured at amortised cost.\n- \u00b7 Realised gains/losses on assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n- \u00b7 The revaluation of the hedged risks of hedged items under hedge accounting.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange gains/losses.\n\nThe following items are not presented in 'Net result from items at fair value':\n\n- \u00b7 The interest component of derivatives used for hedge accounting and economic hedges. These components are\n\n- presented in 'Net interest income' to ensure consistent accounting treatment with the hedged items.\n- \u00b7 Return on assets backing insurance liabilities is included gross in this note, but transferred to Note G2.4 'Net insurance result' and thus not included in the totals.\n- \u00b7 Losses from counterparty risk on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value (the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test fails), are presented in the separate line item 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value'.\n\nFor more information on accounting policies related to foreign exchange gains/losses, see Note G1 'Accounting policies' and Note G9.2 'Currency translation of foreign entities/ branches'.\n\n## Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value\n\nThe item 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value' includes fair value adjustments of the margin component of loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value (the SPPI test fails). The loans are classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and presented in the line item 'Loans to the public' on the balance sheet. Fair value adjustments are largely driven by changes in credit risk.\n\nLosses from counterparty risk on other instruments classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' are presented in 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nImpairment losses on instruments within other categories than the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' are recognised in the line item 'Net loan losses'. For more information, see Note G2.10 'Net loan losses'.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nEstimation uncertainty exists in the valuation of financial instruments, in particular for instruments that lack quoted prices or where recently observed market prices are not available (Level 3 instruments).

This has entailed the Group winding down its operations in Russia. On 24 March 2021 the Extraordinary General Meeting of JSC Nordea Bank decided to initiate the voluntary liquidation process, which was approved by the Central Bank of Russia on 16 April 2021. The voluntary liquidation process of JSC Nordea Bank was completed on 21 April 2022, following its deregistration from the trade register by the Russian tax authorities. The final steps to liquidate the remaining Russian subsidiaries are pending.\n\nAs required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), Nordea had accumulated foreign exchange (FX) losses on the investment in its banking operations in Russia in equity through 'Other comprehensive income' (OCI) since the acquisition of JSC Nordea Bank in 2007. In the first quarter of 2022 Nordea repatriated capital and in substance\n\nceased all operations in Russia. In accordance with the IFRSs, Nordea recycled the accumulated FX losses from OCI into the income statement. The recycling impact was recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value' and was treated as an item affecting comparability. There was no impact on equity, own funds or capital as a corresponding positive item was recorded in OCI. Consequently, this item had no impact on Nordea's dividend or share buy-back capacity.\n\n## G2.6  Other operating income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNet gains from divestment of shares in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures and net gains from the sale of tangible assets as well as other transactions not related to any other income line are generally presented in 'Other operating income' and recognised when it is probable that the benefits associated with the transaction will flow to Nordea. This generally occurs when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer (generally when the transaction is finalised).\n\n## Other operating income\n\n| EURm                                   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income from real estate                |      1 |      2 |\n| Sale of tangible and intangible assets |     29 |     39 |\n| Other                                  |     13 |     42 |\n| Total                                  |     43 |     83 |\n\n## G2.7  Other expenses\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTransactions not related to any other expense line are generally presented in 'Other expenses'. The major part of the expenses are related to IT purchased and other services. The expenses for acquired services are normally transaction-based and recognised in the period in which the services are received.\n\nNet losses from divestment of shares in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures and net losses from the sale of tangible assets are generally recognised in 'Other expenses' when it is probable that the benefits associated with the transaction will flow to Nordea and if the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer (generally when the transaction is finalised).\n\nExpenses related to the fulfilment of insurance contracts accounted for under IFRS 17 are included gross in this note, but subsequently transferred out from 'Other expenses' and accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies defined in Note G4 'Insurance contract liabilities' and Note G2.4 'Net insurance result'.\n\nExpenses that fulfil the capitalisation requirements defined in the accounting policies in Note G5.1 'Intangible assets' are included gross in this note but subsequently capitalised and added to 'Intangible assets' on the balance sheet.",

The Swedish bank tax is refundable for the period during which Nordea does not operate, and the obligating event is therefore assessed to occur continuously over the year.\n\nResolution fees are thus recognised in full in the first quarter, while the Swedish bank tax is amortised on a straight-line basis over the course of the year.\n\n| EURm            |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| Resolution fees |   -234 |   -256 |\n| Bank tax        |    -82 |    -66 |\n| Total           |   -316 |   -322 |\n\n## G2.9   Depreciation,  amortisation and impairment charges of tangible and intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTangible and intangible assets (except goodwill) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life (goodwill) is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment.\n\nAll intangible assets with definite useful lives, including IT development taken into use, are reviewed for indications of impairment. The impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.\n\nAccounting policies for intangible and tangible assets, and critical judgements applied, can be found in Note G5 'Intangible and tangible assets'.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation related to the fulfilment of insurance contracts are not presented in this line item but instead accounted for and presented as defined in Note G2.4 'Net insurance result' and Note G4 'Insurance contract liabilities'.\n\n| EURm                                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Depreciation/amortisation                                               |        |        |\n| Properties and equipment                                                | -225   | -215   |\n| Intangible assets                                                       | -393   | -371   |\n| Total depreciation/amortisation                                         | -618   | -586   |\n| Impairment charges, net                                                 |        |        |\n| Properties and equipment                                                | -6     | 1      |\n| Intangible assets                                                       | -193   | -26    |\n| Total impairment charges                                                | -199   | -25    |\n| Total before transfer of insurance expenses                             | -817   | -611   |\n| Transfer of expenses to fulfil insurance  contracts in scope of IFRS 17 | 9      | -      |\n| Total                                                                   | -808   | -611   |\n\n## G2.10  Net loan losses\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nImpairment losses on financial assets classified in the categories 'Amortised cost' and 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' (see Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'), in the line items 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest-bearing securities' on the balance sheet, are reported as 'Net loan losses' in the income statement together with losses from financial guarantees. Losses are reported net of any collateral and other credit enhancements. Nordea's accounting policies covering the calculation of impairment losses on loans, and critical judgements applied, can be found in Note G3.8 'Loans'.\n\nCounterparty losses on instruments classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss', including credit derivatives but excluding loans held at fair value, are reported under 'Net result from items at fair value'. Losses on loans held at fair value in hold portfolios (failing the test for solely payments of principal and interest) are reported in the line item 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value'. For more information see Note G2.5 'Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\nMore information on credit risk can be found in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.",

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the tax effects relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, in which case the tax effects are recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax\n\nbase of the same assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits if the relevant recognition criteria in IAS 12 are met. Deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the temporary differences reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences, tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.",

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities. When recognising deferred tax, the impact, if any, of the upcoming Global Anti-Base-Erosion (GloBE/Pillar 2) Rules is not taken into account.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nTax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will accept the treatment used in the tax filings. Uncertain tax positions are considered independently or as a group, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If Nordea concludes that it is not probable that the tax authorities will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of uncertainty is reflected when determining the related taxable result, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. This is done by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty. Uncertain tax treatment can affect both current tax and deferred tax.\n\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets is influenced by management's assessment of Nordea's future profitability and sufficiency of future taxable profits and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. These assessments are updated and reviewed at each balance sheet date and are, if necessary, revised to reflect the current situation.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets was EUR 254m (EUR 299m) at the end of the year.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\n| EURm         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax  | -1,445 | -988   |\n| Deferred tax | 41     | -187   |\n| Total        | -1,404 | -1,175 |\n\nFor total tax recognised in other comprehensive income, see Statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe tax on the Group's operating profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate in Finland as follows:\n\n| EURm                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before tax                                       | 6,338  | 4,762  |\n| Tax calculated at a tax rate of 20.0%                   | -1,268 | -952   |\n| Effect of different tax rates in other countries        | -172   | -134   |\n| Income from associated undertakings                     | 1      | 1      |\n| Tax-exempt income                                       | 29     | 43     |\n| Income subject to yield taxation                        | 14     | 15     |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                 | -27    | -20    |\n| Prior year adjustments, current tax                     | -34    | -25    |\n| Prior year adjustments, deferred tax                    | 87     | 33     |\n| Utilisation and origination of unrecognised tax  assets | 9      | -      |\n| Change of tax rate 1                                    | -      | -26    |\n| Non-creditable foreign tax                              | -27    | -23    |\n| Tax incentive machinery and equipment                   | -16    | 19     |\n| Recycled non-deductible foreign exchange  losses 2      | -      | -106   |\n| Tax charge                                              | -1,404 | -1,175 |\n| Effective tax rate                                      | 22.2%  | 24.7%  |\n\n## Movement of deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                                | 1 Jan 2023   | Charged to  income  statement   | Charged to other  comprehensive  income   | Acquisitions   | Translation  differences   | 31 Dec 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                 |              |                                 |                                           |                |                            |               |\n| Tax losses carried forward                          | 8            | 48                              | -                                         | 2              | -                          | 58            |\n| Intangible assets                                   | 8            | -8                              | -                                         | -              | -                          | -             |\n| Loans to the public                                 | 98           | -23                             | -4                                        | -              | -1                         | 70            |\n| Investment properties                               | 40           | -39                             | -                                         | -              | -                          | 1             |\n| Retirement benefits                                 | 71           | -                               | 5                                         | -              | -1                         | 75            |\n| Liabilities/provisions                              | 237          | -1                              | -                                         | -              | -                          | 236           |\n| Lease liabilities                                   | 229          | 10                              | -                                         | -5             | -4                         | 230           |\n| Other                                               | -            | 19                              | -                                         | -              | -3                         | 16            |\n| Netting between deferred tax assets and liabilities | -392         | -40                             | -                                         | -              | -                          | -432          |\n| Total                                               | 299          | -34                             | 1                                         | -3             | -9                         | 254           |",

The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is based on an assessment of the probability and amount of future taxable profits as well as on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\n\nAdditionally, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of EUR -m (EUR 40m) in relation to tax losses carried forward in various entities as well as EUR 581m (EUR 427m) in relation to unused foreign tax credits. Unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to foreign tax credits may be recovered in the event of unexpected differences in the timing of taxation or the tax base between the head office and branches.\n\n## Pillar 2 Global Anti-Base-Erosion tax reform\n\nIn December 2022 the European Union member states adopted a directive to implement the Global Anti-Base-Erosion Rules (Pillar 2) as of 1 January 2024. The Nordic countries, and also other jurisdictions in which Nordea operates, enacted the Pillar 2 legislation at the end of 2023. Since the newly enacted tax legislation was not effective in 2023, it had no current tax impact on Nordea in 2023. Due to amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, the enacted Pillar 2 neither affected deferred tax assets nor deferred tax liabilities in 2023. For more information on the Amendment to IAS 12 Income taxes, see Note G1 'Accounting policies'.\n\nUnder the Pillar 2 rules, Nordea is liable to pay a top-up tax on the difference between the jurisdictional Pillar 2 effective tax rates and the minimum rate of 15% if the Pillar 2 effective tax rate ends up below 15% in any jurisdiction in which Nordea operates. The Pillar 2 rules provide a new way of calculating the effective tax rate compared to local tax rules, which may result in a taxpayer falling below the threshold in one jurisdiction although not operating in a low tax jurisdiction and paying a statutory tax rate above 15%. Nordea has made full Pillar 2 calculations for the most significant entities in the Nordic jurisdictions, including selected Group entities with complex positions. Based on this assessment, all Pillar 2 calculations per jurisdiction show that the effective tax rates exceed 15%.\n\nFull Pillar 2 calculations and filings will not be required for the financial years 2024-2026 for the jurisdictions meeting the temporary safe harbour requirements introduced by the Pillar 2 rules. Nordea has assessed the applicability of the safe harbour rules based on the Group's historical data and currently expects to satisfy the safe harbour requirements in all significant jurisdictions and consequently to postpone the preparation of the full Pillar 2 calculations until the financial year 2027.\n\nConsidering that the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which Nordea operates are above 15% and that the analysis is carried out during the year, Nordea consequently does not expect to end up in any significant top-up tax position. However, the full quantitative impact of the Pillar 2 rules remains to be confirmed once more guidance is published by the OECD, local legislators and tax authorities.\n\n## G2.12  Earnings per share\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to shareholders of Nordea Bank Abp by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, consisting of rights to performance shares under the Long Term Incentive Plans and contracts that can be settled in Nordea shares, i.e. derivatives such as options and warrants and their equivalents. Such contracts affect diluted earnings per share when (and only when) the average price of ordinary shares during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants (i.e. they are in the money).\n\nThe potential ordinary shares are only considered to be dilutive on the balance sheet date if all performance conditions are fulfilled and if a conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share. The rights are furthermore considered dilutive only when the exercise price, with the addition of future services, is lower than the period's average share price.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Earnings:                                                                                    |        |        |\n| Profit attributable to shareholders of   Nordea Bank Abp, EURm                               | 4,908  | 3,563  |\n| Number of shares (millions):                                                                 |        |        |\n| Number of shares outstanding at   beginning of year                                          | 3,654  | 3,966  |\n| Average number of repurchased shares under  the share buy-back programme                     | -66    | -170   |\n| Average number of shares held for  remuneration purposes or in the trading  portfolio        | -12    | -17    |\n| Weighted average number of   basic shares outstanding                                        | 3,576  | 3,779  |\n| Adjustment for diluted weighted average  number of additional ordinary shares  outstanding 1 | 3      | 3      |\n| Weighted average number of   diluted shares outstanding                                      | 3,579  | 3,782  |\n| Basic earnings per share, EUR                                                                | 1.37   | 0.94   |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                                                              | 1.37   | 0.94   |",

        "page_content": "## G3  Financial instruments\n\n## G3.1   Recognition on and derecognition from the balance sheet\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDerivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign exchange spot transactions are recognised on and derecognised from the balance sheet on the trade date. Other financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet on the settlement date. An asset or a liability is recognised in 'Other assets' or 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet between the trade date and the settlement date.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those for which trade date accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. The rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred when the counterparty has performed by e.g. repaying a loan to Nordea, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised and a new loan recognised if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially different from the old loan. This is normally the case if the present value of the cash flows of the new loan discounted by the original interest rate differs by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows of the old loan. The same principles apply to financial liabilities. The terms and conditions are also considered to be significantly different for financial assets where the modified cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa.\n\nIn some cases, Nordea enters into transactions where it transfers assets that are recognised on the balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, the transferred assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. If Nordea's counterparty can sell or repledge the transferred assets, the assets are disclosed in Note G3.7 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'. Transfers of assets with retention of all or substantially all risks and rewards include securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised from the balance sheet when the liability is extinguished. Normally this occurs when Nordea performs, for example when Nordea returns a deposit to the counterparty, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nA sale of a security not owned by Nordea is defined as a short sale and triggers the recognition of a trading liability (sold, not held, securities) presented in 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The short sale is generally covered through a securities financing transaction, normally a reverse repurchase agreement or other forms of securities borrowing agreements.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised and a new loan recognised if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially different from the old loan. Nordea applies judgements to determine if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially different from the old loan. Nordea considers, as mentioned under Accounting policies above, that the terms and conditions are substantially different if the present value of the cash flows of the new loan discounted by\n\nthe original interest rate differs by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows of the old loan or if the modified cash flows are SPPI, but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa. For more information about sustainability-linked loans, see Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement\".\n\n## G3.2   Transferred assets and obtained collateral\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssets are considered to be transferred from Nordea if Nordea either transfers the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets or retains that right but has a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more parties. All assets transferred continue to be recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\nCollateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea is not exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\nFor information about financial instruments pledged as collateral, see Note G3.7 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'.\n\n## Transferred assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities\n\nRepurchase agreements are a form of collateral borrowing where Nordea sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price.\n\nSecurities lending agreements are transactions where Nordea lends securities to a counterparty and receives a fee. Generally, securities lending agreements are entered into on a collateralised basis.\n\nAs both repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements result in the securities being returned to Nordea, all risks and rewards associated with the instruments transferred are retained by Nordea although the instruments are not available to Nordea during the period during which they are transferred. The counterparties to the transactions hold the securities as collateral but have no recourse to other assets in Nordea. For this reason securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are not derecognised from the balance sheet. In cases where the counterparty has the right to resell or repledge the securities, the securities are disclosed in Note G3.7 'Financial instruments pledged as collateral'. Securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are also disclosed in Note G7.3 'Assets pledged'. Cash received under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements is recognised on the balance sheet in 'Deposits by credit institutions' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'.\n\nIn derivative transactions Nordea delivers collateral which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such transactions are mainly related to collateral delivered under credit support annex agreements.",

The transactions are conducted under standard agreements employed by financial market participants. Generally, the agreements require additional collateral to be provided if the value of the securities falls below a predetermined level. Under the standard terms of most repurchase transactions, the recipient of collateral has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge it, subject to returning equivalent securities on settlement of the transactions.\n\nSecurities received under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements are not recognised on the balance sheet. Cash delivered under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements is recognised on the balance sheet in 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions' or 'Loans to the public'.\n\nThe fair value of the securities obtained as collateral under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements is disclosed below. Nordea also obtains collateral under other agreements which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such collateral is mainly received under credit support annex agreements covering derivative transactions. The received collateral presented in the table below is not recognised on the balance sheet and includes collateral issued by Nordea.\n\n## Received collateral not recognised on the balance sheet\n\n| EURm                                                | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Reverse repurchase agreements                       |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged   or sold | 30,455        | 25,520        |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 10,537        | 18,849        |\n| Securities borrowing agreements                     |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged   or sold | 865           | 1,003         |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 219           | 445           |\n| Other agreements                                    |               |               |\n| Collateral received that can be repledged or sold   | 682           | 834           |\n| - of which repledged or sold                        | 311           | 320           |\n| Total                                               | 32,002        | 27,357        |\n\n## G3.3  Classification and measurement\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEach financial instrument has been classified in one of the following categories:\n\n## Financial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Fair value through profit or loss:\n- - Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n- - Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Fair value through profit or loss:\n- - Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n- - Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option).\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is dependent on the business model for the portfolio in which the instrument is included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments of princpal and interest (SPPI).\n\nFinancial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. All other assets are classified based on the business model. Instruments included in a portfolio with a business model where the intention is to keep the instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured at amortised cost. Instruments included in a business model where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets included in any other business model are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn order to determine the business model, Nordea has divided its financial assets into portfolios and/or sub-portfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. When determining the right level for the portfolios, Nordea has taken the current business area structure into account. When determining the business model for each portfolio, Nordea has analysed the objective of the financial assets as well as, for instance, past sales behaviour and management compensation.\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. The classification of financial instruments into different categories forms the basis for how each instrument is subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how changes in its value are recognised. The classification of the financial instruments on Nordea's balance sheet into the different categories under IFRS 9 is presented in the table 'Classification of financial instruments' in Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the instruments within this category are measured at amortised cost. In an amortised cost measurement, the difference between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised in the income statement over the remaining term using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is defined as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation of any difference between",

The cumulative amortisation is calculated using the effective interest rate method. For more information about the effective interest rate method, see Note G2.2 'Net interest income'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note G3.8 'Loans'.\n\nInterest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost is generally recognised under 'Interest income calculated using the effective interest method' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. Changes in fair value are generally recognised directly in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. However, fair value adjustments of the margin component of loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value (the SPPI test fails) are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value'. For more information, see Note G2.5 'Total net result from items at fair value'. For estimation of fair value, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'. The return on assets backing insurance contracts is in addition allocated to the line item 'Return on assets backing insurance contracts'. See Note G2.4 'Net insurance result'.\n\nThe category consists of two sub-categories: 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' and 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)'. The sub-category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)' is an option to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. This option can be used if it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch and for liabilities if they are managed on a fair value basis. Changes in credit risk related to liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in other comprehensive income unless it creates an accounting mismatch.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to balance sheet items held at fair value through profit or loss are generally classified as 'Net result from items at fair value'. For more information, including exceptions from this general rule, see Note G2.5 'Total net result from items at fair value' and Note G2.2 'Net interest income'.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Changes in fair value, except for interest, foreign exchange effects and impairment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity through other comprehensive income. Interest is recognised under 'Interest income', foreign exchange effects under 'Net result from items at fair value' and impairment losses under 'Net loan losses' in the income statement. When an instrument is disposed of, the fair value changes previously accumulated in the fair value reserve in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note G3.8 'Loans', and about estimation of fair value, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\n## Hybrid (combined) financial instruments\n\nHybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts containing a host contract and an embedded derivative instrument. Such combinations arise predominantly from the issuance of structured debt instruments, such as issued indexlinked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps.\n\nFor structured bonds issued by Markets, Nordea applies the fair value option, and the entire combined instrument, the host contract together with the embedded derivative, is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value' except for changes in Nordea's own credit risk which is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nA financial instrument issued by Nordea is either classified as a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities if the contractual arrangements result in Nordea having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and classified as equity, net of transaction costs. If issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nNordea classifies financial assets based on Nordea's business model for managing the assets. When determining the business model for bonds within the liquidity buffer, Nordea performs critical judgements. The bonds within the liquidity buffer are split into three portfolios. For the first portfolio, Nordea has determined that the business model is to keep the bonds and collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. For the second portfolio, Nordea has determined that the business model is to manage the bonds with the objective of realising cash flows through sale. For the third portfolio, Nordea has determined that the business model is to keep the bonds and collect contractual cash flows. The bonds within the first portfolio are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the bonds within the second portfolio are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the third portfolio is measured at amortised cost. Interest-bearing securities in the liquidity buffer measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (the first portfolio), fair value through profit or loss (the second portfolio) and amortised cost (the third portfolio) amounted at the end of the year to EUR 35,869m (EUR 32,495m), EUR 10,047m (EUR 13,895m) and EUR 57m (EUR 40m), respectively.\n\nNordea also classifies financial assets based on whether or not the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding. Some loan contracts at Nordea include terms linking contractual cash flows to the customer's achievement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets (sustainability-linked loans). These ESG targets are material to the counterparty and therefore generally entity specific. At the end of the year the carrying amount of these sustainability-linked loans amounted to EUR 9,194m (EUR 6,775m). Nordea considers these loans to be compliant with the SPPI requirements to the extent that the targets are customer specific. Nordea consequently judges a change in",

This category also includes interest-bearing securities mainly related to a portfolio in Life & Pension in Norway, subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue, except for bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab and structured bonds issued by Markets.\n\n## Lending with ESG targets\n\nSome loan contracts in Nordea include terms linking contractual cash flows to the customer's achievement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets (so-called sustainability-linked loans). The most common targets in these sustainability linked loans are environmental, such as CO2\n\nemission. At the end of the year the carrying amount of the sustainability-linked loans recognised on the balance sheet amounted to EUR 9,194m. 59.2% of the carrying amount was connected to so-called transition risk, meaning the risk of losses when the customers transfer their business to become more green, with the targets generally applied being Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, carbon intensity and energy intensity. The nominal amount of unutilised and off-balance sheet loan commitments regarding sustainability-linked loans was EUR 10,661m at the end of the year of which EUR 64.4% is related to transition risk. The impact on the interest rate is typically within the 2.5-5bp range if the targets for the sustainability-linked loans are met. The average term of these loans is 3 years. For more information about the risk associated with these loans, see section 2.1 'Credit risk definition and identification' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'. The ESG targets are material to the counterparty and generally entity specific.",

The carrying amount of these loans was EUR 1,165m at the end of the year. The volatility of the cash flows during the term of the loans is expected to be insignificant.\n\n## Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe sub-category 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' mainly contains all assets and trading liabilities in Markets, interest-bearing securities in the liquidity buffer, derivatives, shares, mortgage loans in Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab and financial assets under 'Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts'. Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are contracts with customers and policyholders where most or all of the risk is borne by the policyholders. The deposits are invested in different types of financial assets on behalf of customers and policyholders.\n\n## Financial assets designated at fair value through  profit or loss (fair value option)\n\nMost interest-bearing securities in Life & Pension backing insurance contracts, EUR 8,335m (EUR 11,612m), are designated at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch with the insurance\n\ncontract liabilities. Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts in Life & Pension which are not mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss, EUR 898m (EUR 668m), are designated at fair value through profit or loss to avoid an accounting mismatch with the related deposits. Nordea does not disclose the effect of changes in credit risk on the fair values of these assets as any such change in value will directly result in essentially the opposite change in the carrying amount of the corresponding insurance contract liabilities. There is thus no significant impact on the income statement or equity due to changes in the credit risk on these assets in Life & Pension.\n\n## Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\n| EURm                                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying amount at end of year                 | 9,233  | 12,280 |\n| Maximum exposure to credit risk at end of year | 9,233  | 12,280 |\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive  income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income mainly consist of interest-bearing securities in the liquidity buffer.\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                                                                           | 2023                                                                                             | 2023                                                                             | 2023    | 2022                                                                                             | 2022                                                                             | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| EURm                                                                      | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk   are presented   in other  comprehensive  income | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk are  presented in  profit or loss | Total   | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk   are presented   in other  comprehensive  income | Liabilities for  which changes  in credit risk are  presented in  profit or loss | Total   |\n| Carrying amount at end of year                                            | 1,715                                                                                            | 103,223                                                                          | 104,938 | 1,371                                                                                            | 94,714                                                                           | 96,085  |\n| Amount to be paid at maturity 1                                           | 1,634                                                                                            | 108,600                                                                          | 110,234 | 1,634                                                                                            | 103,688                                                                          | 105,322 |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes in own credit  risk, during the year | 13                                                                                               | 98                                                                               | 111     | 7                                                                                                | -43                                                                              | -36     |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes in own credit  risk, accumulated     | 4                                                                                                | -485                                                                             | -481    | -9                                                                                               | -583                                                                             | -592    |",

When Nordea grants mortgage loans to customers in accordance with Danish mortgage legislation, Nordea at the same time issues bonds with matching terms, so-called match funding. The customers can repay the loans either through repayment of the principal or by purchasing the issued bonds and returning them to Nordea settling the loan. The bonds play an important part in the Danish market and Nordea consequently buys and sells own bonds in the market. The loans are measured at fair value through profit or loss because they fail the SPPI criteria, and if the bonds were measured at amortised cost, this would give rise to an accounting mismatch. To avoid such an accounting mismatch, Nordea measures the bonds at fair value with all changes in fair value, including changes in credit risk, recognised in profit or loss. Changes in fair value due to changes in own credit risk on bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkredit-aktieselskab are calculated by determining the amount of fair value changes that is not attributable to changes in market conditions. The method used to estimate the amount of changes in market conditions is based on relevant benchmark interest rates which are the average yields on Danish and German (EUR) government bonds. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk. The changes in own credit risk on mortgage bonds issued by Nordea Kredit\n\nRealkreditaktieselskab are not recognised in other comprehensive income as that would create an accounting mismatch with the corresponding change in the fair value of the mortgage loans that are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nNordea also applies the fair value option to structured bonds issued by Markets, EUR 1,715m (EUR 1,371m), as these hybrid instruments, such as issued index-linked bonds, include embedded derivatives not closely related to the host contract. The host contract together with the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. The change in the fair value of these issued structured bonds is recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value' except for the changes in own credit risk, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Nordea calculates the change in its own credit spread as the change in its total funding spread, thus assuming a constant issuance premium on all issues over time. The change in the credit spread is estimated by comparing the value of the trades using the initial funding spread on the issuance date and the actual funding spread on the reporting date. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk.\n\nAlso deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts, EUR 51,573m (EUR 44,770m), of which EUR 47,322m (EUR 40,600m) relates to Life & Pension, are designated at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed at fair value. The value of these deposits is directly linked to the fair value of the underlying assets, and changes in own credit risk consequently have no net impact.",

The fair value measurement assumes that the transaction takes place under current market conditions in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe existence of published price quotations in an active market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist, they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The absolute level of liquidity and volume required for a market to be considered active varies depending on the class of instruments.\n\nThe trade frequency and volume are monitored regularly in order to assess if markets are active or not active. If quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions or if quoted prices are not available, fair value is established by using an appropriate valuation technique. The adequacy of the valuation technique, including an assessment of whether to use quoted prices or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nValuation techniques can range from a simple discounted cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models. Valuation techniques are designed to apply observable market prices and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use of unobservable model parameters. The adequacy of the valuation technique is assessed by measuring its ability to match market prices. This is done by comparing calculated prices with relevant benchmark data, e.g. quoted prices from exchanges, the counterparty's valuations, price data from consensus services etc.\n\nFor financial instruments whose fair value is estimated by a valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables used are predominantly based on data from observable markets. Nordea considers data from observable markets to be data that can be collected from generally available external sources and which is deemed to represent realistic market prices. If unobservable data has a significant impact on the valuation, the instrument cannot be recognised initially at the fair value estimated by the valuation technique and any upfront gains are thereby deferred and amortised through the income statement over the contractual life of the instrument. The deferred upfront gains are subsequently released to income if the unobservable data becomes observable.\n\nFair value measurements of assets and liabilities are categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The categorisation of these instruments is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nLevel 1 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities where directly quoted market prices are not available in active markets. The fair values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Alternatively, the fair values are estimated using valuation techniques based on market prices or inputs prevailing at the balance sheet date and where unobservable inputs have not had a significant impact on the fair values.\n\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities for which fair values cannot be obtained directly from quoted market prices or indirectly using valuation techniques or models supported by observable market prices or rates.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nCritical judgements that have a significant impact on the recognised amounts for financial instruments are exercised when determining the fair value of OTC derivatives and other financial instruments that lack quoted prices or where recently observed market prices are not available, such as unlisted equities. The judgements relate to the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 The choice of valuation techniques.\n- \u00b7 The determination of when quoted prices fail to represent fair value (including the judgement of whether markets are active).\n- \u00b7 The calculation of fair value adjustments in order to incorporate relevant risk factors such as credit risk, model risk and liquidity risk.\n- \u00b7 The judgement of which market parameters are observable.\n\nThe critical judgements required when determining the fair value of financial instruments that lack quoted prices or where recently observed market prices are not available also introduce a high degree of estimation uncertainty.\n\nIn all of these instances, decisions are based on professional judgement in accordance with Nordea's accounting and valuation policies. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value using a valuation technique, Levels 2 and 3 in the fair value hierarchy, was EUR 164,037m (EUR 162,018m) and EUR 161,770m (EUR 120,620m), respectively, at the end of the year. Valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA, FFVA, NFVA, close-out cost adjustment, model risk adjustment and IPV variance) made when determining the fair value of financial instruments (including those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income) had a negative impact on equity of EUR -82m (EUR -47m).\n\nSensitivity analysis disclosures covering the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs can be found in the table 'Valuation techniques and inputs used in fair value measurements of financial instruments in Level 3' in this note.\n\nEstimation uncertainty also arises at initial recognition of financial instruments that are part of larger structural transactions. Although subsequently not necessarily held at fair value, such instruments are initially recognised at fair value, and as there is normally no separate transaction price or active market for such individual instruments, the fair value has to be estimated.",

New pricing models are subject to approval by the Model Risk Committee and all pricing models are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nComplex valuation techniques are generally characterised by the use of unobservable and model-specific inputs. All valuation techniques, both simple and complex models, make use of market prices and inputs, which comprise interest rates, volatilities, correlations etc. Some of these prices and inputs are observable while others are not. For most non-exotic currencies, the interest rates are all observable, and implied volatilities and the correlations of the interest rates and FX rates may be observable through option prices up to a certain maturity. Implied volatilities and correlations may also be observable for the most liquid equity instruments. For less liquid equity names, the option market is fairly illiquid, and hence implied volatilities and correlations are unobservable.\n\nNordea predominantly uses published price quotations to establish the fair value of items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities\n- \u00b7 Shares (listed)\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (listed)\n- \u00b7 Debt securities in issue (mortgage bonds issued by Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab).\n\nNordea predominantly uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of items disclosed under the following balance sheet items:\n\n- \u00b7 Loans to the public (mortgage loans in Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab)\n- \u00b7 Interest-bearing securities (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Shares (when quoted prices in an active market are not available)\n- \u00b7 Deposits\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (OTC derivatives).\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, cont.\n\n|                                                                    | 31 Dec 2023      | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022      | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                               | Carrying  amount | Fair   value  | Carrying  amount | Fair   value  |\n| Financial liabilities                                              |                  |               |                  |               |\n| Deposits and debt  instruments 1                                   | 426,965          | 427,651       | 433,362          | 435,547       |\n| Deposits in pooled  schemes and unit- linked investment  contracts | 51,573           | 51,573        | 44,770           | 44,770        |\n| Derivatives                                                        | 30,794           | 30,794        | 40,102           | 40,102        |\n| Other liabilities 2                                                | 11,058           | 11,058        | 14,314           | 14,314        |\n| Accrued expenses   and prepaid income                              | 8                | 8             | 7                | 7             |\n| Total                                                              | 520,398          | 521,084       | 532,555          | 534,740       |\n\nFor interest-bearing securities, the valuation can either be based on direct quotes in active markets or measured using a valuation technique.\n\nFor OTC derivatives, valuation techniques are usually developed in-house and based on assumptions about the behaviour of the underlying asset and on statistical scenario analysis. Most OTC derivatives are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, implying that all significant model inputs are observable in active markets.\n\nValuations of private equity funds, credit funds and unlisted equity instruments are by nature more uncertain than valuations of more actively traded equity instruments. Emphasis is put on using a consistent approach across all assets and over time. The methods used are consistent with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued by the IPEV Board. The guidelines are considered as best practice in the industry. For US-based funds, similar methods are applied.\n\nFurthermore, Nordea holds loans and issued debt securities in the subsidiary Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab at fair value. When Nordea grants mortgage loans to borrowers, in accordance with the Danish mortgage legislation, Nordea at the same time issues debt securities with matching terms, so-called match funding. The fair value of the debt securities issued is based on quoted prices. As borrowers have the right to purchase debt securities issued by Nordea in the market and return these as repayment for their loans, the fair value of the loans is the same as the fair value of the bonds issued (due to the revaluation of the repayment option embedded in the loan) adjusted for changes in the credit risk of the borrower and the fair value of the margin associated with each loan.\n\nDeposits held at fair value primarily relate to assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts where the fair value of the deposits equal the fair value of the assets held on behalf of customers.\n\nThe fair value of financial assets and liabilities is generally calculated as the theoretical net present value of the individual instruments. This calculation is supplemented by portfolio adjustments.",

        "page_content": "Business areas\n\nStrategic report\n\nG3.4  Fair value, cont.\n\nNordea incorporates credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) into derivative valuations. CVAs and DVAs reflect the impact on fair value from the counterparty's credit risk and Nordea's own credit quality, respectively. Calculations are based on estimates of exposure at default, probability of default (PD) and recovery rates on a counterparty basis. Generally, exposure at default for CVAs and DVAs is based on the expected exposure and estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors. Where possible, Nordea obtains credit spreads from the credit default swap (CDS) market, and PD is inferred from this data. For counterparties that do not have a liquid CDS, the PD is estimated using a cross-sectional regression model, which calculates an appropriate proxy CDS spread based on each counterparty's rating, region and industry.\n\nThe impact of funding costs and funding benefits on the valuation of uncollateralised and imperfectly collateralised derivatives is partly reflected in the calculated net present value through the applied discounting curve and partly through the addition of a separate funding fair valuation adjustment (FFVA). In addition, Nordea applies close-out cost valuation adjustments, model risk adjustments for identified model deficiencies and adjustments for independent price verification (IPV) to its fair value measurement.\n\nNordea's pricing models are calibrated to the market, and if climate risk has any impact on a particular market, it will already have been taken into consideration by other market participants. Hence, Nordea has not implemented any changes to its pricing models to take climate risk into account and no critical valuation adjustments have been made. Going forward, Nordea will monitor areas in the valuation space where climate risk could have an impact on the models (e.g. in relation to credit valuation adjustment).\n\nIn the below table, fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the balance sheet have been categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (Level 1), a valuation technique using observable data (Level 2) and a valuation technique using unobservable data (Level 3).\n\nThe Level 1 category includes listed derivatives, listed equities, government bonds in developed countries as well as the most liquid mortgage bonds and corporate bonds where direct tradable price quotes exist. The Level 2 category includes the majority of Nordea's OTC derivatives, securities purchased/sold under resale/repurchase agreements, securities borrowed/lent, deposits in pooled schemes and unitlinked investment contracts and other instruments where active markets supply the input to the valuation techniques or pricing models. The Level 3 category includes investments in unlisted securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, more complex OTC derivatives where unobservable input has a significant impact on fair value, certain complex or structured financial instruments and illiquid interest-bearing securities.\n\n## Transfers between Levels 1 and 2\n\nDuring the year Nordea transferred items recognised in the line item 'Interest-bearing securities' of EUR 10,577m (EUR 4,030m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and of EUR 280m (EUR 1,570m) from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Furthermore, Nordea transferred items recognised in the line item 'Debt securities in issue' of EUR 25,685m (EUR 2,989m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and of EUR 1,105m (EUR 3,731m) from Level 2 to Level 1. Nordea also transferred items recognised in the line item 'Other liabilities' of EUR 294m (EUR 43m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and of EUR 8m (EUR 235m) from Level 2 to Level 1. The transfer of 'Interest-bearing securities' and 'Debt securities in issue' from Level 1 to Level 2 were mainly due to a reassessment of trading activity. Other transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 were due to the instruments ceasing to be actively traded during the year, which meant that fair values were obtained using valuation techniques with observable market inputs. The transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 were due to the instruments again being actively traded during the year, which meant that reliable quoted prices were obtained in the market. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year.",

The first step is to determine the end-of-day mid-prices. It is the responsibility of the business areas to determine the correct prices for the valuation process. These prices are either internally marked prices set by a trading unit or externally sourced prices. The valuation prices are then controlled and tested by a valuation control function within the first line of defence,\n\nwhich is independent from the risk-taking units of the front office. The cornerstone of the control process is the independent price verification (IPV). The IPV test comprises verification of the correctness of valuations by comparing end-of-day mid-prices to independently sourced data. The result of the IPV is analysed and any findings are escalated as appropriate. Also, adjustments for IPV variances are included in fair value. The verification of the correctness of prices and inputs is as a",

In case the exposure to an unobservable parameter is offset across different instruments, only the net impact is disclosed in the table. The range disclosed is likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in determining the fair value of these instruments as all unobservable parameters are in practice unlikely to be simul-\n\ntaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. The disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.\n\nThe reported sensitivity (range) of the fair value of derivatives follows the same methodologies as applied to the reporting of the model risk and market price uncertainty additional valuation adjustments (AVAs) as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/101 of 26 October 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for prudent valuation under Article 105(14).",

Higher ranges are applied to instruments with more uncertain valuations relative to actively traded instruments and underlying uncertainties in individual assumptions.\n\n## Movement of deferred Day 1 profit\n\nIn some cases, the transaction price for financial instruments differs from the fair value at initial recognition measured using a valuation technique, mainly due to the fact that the transaction price is not established in an active market. If there are significant unobservable inputs used in the valutaion technique (Level 3), the financial instrument is recognised at the transaction price and any difference between the\n\ntransaction price and the fair value at initial recognition measured using a valuation technique (Day 1 profit) is deferred.

Balances with central banks are due to its short-term nature considered to be equivalent to cash and therefore also categorised into Level 1.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe fair value of 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions' and 'Loans to the public' has been estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows with an assumed customer interest rate that would have been used in the market if the loans had been issued at the time of the measurement. The assumed customer interest rate is calculated as the benchmark interest rate plus the average margin on new lending in Personal Banking, Business Banking and Large Corporates & Institutions, respectively.\n\nThe fair value measurement is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Interest bearing-securities\n\nThe fair value is EUR 838m (EUR 38m), of which EUR 804m (EUR 20m) is categorised into Level 2 and EUR 34m (EUR 18m) into Level 3. The measurement principles follow those for similar instruments that are held at fair value on the balance sheet.\n\n## Other assets and prepaid expenses and accrued income\n\nThe balance sheet line items 'Other assets' and 'Prepaid ex-penses and accrued income' consist of short-term receivables. The fair value is therefore considered to equal the carrying amount and is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",

However, for non-maturing deposits the fair value equals the nominal amount. The fair value is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value changes related to interest rate risk are based on changes in relevant interest rates compared with the corresponding nominal interest rates of the portfolios.\n\nThe fair value changes in credit risk are calculated as the difference between the credit spread of the nominal interest rate and the current spread observed in the market.

The legal right to offset should exist both in the ordinary course of business and in case of the default, bankruptcy and insolvency of Nordea and its counterparties.\n\n## Financial instruments set off on the balance sheet or subject to netting agreements\n\n|                                 |                                        |                                                                     |                                          | Amounts not set off but subject to master   netting agreements and similar agreements   | Amounts not set off but subject to master   netting agreements and similar agreements   | Amounts not set off but subject to master   netting agreements and similar agreements   |            |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm               | Gross  recognised  financial  assets 1 | Gross recognised  financial liabilities  set off on  balance  sheet | Net carrying  amount on  balance sheet 2 | Financial  instruments                                                                  | Financial  collateral  received                                                         | Cash   collateral  received                                                             | Net amount |\n| Assets                          |                                        |                                                                     |                                          |                                                                                         |                                                                                         |                                                                                         |            |\n| Derivatives 3                   | 172,533                                | -146,010                                                            | 26,523                                   | -21,966                                                                                 | -

As the contractual maturity is short for 'Deposits by credit institutions' and 'Deposits and borrowings from the public', the changes in Nordea's own credit risk related to these items are assumed not to be significant. This is also the case for short-term issuance recognised in the balance sheet line items 'Debt securities in issue' and 'Subordinated liabilities'.\n\n## Other liabilities and accrued expenses and prepaid income\n\nThe balance sheet items 'Other liabilities' and 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income' consist of short-term liabilities, mainly liabilities related to securities traded but not settled. The fair value is therefore considered to be equal to the carrying amount and is categorised into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",

Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities against central counterparty clearing houses are set off on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities are settled in the same transaction currency and relate to the same central counterparty. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities related to bilateral OTC derivative transactions are not set off on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions with central counterparty clearing houses are set off on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same central counterparty, are settled in the same currency and have the same maturity date. Loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions that are made in accordance with the\n\nGlobal Master Repurchase Agreement are set off on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are settled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and are settled through the same settlement institution.\n\nThe fact that a financial instrument is accounted for on a gross basis on the balance sheet does not imply that the financial instruments are not subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Generally, financial instruments (derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions) are subject to master netting agreements, and Nordea is consequently able to benefit from netting in any calculations involving counterparty credit risk in the event of the default of its counterparties.\n\nFor a description of counterparty risk, see also Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management', section 3 'Counterparty credit risk'.",

A hedge is regarded as highly effective if, at inception and throughout its life, changes in the fair value of the hedged item, as regards the hedged risk, can be expected to be essentially offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The result should be within a range of 80-125%.\n\nTransactions that are entered into in accordance with Nordea's hedging objectives but do not qualify for hedge accounting are economic hedge relationships.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are hedging changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability attributable to a specific risk. Fair value hedge accounting can be performed at both micro level (single assets/liabilities or closed portfolios of assets/liabilities where one or more hedged items are hedged using one or more hedging instruments) and macro level (open portfolios where groups of items are hedged using multiple hedging instruments).\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives (hedging instruments), as well as changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged, are recognised separately in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. Given that the hedge is effective, the change in the fair value of the hedged item will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe changes in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the risks being hedged with the derivative instrument, are reflected in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item, which is also recognised in the income statement. The fair value changes of the hedged items held at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risks in macro hedges are reported separately in the balance sheet item 'Fair value changes of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk'.\n\nAny ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement under the item 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. The hedging instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss and the change in the fair value of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge relationship is terminat-\n\ned, is amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the hedged item.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging the exposure to variability in future cash flows. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the item 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement. The hedge is considered to be ineffective to the extent that the cumulative change in fair value from the inception of the hedge is larger for the hedging instrument than for the hedged item.\n\nGains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other comprehensive income are recycled and recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item affects profit or loss, normally in the period in which interest income or interest expense is recognised.\n\nA hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable cash flows from recognised assets or liabilities or from future assets or liabilities. Derivatives used as hedging instruments are always measured at fair value.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument will prospectively from the last time it was proven effective be accounted for in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective is reclassified from equity to 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement if the expected transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nIf the expected transaction is no longer highly probable but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective will remain in other comprehensive income until the transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nNet investment hedges are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of net investments in foreign operations. Foreign currency risk is defined as the risk of loss on investments in foreign operations which have a functional currency different from that of the Group reporting currency.\n\nThe foreign exchange spot risk component of financial instruments that are designated as hedging instruments in a hedge of a net investment in a group undertaking is recognised in other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge is effective. This is to offset the translation differences affecting other comprehensive income when consolidating the group undertaking into Nordea, including the revaluation of any extended net investments. Any ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nSee also section 'Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies' in Note G1 'Accounting policies'.",

The currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of the currency risk (including cross-currency basis margin and swap points) and the interest component as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk. The hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges, meaning that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction (the currency component). Critical judgement has to be exercised when defining the characteristics of the perfect hypothetical swap.\n\n## Derivatives used for hedge accounting\n\n|                       | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm     | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges 1   | 3,990        | 5,587        | 199,492         |\n| Cash flow hedges 1    | 1,625        | 301          | 20,491          |\n| Net investment hedges | 499          | 734          | 4,861           |\n| Total                 | 6,114        | 6,622        | 224,844         |\n\n|                       | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm     | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges 1   | 4,899        | 7,514        | 190,844         |\n| Cash flow hedges 1    | 1,466        | 251          | 18,738          |\n| Net investment hedges | 241          | 200          | 3,565           |\n| Total                 | 6,606        | 7,965        | 213,147         |\n\nThe table above shows the fair value of derivatives used for hedge accounting together with their nominal amounts. The nominal amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at year end and are neither indicative of market risk nor credit risk. The fair value and nominal amount of derivatives in this note represent derivatives before offsetting between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet (gross amount) as the gross amount better reflects Nordea's exposure in relation to the hedged risk.\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs part of its risk management policy, Nordea has identified a series of risk categories with corresponding hedging strategies using derivative instruments, as set out in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nNordea classifies its exposures to market risk into either trading (the trading book) or non-trading (the banking book) portfolios which are managed separately.\n\nThe trading book consists of all positions in financial instruments held by Nordea either with trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. Positions held with trading intent are those held intentionally for short-\n\nterm resale or with the intention of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price differences between buying and selling prices or from other price or interest rate variations.\n\nThe banking book comprises all positions not held in the trading book. All hedges qualifying for hedge accounting are treated as banking book instruments. The hedging instruments and risks hedged are further described below by risk and hedge accounting type.\n\nAt inception, Nordea formally documents how the hedging relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, including the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and the method used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nNordea's primary business model is to collect deposits and use these funds to provide loans and other funding products and debt instruments to its customers. Interest rate risk is the impact that changes in interest rates could have on Nordea's margins, profit or loss and equity. Interest rate risk arises from mismatches between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nAs part of Nordea's risk management strategy, the Board has established limits on the non-trading interest rate gaps for interest rate sensitivities. These limits are consistent with Nordea's risk appetite and Nordea aligns its hedge accounting objectives to keep exposures within those limits. Nordea's policy is to monitor positions on a daily basis. For further information on measurement of risks, see section 4 'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nFor hedge accounting relationships related to interest rate risk, the hedged risk is the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The hedge ratio is established by matching the nominal amount of the derivatives with the principal of the hedged items.\n\nIn order to hedge and manage the risk and limit the impact on Nordea's margins, profit or loss and equity, Nordea uses hedging instruments to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates.\n\nThe risk components of hedged items designated by the Group consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, i.e. IBORs which also include new alternative reference rates such as SOFR, ESTR or SONIA. Using the benchmark interest rate risk can result in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.\n- \u00b7 Components of cash flows of hedged items.\n\nThe benchmark rate is determined as a change in the present value of the future cash flows using benchmark discount curves. The benchmark rate is separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is typically the most significant component of the overall change in fair value or cash flows.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nNordea enters into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps in order to reduce or eliminate changes in the fair value of the hedged items due to interest rate risk.\n\nHedged items are fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities in both local and foreign currencies such as loans, debt securities classified in the category \"Fair value through other comprehensive income\", deposits and debt securities in issue.\n\nHedging instruments are interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps (the portion related to interest rate risk is designated in fair value hedge relationships).",

        "page_content": "Business areas\n\nG3.6  Hedge accounting, cont.\n\nNordea applies fair value hedge accounting both at micro and macro level. The micro level is applied for hedging fixedrate debt securities classified in the category \"Fair value through other comprehensive income\" and fixed-rate debt securities in issue. The macro level is applied for hedging loans and deposits where fixed-rate loans and term deposits are initially offset and the residual exposure hedged using a portfolio of interest rate swaps up to the designated portion of either the net asset or liability in a given time bucket.\n\nFor hedge effectiveness testing Nordea uses both critical terms matching (for prospective effectiveness testing) and regression analysis (for retrospective effectiveness testing). When assessing hedge effectiveness retrospectively, Nordea measures the fair value of a hedging instrument and compares the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. The effectiveness measurement is made on a cumulative basis.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 differences in timing of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 different interest rate curves applied to discount the hedged items and hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 the effect of changes in Nordea's or a counterparty's credit risk on the fair value of the hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 the disparity between expected and actual prepayments on the loan portfolio.\n\nNordea has an established hedging programme for non-maturing core deposits (NMD) and applies hedge accounting in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The\n\nbehavioural model is subject to regular semi-annual reviews and/or recalibration of risk parameters. The most recent review of the model performed in 2023 addressed the changes in the behavioural pass-through sensitivities of market to customer rates in relation to the increased interest rate environment, which impacted the expected repricing profile (modelled maturity) of the non-maturing deposits (modelled split of NMDs into an interest sensitive and non-interest sensitive portion).\n\nThe hedging approach is based on a target hedge ratio and deviation band set by the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) commensurate with Nordea's risk appetite limits for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB). The overall hedging strategy assumes that a conservative buffer of the eligible and unhedged portion of non-maturing deposits is maintained above the hedged bottom layer. The average volume of the hedged portion in 2023 amounted to EUR 31.1bn (EUR 24.3bn), as of 31 December 2023 the hedged portion amounted to EUR 35.4n (EUR 27.4bn) and as of 31 December 2023 the hedge ratio was 52% (40%). Nordea's assessment is that the risk of unanticipated deposit withdrawals by bank customers that would have significant impact on, or lead to discontinuation of, the NMD hedging relationships is low. Nordea assesses the risk and potential impact of deposit outflow that could lead to a discontinuation of the hedging relationship in the reverse stress testing program.\n\nThe table below presents the accumulated fair value adjustments arising from continuing and discontinued hedging.\n\n## Hedged items\n\n|                                 | Interest rate risk 2023                        | Interest rate risk 2023                                         | Interest rate risk 2022                        | Interest rate risk 2022                                         |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                            | Carrying amount of  hedged assets/ liabilities | Of which  accumulated amount  of fair value hedge  adjustment 2 | Carrying amount of  hedged assets/ liabilities | Of which  accumulated amount  of fair value hedge  adjustment 2 |\n| Fair value hedges -

This variability in cash flows is hedged by interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the hedged cash flows according to Nordea's policies and risk management strategy described in section 4 'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nThe hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring the effectiveness of cash flow hedges retrospectively, meaning that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows from the hedged transaction. The hypothetical derivative represents the characteristics of the hedged items (variable rate loans) in terms of hedged volume, repricing and interest payment periods. Hedge effectiveness is calculated on a cumulative basis by comparing changes in a portfolio of interest rate swaps (hedging instruments) and hypothetical derivatives. Changes in the valuation of the hedging instruments that are part of effective cash flow hedge relationships are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe possible sources of ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges can generally be the same as those in fair value hedges described above. However, for cash flow hedges, prepayment risk is less relevant. The main causes of hedge ineffectiveness arise from the changes in the timing and the amount of forecast future cash flows.\n\nThe table below provides information about the hedging instruments in hedges of interest rate risk, including the nominal amount and the fair value of the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges   |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 0            | 16           | 750             |\n\n|                    | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm  | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges   |              |              |                 |\n| Interest rate risk | 368          | 42           | 4,579           |\n\nThe table below specifies changes in the fair value of hedging instruments arising from continuing hedging relationships, irrespective of whether there has been a change in hedge designation during the year.

Foreign exchange risk from trading activities is limited through a VaR limit. Foreign exchange risk from structural exposures (as described below) is limited through a stress loss limit for the CET1 ratio impact from foreign exchange fluctuations in a severe but plausible stress scenario. See section 4 'Market risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nNordea's issuance of credits and borrowing can be denominated in the currency of the borrower or investor. Borrowing, investing and lending are not always executed in the same currency, thus exposing Nordea to a foreign exchange risk. Differences in exposures to individual currencies that exist between different transactions are predominantly matched by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps (for maturities below one year FX swaps/FX forwards are used). The currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of the currency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk.\n\nIn addition to the above, Nordea also has exposure to structural foreign currency risk through its foreign operations that have a functional currency other than Nordea's presentation currency, EUR (i.e. a translation risk). Fluctuations in spot exchange rates will cause Nordea's reported net investments in foreign operations to vary and the CET1 ratio to fluctuate due to the currency mismatch between equity and risk exposure amounts. Nordea applies hedge accounting when hedging its investments in fully consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is not EUR.\n\nFor hedge accounting relationships related to currency risk, the hedged item is a foreign currency component. The hedge ratio is established by matching the nominal amounts of the derivatives with the principals of the hedged items.\n\nThe currency component is determined as the change in the present value of the future cash flows using foreign exchange curves. The foreign currency component is separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is typically the most significant component of the overall change in fair value or cash flows.\n\n## Cash flow and net investment hedges\n\nHedged items in cash flow hedges of currency risk are future payments of interest and the nominal amount from (1) issuance in foreign currencies (bonds issued, certificates of deposits and commercial paper) as well as (2) intra-group lending in foreign currencies where the foreign exchange impact is not eliminated on consolidation. For shorter maturities (below one year) Nordea uses FX-swaps/FX forwards as hedging instruments. For longer maturities (above one year) Nordea uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, both float to float and fixed to float, of which the portion related to foreign currency risk, including the cross-currency basis impact, is designated as a cash flow hedge. Hedging relationships are established at micro or macro level.\n\nFor net investment hedges, Nordea uses short-term foreign exchange swaps as hedging instruments, and changes to the spot rate are designated as the hedged risk. Hedge ineffectiveness can arise to the extent that the hedging instruments exceed in nominal terms the risk exposure from foreign operations.\n\nThe tables below provide information about the hedging instruments in hedges of currency risks, including the nominal amount and the fair value of the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                                              | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm                            | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 1,625        | 285          | 19,741          |\n| Net investment hedges                        |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 499          | 734          | 4,861           |\n| Total derivatives used for hedge  accounting | 2,124        | 1,019        | 24,602          |\n\n|                                              | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm                            | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 1,098        | 209          | 14,159          |\n| Net investment hedges                        |              |              |                 |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        | 241          | 200          | 3,565           |\n| Total derivatives used for hedge  accounting | 1,339        | 409          | 17,724          |",

Loans are classified and measured in accordance with the description in Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'. Nordea's accounting policies covering expected credit losses follow below. Additional information on the credit risk on loans is disclosed in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nFinancial instruments classified as 'Amortised cost' or 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are subject to impairment testing due to credit risk. This includes assets recognised on the balance sheet in 'Loans to central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest- bearing securities'. 'Loans to the public' includes finance leases, which are also subject to impairment testing. These balance sheet line items also include assets classified as 'Fair value through profit or loss', which are not subject to impairment testing. See also Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement'.\n\nOff-balance sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and loan commitments are also subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Recognition and presentation\n\nAmortised cost assets are recognised gross with an offsetting allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not regarded as final. The allowance account is netted against the loan balance on the face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is disclosed separately in this note. Changes in the allowance account are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nIf the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised. An\n\nimpairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the financial outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when Nordea waives its claims either through a legally based or voluntary reconstruction, or when Nordea, for other reasons, deems it unlikely that the claim will be recovered. See also the section 'Write-offs' below.\n\nProvisions for off-balance sheet exposures are classified as 'Provisions' on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nAssets classified as 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet. Impairment losses calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'. Any fair value adjustments are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nNordea classifies all exposures into stages on an individual basis. Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 (impaired loans) includes defaulted assets. Nordea monitors whether there are indicators of exposures being credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows. Nordea applies the same definition of default as the Capital Requirements Regulation. More information on the identification of loss events can be found in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'. Exposures without individually calculated allowances will be covered by the model-based impairment calculation.\n\nFor significant exposures where a credit event has been identified, the exposure is tested for impairment on an individual basis. If the exposure is found impaired, an individual provision is recognised. The carrying amount of the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the carrying amount is higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss. The expected cash flows are discounted at the original effective interest rate and include the fair value of the collateral and other credit enhancements. The estimate is based on three different forward-looking scenarios that are probability weighted to derive the net present value.\n\nFor insignificant exposures that have been individually identified as credit impaired, the impairment loss is measured using the model described below but based on the fact that the exposures are already in default.\n\nNordea uses the 'low credit risk exemption' for exposures issued after transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018. Such exposures with a 12-month probability of default (PD) below 0.3% are classified as stage 1. Nordea also applies this exception to a minor portfolio of interest-bearing securities in its insurance operations.\n\n## Model-based allowance calculation\n\nFor exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical model is used for calculating impairment losses. The provisions are calculated as the exposure at default times the PD times the loss given default. The provisions for exposures for which there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are based on the 12-month expected loss (stage 1). The provisions for exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but which are not credit impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2). This is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired exposures in stage 3.",

For assets held on transition to IFRS 9, the change in internal rating and scoring data is used to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. Internal rating/scoring information is used to assess the risk of the customers and a deterioration in rating/scoring indicates an increase in the credit risk of the customer. Nordea has concluded that it is not possible to calculate the lifetime PD at origination without the use of hindsight for assets already recognised on the balance sheet at transition. Changes to the lifetime PD are used as the trigger for assets recognised after transition.\n\nFor assets evaluated based on lifetime PD, Nordea uses a mix of absolute and relative changes in PD as the transfer criterion.\n\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 45bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 1%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 300bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 20bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 400bp are transferred to stage 2.\n\nFor assets for which rating and scoring models are used, the change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime PD.\n\nIn addition, Nordea applies the following backstops for transfers between stages:\n\n- \u00b7 Customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are transferred to stage 2, unless already identified as credit impaired (stage 3). Exposures with forbearance measures will stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when the measures were introduced. Once transferred back to stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated as any other stage 1 exposure on the assessment of significant increase in credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Exposures more than 90 days past due are normally classified as stage 3, but this classification will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in default. Such exposures are classified as stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Exposures with a relative change in annualised lifetime PD exceeding 200% and with at least one rating grade of deterioration are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Exposures classified as 'high risk', i.e. with a rating grade of 2 or below, are transferred to stage 2.\n\nWhen calculating provisions, including the staging assessment, the calculation is based on both historical data and probability-weighted forward-looking information. Nordea applies three macroeconomic scenarios to address the non-linearity in expected credit losses. The different scenarios are used to adjust the relevant parameters for calculating expected losses and a probability-weighted average of the expected losses under each scenario is recognised as provisions. The model is based on data collected before the report-\n\ning date, requiring Nordea to identify events that could affect the provisions after the data is sourced to the model calculation. Management evaluates these events and adjusts the provisions if deemed necessary.\n\n## Write-offs\n\nA write-off is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision. When assets are considered uncollectible, they should be written off as soon as possible, regardless of whether the legal claim remains or not. A write-off can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded in full. Although an uncollectible asset is removed or written off from the balance sheet, the customer remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt. When assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and determining if write-offs are required, exposures with the following characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 Exposures past due more than 90 days. If, following this assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed as unrecoverable, it is written off.\n- \u00b7 Exposures under insolvency procedures where the collateralisation of the exposure is low.\n- \u00b7 Exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb the proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure and estimated recoveries are therefore expected to be low.\n- \u00b7 A partial write-off may be warranted where there is reasonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of the borrower to repay the full amount, i.e. a significant level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the execution of collateral.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring cases.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate used to measure impairment is the original effective interest rate for loans attached to an individual customer or, if applicable, to a group of loans. If considered appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation using the effective interest rate method as basis for the calculation.\n\n## Restructured loans and modifications\n\nIn this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where Nordea has granted concessions to the obligor due to their financial difficulties and where such concessions have resulted in an impairment loss for Nordea. After restructuring, the loan is normally regarded as not impaired if it performs according to the new terms and conditions. In the event of recovery, the payment is reported as recovery of loan losses.\n\nModifications of the contractual cash flows of loans to customers in financial difficulties (forbearance) reduce the gross carrying amount of the loan. Normally this reduction is less than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in the income statement due to modifications. If significant, the gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced.\n\n## Assets taken over for protection of claims\n\nIn a financial reconstruction the creditor may concede loans to the obligor and in exchange for this concession acquires an asset pledged for the conceded loans, shares issued by the obligor or other assets. Assets taken over for protection of claims are reported on the same balance sheet line as similar assets already held by Nordea. For example, a property taken over, not held for Nordea's own use, is reported together with other investment properties.",

The fair value of the asset on the date of recognition becomes its cost or amortised cost value, as applicable. In subsequent periods, assets taken over for protection of claims are valued in accordance with the valuation principles for the appropriate type of asset. Investment properties are then measured at fair value. Financial assets that are foreclosed are generally classified in the category 'Fair value through profit or loss' and measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nAny change in value, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, is presented in the income statement in line with the Group's presentation policies for the appropriate asset. The item 'Net loan losses' in the income statement is, after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, consequently not affected by any subsequent remeasurement of the asset.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nManagement is required to exercise critical judgements and estimates when calculating loan impairment allowances. Nordea's total lending at amortised cost before impairment allowances was EUR 276,025m (EUR 279,614m) at the end of the year.\n\nWhen calculating allowances for individually significant impaired loans, judgement is exercised to estimate the amount and timing of the expected cash flows to be received from the\n\ncustomers under different scenarios, including the valuation of any collateral received. Judgement is also applied when assigning the likelihood of the different scenarios occurring.\n\nJudgement is exercised to assess when an exposure has experienced a significant increase in credit risk. If this is the case, the provision should reflect the lifetime expected losses as opposed to a 12-month expected loss amount for exposures that have not increased significantly in credit risk. Judgement is also exercised in the choice of modelling approaches covering other parameters used when calculating the expected losses, such as the expected lifetime used in stage 2, as well as in the assessment of whether the parameters based on historical experience are relevant for estimating future losses.\n\nThe statistical models used to calculate provisions are based on macroeconomic scenarios, which requires management to exercise judgement when identifying such scenarios and when assigning the likelihood of the different scenarios occurring. Judgement is also exercised in the assessment of to what extent the parameters for the different scenarios, based on historical experience, are relevant for estimating future losses. Nordea adjusts its collectively calculated provisions if the historical data does not adequately reflect management's view regarding expected credit losses. Estimating post-model adjustments requires management to exercise critical judgements.\n\nFor information about critical judgements in the preparation of this Annual Report due to the uncertainty concerning the potential long-term impact of higher energy and raw material prices and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors on Nordea's financial statements, see Note G1 'Accounting policies'.\n\n## Loans and impairment\n\n| EURm                                                            | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Loans measured at fair value                                    | 74,728        | 73,248        |\n| Loans measured at amortised cost, not impaired (stages 1 and 2) | 273,568       | 277,359       |\n| Impaired loans (stage 3)                                        | 2,457         | 2,255         |\n| - of which servicing                                            | 1,091         | 1,111         |\n| - of which non-servicing                                        | 1,366         | 1,144         |\n| Loans before allowances                                         | 350,753       | 352,862       |\n| - of which central banks and credit institutions                | 4,293         | 5,475         |\n| Allowances for individually assessed impaired loans (stage 3)   | -1,037        | -1,045        |\n| - of which servicing                                            | -453          | -556          |\n| - of which non-servicing                                        | -584          | -489          |\n| Allowances for collectively assessed loans (stages 1 and 2)     | -616          | -628          |\n| Allowances                                                      | -1,653        | -1,673        |\n| - of which central banks and credit institutions                | -21           | -29           |\n| Loans, carrying amount                                          | 349,100       | 351,189       |\n\nNordea has granted EUR 164bn (EUR 159bn) in mortgage credits.

Unit-linked contracts with investment guarantees or contracts which transfer significant insurance risk are classified as insurance contracts. The deposits received from customers are invested in different types of financial assets on behalf of the customers and policyholders.\n\nThe assets and deposits under these contracts are recognised and measured at fair value as described in Note G3.4 'Fair value'.

Derivatives with a positive fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as assets in the line item 'Derivatives' on the asset side. Derivatives with a negative fair value, including any accrued interest, are recognised as liabilities in the line item 'Derivatives' on the liability side.\n\nNordea incorporates credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) into derivative valuations. CVAs and DVAs reflect the impact on fair value from the counterparty's credit risk and Nordea's own credit quality, respectively. For more information about the calculation and other XVAs, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\nRealised and unrealised gains and losses from derivatives are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from items at fair value'. For more information about accounting policies and critical judgements, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\n## Derivatives\n\n|                                            | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm                          | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Derivatives not used for hedge  accounting | 166,421      | 170,856      | 7,238,112       |\n| Derivatives used for hedge  accounting     | 6,114        | 6,622        | 224,844         |\n| Total gross derivatives                    | 172,535      | 177,478      | 7,462,956       |\n| Derivatives offset on the balance  sheet   | -146,010     | -146,684     |                 |\n| Total derivatives                          | 26,525       | 30,794       | 7,462,956       |\n\n|                                            | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm                          | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Derivatives not used for hedge  accounting | 204,938      | 206,220      | 6,998,966       |\n| Derivatives used for hedge  accounting     | 6,606        | 7,965        | 213,147         |\n| Total gross derivatives                    | 211,544      | 214,185      | 7,212,113       |\n| Derivatives offset on the balance  sheet   | -174,966     | -174,083     |                 |\n| Total derivatives                          | 36,578       | 40,102       | 7,212,113       |",

An insurance contract is defined as 'a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risks from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder'. DPF contracts give the policyholder the contractual right to receive, as a supplement to an amount not subject to the discretion of the issuer, significant additional amounts where the timing or amount is contractually at the discretion of Nordea and the investment returns are linked to a specified pool of assets held by Nordea. Insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF are below referred to as 'insurance contracts'.\n\nFor Nordea, issued contracts accounted for under IFRS 17 include:\n\n- \u00b7 Life insurance.\n- \u00b7 Pension plans with or without guaranteed returns, but with additional bonus.\n- \u00b7 Combined insurance pensions plans with significant additional death benefits.\n- \u00b7 Health and personal accident insurance.\n\n## Unit of account\n\nFor most contracts, the legal contract is the basis for accounting. Unit-linked contracts and Traditional contracts in Sweden are considered to be two separate contracts, a saving contract and a risk contract, for accounting purposes. The unit-linked saving contracts are accounted for under IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and the other contracts are accounted for under IFRS 17. The death cover and other risk covers of the Finnish contracts are regarded as separate accounting contracts, accounted for under IFRS 17.\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nInsurance contracts are recognised from the earliest of:\n\n- \u00b7 the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts,\n- \u00b7 the date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due, and\n- \u00b7 for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous.\n\nInvestment contracts with DPF are recognised from the date the entity becomes party to the contract. Insurance contracts are derecognised when they are extinguished, which means when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or cancelled. Insurance contracts are also derecognised when substantially modified, in which case a new contract is recognised with new terms.\n\n## General measurement model\n\nThe general measurement model is used for an individual risk product in Norway (endowment contracts) and different risk insurance products in Finland.\n\nInsurance contracts are aggregated into portfolios of insurance contracts with similar risks and managed together. For each portfolio, contracts issued in one calendar year are further grouped into annual cohorts. Each of these sets of contracts is then broken down into groups of onerous and profitable contracts. At initial recognition, fulfilment cash flows are estimated for all groups of insurance contracts. For groups of contracts with net positive cash flows (profitable contracts), the contractual service margin (CSM) is an equal and opposite value on initial recognition to the expected net positive cash flows and is recognised as an insurance liability. This is because the entire\n\nvalue of the contracts relates to services to be provided in the future and, therefore, profit to be earned in the future. For groups of contracts with negative fulfilment cash flows (onerous contracts), the negative amount is considered the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and is recognised as a loss in the income statement.\n\nThe fulfilment cash flows consist of the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 Unbiased and Nordea-specific estimates of expected cash flows that will arise as the entity fulfils the contracts. The estimates are updated at each reporting date.\n- \u00b7 An adjustment to reflect the time value of money, in other words the effect of discounting. This also includes the financial risks to the future cash flows, to the extent that the financial risks are not reflected in the estimates of future cash flows.\n- \u00b7 An explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk to reflect the compensation that the entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of cash flows that arise from non-financial risk.\n\nIn subsequent periods, the fulfilment cash flows are reassessed and remeasured at each reporting date, using current assumptions. The CSM is released to the income statement as services are provided. For investment contracts with DPF, the release is based on when investment services are provided and for the remaining contracts it is based on when insurance contract services are provided.\n\n## Variable fee approach\n\nThe variable fee approach is used for all contracts with direct participation features. These contracts are at inception accounted for in the same way as under the general measurement model. Nordea provides investment- and insurancerelated services and is compensated for the services by a fee that is determined with reference to the underlying assets. The CSM is adjusted after initial recognition, where changes related to Nordea's share of the fair value of the underlying assets also adjust the CSM liability. The adjusted CSM is the basis for the future release to the income statement.\n\n## Premium allocation approach\n\nThe premium allocation approach is used for short-term contracts (with a coverage period of less than one year), normally related to health and disability risks, although some such contracts in Finland are measured under the general measurement model. The liability consists of two parts:\n\n- \u00b7 Liability for remaining coverage.\n- \u00b7 Liability for incurred claims.\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage is measured based on unearned premiums received and released to the income statement based on the amount of expected premium receipts allocated to the period on the basis of passage of time. The liability for incurred claims is measured in the same way as under the general measurement model.\n\nNordea has chosen to recognise the acquisition cash flows as expenses when they occur under the PAA model. Under this model when measuring the liability for incurred claims, Nordea adjusts future cash flows for the time value of money if those cash flows are expected to be paid or received more than one year from the date the claims are incurred.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nA valuation of insurance liabilities includes estimations and assumptions, both financial and actuarial, that affect the present value of future cash flows.

        "page_content": "G4  Insurance contract liabilities, cont.\n\nrisk-neutral stochastic modelling techniques are used, while for some products deterministic models are used. The methods and processes used were stable during the year.\n\nThe main assumptions used when calculating the insurance liabilities are explained below.\n\n## In scope of IFRS 17\n\nNordea applies IFRS 17 to insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF.\n\nInsurance contracts are, as stated in the accounting policies above, contracts under which Nordea accepts significant insurance risk from the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.\n\nIf the contract does not transfer any significant insurance risk but contains DPF, it shall be accounted for under IFRS 17 since Nordea also issues insurance contracts. Thus there is a necessity to determine if an investment contract is to be classified as comprising DPF.\n\nThe evaluation of the existence of significant insurance risk is made on a contract-by-contract basis and given that the contract exposes Nordea to insurance risk, further investigation is performed to assess if significant insurance risk exists.\n\nA contract transfers significant insurance risk if there exists any scenario of commercial substance at initial recognition in which the policyholder receives additional amounts (5%-10%) that exceed the investment component. The investment component is defined as the amount that an insurance contract requires Nordea to repay to a policyholder even if an insured event does not occur.\n\nAn investment contract with DPF is defined as a financial instrument that provides a particular investor with the contractual right to receive, as a supplement to an amount not subject to the discretion of Nordea, additional amounts:\n\n- \u00b7 that are expected to be a significant portion (>10 %) of the total contractual benefits,\n- \u00b7 the timing or amount of which are contractually at the discretion of Nordea (profit sharing, mutualisation elements exists and/or Board decided return allocation), and\n- \u00b7 that are contractually based on:\n- -  the returns on a specified pool of contracts or a  specified type of contract,\n- -  realised and/or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by Nordea, or\n- - the profit or loss of Nordea.\n\n## Release of CSM\n\nAn amount of CSM is recognised as profit or loss in each period and the amount reflects the service provided. The release-pattern of the CSM is determined by first identifying coverage units for the group of contracts, representing the quantity of benefits under the expected coverage duration, and secondly release coverage units for each period reflect-\n\ning the service provided. For investment contracts with DPF, the release is based on when investment services are provided and for the remaining contracts it is based on when insurance contract services are provided.\n\n## Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are part of future cash flows and correspond to the costs of maintaining the current in-force business, adjusted for inflation. Increased expected expenses reduce future expected profits. Expenses are allocated to groups of contracts using well-defined methodologies that are consistent over time.\n\n## Surrender rates\n\nPartial and full surrender and transfers of capital affect the insurance liabilities and profits. Surrender assumptions are derived using trends in historical data and vary by e.g. product type and type of contract. Higher surrender rates than assumed will reduce profits if the underlying contracts are profitable.\n\n## Mortality, longevity and morbidity\n\nStandard industry tables are used when setting the assumptions for mortality, longevity and morbidity. The assumptions vary with e.g. the policyholder's gender and age, product type and class. Deviations from the assumed rates will affect the expected future profits.\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk\n\nThe risk adjustment aims to capture the compensation required by Nordea for bearing the uncertainty around the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. Nordea determines the risk adjustment using a single equivalent scenario stress approach, which has a confidence level of 78% (77% in 2022). The stress parameters are updated on a yearly basis. The entire change in risk adjustment is fully presented in the \"Net insurance revenue\" and relates to both current and future services.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nMethods and assumptions used to derive the discount rates are applied consistently within Nordea Life & Pension. Further, for each jurisdiction, the discount rate is consistently applied for all products.\n\nThe discount rate is determined using a bottom-up approach as the sum of a risk-free component and an illiquidity component. The risk-free component ensures that the discount rate reflects the time value of money and is consistent with observable market prices. The illiquidity component reflects the characteristics of the liabilities.\n\nThe discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows are presented in the table below.\n\n|     | 1 year   | 1 year   | 3 years   | 3 years   | 5 years   | 5 years   | 10 years   | 10 years   | 20 years   | 20 years   |\n|-----|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|     | 2023     | 2022     | 2023      | 2022      | 2023      | 2022      | 2023       | 2022       | 2023       | 2022       |\n| EUR | 3.4%     | 3.2%     | 2.0%      | 3.0%      | 2.2%      | 3.0%      | 2.6%       | 3.1%       | 2.4%       | 2.0%       |\n| SEK | 3.0%     | 3.5%     | 2.5%      | 3.3%      | 2.3%      | 3.2%      | 2.3%       | 3.0%       | 2.8%       | 3.2%       |\n| NOK | 4.5%     | 3.8%     | 4.1%      | 3.6%      | 3.8%      | 3.5%      | 3.7%       | 3.5%       | 3.8%       | 3.6%       |\n| DKK | 3.6%     | 3.3%     | 2.7%      | 3.4%      | 2.6%      | 3.3%      | 2.6%       | 3.3%       | 2.7%       | 2.9%       |",

These include market, default, liquidity, operational, business, strategic, regulatory, ESG and underwriting risks. Market and underwriting risks being the most relevant from a capital and profit perspective. More information on these risks, reinsurance and the main sensitivities follows below. Operational risks are described in Note G11 \"Risk and liquidity management\", section 5.\n\nIn addition to compliance with IFRS 17, adherence to  Solvency II is crucial for regulatory compliance and financial stability. More details on Solvency II can be found in the  Solvency and Financial Condition report, which is available on nordea.com.\n\n## Market risk\n\n## Measurement and analysis of market risk\n\nMarket risk arises mainly due to the mismatch between assets and liabilities and the sensitivity of the values of these assets and liabilities to changes in the level or in the volatility of market prices or rates. Market risk mainly originates from investments in products with embedded guarantees.\n\nNordea carries the risk of fulfilling these guarantees to policyholders. Market risks are measured via exposure measurement on investment assets, forward-looking balance sheet projections and stress and sensitivity analysis. The results prove that Nordea is resilient to the stresses performed. Market risks are monitored against the risk appetite and risk limits.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nNordea is exposed to falls in equity prices impacting financial guarantees in traditional insurance products.",

The widening of credit spreads reduces market values and thus the expectations of future profits. The following table shows the exposure to different credit ratings and how it has changed since last year.\n\n## Fixed income holdings\n\n| EURm         | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n| AAA          | 4,784         | 6,383         |\n| AA           | 840           | 703           |\n| A            | 1,085         | 1,336         |\n| BBB          | 430           | 433           |\n| BB and below | 132           | 181           |\n| Not rated    | 1,783         | 1,827         |\n| Total        | 9,054         | 10,863        |\n\n## Market concentration risk\n\nNordea is exposed to the concentration of market risks by e.g. counterparty, guarantee levels, region and industry. Concentration risk is both addressed in each investment mandate and on an aggregated level. Nordea manages concentration risk by setting upper limits for the size of individual investments and for aggregate investments by category. Concentration risks are also addressed on an aggregated level and managing these risks is an integrated part of the investment strategy.\n\nNordea reduces concentration risk on an ongoing basis in the revision and adjustment of asset portfolios. Due to the diversification across the portfolios in the local entities Nordea has no significant unmanaged concentration of market risk at Nordea Life & Pension Group level.\n\n## Guarantee levels, estimates of present\n\n## value of future cash flows\n\n| EURm    | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|\n| 0%      | 350           | 305           |\n| 0-2%    | 3,869         | 3,803         |\n| 2-3%    | 3,347         | 3,601         |\n| 3-4%    | 2,181         | 2,431         |\n| Over 4% | 1,330         | 1,294         |\n| Total   | 11,077        | 11,434        |\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nNordea is exposed to movements in interest rates, mainly through the duration mismatch between assets and liabilities within traditional insurance products. Also life and disability insurance products come with interest rate risk due to the discounting of future cash flows.\n\n## Property risk\n\nNordea holds commercial, industrial and residential properties and is exposed to falls in their prices.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nNordea actively invests in global assets. Virtually all of the currency exposure in the local entities is hedged against the local reporting currencies.\n\n## Management of market risk\n\nBusiness decisions are formed balancing short-term and longterm objectives, customers, considerations for competitiveness, legal requirements, profitability, liquidity and capital. At the same time, the liability-driven investment strategy, risk considerations and the Prudent Person Principle must be observed.\n\nIn order to ensure that all aspects are considered continuously, market risks are monitored regularly against the risk appetite and risk limits.\n\n## Counterparty default risk\n\nCounterparty default risk reflects potential losses from unexpected default of Nordea's counterparties and debtors, taking into account risk-mitigating contracts, reinsurance, securitisations and derivatives as well as receivables from intermediaries. Nordea is exposed to counterparty default through cash and deposits held by counterparties as well as the derivatives used to hedge portfolios.\n\nNordea monitors counterparty derivative exposures on a daily basis. The results prove that Nordea is resilient to the stresses performed. To mitigate the exposure to unexpected defaults, Nordea ensures diversification by counterparty. Concentrations to individual counterparties are mitigated through the investment limit framework.\n\nNordea has bilateral agreements with derivatives counterparties which define the nature, timing and quality of eligible collateral. Nordea manages and monitors collateral for derivatives weekly and ad hoc as necessary.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of being able to meet liquidity commitments only at increased cost or, ultimately, being unable to meet obligations as they fall due. Liquidity risk arises both from illiquidity of investment assets (market liquidity risk) and from changed cash flows on liabilities as a result of changed claims and/or lapses (funding liquidity risk). Liquidity risk can also arise from short-term payments affecting the short-term liquidity need. Liquidity risk derives primarily from traditional insurance products.\n\n## Management and measurement of liquidity risk\n\nNordea's exposure to liquidity risk is managed based on local liquidity rules, investment guidelines and limits. Liquidity risk is monitored through:\n\n- \u00b7 liquidity scoring of current investment assets,\n- \u00b7 calculation of forward-looking liquidity risk indicators under both normal and stressed conditions, and\n- \u00b7 calculation of a liquidity ratio for the traditional insurance portfolios.\n\nLiquidity risk is monitored as part of the Risk Appetite Framework of Nordea Life & Pension Group and its local entities. Moreover, the liquidity risk indicators are integrated into the Nordea Group's overall monitoring of liquidity risk.\n\n## Expected yearly net cash flows, undiscounted\n\n| EURm              | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1 year or less    | 2,252         | 1,852         |\n| 1-2 years         | 2,080         | 1,953         |\n| 2-3 years         | 1,924         | 1,856         |\n| 3-4 years         | 1,818         | 1,792         |\n| 4-5 years         | 1,705         | 1,661         |\n| More than 5 years | 25,057        | 25,704        |\n| Total             | 34,836        | 34,818        |\n\n## Amounts payable on demand\n\n| EURm                                           | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Amounts payable on demand                      | 25,705        | 24,018        |\n| Assets backing insurance contract  liabilities | 27,096        | 25,377        |",

These may arise due to improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry changes.\n\nRisks related to regulatory changes arise as a result of inadequate or imperfect implementation of new or changed regulation. This could potentially impact reputation, processes and costs.\n\nBusiness and strategic risks are mitigated through actions such as monitoring sales, costs and risk results regularly and analysing the drivers of profit.\n\nRisks related to the legal environment are mitigated through continuous monitoring of the regulatory developments and through establishing specific programmes to handle the implementation. The compliance function at Nordea Life & Pension monitors compliance with existing laws, regulations and internal rules applicable to Nordea Life & Pension.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk\n\nESG risk is a risk category that has gained importance in recent years. Nordea Life & Pension Group considers the double materiality of ESG, i.e. the fact that Nordea Life & Pension Group is exposed to ESG risk while its own actions and investment decisions impact ESG factors, and has developed a consistent approach to sustainability risk and the consideration of ESG factors in the investment process.\n\nThe perception of ESG risk at Nordea Life & Pension Group comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 the physical impact of climate change,\n- \u00b7 the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient economy,\n- \u00b7 an increasing awareness of social objectives, working and safety conditions and human rights, and\n- \u00b7 an increasing importance of good governance practices within companies, anti-bribery and corruption practices and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nNordea Life & Pension Group has established a comprehensive database for ESG risk indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions (GHG emissions), the Climate Value at Risk (Climate VaR), ESG ratings and many others. The database is updated regularly and developed continuously in order to achieve a good coverage of assets with available best practice indicators of ESG risk.\n\nESG risks may materialise through other risk types. The table below shows how material the impact may be on the different risk types:\n\n| Risk type                       | Impact of ESG factors   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Market Risk                     | High                    |\n| Underwriting Risk               | Low                     |\n| Operational and Compliance Risk | Medium                  |\n| Reputational Risk               | High                    |\n\nESG factors are considered to have a high impact on market risk. Market risk may arise from disruptions and shifts associated with the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient economy. Those risks may be motivated by policy changes, market dynamics, technological innovation or reputational factors. Key examples of transition risks include wrong\n\nassessments of climate-induced risks and opportunities, policy changes and regulatory reforms, which affect carbon-intensive sectors. Policy and regulatory measures may affect specific classes of financial assets (such as real estate portfolios), in addition to those affecting capital markets.\n\nClimate risks related to investments are in general assumed to be captured in the market value of the assets. An asset composition heavily weighted towards sectors that are vulnerable to climate changes will however represent concentration risk that requires awareness.\n\nThe graph below shows the insurance contracts' equity and corporate bond exposure towards different sectors. The largest exposures are found within financials, technology and non-cyclical consumer products and services.\n\n## ESG data concentration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile these are not necessarily industries which are associated with heavy scope 1 emissions (direct carbon emissions), scope 2 (indirect carbon emissions) and scope 3 emissions (carbon emissions in the full value chain) must also be taken into consideration. Overall, the equity and corporate bond investments managed by Nordea Life & Pension Group have a scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity averaging at 80 tons of CO2 per EURm of sales, compared to the MSCI World average of 138 tons of CO2 per EURm of sales. This underlines that while investing in a similar mix of industrial sectors, Nordea Life & Pension Group makes investment choices within the sectors that underpin the overall net zero emission target. Despite the overall small investments in the utility, industrials and basic materials industries, these sectors contribute significantly to the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions profile of the equity investments. Those sectors in which Nordea Life & Pension Group makes most of its investments contribute comparatively little to its emissions profile.\n\nNordea Life & Pension Group uses scenario data from the Network for Greening the Financial System as the basis for the forward-looking analysis of climate-related risks. Forward-looking analysis is facilitated by the MSCI Climate VaR which enables analyses of policy-related risks, technological opportunities and physical risks across different scenarios associated with a variety of temperature outcomes and transition narratives. The Climate VaR quantifies these risks in terms of a return-based valuation of companies.\n\nThe industry sectors that currently have the highest GHG emissions also are the ones that are expected to incur negative effects on their market values due to regulation and policy changes. The upside is, however, that these sectors also provide opportunities for developing more GHG efficient technological solutions. The challenge is therefore not to avoid these industry sectors altogether, but to reduce ESG-induced market risk from these sectors, to carefully select the",

Based on the current assessments, ESG-induced market risk is considered as immaterial as of 2023 for Nordea Life & Pension Group.\n\nReputational risk can arise due to failure to deliver on internal and external promises and expectations can lead to negative attention from customers and media, claims and law suits, which in turn can increase lapses and reduce new business. To understand the impact of ESG-related reputational risk different scenarios are analysed where lapses increase. The outcome of the scenarios is that there is a negative profit effect which may affect profits in the longer run and also business plans. ESG-related reputational risk can therefore not be dismissed as immaterial.\n\n## Underwriting risk\n\nUnderwriting risk is defined as the risk of loss, or of adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities, resulting from changes in the level, trend, or volatility of mortality rates, longevity rates, disability rates and surrenders and lapses, with such a change leading to an increase in the value of insurance liabilities.\n\n## Measurement and analysis of underwriting risk\n\nUnderwriting risks are primarily controlled using actuarial methods, i.e. through tariffs, rules for acceptance of customers, reinsurance contracts, stress testing and setting adequate provisions for risks. Experience analyses and benchmarking are performed at least annually for each underwriting risk.\n\nNordea measures underwriting risks by measuring the sensitivity of the balance sheet to stressed underwriting scenarios via regular stress and scenario testing. The results prove that Nordea is resilient to the stresses performed. Neither Nordea's underwriting risk exposures nor the approach to measurement changed materially over the reporting period.\n\n## Lapse risk\n\nLapse risk includes partial and full surrender, transfers of capital and transition to paid-up policies. Exposure to lapse risk is due to the potential deviation between the actual lapse rates and expected lapse rates.\n\nLapse risk is linked to policyholder behaviour. It is mitigated by ensuring that products meet customers' needs. Lapses are stress tested, monitored and reported regularly. Monitoring helps Nordea to identify and address emerging trends.\n\n## Longevity\n\nLongevity risk arises from the annuities in payment and in deferral within Nordea's traditional insurance products. Mortality rates and life expectancies are updated and benchmarked annually.\n\n## Concentration of underwriting risks\n\nNordea's insurance portfolios comprise individual and group policies, all of which are well diversified by industry, geography and demography as well as by product type and risk. Within Nordea's insurance portfolios, large companies may pose a geographic risk concentration. Concentration risk is managed on local entity level and mitigated by reinsurance wherever deemed necessary.\n\n## Management of underwriting risk\n\nManagement of underwriting risk includes, among others, underwriting procedures, reinsurance programme and product approval processes.\n\n## Underwriting procedures\n\nUnderwriting is performed in compliance with the local entity's strategic documents for underwriting and insurance risks. These documents are established to ensure strong underwriting processes and sound advice to customers.\n\nUnderwriting procedures intend to ensure the fair and ethical treatment of all new customers and the acceptance or rejection of individual risks on an informed basis. Sound underwriting ensures that the right products are offered to the customers to meet their needs. Individual underwriting is used for life and health policies. Depending on the nature of the risk coverage and the level of benefits, underwriting may include a health assessment.\n\nThe Actuarial function highlights risks and makes recommendations regarding underwriting in its annual report. The Actuarial function reviews the strategic documents governing underwriting annually and ad hoc whenever deemed necessary.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nNordea's reinsurance programme covers individual and aggregate mortality and disability risks, including mortality catastrophe cover in Finland and Norway. It includes individual risk retention limits and aggregate stop loss cover. Reinsured risks include mortality, disability and mortality catastrophe. The aim of the reinsurance programme is to minimise claims volatility, stabilise annual results and protect Nordea from underwriting risk concentrations and catastrophes. New business with large individual risk exposures is underwritten with facultative reinsurance.\n\nThe reinsurance programme is monitored monthly via the risk result by product line. The Actuarial Function is responsible for reviewing the reinsurance strategy and programme as a minimum once a year.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nNordea regularly performs stress tests of the contractual service margin (CSM) and profit to assess the impact of various scenarios. The stress tests are conducted by applying overnight market stresses and changes to underwriting assumptions. Due to the long-term nature of the life and pension business Nordea is sensitive to interest rate movements, which in combination with lower equity prices and wider spreads would have a significant impact on profit and the CSM. The methodologies used are aligned with other stress tests carried out and were developed during the year for IFRS 17 purposes. The relevant sensitivities and their effect on profit and CSM are shown in the table below.\n\n|                          | Impact on profit   | Impact on profit   | Impact on CSM   | Impact on CSM   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| EURm                     | 31 Dec  2023       | 31 Dec  2022       | 31 Dec  2023    | 31 Dec  2022    |\n| Equities -20% 1          | -16                | -19                | -124            | -143            |\n| Interest rates -50 bp    | -18                | -19                | -161            | -201            |\n| Interest rates +50 bp    | 16                 | 17                 | 142             | 181             |\n| Spread +50 bp            | 1                  | 0                  | 4               | 5               |\n| Combined market stress 2 | -35                | -39                | -292            | -352            |\n| Lapses +10%              | -1                 | -2                 | -12             | -33             |\n| Expenses +10%            | -12                | -11                | -72             | -77             |\n| Mortality +10%           | 2                  | 2                  | 4               | 4               |\n| Disability +10%          | -15                | -14                | -3              | -6              |\n| Longevity +10%           | -4                 | -3                 | -12             | -25             |\n\n- 2) Interest rates -50 bp, Equities -20% and Spread +50 bp.",

        "page_content": "## G5  Intangible and tangible assets\n\n## G5.1  Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIntangible assets are identifiable, non-monetary assets without physical substance. The assets are under Nordea's control, which means that Nordea has the power and rights to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource. Nordea's intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, IT development/computer software and customer-related intangible assets.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of Nordea's share of net identifiable assets of the acquired group undertaking/associated undertaking/ joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of group undertakings is included in 'Intangible assets'. Goodwill on acquisitions of associated undertakings and joint ventures is not recognised as a separate asset but included in 'Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures'. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent periods. Goodwill related to associated undertakings and joint ventures is not tested for impairment separately but included in the total carrying amount of the associated undertakings and the joint ventures. The policies covering impairment testing of associated undertakings and joint ventures are disclosed in Note 9.3 'Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures'.\n\n## IT development/computer software\n\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred. Costs directly associated with major software development investments, with the ability to generate future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include software development staff costs and overhead expenditures directly attributable to preparing the asset for use. Computer software also includes acquired software licences not related to the function of a tangible asset.\n\nAmortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the software, generally a period of three to five years, and in some circumstances for strategic infrastructure up to a maximum of ten years.\n\n## Customer-related intangible assets\n\nIn business combinations a portion of the purchase price is normally allocated to a customer-related intangible assets if the asset is identifiable and under Nordea's control. An intangible asset is identifiable if it arises from contractual or legal rights or can be separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The asset is amortised over its useful life, generally over ten years.\n\n## Impairment\n\nGoodwill and IT development not yet taken into use are not amortised but tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indications of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. Intangible assets in use and amortised are also evaluated for indications of impairment and if such indications are found, the assets are tested for impairment. The impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or the cash- generating unit (CGU), which is defined as the smallest identifiable group\n\nof assets that generate largely independent cash flows in relation to other assets. For goodwill and IT development not yet taken into use, the CGUs are defined as the operating segments. The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be realised from the asset or the CGU.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nThe identification of CGUs and to what extent they can be aggregated to groups that are tested together requires judgement. Internally developed software is included in the impairment test and allocated to the CGUs. Nordea's total goodwill amounted to EUR 2,227m (EUR 2,262m) at the end of the year. Internally developed software amounted to EUR 1,457m (EUR 1,599m) at the end of the year.\n\nThe estimation of future cash flows and the calculation of the rate used to discount those cash flows are subject to estimation uncertainty. The forecast of future cash flows is sensitive to the cash flow projections for the near future (generally 3-5 years) and to the estimated sector growth rate for the period beyond 3-5 years. The growth rates are based on historical data, updated to reflect the current situation, which implies estimation uncertainty. Also, the estimate for the longterm growth rate requires critical judgement.\n\nThe derived cash flows are discounted at a rate based on the market's long-term risk-free rate of interest and yield requirements.\n\n## Higher energy and raw material prices and reduced customer spending\n\nFor information about critical judgements in the preparation of this Annual Report due to the uncertainty concerning the potential long-term impact of higher energy and raw material prices and reduced consumer spending in various economic sectors on Nordea's financial statements, see Note G1 'Accounting policies'.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nThe impairment test is performed for each CGU by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the value in use and is estimated based on the discounted cash flows. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely.\n\nCash flows for the coming three years are based on financial forecasts. The forecasts are based on Nordea's macroeconomic outlook, including information on GDP growth, inflation and benchmark rates for the relevant countries. Based on these macroeconomic forecasts, the business areas project how margins, volumes, sales and costs will develop over the coming years. Credit losses are estimated using the long-term average for the different business areas. This results in an income statement for each year. The projected cash flow for each year is the forecast net result in these income statements, reduced by the regulatory capital needed to grow the business in accordance with the long-term growth assumptions. For CGUs with more capital than the Group's CET1 target, the expected dividends are included in the cash flows generated by the CGUs until these meet the Group's CET1 target over a three-year period.\n\nThe projections take into consideration the major projects initiated at Nordea. There is also an allocation of central costs to business areas to make sure that the cash flows for the CGUs include all indirect costs. Tax costs are estimated based on the standard tax rate.

Growth rates are based on historical data, updated to reflect the current situation.\n\nThe derived cash flows are discounted at a rate based on the market's long-term risk-free rate of interest and yield requirements. The discount rate used in 2023 was 9.8% (9.0%) post-tax, corresponding to a pre-tax rate of 12.7% (11.7%). The estimated growth rate was 2.1% (2.5%). The CGUs cover all Nordic currencies and Nordea discounts the future estimated cash flows using one EUR rate for all CGUs.\n\nThe impairment tests conducted in 2023 did not indicate any need for goodwill impairment.\n\nBoth an increase in the discount rate of 1 percentage point and a reduction in the future growth rate of 1 percentage point are considered to be reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions. Such a change would not result in any impairment.\n\nIn addition to the cash flow test for CGUs, internally developed IT systems are qualitatively assessed for indications of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the assets is fully recoverable. This is assessed on an individual asset level based on a qualitative analysis. Both external and internal impairment triggers are reviewed.\n\nExternal impairment triggers could be that the market is moving to new cloud solutions that are significantly more cost efficient compared to an on-premise solution. Another trigger could be that a product that is supported by the\n\ndevelopment becomes redundant or replaced by another product in the market, indicating that the value of the development may be impaired.\n\nInternal impairment triggers are internal decisions indicating that products supported by the functionality will be discontinued, that a line of business will be discontinued, that it is expected/decided internally that the functionality will be moved to cloud or replaced by new on-premise functionality, etc.\n\nDuring the year Nordea reviewed its portfolio of current development initiatives supporting customer facing digital services. The assessment concluded that the rapid pace of digital development in this portfolio, including the continuous and agile introduction of new features and implementation of new cloud-based solutions, was making it more difficult to evidence such benefits for accounting purposes.\n\nAccordingly, although Nordea's digital services are highly rated by customers, Nordea decided that such development costs shall going forward be expensed as incurred, and an impairment charge of EUR 130m was recognised. The total impairment charge amounted to EUR 193m, and included also individually insignificant impairments identified in the ordinary impairment testing. Nordea still holds EUR 1.5bn of internally developed intangible IT assets on the balance sheet, where no significant impairment needs were identified during 2023 and where capitalisation is currently expected to continue. The impairments are almost exclusively presented within 'Other operating segments\" in Note G2.1 'Segment reporting'.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n| Cash-generating units, EURm     | Goodwill 1 31 Dec 2023   | Internally  developed  software   31 Dec 2023   | Total   31 Dec 2023   | Goodwill 1 31 Dec 2022   | Internally  developed  software   31 Dec 2022   | Total   31 Dec 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Personal Banking                | 1,009                    | 443                                             | 1,452                 | 1,029                    | 564                                             | 1,593                 |\n| Business Banking                | 695                      | 492                                             | 1,187                 | 724                      | 490                                             | 1,214                 |\n| Large Corporates & Institutions | 157                      | 312                                             | 469                   | 165                      | 308                                             | 473                   |\n| Asset & Wealth Management       | 366                      | 210                                             | 576                   | 344                      | 237                                             | 581                   |\n| Total                           | 2,227                    | 1,457                                           | 3,684                 | 2,262                    | 1,599                                           | 3,861                 |\n| Other intangible assets 2       | -

Right-of-use assets under leasing agreements are presented in this item; see Note G5.4 'Leases' for more information. Items of properties and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price as well as any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the working condition for its intended use. Parts of an item of property and equipment are accounted for as separate items if they have different useful lives.\n\nOwner-occupied properties backing issued insurance contracts with direct participation features are measured using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40. For more information about valuation and processes, see Note G5.3 'Investment properties'.\n\nImprovements are recognised as assets if they provide an improved function of the asset, while maintenance does not improve the function of the assets and is expensed as incurred.\n\nProperties and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as speci-\n\nfied below. The estimates of the useful life of different assets are reassessed on a yearly basis.\n\nBuildings\n\n30-75 years\n\nEquipment\n\n3-5 years\n\nLeasehold\n\nimprovements\n\nFor changes within buildings, the shorter of 10 years and the remaining lease term. For new construction, the shorter of the principles used for owned build- ings and the remaining lease term. Fix- tures installed in leased properties are depreciated over the shorter of 10-20 years and the remaining lease term.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, Nordea assesses whether there is any indication that an item of property and equipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, and any impairment loss is recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.",

Transaction costs are included in the initial measurement. The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenses. Directly attributable expenses include, for example, professional fees for legal services, property transfer taxes and other transaction costs.\n\nNordea applies the fair value model for subsequent measurement of investment properties. The best evidence of fair value is normally quoted prices in an active market for similar properties in the same location and condition. As these prices are rarely available, discounted cash flow projection models based on reliable estimates of future cash flows are also used. The fair value measurement of investment properties takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits through the highest and best use of the property, i.e. taking into account the use of the property in a way that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.\n\nNet rental income, gains and losses as well as fair value adjustments are recognised directly in the income statement as 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\nFair value measurements of investment properties are categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investment properties (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The categorisation of the investment properties is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nFor more information about the estimation of fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note G3.4 'Fair value'.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. As there are normally no active markets for investment properties, the fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flow models. These models are based on assumptions about future rents, vacancy levels, operating and maintenance costs, yield requirements and interest rates.\n\nThe carrying amount of investment properties was EUR 2,928m (EUR 3,146m) at the end of the year.\n\n## Amounts recognised in the income statement 1\n\n| EURm                                                            | 2023   |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fair value  adjustments 2                                       | -133   |    -76 |\n| Rental income                                                   | 114    |     63 |\n| Direct operating expenses that generated rental  income         | -31    |    -28 |\n| Direct operating expenses that did not   generate rental income | -      |      0 |\n| Total                                                           | -50    |    -41 |\n\n- 1)  Included in 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n- 2)  Excluding fair value adjustments on investment properties presented as 'Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investments contracts' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Categorisation in the fair value hierarchy\n\nAll investment properties in Nordea are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of these investment properties are presented in the table below.\n\n| Level 3 - Fair value of investment properties 1 ,  EURm                         | 31 Dec  2023   | 31 Dec  2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Investment properties                                                           | 2,199          | 2,288          |\n| - of which Life & Pension                                                       | 2,191          | 2,286          |\n| Investment properties in pooled schemes and  unit-linked investment contracts 2 | 729            | 858            |\n| - of which Life & Pension                                                       | 729            | 858            |\n| Total                                                                           | 2,928          | 3,146          |\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe valuation of the investment properties takes into account the purpose and the nature of the properties by using the most appropriate valuation methods. The primary valuation approach is a discounted cash flow model using current cash flows, market interest rates and the current yield requirements. Fair value calculated, or model parameters provided, by external independent valuers covers 72% (74%) of the total fair value of investment properties on the balance sheet.\n\n## Movements in Level 3\n\nThe tables below present the movements in Level 3. Unrealised gains and losses relate to the investment properties held at the end of the year. Fair value gains and losses in the income statement during the year are included in 'Net result from items at fair value' (see Note G2.5 'Total net result from items at fair value').",

The valuation of the investment properties is performed quarterly by the real estate units of each entity within Life & Pension with full or partial assistance from external valuers. For investment properties where units use their own methodologies, the changes in the price levels of the properties are compared with valuations of similar properties assessed by external valuers. The result of the valuations is presented to and approved by the local management of each entity. The CFO of each entity within Life & Pension is responsible for the approval of the concepts and for the values used. The principles used by all entities are in accordance\n\nwith regulations provided by the local financial supervisory authorities, which are in accordance with international valuation principles and the IFRS.\n\nIn addition, there is an investment operations committee (IOC), which is a joint forum focusing on the valuation and accounting of investment operations issues within Life & Pension. The entities within Life & Pension report regularly to the IOC.\n\nLife & Pension's investment properties are backing the insurance and investment contracts. This means that the impact on Nordea's income statement and on shareholders' equity is based on the profit structure of the portfolio of contracts backed by the investments.",

        "page_content": "## G5.4  Leases\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nA lease is a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## Nordea as lessor\n\nFinance leases are reported as receivables from the lessee and included in 'Loans to the public' (see Note G3.8 'Loans') at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The lease payment, excluding cost of services, is recorded as repayment of principal and interest income. The income allocation is based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance lease.\n\n## Nordea as lessee\n\nAt inception Nordea assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease.\n\nThe right to use an asset in a lease contract is recognised on the commencement date as a right-of-use (ROU) asset and the obligation to pay lease payments is recognised as a lease liability. The ROU asset is initially measured as the present value of the lease payments plus initial direct costs and the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset less any lease incentives received. Non-lease components are separated. The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability for each contract is the incremental borrowing rate at commencement of the contract. In significant premises contracts the rate implicit in the contract may be used if available.\n\nThe ROU assets are presented as similar owned assets and the lease liabilities as 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The depreciation policy is consistent with that of similar owned assets, but the depreciation period is capped at the end of the lease term. Impairment testing of the ROU assets is performed according to the same principles that apply to similar owned assets. Interest expense on lease liabilities is presented as 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\nThe assets are classified as 'Land and buildings' and 'Equipment'. Equipment mainly comprises vehicles and IT hardware. Nordea applies the practical expedient for shortterm contracts (with a contract term of 12 months or less) both for Land and buildings and for Equipment. The practical expedient for low-value assets is applied to Equipment.\n\nShort-term and low-value contracts are not recognised on the balance sheet and the payments are recognised as 'Other expenses' in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic way better reflects the time pattern of Nordea's benefit.\n\nThe lease term is the expected lease term. This comprises the non-cancellable period of lease contracts and any options that Nordea is reasonably certain to exercise. The length of contracts with no end date is estimated by considering all facts and circumstances.\n\n## Embedded leases\n\nAgreements can contain a right to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments although the agreement is not in the legal form of a lease contract. If applicable, these assets are separated from the contract and accounted for as leased assets.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nFor a lessee, critical judgement has to be exercised when estimating the expected lease term by considering all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension or termination option. The expected lease term for contracts with no end date is estimated in the same way. Backstop rules on the average expected lifetime of different types of real estate contracts are used as a guidance when making the estimate for branch offices. A more detailed analysis is performed for more significant contracts. Head office contracts are estimated to be more long term in nature than branch office contracts where the business environment is changing at a more rapid pace. The backstop rule of branch offices is currently limiting the expected lease term of contracts with no end date and contracts with extension options to five years. It is possible to deviate from the backstop rule if the circumstances show that Nordea is likely to stay for a longer/shorter period. The carrying amount of ROU assets was EUR 1,239m (EUR 1,257m) at the end of the year.\n\nFor a lessor, critical judgement has to be exercised when classifying lease contracts. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership.",

The premises are mainly divided into branch offices and head offices. The premises contracts are actively managed with focus on the effective use of the premises and changes in the business environment. The lease payments generally include fixed payments and especially in premises contracts also variable payments that depend on an index.Residual value guarantees or purchase options are generally not used.\n\nLease expenses are disclosed in the table below.\n\n| EURm                                 |   2023 |   2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Expense related to short-term leases |    -11 |    -12 |\n| Expense related to low-value leases  |      0 |      0 |\n| Expense related to variable payments |    -17 |    -19 |\n| Interest expense                     |    -11 |     -9 |\n| Sub-lease income                     |      1 |      2 |\n| Total cash outflow for leases        |   -158 |   -163 |\n\nThe table below shows the contractual maturity of undiscounted cash flows on lease liabilities.\n\n| EURm               | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Less than one year | 124           | 125           |\n| 1-2 years          | 111           | 95            |\n| 2-5 years          | 262           | 202           |\n| 5-10 years         | 335           | 306           |\n| 10-15 years        | 294           | 263           |\n| 15-20 years        | 101           | 164           |\n| 20-25 years        | 2             | 10            |\n| Total              | 1,229         | 1,165         |\n\nMore information on right-of-use assets and the maturity profile can be found in Note G5.2 'Properties and equipment' and in Note G10.3 'Maturity analysis'.\n\nThe lease liability does not include future estimated cash flows for significant committed leases not yet commenced, amounting to approximately EUR 121m at the end of the year.\n\nNordea operates from leased premises. The premises are mainly divided into head office contracts, branch office contracts and other contracts.\n\nThe expected lease term in most of the premises contracts is 1-10 years, whereas the expected lease term of the main head office contracts in the Nordic countries is 10-25 years. These contracts usually have renewal options. The head office contracts generally have fixed lease terms, whereas branch office contracts either have fixed lease terms or are without an end date with the right to terminate. The termination clauses are generally 6-12 months. The main principle is that premises contracts do not contain purchase options. Company car contracts generally have a fixed lease term of less than five years.",

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nAccounting policies relating to employee benefits are further described in Note G8 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration' and relating to financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments in Note G7 'Off-balance sheet items'. Accounting policies for provisions for off-balance sheet items can be found in Note G3.8 'Loans'.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of operational and legal risks potentially resulting in reputational impacts, fines, sanctions, disputes, losses and/or litigation. This includes potential claims related to the provision of banking and investment services and other areas in which Nordea operates. Currently, such claims are mainly related to lending and insolvency situations, various investment services, and sub-custody and withholding taxation matters. At present, none of the current claims are considered likely to have any significant adverse effect on Nordea or its financial position. As previously stated, Nordea expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters. Nordea cannot exclude the possibility of fines which could impact the bank's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation. See also section 6 'Compliance Risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note G7.1 'Contingent liabilities'.\n\n## Provisions\n\n| EURm                   |   31 Dec 2023 |   31 Dec 2022 |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Restructuring          |            75 |            78 |\n| Guarantees/commitments |           168 |           184 |\n| Other                  |           128 |            89 |\n| Total                  |           371 |           351 |\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs were utilised by EUR 41m in 2023, and new provisions amounting to EUR 48m were accounted for. The remaining provisions are related to staff restructuring (EUR 61m) and premises-related obligations (EUR 14m).\n\nThe staff-related provision is related to contracts entered into, or activities communicated but not yet finalised, where payments remain to be executed on. These contracts are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Approximately EUR 50m out of the total restructuring provision EUR 75m is expected to be utilised/paid out in 2024. All staff-related activities are expected to be executed on in 2024, but payments are expected to extend into 2025. As for any other provision, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing and the amount to be finally paid. The uncertainty is expected to decrease as the plans are executed.\n\nLoan loss provisions on off-balance sheet items amounted to EUR 168m (EUR 184m). More information on these provisions can be found in section 2 'Credit risk' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management' and Note G7 'Off-balance sheet items'.\n\nMore information on the provision for AML-related matters can be found in section 6.3 'Financial crime prevention' in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n|                         |   Restruc turing | Restruc turing   |   Other | Other   |\n|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                    |             2023 | 2022             |    2023 | 2022    |\n| At beginning of year    |               78 | 127              |      89 | 104     |\n| New provisions made     |               48 | 27               |      65 | 1       |\n| Provisions utilised     |              -41 | -68              |     -27 | -14     |\n| Reversals               |               -7 | -5               |       0 | -1      |\n| Reclassifications       |               -1 | -                |       1 | -       |\n| Translation differences |               -2 | -3               |       0 | -1      |\n| At end of year          |               75 | 78               |     128 | 89      |",

Loan guarantees are provided for customers to guarantee obligations in other credit and pension institutions. Other guarantees mainly consist of commercial guarantees such as bid guarantees, advance payment guarantees, warranty guarantees and export-related guarantees. Contingent liabilities also include unutilised irrevocable import documentary credits and confirmed export documentary credits. These transactions are part of the bank's services and support Nordea's customers.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2023 decided that Nordea Bank Abp will cover or reimburse the members of the Board of Directors all costs and expenses related to or arising from the Board membership, including travel, logistics and accommodation as well as consultative, legal and administrative costs. The legal costs can e.g. include required costs of legal defence and claims made (during and after their period of office) against Board members in cases where Board members are not found liable or guilty of any intentional wrongdoing or grossly negligent behaviour.\n\nAs of 1 June 2023, members of the GLT are afforded coverage and reimbursement corresponding to that of the Board in instances related to or arising from the respective GLT membership of each member. In addition, as of 2019, Nordea Bank Abp has undertaken to indemnify the members of the GLT against legal expenses incurred in relation to certain claims or investigations by third parties based on circumstances or events which occurred during the members' respective terms of office, excluding crimes or actions made with intent or gross negligence, up to a capped aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m, unless the Board decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken, in relation to certain individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for the potential payment liability against these individuals in their capacity of managing directors or board members of group undertakings of Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nNordea Bank Abp purchases directors and officers liability insurance, which provides cover for personal liabilities of its Board of Directors and management as well as liability assumed by the bank to a certain extent following indemnification undertakings. The terms and conditions including the total limit of liability of the directors and officers liability insurance programme are in line with large European banks.\n\nA limited number of employees are entitled to severance pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retirement age.

On the settlement date, these reverse repurchase agreements will, as far as possible, replace existing reverse repurchase agreements not yet derecognised as at 31 December 2023. The net impact on the balance sheet is minor. These instruments have not been disclosed as commitments.\n\nFor more information on reverse repurchase agreements, see Note G3.2 'Transferred assets and obtained collateral'.\n\n## Acquisition of Danske Bank's personal customer and private banking business in Norway\n\nNordea entered into an agreement with Danske Bank to acquire its Norwegian personal customer and private banking business and associated asset management portfolios on 19 July 2023. The Norwegian Competition Authority announced its approval of the acquisition on 15 December 2023. The Financial Supervisory Authority in Norway announced its approval relating to the acquisition of the personal customer and private banking business on 7 February 2024. The Financial Supervisory Authority will evaluate the acquisition of the associated asset management portfolios at a later stage. Nordea expects to close the acquisition in late 2024.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the business to be transferred comprised approximately 285,000 customers, lending and deposit volumes of EUR 18bn and EUR 4bn, respectively, and approximately EUR 2bn in assets under management. These amounts are not reflected in the table above. The committed purchase price is close to the net fair value of financial assets and liabilities acquired on closing.

The transactions are typically short term and mature within three months.\n\nSecurities related to life operations are also pledged as security for the corresponding insurance liabilities.\n\nLoans to the public have been registered as collateral for issued covered bonds and mortgage bonds in line with local legislation. In the event of the company's insolvency, the holders of these bonds have priority to the assets registered as collateral.\n\nOther assets pledged relate to certificates of deposit pledged by Nordea to comply with the authorities' requirements.\n\n## Assets pledged as security for other than own liabilities\n\nOther assets pledged mainly relate to interest-bearing securities pledged as security for payment settlements with central banks and clearing institutions and amounted to EUR 236m (EUR 253m). Only securities pledged for overnight liquidity are disclosed (securities pledged for intraday liquidity are excluded). Collateral pledged for items other than Nordea's own liabilities, e.g. for a third party or for Nordea's own contingent liabilities, is also presented under this item.",

        "page_content": "## G8   Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration\n\nAll forms of consideration given by Nordea to its employees as compensation for services performed are employee benefits. Employee benefits consist of short-term benefits, post-employment benefits and share-based payment plans.\n\nShort-term benefits are to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period when the services have been performed. Short-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. For more information, see Note 8.1 'Fixed and variable salaries'.\n\nPost-employment benefits are benefits payable after termination of the employment. Post-employment benefits in Nordea consist only of pensions. For more information, see Note 8.2 'Pensions'.\n\nShare-based payment plans cover share-based payments for services from employees. For more information, see Note G8.3 'Share-based payment plans'.\n\nIn addition, remuneration to key management personnel is disclosed in Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n## Additional disclosures on remuneration\n\nThe Board of Directors' report includes a separate section on remuneration, see page 78. Further, in accordance with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies 2023 will be prepared for the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2024. Finally, aggregated disclosures for key management personnel and material risk takers (Pillar III, CRR article 450) will be published on nordea.com ahead of the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## G8.1  Fixed and variable salaries\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. Both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the period when the employees perform services for Nordea.\n\nShort-term benefits related to the fulfilment of insurance contracts accounted for under IFRS 17 are included gross in this note, but subsequently transferred out from 'Staff costs' and accounted for according to the accounting policies defined in Note G4 'Insurance contract liabilities' and Note G2.4 \"Net insurance result\".\n\nShort-term benefits that fulfil the capitalisation requirements defined in the accounting policies in Note G5.1 'Intangible assets' are included gross in this note, but subsequently capitalised and added to 'Intangible assets' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or if an employee accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy.\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when Nordea has an obligation to make the payment. An obligation arises when a formal plan has been committed to on the appropriate organisational level and when Nordea is without realistic possibility of withdrawal, which normally occurs when the plan has been communicated to the affected individual or employee(s) or their representatives.\n\nTermination benefits can include both short-term benefits, for instance a number of months' salary, and post-employment benefits, normally in the form of early retirement.\n\n## Nordea's Short Term Incentive Plans\n\nNordea operates Short Term Incentive Plans (STIPs). These are the Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP), which is offered to the CEO and members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and, subject to invitation, to other employees, or bonus schemes (bonus) for selected employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board of Directors (Board). The NIP should primarily be used for roles where variable remuneration is a widespread market practice and makes up a significant part of the total remuneration package.\n\nSTIPs have been offered for several years primarily as the Executive Incentive Programme (EIP) and since 2022 as the NIP with similar terms and conditions.\n\nThe STIPs cover a performance period of one year and deliver cash to the participants and if they are material risk takers also share awards.

Pension costs for defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense as the employee renders services to the entity and the contribution payable in exchange for that service becomes due. In general, the payment is associated with and settled through regular salary payments. Nordea also contributes to state pension plans.\n\nPension costs for defined contribution plans related to the fulfilment of insurance contracts accounted for under IFRS 17 are included gross in this note, but subsequently transferred from 'Staff costs' and accounted for according to the accounting policies defined in G4 'Insurance contract liabilities' and Note G2.4 \"Net insurance result\".",

The major defined benefit plans are funded, covered by assets in pension funds/foundations. If the fair value of plan assets associated with a specific pension plan is lower than the gross present value of the defined benefit obligation determined using the projected unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as a liability ('Retirement benefit liabilities'). If not, the net amount is recognised as an asset ('Retirement benefit assets'). Non-funded pension plans are recognised as 'Retirement benefit liabilities'. Also plans that fulfil the accounting requirements for defined contribution plans are accounted for as defined benefit plans if the payment obligations have not been transferred.\n\nNordea's net obligation for defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned for their service in the current period and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Actuarial calculations, including the projected unit credit method, are applied to assess the present value of defined benefit obligations and related costs, based on several actuarial and financial assumptions. Current service cost and past service cost are recognised in the income statement in the current year. Current service cost is defined as the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period. Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods triggered by plan amendments or curtailments.\n\nThe present value of the obligation and the fair value of any plan assets are impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions (discount rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, salary increases, turnover and mortality) and experience effects, including actual outcome compared to assumptions. The remeasurement effects are recognised immediately in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe discount rate is determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds where a deep enough market for such bonds exists. Covered bonds are in this context considered to be corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the discount rate is determined with reference to covered bonds, whereas in Finland and the UK it is determined with reference to corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, the observed bond credit spreads over the swap curve are derived from long-dated covered or corporate bonds and extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves. In the UK, the corporate bond credit spread over the government bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the government bond curve.\n\nWhen the calculation results in a net asset, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nSocial security contributions are calculated and accounted for based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and are included on the balance sheet as 'Retirement benefit liabilities' or 'Retirement benefit assets'.\n\nPension costs for defined benefit plans related to the fulfilment of insurance contracts accounted for under IFRS 17 are included gross in this note, but subsequently transferred from 'Staff costs' and accounted for according to the accounting policies defined in G4 'Insurance contract liabilities' and Note G2.4 \"Net insurance result\".\n\nPension costs for defined benefit plans that fulfil the capitalisation requirements defined in the accounting policies in Note G5.1 'Intangible assets' are included gross in this note, but subsequently capitalised and added to 'Intangible assets' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe defined benefit obligation for major pension plans is calculated by external actuaries using demographic assumptions based on the current population. As a basis for these calculations a number of actuarial and financial parameters are used.\n\nThe estimation of the discount rate is subject to uncertainty about whether corporate bond markets are deep enough and of high quality. There is also uncertainty about the extrapolation of yield curves to relevant maturities. Other parameters, like assumptions about salary increases and inflation, are based on the expected long-term development of these parameters and also subject to estimation uncertainty. The main parameters used at year end are disclosed together with a description of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions. The defined benefit obligation was EUR 2,849m (EUR 2,910m) at the end of the year.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe companies within Nordea have various pension plans. They consist of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, reflecting national practices and conditions in the countries where Nordea operates.\n\n## Pension costs\n\n| EURm                                                                              |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Defined contribution plans                                                        |   -247 |   -236 |\n| Defined benefit plans 1                                                           |    -20 |    -36 |\n| Defined contribution plans where payment  obligations have not been transferred 1 |     -5 |     -5 |\n| Total                                                                             |   -272 |   -277 |\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nAll new employees have been offered defined contribution plans since 2013 when the defined benefit plan in Sweden was closed for new members. The defined contribution plans follow the local collective agreements and regulations in each country.\n\nIn Norway, Nordea is part of a collectively agreed multi-employer pension plan in the private sector (AFP), providing entitled employees with a lifelong addition to their regular pensions. As no information is available on Nordea's share of the liabilities/assets and pension cost, the AFP is accounted for as a defined contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe AFP plan is financed by an annual premium, for 2023 equal to 2.6% of employees' salary between 1 and 7.1 times the Norwegian social security base amount ('G'). The premium for 2023 amounted to EUR 3m (EUR 3m).",

All defined benefit plans are closed for new entrants; new employees are offered defined contribution plans.\n\nIn Sweden, 2,699 (2,842) employees earn defined benefit pension rights as the primary pension plan. In Finland, 1,178 (1,273) employees earn defined benefit pension rights as a supplementary pension to the statutory pension plan (TyEL).\n\nIn Norway, 244 (271) employees earn defined benefit pension rights as the primary pension plan.

Pension funds and foundations hold both the assets and the pension liabilities, except for Sweden where the pension foundation serves as collateral for the pension liabilites held by Nordea.\n\nMinimum funding requirements differ between the pension funds and foundations according to local regulatory requirements. The funding requirement is generally that the pension obligations measured using local requirements must be covered in full by a local predefined surplus. Other pension plans are not covered by funding requirements and are generally unfunded. The respective Nordea entities issuing the defined pension benefit serve as the sponsoring entity in accordance with the EU IORP II Directive.\n\nDefined benefit plans impact Nordea via changes in the net present value of obligations and/or changes in the market value of plan assets.\n\n## IAS 19 pension calculations and assumptions\n\nCalculations of major plans are performed by external liability calculators and are based on actuarial assumptions reflecting long-term expectations.\n\nThe assumptions disclosed for 2023 impact the liability calculations by year-end 2023, while assumptions disclosed for 2022 impact the calculations of 2023 pension expenses.\n\n|                 | Assumptions   | Assumptions   | Assumptions   | Assumptions   | Assumptions   |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                 | SE            | NO            | FI            | DK            | UK            |\n| 2023            |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Discount rate   | 3.04%         | 3.81%         | 2.92%         | 2.65%         | 4.71%         |\n| Salary increase | 2.60%         | 3.50%         | 2.80%         | 2.25%         | - 2           |\n| Inflation       | 1.60%         | 2.25%         | 2.30%         | - 1           | 3.50%         |\n| Mortality       | DUS21         | K2013BE       | TyEL 2016     | FSA 23        | CMI 2023      |\n| 2022            |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Discount rate   | 3.28%         | 3.40%         | 2.95%         | 3.20%         | 4.68%         |\n| Salary increase | 3.00%         | 3.50%         | 3.10%         | 2.25%         | - 2           |\n| Inflation       | 2.00%         | 2.00%         | 2.60%         | - 1           | 3.50%         |\n| Mortality       | DUS21         | K2013BE       | TyEL 2016     | FSA 22        | CMI 2022      |\n\n## Sensitivities - impact on defined benefit obligations\n\n| %                                 | SE    | NO    | FI    | DK    | UK    |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Discount rate   - Increase 50bp   | -8.8% | -6.8% | -5.1% | -3.9% | -6.6% |\n| Discount rate   - Decrease 50bp   | 9.9%  | 7.5%  | 5.6%  | 4.2%  | 7.4%  |\n| Salary increase   - Increase 50bp | 1.7%  | 0.1%  | 0.2%  | 4.3%  | -     |\n| Salary increase   - Decrease 50bp | -1.4% | -0.1% | -0.2% | -4.1% | -     |\n| Inflation   - Increase 50bp       | 9.6%  | 7.6%  | 4.1%  | -     | 1.2%  |\n| Inflation   - Decrease 50bp       | -8.6% | -6.9% | -3.9% | -     | -1.2% |\n| Mortality   - Increase 1 year     | 4.4%  | 3.6%  | 4.4%  | 6.1%  | 3.3%  |\n| Mortality   - Decrease 1 year     | -4.4% | -4.7% | -4.3% | -5.9% | -3.3% |\n\nThe sensitivity analyses are prepared by changing one actuarial assumption while keeping the other assumptions unchanged.

Results were driven by strong equity and stable fixed\n\nincome returns. In the UK, higher local interest rates led to overall negative returns.

Such transactions are recognised as a staff expense and a corresponding increase in equity. The expense is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. In such cases, the expense is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded, which is the method used by Nordea.\n\nWhen Nordea issues such instruments, the award date fair value of these rights is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value per right is estimated at award date and not subsequently updated. The vesting period is the period over which the employees have to remain in service at Nordea in order for their rights to vest.\n\nFor rights with non-market performance conditions, the amount expensed is the award date fair value per right multiplied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, which is reassessed at each reporting date. For rights with market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimated based on the fair value of each right times the maximum number of rights at award date. Market conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments awarded. Therefore, if all other vesting conditions (e.g. service conditions) are met, Nordea recognises the expense for awards of equity instruments with market conditions over the vesting period irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.\n\nSocial security costs are also allocated over the vesting period. The provision for social security costs is reassessed on each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on the rights' fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Cash-settled plans\n\nA cash-settled share-based payment transaction occurs when Nordea acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price of equity instruments of Nordea. For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. The liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recognised in the line item 'Net result from items at fair value' in the income statement.\n\n## Nordea's share-based remuneration plans\n\nNordea has several variable pay plans for selected Nordea employees (participants). The terms of the plans vary depending on the target group. Disclosures related to the share-based plans can be found below. All remuneration plans are also described in the section 'Remuneration' on page 78 of the Board of Directors' report.\n\nUntil the end of the performance/financial year 2018, Nordea's share-based variable remuneration plans were partly in the form of equity-linked total shareholders' return indexation (excluding dividends) and partly in the form of cash. The plans were consequently generally settled in cash and the portion indexed with Nordea's total shareholders' return was accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment plan. The total shareholders' return indexation resulted in a loss of EUR 1m in 2023 related to the remaining deferred payments stemming from these plans.\n\nStarting from the 2019 performance year, share-based variable pay plans are partly in the form of cash not linked to the Nordea share and partly in the form of Nordea shares, which makes the portion paid in Nordea shares equity-settled share-based plans.

The LTIP has been in place in Nordea since 2020. On 1 February 2023 the Board decided to launch an LTIP (LTIP 2023-2025) to the same target group as in 2022, being the CEO and members of the GLT in the first line of defence and approximatey 50 senior leaders.\n\nThe LTIPs cover a performance period of three years, respectively, from when they were launched, and are fully equity-settled. The LTIPs deliver conditional shares to the participants, i.e. a promise for the participant to receive shares if certain performance criteria are met.\n\nThe maximum number of shares allocated to the participants is decided when the LTIPs are launched and the final\n\nnumber of shares to be awarded to each participant will be determined after the end of the three-year performance period. No shares are awarded at the time when the LTIPs are launched and the conditional shares allocated.\n\nAfter the end of the performance period and once the Board has decided on the share award from the LTIP, deferral is applied to part of the share award for delivery annually in equal instalments over the following five-year period. Shares delivered to the participants are subject to a 12-month retention period during which the participants cannot sell them or perform any other transactions.\n\nThe LTIPs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, as outlined on the following pages covering each of the LTIPs.",

All shares in the LTIP 2012 are fully vested and consequently not conditional. 60% of the vested shares were deferred with forfeiture clauses in line with regulatory requirements and allotted over a five-year period, for the LTIP 2012 starting in May 2015.\n\nThe share balance outstanding is 3,015 matching shares, 9,045 performance shares I and 3,015 performance shares II at the end of the year.\n\n## Share-based variable remuneration plans other than LTIP plans\n\nThis section covers the variable share-based plans where TSR indexation (cash-settled plan up until 2018) and shares (equity-settled plans as from 2019) are used for deferral/retention. For the 2023 performance year, the plans are classified as the Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP) and bonus schemes (bonus).\n\nThe plans are annual plans with a service condition for the respective years and are fully expensed in the year when they are earned (one-year vesting period). The individual allocations are awarded at the beginning of the subsequent year.\n\nThe aim of the NIP is to strengthen Nordea's capability to recruit, motivate and retain the GLT, senior leaders as well as selected people leaders and specialists, and to reward strong performance. The NIP 2023 rewards performance meeting agreed predetermined targets on Group, business unit and individual level. The effect on the long-term results is to be\n\nconsidered when determining the targets. NIP awards will not exceed the fixed salary and are subject to deferral for material risk takers. It includes ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment clauses and retention applies in line with relevant remuneration regulations.\n\nIn 2023 bonus was offered only to selected groups of employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board, e.g. in Large Corporates & Institutions,\n\nNordea Asset Management, Nordea Funds and within Treasury in Group Finance. The aim is to ensure strong performance and maintain cost flexibility for Nordea. Individual awards are determined based on detailed performance assessments covering a range of financial and non-financial goals. 2022 bonus awards were paid in cash. For material risk takers, awards are partly delivered in shares with subsequent retention. Parts of the bonus awards for material risk takers are subject to a four- to five-year pro rata deferral period with forfeiture conditions applying during the deferral period.\n\nDeferrals from the NIP, Executive Incentive Programme (EIP), VSP and bonus plans not yet delivered to the participants as of 31 December 2023 are summarised in the following tables, including deferrals from the Leaders of Transformation Variable plan (offered in 2018-2019) and deferrals stemming from compensation for contracts in previous employments (buy-outs). Such agreements can be offered only in exceptional cases, in the context of hiring new staff, limited to the first year of employment.",

For further details see Note G8.2 'Pensions'.\n\nDefined benefit pension costs related to key management personnel in 2023 were EUR 0m (EUR 0m).\n\nThe pension obligations in the below table reflect the valuation under IAS 19 as of 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease compared with 2022 is mainly due to pension payments to retired executives during the year, changes in the discount rates used in the measurement of the obligations at the end of 2023 and currency effects from obligations in SEK. There are no defined benefit pension obligations towards the CEO and the Deputy Managing Director.\n\n| EUR                                                         | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Group Leadership Team:                                      |           |           |\n| 3 (3) individuals in Sweden                                 | 856,402   | 756,087   |\n| Former Chairman of the Board, former CEOs  and Deputy CEOs: |           |           |\n| Vesa Vainio 1                                               | 4,001,398 | 4,105,734 |\n| Lars G Nordstr\u00f6m                                            | 239,717   | 243,140   |\n| Casper von Koskull                                          | 325,254   | 338,920   |\n| Total                                                       | 5,422,771 | 5,443,881 |\n\n## Notice period and severance pay\n\nIn accordance with the service contract, the CEO has a notice period of 12 months and Nordea a notice period of 12 months.

The legal costs can e.g. include required legal defence costs related to claims made against Board members in cases where Board members are not found liable or guilty of any wrongdoing or grossly negligent behaviour.",

        "page_content": "## G9  Scope of consolidation\n\n## G9.1  Consolidated entities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company, Nordea Bank Abp and those entities that the parent company controls. Control exists when Nordea is exposed to variability in returns from its investments in another entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the other entity. Control is generally achieved when the parent company owns, directly or indirectly through group undertakings, more than 50% of the voting rights. For entities where voting rights do not give control, see the section 'Structured entities' below.\n\nAll group undertakings are consolidated using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the acquisition is regarded as a transaction whereby the parent company indirectly acquires the assets of the group undertaking and assumes its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The group's acquisition cost is established using a purchase price allocation analysis. In such analysis, the cost of the business combination is the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for the identifiable net assets acquired. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed.\n\nAs at the acquisition date Nordea recognises the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values.\n\nFor each business combination Nordea measures the non-controlling interests in the acquired business either at fair value or at its proportionate share of the acquired identifiable net assets.\n\nWhen the aggregate of the consideration transferred in a business combination and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests exceeds the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, the excess is reported as goodwill. If the difference is negative, such difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nEquity and net income attributable to non-controlling interests are separately disclosed on the balance sheet as well as in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances between the consolidated group undertakings are eliminated.\n\nThe group undertakings are included in the consolidated accounts as from the date on which control is transferred to Nordea and are no longer consolidated as from the date on which control ceases.\n\nIn the consolidation process the reporting of the group undertakings is adjusted to ensure consistency with the IFRS principles applied by Nordea.\n\n## Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nOne decisive variable when assessing if Nordea controls another entity is whether Nordea is exposed to variability in returns from the investment. For structured entities where voting rights are not the dominant factor when determining control, critical judgement has to be exercised when defining when Nordea is exposed to significant variability in returns. Nordea's critical judgement is that Nordea is normally exposed to variability in returns when Nordea receives more than 30% of the return produced by the structured entity. This is only relevant for structured entities if Nordea is also the investment manager and thus has influence over the return produced by the structured entity.\n\nMoreover, judgement relating to control is whether Nordea acts as an agent or as a principal. For unit-linked and other contracts where the policyholder/depositor decides both the amount and in which assets to invest, Nordea is considered to act as an agent and thus does not have control.\n\nJudgement also has to be exercised when assessing if a holding of a significant, but less than a majority, share of voting rights constitute so-called de facto control and to what extent potential voting rights need to be considered in the control assessment. Nordea's assessment is that Nordea does not currently control any entities where the share of voting rights is below 50%.",

The specific dividend amount is determined for each legal entity based on distributable funds, capital adequacy regulations and ratios, capital and business planning, local tax considerations and Group-internal policies. Regulatory restrictions, both general and local, on dividends as well as projected changes in the entities' capital requirements and risk exposure amounts are incorporated into the analysis regarding the dividend decisions.\n\nThe CRR requires credit institutions to hold liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity buffers which are adequate. There are also local liquidity requirements that restrict the movement of funds between legal entities.\n\nThe Group has pledged assets to collateralise its obligations under repurchase agreements, securities financing transactions, collateralised loan obligations and for margining purposes of OTC derivative liabilities. Further information is disclosed in Note G7.3 'Assets pledged'.\n\nFor banks under resolution, which was not applicable to Nordea at the balance sheet date, there are potential restrictions as the regulators have far-reaching resolution tools they can impose if deemed necessary.\n\nStatutory, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of non-controlling interests might restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. Since the Group did not have any material non-controlling interests at the balance sheet date, any protective rights associated with these did not give rise to significant restrictions.",

Translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the translation reserve in equity.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of group undertakings are treated as items in the same functional currency as the cash-generating unit to which they belong and are also translated at the closing rate.\n\nAny remaining equity in foreign branches is converted at the closing rates with translation differences recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount for the exchange difference relating to that foreign operation, recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve in equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.\n\n## G9.3   Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssociated undertakings are undertakings where the share of voting rights is between 20% and 50% and/or where Nordea has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nJoint ventures are entities where Nordea has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. At initial recognition the investment is recognised at acquisition cost. Fair value is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of associated undertakings and joint ventures. Any difference between Nordea's share of the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets and the purchase price is goodwill or negative goodwill. Goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the associated undertakings and joint ventures.\n\nProfit from companies accounted for under the equity method is defined as the post-acquisition change in Nordea's share of net assets in associated undertakings and joint ventures. Nordea's share of items accounted for in other comprehensive income in associated undertakings and joint ventures is accounted for in other comprehensive income in Nordea.\n\nProfit from companies accounted for under the equity method is reported post taxes in the income statement. Consequently, the tax expense related to this profit is excluded from the income tax expense for Nordea. Dividends received are accounted for as a reduction in the carrying amount.\n\nIf observable indicators (loss events) indicate that an associated undertaking or a joint venture is impaired, an impairment test is performed to assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment. The carrying amount of the investment in the associated undertaking or joint venture is compared with the recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less cost to sell) and the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount if required. Impairment of investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures is classified as 'Profit from associated undertakings and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method' in the income statement.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\nNordea is not generally involved in any sale or contribution of assets to or from associated undertakings or joint ventures, but if such transactions occur, Nordea's share of any profit recognised in the associate or joint venture is eliminated. Other transactions between Nordea and its associated undertakings or joint ventures are not eliminated.\n\nFor some associated undertakings and joint ventures not individually significant, the change in Nordea's share of the net assets is based on the external reporting of the associated undertakings and joint ventures and affects the financial statements of Nordea in the period in which the information is available. The reporting from the associated undertakings and joint ventures is, if applicable, adjusted to comply with Nordea's accounting policies.\n\nInvestments within Nordea's investment activities (classified as part of Nordea's venture capital organisation) are measured at fair value in accordance with the rules set out in IAS 28 and IFRS 9.\n\n## Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures\n\n| EURm                                                 | 31 Dec 2023   |   31 Dec 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Acquisition value at beginning of year               | 552           |           247 |\n| Acquisitions 1                                       | 1             |           329 |\n| Sales                                                | -             |             0 |\n| Share in earnings                                    | 14            |            -4 |\n| Share of other comprehensive income                  | -3            |             1 |\n| Dividend received                                    | -9            |            -8 |\n| Translation differences                              | -14           |           -13 |\n| Acquisition value at end of year                     | 541           |           552 |\n| Accumulated impairment charges  at beginning of year | -43           |           -40 |\n| Impairment charges 2                                 | -17           |            -4 |\n| Translation differences                              | 0             |             1 |\n| Accumulated impairment charges   at end of year      | -60           |           -43 |\n| Total                                                | 481           |           509 |\n\n- 1)  2022: Acquisition of associated undertakings in Topdanmark Life amounts to EUR 310m.\n- 2)  2023: Refers to impairment of shares in P27 and Invidem.",

Often legal arrangements impose strict limits on the decision-making powers of management over the ongoing activities of a structured entity. The same consolidation requirements apply to these entities, but as voting rights do not determine whether control exists, other factors are used to determine control.\n\nPower can exist due to agreements or other types of influence over a structured entity. This is normally the case when Nordea has sponsored or established a structured entity or when Nordea is the investment manager and has sole discretion as to investments and other administrative decisions.\n\nVariability in returns is also a prerequisite for consolidation. Service and commission fees in connection with the establishment of the structured entity are normally not significant enough to trigger consolidation, nor is acting as an investment manager or as a custodian. Funding in the form of fund units, loans or credit commitments can result in significant variability in returns. If Nordea is exposed to variability in returns and has power to affect the returns of the entity, it is consolidated. Nordea normally considers a share of more than 30% of the return produced by a structured entity to give rise to variability and thus to give control. Variability is measured as the sum of fees received and revaluation of assets held. For unit-linked and other contracts where the policyholder/depositor decides both the amount and in which assets to invest, Nordea is considered to act as an agent and, thus, does not have control.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nViking ABCP Conduit (Viking) has been established with the purpose of supporting trade receivable or accounts payable securitisation transactions to core Nordic customers. The SPE purchases trade receivables from approved sellers and funds the purchases either by issuing commercial paper (CP) via the established asset-backed commercial paper programme or by drawing funds under the liquidity facilities available.\n\nNordea has provided liquidity facilities to a maximum of EUR 856m (EUR 1,006m) and at year end EUR 802m (EUR 826m) was utilised. The total assets of the conduit amounted to EUR 806m (EUR 852m) at year end. The SPE is consolidated as Nordea manages the entity and is exposed to variability in returns through the liquidity facility. There are no significant restrictions on repayment of loans from Viking apart from the payments being dependent on the rate at which Viking releases its assets.\n\nAR Finance invests in notes backed by trade receivables. Nordea has provided liquidity facilities of a maximum of EUR 150m (EUR 150m) and at year end EUR 92m (EUR 103m) was utilised. The entity held assets of EUR 94m (EUR 105m) at year end. The SPE is consolidated as Nordea manages the entity and is exposed to variability in returns through the liquidity facility.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nDisclosures are provided for structured entities in which Nordea has an interest but over which Nordea has no control. Investment funds are the only interests in unconsolidated structured entities currently held by Nordea.\n\nNordea invests in investment funds:\n\n- \u00b7 on behalf of policyholders in Nordea Life & Pension\n- \u00b7 on behalf of depositors where the return is based on the investment\n\n- \u00b7 to hedge exposures to structured products issued to customers\n- \u00b7 that are illiquid private equity and credit funds.\n\nAs Nordea is exposed to variability in returns on a gross basis, information about these funds is disclosed although the net exposure is considerably less. Any change in the value of investment funds acquired on behalf of policyholders and depositors where the policyholder/depositor bears the investment risk is reflected in the value of the related liability, and the maximum net exposure to losses is zero. The change in the value of investment funds held on behalf of other policyholders is largely passed on to the policyholders, but as Nordea has issued guarantees in respect of some of these products, Nordea is exposed to value changes.\n\nInvestment funds acquired to hedge exposures to structured products reduce the net exposures to the extent hedges are effective.\n\nInvestments in illiquid private equity and credit funds are an integral part of managing balance sheet risks at Nordea. The maximum loss on private equity and credit funds is estimated at EUR 1,194m (EUR 975m), equal to the investments in the funds.\n\nNordea has established one unconsolidated structured entity, Thulite, in which Nordea does not currently have an interest. As Nordea does not control it, it is considered to have been sponsored by Nordea. Nordea entered into two new transactions with Thulite during 2023, where Nordea bought financial guarantees on portfolios of loans. Previously Nordea bought protection in the form of a CDS and other financial guarantees from Thulite. Nordea received less than EUR 1m in income from Thulite in 2022 and 2023.\n\nNordea's interests in unconsolidated structured entities and any related liability are disclosed in the table below. The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to credit loss before considering any hedges. Income related to these investments is recognised in 'Net result from items at fair value'.\n\n## Interest in unconsolidated structured entities\n\n| EURm                                                             | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Assets, carrying amount:                                         |               |               |\n| Shares                                                           | 10,670        | 9,488         |\n| Assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked  investment contracts   | 49,022        | 37,966        |\n| Total assets                                                     | 59,692        | 47,454        |\n| Liabilities, carrying amount:                                    |               |               |\n| Deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked  investment contracts | 49,022        | 37,966        |\n| Insurance contract liabilities                                   | 9,440         | 8,349         |\n| Total liabilities                                                | 58,462        | 46,315        |\n| Off-balance sheet, nominal amount:                               |               |               |\n| Loan commitments                                                 | -             | -             |\n\nNordea holds a large number of different funds that are classified as unconsolidated structured entities, some of which are managed by Nordea. These have different investment mandates and types of risk appetite, ranging from low-risk government bond funds to high-risk leveraged equity funds. The total assets of funds managed by Nordea are EUR 201bn (EUR 190bn). All funds are financed by deposits from unitholders. The total assets of investment funds not managed by Nordea are not considered meaningful for the purpose of understanding the related risks and are thus not disclosed.",

Comparative figures are not restated.\n\n## Retail Finance in Sweden\n\nNordea has decided to wind down its operations in Retail Finance in the Swedish finance company and to sell the existing loan portfolio. It is expected the sale will be completed within one year and the requirements listed above have been fulfilled. The portfolio was thus reclassified to 'Assets held for sale' in Q4 2023. The portfolio amounted to EUR 106m at the end of 2023.\n\n## Interest in Luminor in the Baltics\n\nIn 2018, when Nordea and DNB sold around 60% of their combined interest in Luminor to Blackstone, Nordea entered into a forward sale agreement with Blackstone to sell its remaining 19.95% holding over the coming years. As at 1 January 2022 Nordea held 11.6% of the shares in Luminor, valued at EUR 180m. The shares were classified as held for sale due to the forward sale agreement with Blackstone. The remaining shares were sold on 1 September 2022.\n\n## G9.6  Acquisitions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn a business combination, the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value, including any intangible assets identified in the acquisition. The net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities is compared with the consideration paid and any surplus is recognised as goodwill. See also Note G9.1 'Consolidated entities'.\n\n## Acquisition of Advinans\n\nOn 15 May 2023 the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Advinans AB was completed. The company has developed a digital broker platform for selling and administering occupational pensions. A purchase price of EUR 38m was paid at closing. Total assets in the company were EUR 2m and the acquired net assets EUR 1m, resulting in a surplus value of EUR 37m. The preliminary purchase price allocation is disclosed below.\n\n| EURm                                   | 15 May 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Acquired net assets 1                  | 1             |\n| Cost of combination 2                  | 38            |\n| Surplus value                          | 37            |\n| Allocation of surplus value:           |               |\n| IT software intangible asset           | 11            |\n| Customer relationship intangible asset | 5             |\n| Deferred tax asset                     | 2             |\n| Deferred tax liability                 | -3            |\n| Goodwill                               | 22            |\n\nNordea has estimated the fair value of the IT software intangible asset in Advinans to be EUR 11m. The fair value reflects the estimated replacement cost. The fair value of the IT software intangible asset is amortised over ten years, which is the estimated useful life.\n\nA customer relationship intangible asset has been identified and valued at EUR 5m, reflecting the profit above cost of equity expected to be generated from the existing customer base. The customer relationship intangible asset is amortised over ten years.\n\nGoodwill is mainly related to synergies, such as cross-selling with Nordea's existing customer base. The synergies cannot be accounted for as separate intangible assets under IFRS 3 and consequently end up as goodwill. The goodwill is expected to have an indefinite life and is consequently not amortised.\n\nThe revenue and operating profit for the period during which the company was consolidated was EUR 1m and EUR -3m, respectively. Had the company been consolidated as from 1 January 2023, it would have contributed a revenue of EUR 1m and an operating profit of EUR -5m.\n\n## Acquisition of Topdanmark Life (Nordea Pension)\n\nOn 1 December 2022 the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Topdanmark Liv Holding A/S was completed. Topdanmark Liv Holding A/S was the parent company of a group including the insurance company Topdanmark Livsforsikring A/S as well as asset management and property companies. The group conducts life and pensions business in Denmark. The group had approx. 300 employees and EUR 12bn in assets under management as of the acquisition date.\n\nA purchase price of EUR 283m was paid to Topdanmark Forsikring A/S in December 2022.

        "page_content": "Business areas\n\nG9.6  Acquisitions, cont.\n\nNordea estimated the fair value of the insurance contract liabilities with the same model applied when estimating fair value in Nordea's transition to IFRS 17, as described in Note 10.6 'Transition to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts' in the 2022 Annual Report. This resulted in an increase in the insurance contract liabilities of EUR 194m and a corresponding reduction in 'Acquired net assets', in line with the transition impact in Nordea on contracts on Nordea's balance sheet at transition on 1 January 2022. A large part of the adjustment is included in the contractual service margin (CSM) under IFRS 17.\n\nNordea has also estimated the fair value of IT software in Topdanmark Life to be EUR 44m, EUR 31m less than the carrying amount in Topdanmark Life. The fair value reflects the estimated replacement cost. This reduction in value is disclosed in 'Acquired net assets'. The fair value of the IT software is amortised over ten years, which is the estimated useful life.\n\n## G10  Other disclosures\n\n## G10.1  Additional disclosures on the statement of changes in equity\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEquity is the residual interest in recognised assets after deduction of recognised liabilities. For equity there are no requirements to distribute cash flows. Instruments are classified as financial liabilities if such genuine requirements exist, for instance to pay interest when a triggering event occurs that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instruments. See Note G3.3 'Classification and measurement' for more information, including the critical judgements applied by Nordea.\n\nAny payments connected to instruments classified as equity are accounted for directly in equity and presented as dividends. Nordea determines payments on financial instruments classified as equity (i.e. Additional Tier 1 instruments) as distribution of profits and they are therefore accounted for as dividends. Dividends to shareholders are recognised as a reduction of equity when the Annual General Meeting has adopted the proposal. The reduction of equity is accounted for when the Board of Directors decides on dividends in situations where the Annual General Meeting has given the Board of Directors a mandate to make such a decision up to a certain cap.\n\nInvestments in own shares are not accounted for as assets; instead, they are recognised as a reduction in equity net of any transaction costs. Acquisitions of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations are recognised as a reduction in invested unrestricted equity. Treasury shares acquired to optimise the capital structure and Nordea's buy-back programmes are recognised as a reduction in retained earnings. Transaction costs related to repurchasing of treasury shares are also recognised in equity. There is no impact on the financial statements when shares are cancelled. Sales of own shares in the trading operations are recognised as increases in invested unrestricted equity.\n\nContracts on Nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, for instance derivatives such as options and warrants, are either presented as financial assets or liabilities, meaning that these are not equity instruments.\n\nNon-controlling interests comprise the portion of net assets of group undertakings not owned directly or indirectly by Nordea Bank Abp. For each business combination, Nordea measures the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nOther reserves comprise income and expenses, net of tax effects, which are reported in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nFor unit-linked contracts, a customer relationship intangible asset was identified. The customer relationship intangible asset reflected the profit above cost of equity expected to be generated from the existing contracts. The value of the intangible asset also included the profit above cost of equity from expected future premiums from existing customers. This intangible asset was reclassified to an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows in the transition to IFRS 17.\n\nGoodwill is mainly related to the value of the assembled workforce and synergies, such as cross-selling with Nordea's existing customer base and increased assets under management in Nordea Asset Management. Synergies are expected to be generated in the Nordea Group. The assembled workforce and synergies cannot be accounted for as separate intangible assets under IFRS 3 and consequently end up as goodwill. The goodwill is expected to have an indefinite life and is consequently not amortised.\n\nApart from undistributed profits from previous years, retained earnings include the equity portion of untaxed reserves. Untaxed reserves according to national rules are accounted for as equity net of deferred tax at prevailing tax rates in the respective country.\n\nIn addition, Nordea's share of the undistributed earnings in associated and joint ventures since the date of acquisition is included in retained earnings.\n\n## Additional Tier 1 capital holders\n\nNordea has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of Nordea and non-accumulating. Some of these instruments also include a requirement for Nordea to pay interest if the instruments are no longer allowed to be included in Tier 1 capital. The inclusion of the subordinated loan in Tier 1 capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control of Nordea and the holders of the instruments., and Nordea therefore classifies the instruments as financial liabilities. Instruments without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no requirement for Nordea to pay interest or principal to the holders of the instruments.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nFor information about non-controlling interests, see Note G9.1 'Consolidated entities'.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe share capital amounts to EUR 4,049,951,919. The shares in Nordea have no nominal value. Each share carries one voting right. For more information about the number of registered shares, see 'Statement of changes in equity'.\n\n## Invested unrestricted equity\n\nInvested unrestricted equity equals the amount of the share premium reserve of Nordea Bank AB (publ) before completion of the re-domiciliation by way of a cross-border reversed merger. Invested unrestricted equity has also been impacted by acquisitions and sales of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nThese reserves include reserves for cash flow hedges, financial assets classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' and accumulated remeasurements of defined benefit pension plans as well as a reserve for translation differences.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings primarily comprise Nordea's undistributed profits from previous years.",

Deposits from key management personnel amounted to EUR 7.8m (EUR 7.3m) and interest on these deposits amounted to EUR -0.1m (EUR -0.0m). Loan commitments to key management personnel amounted to EUR 0.2m (EUR 0.1m).\n\nFor key management personnel employed by Nordea the same credit terms apply as for other employees. In Finland, the employee interest rate for mortgage loans corresponds to Nordea Bank Abp's funding cost with a margin of 30bp and for other loans the employee interest rate corresponds to Nordea Bank Abp's funding cost with a margin of 60-500bp. In Denmark, the employee interest rate for loans is variable and between 3.55% - 5.70% depending of the type of mortgage. In Norway, the variable interest rate on loans to empoloyees is 5.01%. Mortgage loans with fixed interest rates are offered with the same rates as mortgage loans to Premium customers. In Sweden, loans approved with employee conditions are a maximum amount at SEK 3m for any type of loan and a maximum amount at SEK 0.4m for car loans. The interest rate for these loans is 215bp lower than the corresponding interest rate for external customers. For interest on loans above SEK 3m and SEK 0.4m respectively, the employees receive the same maximal discount as Nordea's best external customers.\n\nLoans to family members of key management personnel who do not live in the same household as key management personnel are granted on normal market terms, as are loans to key management personnel who are not employed by Nordea. For more information about transactions with key management personnel, see Note G8.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n## G10.5  Events after the financial period\n\n## Share buy-backs and share cancellations\n\nAfter 31 December 2023 Nordea has further acquired 11,364,932 shares, which correspond to a EUR 127,974,947.37 reduction of retained earnings, under its fourth share buyback programme, which started on 28 April 2023 and will end no later than 5 March 2024.\n\nAn aggregated amount of 6,779,548 treasury shares, which were held for capital optimisation purposes and acquired through share buy-backs, were cancelled in January.

Risk governance\n\nMaintaining risk awareness in the organisation is an integral part of Nordea's business strategy. Nordea has defined clear risk and liquidity management frameworks including policies and instructions for different risk types, capital adequacy and capital structure.\n\nCurrently, there are significant risks related to the macroeconomic environment due to geopolitical turbulence. The consequential risks include impacts from possibly increasing energy prices, interest rates staying higher for longer and elevated inflationary pressures. Furthermore, geopolitical instability can cause a risk that demand remains subdued.\n\nRepeated negative supply shocks could lead to continued high inflation simultaneously with a sharp contraction in output, resulting in recession. A sharp upward shift in business and consumer inflationary expectations would result in a steepening yield curve.\n\nIn order to continuously monitor potential adverse outcomes, Nordea has executed a number of internal stress tests with a focus on inflation and geopolitical developments. Depending on government and central bank responses, a stagflation scenario could test the vulnerability of Nordea to an increase in unemployment combined with a potential decline in commercial and residential real estate prices. Nordea could see significant fair value adjustments due to higher interest rates and increased covered bond spreads while net interest income (NII) could be negatively affected by an inverted yield curve and higher funding spreads. Several of these stress tests also consider climate-related physical and transition risks. In the internal stress tests, Nordea's capital and liquidity situation has shown resilience. Nordea has also enhanced the regular monitoring of credit risk developments.\n\n## 1.1 Internal Control Framework\n\nThe Internal Control Framework covers the whole Group and includes Group Board, Group CEO and senior executive management responsibilities regarding internal control, all Group functions and business areas including outsourced activities and distribution channels. Under the Internal Control Framework, all business areas, Group functions and units are responsible for managing the risks they incur when conducting their activities and to have controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of the Internal Control Framework, Nordea has established Group control functions with appropriate and sufficient authority, independence and access to the Group Board to fulfil their mission in line with the Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Internal Control Framework ensures effective and efficient operations, adequate identification, measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of financial and non-financial information (both internal and external) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, supervisory requirements and Group internal rules.\n\nThe internal control process is carried out by the governing bodies, management, risk management functions and other staff at Nordea. The internal control process is based on five main components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication as well as monitoring. The internal control process aims to create the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisation to contribute to the effectiveness and high quality of internal controls through, for instance, clear definitions, assignment of roles and responsibilities and common tools and procedures.\n\n## 1.2 Decision-making bodies for risk, liquidity and capital management\n\nThe Group Board, the Board Risk Committee, the Group CEO in the GLT, the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and the",

In addition, the CEO Credit Committee, the Executive Credit Committee and Business Area Credit Committees are the key bodies for credit decision-making.\n\n## Group Board\n\nThe Group Board has the following overarching risk management responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Decide on the Group's risk strategy and the Risk Appetite Framework, including the Risk Appetite Statement, with at least annual reviews and additional updates when needed.\n- \u00b7 Oversee and monitor the implementation of the risk strategy, Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Management Framework and regularly evaluate whether the Group has effective and appropriate controls to manage the risks.\n\nThe Group Board decides on the Group Board Directive on Capital including the dividend policy. The directive is to ensure adequate capital levels within the Group on an ongoing and forward-looking basis, consistent with Nordea's business model, risk appetite and regulatory requirements and expectations.\n\n## Board Risk Committee\n\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Group Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning management and control of the risks, risk frameworks, controls and processes associated with the Group's operations.\n\n## Group CEO\n\nThe Group CEO is responsible to the Group Board for the overall management of the Group's operations and risks. Responsibilities include ensuring that the risk strategy and risk management decided by the Group Board are implemented, the necessary practical measures are taken and risks are monitored and limited.\n\nThe Group CEO is supported in decision-making by senior management within the Group Leadership Team (the GLT). Matters that are to be decided by the Group Board and matters of principle or otherwise of particular importance that are to be decided by the Boards of Directors of the major subsidiaries of Nordea Bank Abp, must first be presented to the Group CEO for discussion and recommendation.\n\nGroup-wide committees have been established in order to promote coordination within the Group, thus ensuring commitment to and ownership of Group-wide prioritisations, decisions and implementation. The composition and areas of responsibility of each committee is established in Group CEO Instructions.\n\n## Asset and Liability Committee\n\nThe Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is subordinated to the Group CEO in the GLT and chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO). ALCO decides on changes to the financial operations and the risk profile of the balance sheet, including asset and liability management (ALM), balance sheet management and liquidity management. ALCO also decides on certain issuances and capital injections for all wholly owned legal entities within the Group. ALCO has established sub-committees for its work and decision-making within specific risk areas. ALCO met on 12 occasions during 2023.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee is subordinated to the Group CEO and chaired by the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The Risk Committee manages the overarching Risk Management Framework and prepares or provides guidance regarding proposals\n\nto the Group CEO in the GLT and/or the Group Board on issues of major importance concerning Nordea's Risk Management Framework. The Group Board decides on the Risk Appetite Framework. The Risk Committee allocates the risk appetite to the risk-taking units, and the first line of defence is responsible for ensuring that limits are further cascaded and operationally implemented. The Risk Committee has established sub-committees for its work and decision-making within specific risk areas. The Risk Committee met on 20 occasions during 2023.\n\n## Credit decision-making bodies\n\nThe governing bodies for credit risk and/or the Credit Risk Management Framework are the Group Board, the Board Risk Committee and the Risk Committee. The Group Board and the local Boards of Directors delegate credit decisionmaking according to the powers to act as described in the Group Board Directive on Risk.\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO Credit Committee is chaired by the Group CEO and includes all members of the Executive Credit Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Executive Credit Committee is chaired by the Head of Group Credit Management. The Group CEO appoints the members of the Executive Credit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Business Area Credit Committees: The Executive Credit Committee establishes credit committees for each business area as required by organisational and customer segmentation.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nThe subsidiary Board of Directors (BoD) is responsible for approving risk appetite limits and capital actions within the overarching framework set by the Group Board of Directors. The proposals for such items are the responsibility of the relevant subsidiary management which is supported by Group functions.\n\nSubsidiaries must adhere to the Internal Control Framework of the Group including the Group Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management Frameworks, unless local legal or supervisory requirements determine otherwise. The subsidiary BoD has oversight responsibilities concerning the management and control of risk, the implementation of risk management frameworks as well as the processes associated with the subsidiary's operations. In addition, there are risk management functions responsible for the risk management framework and processes within the subsidiary.\n\nThe subsidiary CEO is part of the decision-making process at the subsidiary level and is responsible for the daily operations.\n\n## 1.3 Governance of risk management and compliance\n\nGroup Risk and Group Compliance constitute Nordea's independent second line of defence functions. The second line of defence is organised so that adequate resources are allocated to support processes and to cover the business organisation, legal structure and country dimensions. Group Risk oversees the implementation of the Group risk policies (excluding compliance risk) and, according to a risk-based approach, monitors and controls the Risk Management Framework. Group Compliance oversees the implementation of the Compliance Risk Management Framework, which is a part of the overarching Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Risk Management Framework ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing and measuring, responding to and mitigating, controlling and monitoring and reporting risks to enable informed decisions on risk-taking. The Risk Management Framework encompasses all risks to which Nordea is or could be exposed, including ESG as drivers of existing risks, off-balance sheet risks and risks in a stressed situation.

In addition to this, Nordea's compliance with regulatory requirements is reported to the Risk Committee, the GLT, the Board Risk Committee and the Group Board. The Group Board and the CEO in each legal entity regularly receive local risk reporting.\n\nThe Risk Identification and Materiality Assessment Process starts with identifying risks to which Nordea is or could be exposed. Risks are then assessed for relevance, classified and included in the Common Risk Taxonomy.\n\nAll risks within the Nordea Common Risk Taxonomy need to be classified as material or not material for risk management and capital purposes. Material risks are those assessed as having a material impact on Nordea's current and future financial position, its customers and stakeholders. These risks will typically refer to a higher level within the risk taxonomy, which captures a number of underlying risks where losses arise from a common source.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) supports effective risk management and a sound risk culture by enabling informed decisions on risk-taking, with the objective of ensuring that risk-taking activities are conducted within the organisation's risk capacity.\n\nRisk capacity is the maximum level of risk that Nordea is deemed able to assume given its capital (own funds), its risk management and control capabilities and its regulatory constraints. Risk appetite is the aggregate level and types of risk that Nordea is willing to assume within its risk capacity, in line with its business model, to achieve its strategic objectives. The Risk Appetite Statement is the articulation of the Group Board approved risk appetite and comprises the qualitative statements and quantitative limits and triggers by main risk type, which are deemed appropriate to be able to operate with a prudent risk profile.\n\nCredit concentration metrics cover e.g. sectors and geographical regions in terms of size and importance. Stress test metrics are applied to credit, market and liquidity risk metrics to ensure a forward-looking approach to risk management. Operational risk metrics cover both residual risk levels and requirements for mitigating actions as well as limits for incident losses. Additionally, financed emissions metrics are included as part of Nordea's ESG RAF.\n\nModel risk is defined as the risk of adverse effects on capital adequacy, financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making and damage to Nordea's reputation from the use of models.\n\n## Risk appetite processes\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework contains all processes and controls to establish, monitor and communicate Nordea's risk appetite:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk capacity setting based on capital and liquidity position: On an annual basis, the Group's overall risk capacity is aligned with the financial and capital planning process, based on Nordea's risk strategy. The risk capacity is set in line with Nordea's capital and liquidity position, including an appropriate shock-absorbing capacity.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite allocation by risk type: Risk appetite includes risk appetite limits for the main risk types that Nordea is exposed to. Risk appetite triggers are also set for these main risk types, to act as early indicators for key decision-makers that the risk profile for a particular risk type is approaching its risk appetite limit.\n- \u00b7 Risk limit setting: Measurable risk limits are established and set at an appropriate level to manage risk-taking effectively.\n\nRisk appetite limits are set by the Group Board. These form the basis for setting the risk limits which are established and approved at lower decision-making levels. The RAF is calibrated to ensure consistency throughout the framework. Subsidiary risk appetite limits must be set by the appropriate governing body in alignment with local regulatory requirements and consistent with the Group risk limits.\n\n- \u00b7 Controlling and monitoring risk exposures against risk limits: Regular controlling and monitoring of risk exposures compared to risk limits are carried out to ensure that risk-taking activity remains within the risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite limit breach management process: Group Risk and Group Compliance oversee that risk appetite limit breaches are appropriately escalated to the Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee. Group Risk and Group Compliance report monthly on any breaches of the risk appetite to the Group Board and other relevant governing bodies including a follow-up on the status of actions to be taken, until the relevant risk exposure is within the risk appetite. The reporting includes a consistent status indicator to communicate the current risk exposure compared to the risk appetite limit for all risk types covered by the Risk Appetite Statements.\n\n## Embedding risk appetite in business processes\n\nThe end-to-end risk appetite process cycle is aligned with other strategic processes, including the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) and the Recovery Plan.\n\nThe risk appetite is embedded in business processes and communicated across the organisation in order to meet Nordea's objectives of maintaining a sound risk culture. This includes but is not limited to ensuring a strong link between the assessed risk appetite and the business plans and budgets as well as the capital and liquidity position. Risk appetite is also considered in the Group recoverability and resolvability assessments as well as the incentive structures and remuneration framework.\n\n## 1.4 Disclosure requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation - Capital and Risk Management Report 2023\n\nAdditional information on risk and capital management is presented in the Capital and Risk Management Report 2023, in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.\n\n## 2. Credit risk\n\nCredits granted within the Group must conform to the common principles established for the Group. Nordea strives to have a well-diversified credit portfolio that is adapted to the structure of its home markets and economies. Nordea's loan portfolio is split by type of exposure classes (corporate and retail) or by sector, then further broken down by segment, industry and geography and reported monthly, quarterly and annually.\n\nThe key principles for managing Nordea's risk exposures are:\n\n- \u00b7 risk-based approach, i.e. the risk management functions should be aligned to the nature, size and complexity of Nordea's business, ensuring that efforts undertaken are proportional to the risks in question\n- \u00b7 independence, i.e. the risk control function should be independent of the business it controls\n- \u00b7 three lines of defence, as further described in the Group Board Directive on Internal Governance.\n\nGroup Credit Management is the first line of defence and is responsible for the credit process and Industry Credit Policies. Group Credit Risk Control is the second line of defence and is",

Group Credit Risk Control is also responsible for controlling and monitoring the quality of the credit portfolio and the credit process.\n\nThe basis of credit risk management at Nordea is allocating limits to customers and customer groups which are aggregated and assigned to units responsible for their continuous monitoring and development. In addition to the procedures for allocating customer and customer group limits, Nordea's credit risk management framework also includes the credit risk appetite framework, which provides a comprehensive and risk-based portfolio perspective through relevant asset quality and concentration risk measures. Each division/ unit is primarily responsible for managing the credit risks in its operations within the applicable framework and limits, including identification, control and reporting.\n\nWithin the powers to act granted by the Board of Directors, internal credit risk limits are approved by credit decisionmaking authorities on different levels of the organisation constituting the maximum risk appetite in relation to the customer in question. Individual credit decisions within the approved internal credit risk limit are taken within the customer responsible unit. The risk categorisation together with the exposure of the customer decides at what level the credit decision will be made. Responsibility for a credit risk lies with the customer responsible unit. Customers are classified according to risk and assigned a rating or a score in accordance with Nordea's rating and scoring guidelines. The rating and scoring of customers aim to predict their probability of default and consequently rank them according to their respective default risk. Rating and scoring are used as integrated parts of credit risk management and the credit decision-making process.

The potential for loss is lowered by credit risk mitigation techniques.

Industry credit policies are established for those industries that have a significant weight in the portfolio and/or are either highly cyclical or volatile or assessed as vulnerable to climate-related risks or require special industry competencies.\n\nCredit decisions are reached after a credit risk assessment, based on principles that are defined consistently across the Group. These principles emphasise the need to adjust the depth and scope of the assessment according to the risk. The same credit risk assessments are used as input for determining the internal ratings. Credit decisions at Nordea reflect Nordea's view of both the customer relationship and the credit risk.\n\nESG factors are assessed as a material or potentially material driver of credit risk. Nordea provides an in-depth summary of the materiality assessment outcomes and identification, mitigation, management, capital adequacy and response to ESG factors as a risk driver in the business area sections, the sustainability section and in the Pillar 3 report.\n\nFor corporate borrowers, in summary, ESG assessments are performed according to the size and type of the transaction and the customer's internal segmentation. ESG assessments are performed on new customers, in ordinary reviews of existing customers and when the ESG-related risk(s) or credit exposure on existing customers significantly changes. ESGrelated risks identified qualitatively as material at customer level provide input to the credit risk assessment to reach conclusions on the customer group's risk level included in the credit memorandum. Approvals are made according to the established credit decision-making process. For customers associated with high ESG-related risk levels, decisions are escalated to higher-level credit committees in line with the Group's Credit Governance where relevant.\n\nWhen conducting ESG assessments related to credit risks, a dedicated process which includes identifying both a customer's vulnerability and resilience towards material ESG",

To support these analyses, external databases are used to assess performance on specific ESG-related risks and to assess if the company has been or is involved in ESG-related controversies.\n\nClimate-related transition and physical risks are assessed with an enhanced focus for larger customers. The key components of the assessment include counterparties' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity developments, the corresponding quality of their transition planning and the resulting impact of climate-related transition and physical risks on customer repayment capacity. This analysis is aligned with the Group targets on financed GHG emissions reductions and transition plan coverage.\n\nFor certain customers, there is an enhanced focus on environmental and social risks. The process includes ensuring that sufficient policies and programmes are in place to reduce potential harmful impacts on, for example, the environment, communities, health and safety issues and indigenous rights. Additionally, Nordea follows applicable valuation standards and regulatory requirements, which includes taking ESG factors into account in applying market values for collateralised real estate assets, when available and/or relevant.\n\nESG-related considerations in the credit process are further guided by the internal Industry Credit Policies, which include ESG-related exclusion criteria from exposure to harmful or controversial economic activities and requirements on engagement and monitoring of climate-related transition plans.\n\nIn addition to these processes, where relevant, Nordea carries out an environmental and social impact assessment when financing large infrastructure and industrial projects, as part of its commitment to the Equator Principles.\n\nThe overall credit risk assessment is a combined risk conclusion on the borrower's repayment capacity and recovery position. The risk conclusion must be sufficiently forwardlooking in relation to the risk profile of the customer and the maturity of the transaction.\n\nIn addition to the credit risk assessment made in connection with a new or changed exposure in relation to a customer, an annual or ongoing credit review process is in place. The review process is an important part of the ongoing credit assessment process.\n\nIf credit weakness is identified in relation to a customer exposure, the customer is classified as 'high risk' and receives special attention in terms of more frequent reviews and testing the need of individual provisions when credit events are identified. In addition to the ongoing monitoring, an action plan is established outlining how to minimise the potential credit loss. If necessary, a work-out team is established to support the customer responsible unit.\n\n## 2.2 Credit risk mitigation\n\nCredit risk mitigation is an inherent part of the credit decision process. In every credit decision and review, the valuation of collateral is considered as well as the adequacy of covenants and other risk mitigations. A fundamental credit risk mitigation technique used by Nordea is to obtain collateral. Collateral is always required, when reasonable and possible, to minimise the risk of credit losses.\n\nAt Nordea, the main collateral types are real estate, floating charges and leasing objects. Collateral coverage should generally be higher for exposures of financially weaker customers than for those who are financially strong.\n\nIndependently of the strength of the collateral position, the repayment capacity is the starting point for the credit assessment and the assignment of credit limits. Regarding large exposures, syndication of loans is the primary tool for managing concentration risk, while credit risk mitigation using credit default swaps is applied to a limited extent. Covenants included in credit agreements are complementary to collateral protection.\n\nMost exposures of substantial size and complexity include appropriate covenants. Covenants provide early warning signs that enable Nordea to detect, and react on, a deterioration in the borrower's credit quality or overall performance. Covenant breaches allow Nordea to cancel the credit facility and demand repayment of the outstanding credits.\n\nThe collateral value should always be based on the market value. The market value is defined as the estimated amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. From this market value, a haircut is applied. The haircut is defined as a percentage by which the asset's market value is reduced ensuring a margin against loss. The haircut should reflect the volatility of the market value of the asset, liquidity and cost of liquidation. A minimum haircut is set for each collateral type. In addition to the haircut, potential higher-ranking claims are also deducted from the market value when calculating the maximum collateral value.\n\nThe same principles of calculation must be used for all exposures.\n\n## 2.3 Collateral distribution\n\nThe distribution of the collateral remained stable during 2023, with the majority of the collateral stemming from residential and commercial real estate at 93% (93%). The share of commercial real estate increased to 18% (17%), while residential real estate decreased to 75% (76%). The proportions of the other collateral groups remained roughly the same during 2023.\n\n## Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\n|                                                |            | 31 Dec 2023                                                         | 31 Dec 2023                                             | 31 Dec 2022                                                         | 31 Dec 2022                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                           | Note       | Amortised cost and  fair value through  other comprehensive  income | Financial assets at  fair value through  profit or loss | Amortised cost and  fair value through  other comprehensive  income | Financial assets at  fair value through  profit or loss |\n| Loans to central banks and credit institutions | G3.8       | 3,091                                                               | 1,202                                                   | 2,854                                                               | 2,621                                                   |\n| Loans to the public                            | G3.8       | 272,934                                                             | 73,526                                                  | 276,760                                                             | 70,627                                                  |\n| Interest-bearing securities                    | G3.9       | 36,703                                                              | 31,301                                                  | 32,538                                                              | 35,691                                                  |\n| Derivatives                                    | G3.12      | -                                                                   | 26,525                                                  | -                                                                   | 36,578                                                  |\n| Off-balance sheet items, nominal amounts       | G7.1, G7.2 | 102,461                                                             | 139                                                     | 107,261                                                             | 228                                                     |\n| Total                                          |            | 415,189                                                             | 132,693                                                 | 419,413                                                             | 145,745                                                 |",

Stage 1 includes assets with no significant increase in credit risk, stage 2 includes assets with a significant increase in credit risk, and stage 3 includes defaulted assets (credit impaired). All assets are assessed individually for staging. Significant assets in stage 3 are assessed for provisions individually. Assets in stage 1 and stage 2 and insignificant assets in stage 3 are assessed for provisions collectively.\n\nThroughout the process of identifying and mitigating credit impairment, Nordea continuously reviews the quality of credit exposures. Weak/high-risk exposures and credit-impaired exposures (stage 3) are closely monitored and reviewed at least on a quarterly basis in terms of current performance, business outlook, future debt service capacity and the possible need for individual provisions.\n\nSpecific credit risk adjustments comprise individually and collectively assessed provisions. These adjustments are referred to as loan losses in the income statement, while they are referred to as allowances and provisions on the balance sheet. Individually assessed provisions are a trigger for default.\n\n## Individual provisioning\n\nA need for individual provisioning is recognised if, based on credit events and observable data, a negative impact is likely on the customer's expected future cash flow to the extent that full repayment is unlikely (pledged collateral taken into account).\n\nExposures with individually assigned provisions are credit impaired, defaulted and in stage 3. The size of the provision is equal to the estimated loss, which is the difference between the book value of the outstanding exposure and the discounted value of the expected future cash flow, including the value of pledged collateral.\n\n## Collective provisioning\n\nThe collective model is executed quarterly and assessed for each legal unit/branch. One important driver for provisions is the trigger for transferring assets from stage 1 to stage 2. For assets recognised from 1 January 2018, changes to the lifetime probability of default (PD) are used as the trigger. In addition, customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than 30 days past due are also transferred to stage 2. In stage 1, the provisions equal the 12-month expected losses. In stages 2 and 3, the provisions equal the lifetime expected losses. The output is complemented by an expert-based analysis process to ensure adequate provisioning. Defaulted customers without individual provisions have collective provisions.\n\n## Default\n\nCustomers with exposures that are past due more than 90 days, in bankruptcy or considered unlikely to pay are regarded as defaulted and non-performing and will be in stage 3. Such customers can be either servicing debt or non-servicing, i.e. no longer able or willing to fulfil its debt payment obligations.",

Typically, this situation occurs if the customer succeeds in creating a balance in financials. In order to be cured, the recovery should include the customer's total liabilities, an established satisfactory repayment plan and an assessment that the recovery is underway.\n\n## 2.7 Forbearance\n\nForbearance is eased terms or restructuring due to the borrower experiencing or about to experience financial difficulties. The intention of granting forbearance for a limited time period is to help the customer return to a sustainable financial situation ensuring full repayment of the outstanding debt. Examples of eased terms are changes in amortisation profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as ease of covenants. Forbearance is undertaken on a selective and individual basis for all customers and is followed by impairment testing for corporate customers as forbearance is considered a credit event. Individual loan loss provisions are recognised if necessary. For retail customers the collective models described in 2.6 above are applied. Forbearance is approved according to the powers to act, and forborne exposures can be performing or non-performing.\n\n## Forbearance\n\n| EURm                                                              | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forborne loans                                                    | 2,261         | 2,064         |\n| - of which defaulted                                              | 1,045         | 903           |\n| Allowances for individually assessed impaired  and forborne loans | 455           | 360           |\n| - of which defaulted                                              | 420           | 336           |\n\n| Key ratios                   | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forbearance ratio 1          | 0.8%          | 0.7%          |\n| Forbearance coverage ratio 2 | 20%           | 17%           |\n| - of which defaulted         | 40%           | 37%           |\n\n## Sensitivities\n\n|                                 | 31 Dec 2023            | 31 Dec 2023                        | 31 Dec 2022            | 31 Dec 2022                        |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| EURm                            | Recognised  provisions | Provisions if one  notch downgrade | Recognised  provisions | Provisions if one  notch downgrade |\n| Personal Banking                | 405                    | 526                                | 387                    | 488                                |\n| Business Banking                | 986                    | 1,114                              | 1,036                  | 1,166                              |\n| Large Corporates & Institutions | 396                    | 431                                | 402                    | 441                                |\n| Other                           | 38                     | 51                                 | 35                     | 46                                 |\n| Total                           | 1,825                  | 2,122                              | 1,860                  | 2,141                              |\n\n## 2.8 Sensitivities\n\nOne important factor in estimating expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 is to assess what constitutes a significant increase in credit risk. To understand the sensitivities to these triggers, Nordea has calculated model-based provisions under two different scenarios:\n\n|                             | Triggers   | Scenario 1   | Scenario 2   |\n|-----------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Retail portfolios           |            |              |              |\n| Relative threshold          | 100%       | 50%          | 150%         |\n| Absolute 12-month threshold | 45 bp      | 35 bp        | 55 bp        |\n| Absolute lifetime threshold | 300 bp     | 250 bp       | 350 bp       |\n| Notching 1                  | 1-6        | 1 less       | 1 more       |\n| Non-retail portfolios       |            |              |              |\n| Relative threshold          | 150%       | 100%         | 200%         |\n| Absolute 12-month threshold | 20 bp      | 15 bp        | 25 bp        |\n| Absolute lifetime threshold | 400 bp     | 350 bp       | 450 bp       |\n| Notching 1                  | 1-6        | 1 less       | 1 more       |\n\nThe provisions would have increased by EUR 16m (EUR 20m) in scenario 1 and decreased by EUR 12m (EUR 20m) in scenario 2. For more information on the rating scale and average PDs, see tables 'Rating/scoring information on loans measured at amortised cost' on page 231.\n\nThe provisions are sensitive to rating migration even if the triggers are not reached. The table below shows the impact on provisions from a one notch downgrade of all Nordea's exposures. It includes both the impact of the higher risk for all exposures as well as the impact of transferring exposures from stage 1 to stage 2 that reach the trigger. It also includes the impact of exposures with one rating grade above default going into default, which is estimated at EUR 132m (EUR 118m). This figure is based on calculations with the statistical model rather than individual estimates that would be the case in reality for material defaulted loans.",

Nordea uses three macroeconomic scenarios: a baseline scenario, a favourable scenario and an adverse scenario. 2023 the scenarios were weighted into the final expected credit losses (ECL) as follows: baseline 50%, adverse 40% and favourable 10% (baseline 50%, adverse 40% and favourable 10% at the end of 2022). The weightings reflected a continued higher downside risks in the macroeconomic projections.\n\nThe macroeconomic scenarios are provided by Group Risk at Nordea, based on the Oxford Economics Model. The forecast is a combination of modelling and expert judgement, subject to thorough checks and quality control processes. The model has been built to give a good description of the historical relationships between economic variables and to capture the key linkages between those variables. The weight of the adverse scenario was kept at an elevated level, reflecting continued uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThe macroeconomic scenarios reflect Nordea's view of how the Nordic economies might develop in light of the conflict in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. They take into consideration the possibility of continued high inflation, reinforced by a renewed surge in energy prices, and the potential impact of high interest rates on financial markets and economic activity. When developing the scenarios and determining the relative weighting between the scenarios, Nordea takes into account projections made by Nordic central banks, Nordea Research and the European Central Bank.\n\nThe baseline scenario foresees soft landings in the Nordic economies and slightly higher unemployment in the coming years as the pass-through of higher rates and elevated inflation continues to weigh on economic activity. While growth in 2024 remains moderate in Denmark and Norway, GDP stagnates in Finland and Sweden. Core inflation is expected to remain elevated. House prices have stabilised after the downward adjustment in 2023. In 2024 prices are expected to rise slowly before picking further up in 2025 and 2026. The risks to the baseline forecast are tilted to the downside.\n\nNordea's two alternative macroeconomic scenarios cover a range of plausible risk factors which may cause growth to deviate from the baseline scenario. Persistent and high inflation, reinforced by higher energy prices, may lead central banks to adopt a higher-for-longer  strategy, triggering a deep recession due to falling private consumption and investment . In addition, house prices may see an even larger decline due to higher interest rates, a squeeze in household purchasing power and weak confidence. Normalising inflation, on the other hand, may support growth in 2024 and onwards.\n\nAt the end of the year adjustments to model-based allowances/provisions amounted to EUR 549m, including management judgement allowances of EUR 495m and EUR 52m reallocated from the management judgement allowances. The EUR 52m, related to non-performing loans, is not included in the scenario-weighted model-based allowances/provisions.\n\nThe cyclical management judgement of EUR 414m is intended to cover excess losses from macro-economic shocks and uncertainties that are regarded as extraordinary in relation to a normal contraction in the economic cycle, and are therefore not adequately captured by the existing IFRS 9 ECL modelling. The uncertainties are mainly connected to high inflation and interest rates and reduced disposable income. This in combination with the weaknesses in supply chains and shortages of input goods that arose during the pandemic have created a more challenging economic outlook for both households and corporates. Industry groups with significant additional coverage from the cyclical management judgement allowance include Consumer discretionary and services, Industrials and Real estate. The level at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022 was unchanged in local currencies, but decreased by EUR 16m in EUR (using the fourth quarter in 2022 as reference quarter).\n\nStructural management judgement allowances of EUR 81m cover known IFRS 9 model and data issues to be captured in later model updates. The total allowance at the end of 2023, compared to the end of 2022, was reduced by EUR 74m following the transfer of allowances for aged non-performing retail loans of EUR 52m into the model calculated collective provisions and implementing the corresponding capital deductions for aged non-performing corporate loans. This resulted in shifts between modelled allowances, structural management judgement allowances and capital deductions, without any impact on the actual level of coverage.\n\n## Management judgement allowances coverage\n\n| EURm                                       | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Cyclical management judgement allowances   |               |               |\n| Related to corporate exposures in BB       | 205           | 213           |\n| Related to corporate exposures in LC&I     | 117           | 122           |\n| Related to household exposures             | 92            | 95            |\n| Subtotal                                   | 414           | 430           |\n| Structural management judgement allowances |               |               |\n| Related to corporate exposures in BB       | 13            | 30            |\n| Related to corporate exposures in LC&I     | -             | -             |\n| Related to household exposures             | 68            | 125           |\n| Subtotal                                   | 81            | 155           |\n| Total management judgement allowances      | 495           | 585           |",

The total credit exposure according to the Capital Requirements Regulation definition was at year end after Credit Conversion Factor EUR 491bn (EUR 511bn). Credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in different ways. On-balance sheet lending consists of amortised cost lending and fair value lending and constitutes the major part of the credit portfolio. Amortised cost lending is the basis for impaired loans, allowances and loan losses.\n\nCredit risk in lending is measured and presented as the principal amount of on-balance sheet claims, i.e. loans to credit institutions and to the public, and off-balance sheet potential claims on customers and counterparties, net after allowances. Credit risk exposure also includes the risk related to derivative contracts and securities financing. Nordea's loans to the public decreased by 0.3% to EUR 345bn during 2023 (EUR 346bn). The corporate portfolio increased approximately 0.9%, while the household portfolio decreased by 0.6%. The overall credit quality is solid with strongly rated customers. Close monitoring is performed due to the currently uncertain macroeconomic outlook. However, the credit quality remained strong during 2023. Of the lending to the public portfolio, corporate customers accounted for 46.6% (46.0%), household customers for 52.2% (52.5%) and the public sector for 1.2% (1.5%). Loans to central banks and credit institutions, mainly in the form of interbank deposits, increased to EUR 4bn at the end of 2023 (EUR 5bn).\n\n## 2.11 Loans to corporate customers\n\nLoans to corporate customers at the end of 2023 amounted to EUR 161bn (EUR 159bn). The sector that increased the most in absolute terms in 2023 was Real estate, while Industrials decreased the most. The three largest industries (Real estate, Financial institutions and Industrials) accounted in total for approximately 60% of total corporate lending. Real estate remained the largest industry in Nordea's lending portfolio, at EUR 46.5bn (EUR 44.6bn). The real estate (commercial and residential) portfolio predominantly consists of relatively large and financially strong companies, with 93% (94%) of\n\nthe exposure in rating grades 4- and higher. The Real estate portfolio mainly comprise central and modern offices and residential properties, and continues to have strong credit quality with some slight deterioration during 2023. Only 5% of the portfolio is stage 2 and more than half of this is related to a more conservative categorisation, rather than an actual decrease in credit quality. Stage 3 loans in the Real estate portfolio makes up only 0.4% of the full portfolio, and the coverage ratio is above 50%, which is high in a collateralised portfolio. All new lending granted within the industry is fully collateralised.\n\nThe distribution of loans to corporate customers by size of loans, seen in the table below, shows a high degree of diversification with approximately 64% (64%) of the corporate volume representing loans up to EUR 50m per customer.\n\n## Loans to corporate customers, by size of loans\n\n|              | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Size in EURm | Loans  EURbn  | %             | Loans  EURbn  | %             |\n| 0-10         | 62.7          | 39            | 64.0          | 40            |\n| 11-50        | 39.6          | 25            | 38.3          | 24            |\n| 51-100       | 22.9          | 14            | 20.5          | 13            |\n| 101-250      | 24.2          | 15            | 21.6          | 14            |\n| 251-500      | 6.4           | 4             | 9.3           | 6             |\n| 501-         | 4.9           | 3             | 5.5           | 3             |\n| Total        | 160.7         | 100           | 159.2         | 100           |\n\n## 2.12 Loans to household customers\n\nIn 2023 lending to household customers decreased by 0.6% to EUR 180bn (EUR 181bn). The decrease was driven by the Norwegian and Finnish portfolios which decrease by a combined EUR 3.1bn, while the Danish and Swedish portfolios increase by a combined EUR 2.1bn. Mortgage lending decreased by EUR 0.8bn (EUR 0.2bn), while consumer lending decreased slightly by EUR 0.3bn to EUR 25bn (EUR 26bn). The proportion of mortgage lending of total household lending remained at 86% (86%).",

The average credit quality was stable in both the corporate and retail portfolios in 2023. Exposure-wise, 14% (17%) of corporate customer exposures migrated upwards, while 17% (12%) was down-rated. 91% (92%) of corporate exposures\n\nwere rated 4- or higher, with an average rating for the portfolio of 5-.\n\nInstitutions and retail customers, on the other hand, show a distribution that is biased towards the higher rating grades. 94% (94%) of retail exposures are scored C- or higher, which indicates a probability of default of 1% or lower. The total effect on credit risk exposure amount (REA) from migration was an increase of approximately 2.7% in 2023.",

Impaired loans net, after allowances for stage 3 loans amounted to EUR 1,420m (EUR 1,210m), corresponding to 51bp (43bp) of total loans. Allowances for stage 3 loans amounted to EUR 1,037 (EUR 1,045m). Allowances for stages 1 and 2 loans amounted to EUR 616m (EUR 628m). The ratio of allowances in relation to impaired loans was 42% (46%) and the allowance ratio for loans in stages 1 and 2 was 23bp (23bp). The increase in impaired loans was mainly related to the household portfolio with some increases in all countries but Denmark, which remains roughly unchanged. In the corporate portfolio, impaired loans increased by 7% and EUR 98m, where the largest increase is in the Consumer discretionary and services increasing by EUR 279m, driven by the entertainment industry. This is partly offset by reversals of EUR 128m in the industrials portfolio. Otherwise, no industries had any changes of significance. The portfolios with the largest impaired loan amounts were Household, Industrials and Consumer discretionary and services.\n\n## Impaired loans and ratios\n\n|                                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross impaired loans, amortised cost, EURm              | 2,457  | 2,255  |\n| - of which servicing                                    | 1,091  | 1,111  |\n| - of which non-servicing                                | 1,366  | 1,144  |\n| Impairment ratio (stage 3), gross, bp                   | 89     | 81     |\n| Impairment ratio (stage 3), net, bp                     | 51     | 43     |\n| Allowances in relation to loans,  stages 1 and 2, bp    | 23     | 23     |\n| Total allowance ratio (stages 1, 2 and 3), bp           | 60     | 60     |\n| Allowances in relation to impaired loans   (stage 3), % | 42     | 46     |\n\n## 2.16 Past due loans\n\nPast due loans, 6 days or more, for corporate customers amounted to EUR 848m, up from EUR 814m one year ago, and past due loans to household customers totalled EUR 1,857m in 2023, up from EUR 1,569m one year ago.

Loan allowances for 2023 were EUR 1,653m, down from EUR 1,673m in 2022. This slight reduction was driven by stage 1 releases of EUR 14m and stage 3 releases of EUR 8m. Of the total allowances, stage 1 accounted for EUR 206m (down from EUR 220m one year ago), stage 2 for EUR 409m (up from EUR 408m one year ago) and stage 3 for EUR 1,037m (down from EUR 1,045m one year ago). The coverage ratio was unchanged at 0.08% for stage 1, decreased from 3.2% to 2.5% for stage 2 and 42% for stage 3 (down from 46% in 2022). The decrease in Stage 3 coverage was driven by increased impaired loans where the coverage ratio was lower than the already defaulted portfolio, mostly due to guarantees covering a significant part of the new impaired loans. The corporate stage 3 coverage ratio decreased from 55% to 48% while it decreased from 33% to 32% in the household portfolio.\n\n## 2.18 Net loan losses\n\nNet loan losses for 2023 were low at EUR 187m (EUR 112m), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 7bp (4bp) for amortised cost loans. Including fair value gains from the Danish mortgage portfolio at EUR 20m (loss EUR 13m), \"Net loan losses and similar net result\" amounted to EUR 167m, corresponding to 5bp (4bp). Individually calculated losses amounted to EUR 191m (EUR 169m) and were driven by average write-offs and low provisions and reversals. The individual provisions had some concentration in construction and consumer-related industries which have been affected by cost increases and lower consumer demand.",

Counterparty credit risk\n\nCounterparty credit risk is the risk that Nordea's counterparty in a derivative contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract and that Nordea at that time has a claim on the counterparty. In addition, counterparty credit risk also exists in repurchasing agreements and other securities financing contracts.\n\nNordea enters into derivative contracts based on customer demand, both directly and in order to hedge positions that arise through such activities. Interest rate swaps and other derivatives are used in hedging activities of asset and liability mismatches on the balance sheet. Furthermore, Nordea may, within clearly defined risk limits, use derivatives to take open positions in the bank's operations. Derivatives affect counterparty credit risk, market risk as well as operational and liquidity risk.\n\nCounterparty credit risk, including exposures to central counterparties (CCPs), is subject to credit limits like other credit exposures and is treated accordingly. To assess the counterparty credit risk towards CCPs, clearing limits are based on the potential size of the clearing-related exposure to each CCP, taking regulatory requirements and market developments into account.\n\nFor information about financial instruments subject to master netting agreements, see Note G3.5 'Offsetting'.\n\n## 4. Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss on Nordea's positions in either the trading book or the non-trading book as a result of changes in market rates and parameters that affect market values or net interest income flows. Market risk exists irrespective of the accounting treatment of the positions.\n\nThe market risk appetite for the Group is expressed through risk appetite statements issued by the Board of Directors. The statements are defined for trading and banking books.\n\nThe second line of defence ensures that the risk appetite is appropriately translated by the Risk Committee into specific risk appetite limits for the business areas and Group Treasury.\n\nAs part of the overall Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), holistic and bespoke stress tests are used to measure the market risk appetite and calibrate limits to monitor and control the full set of material market risk factors to which Nordea is exposed.\n\n## 4.1 Traded market risk\n\nTraded market risk mainly arises from customer-driven trading activities and related hedges in Nordea Markets, which is part of Large Corporates & Institutions.\n\nNordea Markets takes on market risks as part of its business model when offering corporate and institutional customers a range of fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, commodity and structured products. The market risks to which Nordea Markets is exposed include interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and inflation risk.\n\nFurthermore, Nordea is a major mortgage lender in the Nordic countries and a major market maker in Nordic corporate and government bonds. Holding inventory is necessary to be able to provide secondary market liquidity. As a result, Nordea's business model gives rise to a concentration of Nordic mortgage and corporate bonds as well as local market currencies.\n\n## 4.2 Non-traded market risk\n\nThe non-traded market risks that Nordea is exposed to are interest rate risk, customer behavioural risk, credit spread risk, foreign exchange risk (both structural and non-structural) and equity risk. Non-traded market risk arises from the core banking business of Nordea, related hedges and regulatory or other external requirements (e.g. the liquid asset buffer).\n\nGroup Treasury is responsible for the risk management of all non-traded market risk exposures on the Group's balance sheet. To ensure a clear division of responsibilities within Group Treasury the banking book risk management is divided across several frameworks - each with a clear risk mandate and specific limits and controls.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the current or prospective risk to Nordea's capital and/or income arising from adverse movements in interest rates and customer behaviour. Business areas transfer their banking book risk exposures to Group Treasury through an internal funds transfer pricing framework. Market risks are managed centrally and include gap risk, spread risks, basis risks, credit spread risk, behavioural risk and non-linear risks. The effectiveness of hedging risk exposures from core banking activities, e.g. loans and deposits, may be adversely impacted by the discretion held by customers in respect of their contractual obligations with Nordea.\n\nLiquid assets are managed in accordance with the liquidity buffer and pledge/collateral frameworks. Most of the directional interest rate risk arising from bond holdings is hedged primarily using maturity-matched Interest rate payer swaps and to a smaller degree overnight indexed payer swaps. Forward rate agreements and listed futures contracts can also be used to hedge credit spread and interest rate fixing risks.\n\n## 4.3 Measurement of market risk\n\nNordea uses several quantitative risk measurement methods for traded market risk: Value-at-risk (VaR), stress testing, sensitivity analysis, parametric methods and Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nVaR is based on historical scenarios and is the primary market risk measurement, complemented by stress testing. Nordea calculates VaR using historical simulation. The current portfolio is revalued based on historical daily changes in market prices, rates and other market risk factors observed during the last 500 business days and translated into changes in current market risk factors. Nordea uses absolute, relative and mixed translation methods for different risk categories. The revaluation of the current portfolio is performed for each position using either a linear approximation method or a full revaluation method, depending on the nature of the position.\n\nParametric methods are used to capture equity event risk, including the impact of defaults on equity-related positions (these risks are part of the specific equity risk).\n\nMonte Carlo simulation is used in the incremental risk measure model and the comprehensive risk measure model to capture default and migration risks.\n\nThe VaR, stressed VaR, equity event risk, incremental risk measure and comprehensive risk measure models are approved by Nordea's regulator, the ECB, for use in calculating market risk own funds requirements under the internal model approach (IMA). The same models, with the same calibration and settings as used for regulatory capital requirements, are used for internal risk management purposes.",

        "page_content": "G11  Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\nThe standardised approach is applied to risk exposure which is not covered by the IMA. It is used to calculate the market risk exposures for commodity-related products, the specific risk for mortgage and government bonds, commercial paper, credit/rate hybrids and credit spread options. Furthermore, the standardised approach is used to calculate equity risk related to structured equity and Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds.\n\nIRRBB is measured, monitored and managed using three key risk metrics:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic value risk.\n- \u00b7 Net interest income risk.\n- \u00b7 Fair value stress loss.\n\nThe three different risk metrics are used to assess differing aspects of the manifestation of interest rate risk. These are described in more detail below.\n\nEconomic value (EV) of equity stress tests considers the change in the EV of banking book assets, liabilities and interest-bearing derivative exposures resulting from interest rate movements, independent of accounting classification and ignoring credit spreads and commercial margins. The model assumes a run-off balance sheet and includes behavioural modelling for non-maturing deposits and prepayments.\n\nThe net interest income (NII) risk metric measures the change in net interest income relative to a baseline scenario, resulting in a NII risk value over a one-year horizon. The model uses a constant balance sheet assumption, implied forward rates and behavioural modelling for non-maturing deposits and prepayments.\n\nThe fair value stress loss (FVSL) risk measure considers the potential revaluation risk relating to positions held under fair value accounting classifications.\n\nEV, NII and FVSL sensitivities are measured using internally defined Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) scenarios. The exposure limit is measured against the worst outcome from the internal scenarios defined under the RAF. The RAF scenarios are calibrated to reflect severe but plausible events and are designed to test specific exposures that are, or may be held, under the approved mandate. The scenarios are aligned across the risk types of EV, NII and FVSL.\n\nThe FVSL RAF scenarios are applied to both the banking book and the trading book portfolios, and the Board risk appetite limit considers the combined impact across both. The FVSL metric is monitored daily. A range of EV risk scenarios are estimated daily for management information purposes, but fully calculated and monitored monthly against risk appetite limits. The NII and earnings risk metrics are monitored monthly.\n\nThe measurement of IRRBB is dependent on key assumptions applied in the models. The most material assumptions relate to the modelling of embedded behavioural options in both assets and liabilities. The behavioural option held by\n\nNordea's lending customers to execute early loan prepayments is estimated using prepayment models. On the liability side, Nordea has a choice to change deposit rates, and customers have a choice to withdraw non-maturing deposits on any given day. Both embedded options are modelled using non-maturing deposit models. Both assumptions are calculated based on the historical average by core asset and liability class features. Assets and liabilities are grouped according to key metrics, including product type, geography and customer segment. Assumptions are based on historically observed values. Regular back-testing and model monitoring are performed for both prepayment models and non-maturing deposit models to ensure that the models remain accurate.\n\nThe Pillar 2 IRRBB capital allocations consist of a fair value risk component and a net interest income risk component. The fair value risk component covers the impact on Nordea's equity due to adverse movements in the monthly revaluation of positions accounted for at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. The net interest income risk component covers the impact of rate changes on the future earnings capacity through modelled impacts to net interest income, and the resulting implications for internal capital buffer levels.\n\nNordea is exposed to structural FX risk, defined as the mismatch between the currency composition of its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and risk exposure amounts. The CET1 capital is largely denominated in euro with the only significant non-euro equity amounts stemming from mortgage subsidiaries. Therefore, changes in FX rates can negatively impact Nordea's CET1 ratio.\n\n## 4.4 Market risk analysis\n\nThe market risk in Nordea's trading book is presented in the table below.\n\nThe average market risk measured by VaR was EUR 32.8m in 2023 (the average in 2022 was EUR 31.5m) and primarily driven by interest rate risk. Average stressed VaR was EUR 44.1m in 2023 (the average in 2022 was EUR 44.9m). The peak in VaR was reached in the third quarter while the peak in stressed VaR was reached in the first quarter. VaR and stressed VaR are primarily driven by market risk in the Northern European and Nordic countries.\n\nAt the end of 2023 the incremental risk charge (IRC) was higher than at the end of 2022. Both the lowest and highest exposure occurred during the first quarter of 2023. The average IRC significantly decreased compared with the previous year.\n\nAt the end of 2023 the comprehensive risk charge (CRC) was significantly lower than at the end of 2022. Both the lowest and highest exposure occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. The average CRC for 2023 decreased compared with 2022.",

        "page_content": "G11  Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\nFX risk in the banking book decreased driven mosty by a decrease in USD and RUB long positions.\n\nAt the end of the year, the worst loss on the fair value part of the banking book portfolio according to the internal risk appetite scenarios for FV stress loss was driven by the Nordic Housing Crisis RAF scenario, where the potential increase in Scandinavian mortgages and government spreads added to a fall in equity prices, implying a loss of EUR 473m (EUR 454m on the previous year) on the banking book FV positions. The banking book is usually long mortgages and government bonds in the liquidity buffer and long equity risk on the longterm illiquid investment holdings, which explains the loss on this worst-case scenario.\n\nThe overall trading and banking book market risk remains within Nordea's risk appetite.\n\n## 4.5 Net interest income risk and Economic value risk\n\nNordea's disclosure of interest rate risk in the banking book is aligned with the Pillar 3 requirements. The change in the economic value of the banking book positions due to interest rate changes is assessed under the six regulatory interest rate shock scenarios, and the net interest income in the banking book over a 12-month period is assessed under the two parallel shifts, both defined by the European Banking Authority. At the end of the year the maximum economic value loss was EUR 1,631m in the 'parallel shock down' scenario, and the maximum one-year loss in net interest income was EUR 1,210m also in the 'parallel shock down' scenario. For most currencies, the 'parallel shock down' scenario includes a 200 bp downward shift, but it can vary from -100 to -400 bp depending on the currency. For more details on the results of different regulatory interest rate shock scenarios, see the Nordea Group Capital and Risk Management Report 2023.\n\n## 4.6 Other market risks/pension risk\n\nPension risks (including market and longevity risks) arise from Nordea-sponsored defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. The ability of the pension schemes to meet the projected pension payments is maintained through investments and ongoing scheme contributions.\n\nPension risks can manifest through increases in the value of liabilities or through falls in the values of assets. These risks are regularly reported and monitored and include market risk sub-components such as interest rate, inflation, credit spread, real estate and equity risk. To minimise the risks to Nordea, limits are imposed on potential losses under severe but plausible stress events as well as on capital drawdowns. In addition, regular reviews of the schemes' strategic asset allocation are undertaken to ensure that the investment approach reflects Nordea's risk appetite. See Note G8.2 for more information.\n\n## 5. Operational risk\n\nAt Nordea operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events and includes legal risk.\n\nOperational risk is inherent in all Nordea's businesses and operations. Managers throughout Nordea are accountable for the operational risks related to their mandate and for managing these risks within the risk appetite of the operational risk management framework.\n\nOperational risk control functions within Group Risk (GR) constitute the second line of defence for overall operational risk and are responsible for developing and maintaining the overall operational risk management framework as well as for monitoring and controlling the operational risk manage-\n\nment of the first line of defence. The independent risk control functions are responsible for monitoring and overseeing that operational risks are appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated and for following up on risk exposures towards risk appetite and assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the operational risk management framework and the implementation of the framework.\n\nThe focus areas of the monitoring and control work performed are decided during an annual planning process that includes business areas, key risk areas and operational risk processes. GR is responsible for preparing and submitting regular risk reports on all material risk exposures, including risk appetite utilisation and incidents, to the Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer in the Group Leadership Team, the Group Board and the relevant committees.\n\nNordea has closely monitored geopolitical developments, such as in Ukraine, during 2023 and continues to do so. Throughout the year Nordea has witnessed elevated threat levels for cyber security and also for physical security across the Nordics. Nordea has taken actions to address the increased risk.\n\n- The Risk Appetite Statement for operational risk sets out: \u00b7 operational risk in breach of risk appetite and effective risk management\n- \u00b7 the total loss amounts from incidents as well as the number of occurrences of large loss events.\n\n## 5.1 Management of operational risk\n\nManagement of operational risk includes all activities aimed at identifying, assessing and measuring, responding to and mitigating, controlling and monitoring as well as reporting on risks. Risk management is supported by various processes and instructions including Risk and Control Self-Assessment, Change Risk Management and Approval, Issue Management, Incident Management, Scenario Analysis, Business Continuity and Crisis Management, Information Security Management, Technology and Data Risk Management, Third Party Risk Management, insurance-related risk diversification and Significant Operating Processes.\n\nSome of these processes are described below and additional details on processes for managing and controlling operational risk are included in the 'Operational and Compliance Risk' section of the Capital and Risk Management Report 2023 published in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.\n\n## Risk and Control Self-Assessment\n\nThe Risk and Control Self-Assessment process ensures an overview and assessment of operational and compliance risks across Nordea. The process improves risk awareness and enables the effective assessment, control and mitigation of identified risks. Furthermore, the Risk and Control SelfAssessment process and its results provide the basis and input for risk reporting at Nordea.\n\n## Change Risk Management and Approval\n\nThe Change Risk Management and Approval process ensures that there is an understanding of the risks arising from a change and that risks are managed consistent with Nordea's risk appetite framework before a change is approved or implemented.\n\nThe Change Risk Management and Approval process must be applied to all relevant types of change and development initiatives, including but not limited to, involving changes to new or changed processes, organisational changes, information and communication technology changes, new outsourcing arrangements and exceptional transactions.",

        "page_content": "G11  Risk and liquidity management, cont.\n\n## Issue Management\n\nIssues are defined as deficiencies in the control environment, i.e. defects and/or quality matters within the internal control environment for managing risk. When such deficiencies are discovered, they must be reported as issues. The Issue Management Framework consists of multiple processes across all three lines of defence identified in different risk management processes, and they together fall under the purpose of issues and action management.\n\n## Incident Management\n\nThe Incident Management Framework ensures appropriate handling and reporting of detected incidents to minimise the impact on Nordea and its customers, prevent reoccurrence and reduce the impact of future incidents. When incidents occur, they are immediately assessed to determine their severity. Depending on the nature of the incident and the severity assessed, different requirements on stakeholder involvement and external reporting apply, including incident notification to relevant authorities.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nScenario Analysis is performed in order to identify and assess operational and compliance risks with severe financial or non-financial impacts with low probability of materialisation, so-called 'tail risks', through the analysis of a broad range of internal and external events and indicators. Analysing tail risks contributes to increased understanding of the key impacts from, and preparedness for, unusual risk events should they materialise, and to identify and close possible control gaps at Nordea.\n\n## Business Continuity and Crisis Management\n\nThe Business Continuity and Crisis Management framework at Nordea ensures the capability to handle extraordinary events and crises and assures the continued delivery and recovery of prioritised products, services and processes to predefined acceptable levels. Extraordinary events and crisis situations are timely and appropriately escalated and responded to through preestablished structures. The capabilities are validated by testing and exercising the organisation and established plans to ensure to protect its resources (e.g. people, premises, technology and information), supply chain, interested parties and reputation, before a discuptive incident occurs. This includes ensuring that roles and responsibilities are clear, known and communicated to all involved.\n\n## Third Party Risk Management\n\nThe objective of Third Party Risk Management is to ensure that risks related to third parties and third party activities, including but not limited to outsourcing, are appropriately identified, assessed and managed before entering into, during as well as when exiting a third party arrangement. Third Party Risk Management ensures that risks associated with third parties and third party activities are kept within risk appetite and risk limits.\n\n## Information and Communication Technology Risk Management\n\nThe objective of Information and Communication Technology Risk Management is to ensure that information and communication technology and data management risks are appropriately identified, assessed and managed.\n\nNordea maintains an Information Security Management System for implementation of the principles and requirements for information security, with the overall objective to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of\n\nNordea's information and information entrusted to Nordea, by applying a risk-based methodology.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nIntroducing new technologies, exploring new ways of doing business and connecting with customers widen banks' attack surface. At the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming more organised, resourceful and experienced. Banks must also deal with the asymmetry of having to protect all assets while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need to find one weak spot. Combined, these factors pose an unprecedented risk to the banking industry.\n\nIn the normal course of business, Nordea focuses not only on maintaining effective basic information security controls but also on enhancing its cyber defence with new tools and functions for security, detection and response. Nordea develops innovative security practices to meet new business demands, such as robust mobile banking applications and proactive customer support for fraud detection and prevention. Nordea develops its information security practice based on recognised industry best practices such as the ISO 27000 series standards and the frameworks provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US. Furthermore, Nordea needs to comply with financial industry legislation, for example European Banking Authority guidelines and other European legislation introducing specific information security requirements.\n\nTo respond to the increased cyber threat level caused by the continued war in Ukraine, Nordea has scaled up selected cyber controls and implemented a wide range of tactical measures to further improve its cyber resilience. In addition, Nordea has teamed up with partners from governmental organisations, law enforcement agencies, intelligence networks, peers in the industry and others to share intelligence and experience.\n\n## Significant Operating Processes\n\nThe objective of the Significant Operating Processes (SiOPs) process is to ensure that SiOPs are identified and documented to ensure that risks and controls in the most important processes are assessed and managed for these processes to operate as intended. This includes ensuring that Nordea's customers are offered products and services in a compliant, safe and timely way.\n\n## 5.2 Financial Reporting Risk Management\n\nFinancial reporting risk is defined as the risk of misstatements or deficiencies in financial reporting, regulatory reporting, disclosures, tax reporting, management reporting and reporting of ESG information. An internal control framework for managing the financial reporting risk is in place, providing the structure and standards for designing, operating and evaluating the internal controls over financial reporting across the Group. The framework is the mechanism through which management expresses its financial statement assertions. Group Risk is the control function for financial reporting risk and is responsible for the independent monitoring and oversight of the risk and the Group's implementation of the framework. Group Risk reports to the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\n\n## 6. Compliance risk\n\nNordea defines compliance risk as the risk of failure to comply with applicable regulations and related internal rules. Management of compliance risk is governed by Nordea's Compliance Risk Appetite Statement which also sets out the requirements for the mitigation of compliance risk. Employees throughout Nordea are accountable for the compliance risks related to their mandate and for managing these risks in",

Group Compliance is the independent second line of defence function responsible for developing and maintaining the framework and for guiding the business in its implementation of and adherence to the framework.\n\nCompliance activities are presented in the form of an annual compliance plan to the Group CEO of Nordea and the Board of Directors. The annual compliance plan provides an overview of Nordea's compliance activities, combining Group Compliance's overall approach to key risk areas. The plan consists of detailed plans for the business areas, the Group functions, the consolidated Group subsidiaries, the branches and for each risk area. Group Compliance is responsible for the regular reporting on its plans to the Group Board, the CEO in the Group Leadership Team (the GLT), branch management and the relevant committees, at least quarterly.\n\nThe uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment has led to the highest inflation and interest rates seen in over a decade. Whilst the inflation rate has reduced across Nordea's core markets during the second half of 2023, interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer. The combined impact of increased consumer prices and a higher cost of credit may adversely impact the financial health of household and corporate customers. In light of the more challenging external environment for some of its customers, Nordea continues to focus on ensuring that its processes adequately assess the suitability and affordability of the products for all customer segments. In 2023 the interest and demand for ESG-related products remained stable, whilst market practices also developed further. Nordea has integrated the MiFID II sustainable preference requirements into its investment advisory processes and actively support its advisory customers in establishing investment strategies that are also aligned to their sustainability preferences.\n\n## 6.1 Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct defines high-level business principles, how Nordea treats customers and how employees are expected to conduct themselves. They underpin Nordea's culture and set the parameters for conduct in areas such as care for the environment, labour rights, human rights, the right to privacy, fair competition, anti-bribery and anti-corruption. The Code of Conduct is reviewed annually and was last updated in June 2023. Compliance with the Code of Conduct is followed up by regular monitoring and annual reporting to the relevant Group committees, the Group CEO and the Board. All employees are required to complete annual Code of Conduct training as part of their License to Work to ensure proper awareness and knowledge of the ethical principles. The 2023 training also included more detailed focus e.g. on whistleblowing and conflicts of interest. 97.6% of all employees (excluding those on long-term leave) completed the Code of Conduct training.\n\n## 6.2 Raise your Concern\n\nNordea's whistleblowing function Raise Your Concern (RYC) ensures that all stakeholders, including customers, partners, affected communities as well as employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights, or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in operations, products or services. This includes any action that constitutes a violation of laws or regulations or of Nordea's internal policies, instructions or guidelines. Reporting can be made orally or in writing and Nordea ensures that all reporting is treated with the strictest confidentiality. Reports can be made in all countries in which Nordea operates. Furthermore, it is also\n\npossible to report anonymously via the electronic reporting channel WhistleB. This platform is managed by an external party, is entirely separate from Nordea's IT systems and does not track IP addresses or other data that could identify the sender of a message. Cases reported through RYC form part of the monitoring of compliance with the Code of Conduct. A summary of key trends and statistics on cases are also reported on a no names basis to the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief People Officer and the Chief Risk Officer in addition to being included in management reports and reports to the Board. Furthermore, the RYC process and investigations are subject to regular quality controls with defined escalation procedures to report any process deviations.\n\nNordea is subject to various legal regimes and requirements, including but not limited to those of the Nordic countries, the European Union and the United States. The supervisory and governmental authorities administering and enforcing these regimes make regular enquiries and conduct investigations with regard to Nordea's compliance. Areas subject to investigation may include investment advice, anti-money laundering (AML), trade regulation and sanctions adherence, tax rules, competition law, governance, risk management and control. The outcome and timing of these enquiries and investigations are unclear and pending. Accordingly, it cannot be ruled out that these enquiries and investigations could lead to criticism against the bank, reputation loss, fines, sanctions, disputes and/or litigation.\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea faces a number of operational and legal risks potentially resulting in reputational impacts, fines, sanctions, disputes, losses and/or litigation. This includes potential claims related to the provision of banking and investment services and other areas in which Nordea operates. Currently, such claims are mainly related to lending and insolvency situations, various investment services, and sub-custody and withholding taxation matters. At present none of the current claims are considered likely to have any significant adverse effect on Nordea or its financial position.\n\nDetails on key processes for managing and controlling compliance risks are included in the 'Operational and Compliance Risk' section of the Capital and Risk Management Report 2023 published in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation.\n\n## 6.3 Financial crime prevention\n\nNordea takes its responsibility to society and its customers seriously and has over the years built strong defences to prevent its products, services and systems from being used for unlawful purposes.\n\nNordea handles and monitors on an annual basis several billion transactions from a wide customer base. Nordea continued to strengthen its financial crime defences in 2023 within areas such as customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and economic sanctions. Nordea's close cooperation with regulators continued during 2023 with ongoing engagement with all four Nordic regulators covering various aspects of Nordea's financial crime prevention work.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces in February 2022, a number of countries and international bodies have introduced sanctions. Nordea complies with applicable EU, US, UN and UK sanctions. The sanctions currently include freezing of assets, deposit restrictions, restrictions on economic relations with certain regions in Ukraine, restrictions focusing on the energy and finance sectors, import and export restrictions and overflight bans. As a consequence of the current sanctions regime and the increasing breadth and complexity of sanctions in force, in 2022 Nordea decided not to conduct any business activities that relate to the regions of",

Furthermore,  due to the current sanctions regime and the restrictions in force, in April 2022 Nordea stopped the automated processing of payments to and from Russia and Belarus. These policy decisions continue to be in place.\n\nAs sanctions measures continue to curb the ability to support and finance the war in the Ukraine, sanctioned parties and facilitators are seeking alternative ways to circumvent sanctions. In addition to traditional techniques, such as wire stripping, the regulators highlight an increased use of cryptocurrencies and third countries as common circumvention methods. In particular the US and EU have identified certain countries, such as former Soviet Republics, Turkey, Serbia and the UAE, that are being used to facilitate the circumvention of sanctions measures imposed in relation to Russia. While Nordea does not apply a blanket prohibition on activities concerning the above-mentioned countries, Nordea remains vigilant to the risk of the bank's products and services being used to evade sanctions and continues to enhance its controls to mitigate sanctions evasion risks.\n\nDuring 2023 there was an increase in the potential for both international and domestic terrorist attacks within the Nordics in connection to Quran burnings and the recent conflict in Gaza. Nordea continues to strengthen its controls to remain responsive to increased inherent risks of terrorist financing.\n\nIn June 2015 the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority investigated how Nordea Bank Danmark A/S had followed the regulations regarding AML. The outcome resulted in criticism and, in accordance with Danish administrative practice, the matter was handed over to the police for further handling and possible sanctions. As previously stated, Nordea expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters.\n\nThere is a risk that, in the event that the authorities issue fines, these could be higher (or potentially lower) than the current provision, and this could also impact Nordea's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation. Given this uncertainty, Nordea will maintain a sufficient level of provision for ongoing AML-related matters while continuing the dialogue with the Danish authorities regarding their allegations concerning historical AML weaknesses.\n\nSince 2015 Nordea has made significant investments to address the deficiencies highlighted by the investigations.\n\n## 7. Life insurance risk and market risks in the Life & Pension operations\n\nFor infomation on risk in the Life & Pension operation, see Note G4 'Insurance contract liabilities'.\n\n## 8. Liquidity risk\n\nDuring 2023 Nordea continued to benefit from its prudent liquidity risk management in terms of maintaining a diversified and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity buffer. Nordea maintained a strong liquidity position throughout the year despite volatility in global markets driven by geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and tightening monetary policy.\n\nNordea issued approximately EUR 21.0bn in long-term funding in 2023 (excluding Long CDs, Danish covered bonds and capital instruments), of which approximately EUR 16.8bn was issued in the form of covered bonds and EUR 4.2bn as senior debt.\n\nThroughout 2023 Nordea remained compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement in all currencies on a combined basis as well as the net stable funding ratio (NFSR).\n\nDuring 2021 Nordea participated in European Central Bank (ECB) and local central bank facilities, including the ECB's tar-\n\ngeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). At the end of 2023 Nordea had EUR 3bn outstanding under the TLTRO III programme, following a repayment during the past years. The interest rate is equal to the deposit facility rate and is no longer contingent on meeting predefined lending thresholds.\n\n## 8.1 Liquidity risk definition and identification\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Nordea can only meet its liquidity commitments at an unsustainably high price or, ultimately, is unable to meet its obligations as they come due. Nordea is exposed to liquidity risk in its lending, investments, funding, off-balance sheet exposures and other activities which results in a negative cash flow mismatch. Cash flow mismatches can occur at the end of a day or intraday.\n\n## 8.2 Management principles and control\n\nLiquidity risk at Nordea is managed across three lines of defence:\n\n- \u00b7 The first line of defence consists of Group Treasury and the business areas. Group Treasury is responsible for the day-today management of the Group's liquidity positions, liquidity buffers, external and internal funding, including the mobilisation of cash across the Group, and funds transfer pricing.\n- \u00b7 The second line of defence, Group Risk, is responsible for providing independent oversight of and challenge to the first line of defence.\n- \u00b7 The third line of defence includes Group Internal Audit, which is responsible for providing independent oversight of the first and second lines of defence.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the liquidity risk appetite by setting limits for the liquidity risk metrics applied. The most central metric is the liquidity stress horizon, which defines the risk appetite by setting a minimum survival period of 90 days under institution-specific and market-wide stress scenarios with limited mitigation actions.\n\nA framework of limits and monitoring metrics is in place to ensure that Nordea stays within various risk parameters including its risk appetite.\n\nA funds transfer pricing (FTP) framework is in place which takes into account that liquidity is a scarce and costly resource. By quantifying and allocating liquidity and funding costs and benefits to the respective business areas, behaviours and strategic decisions are appropriately incentivised.\n\n## 8.3 Liquidity risk management strategy\n\nNordea's liquidity risk management strategy is based on policy statements resulting in various liquidity risk measures, limits and organisational procedures.\n\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that Nordea can always meet its cash flow obligations, including on an intraday basis, across market cycles and during periods of stress. Nordea strives to diversify its sources of funding and seeks to establish and maintain relationships with investors in order to ensure market access. A broad and diversified funding structure is reflected by the strong presence in the Group's four domestic markets in the form of a strong and stable retail customer base and a variety of funding programmes. The funding consists of both short-term (US and European commercial paper as well as certificates of deposit) and long-term (covered bonds, European and Global Medium-Term Notes) programmes and covers a range of currencies.\n\nTrust is fundamental in the funding market. Therefore, Nordea periodically publishes information on the Group's liquidity situation. Furthermore, Nordea regularly performs stress testing of its liquidity risk position to capture relevant risk drivers and has put business contingency plans in place for liquidity crisis management.",

The liquidity buffer consists of central bank eligible, high credit quality and liquid securities as well as central bank cash that can be readily sold or used as collateral in funding operations.\n\nLiquidity risk management focuses on both short-term liquidity risk and long-term structural liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is limited by the Board of Directors via the liquidity stress coverage ratio and liquidity stress horizon metrics stipulating that the liquidity buffer needs to be sufficient to cover peak cumulative stressed outflows experienced over the first 90 days of a combined stress event, whereby Nordea is subject to market-wide stress similar to that experienced by many banks in 2007-08 as well as idiosyncratic stress corresponding to a three-notch credit rating downgrade. These metrics form the basis for Nordea's liquidity risk appetite, which is reviewed and approved by the Board at least annually. Liquidity risk appetite is further defined through the regulatory liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR).\n\nShort-term funding risk is measured via the LCR and also via a funding gap risk metric. The funding gap risk metric expresses the expected maximum accumulated need for raising liquidity in the course of the next 30 days. Funding gap risk is measured and limited for each currency and as a total figure for all currencies combined.\n\nNordea's structural liquidity risk is measured by many metrics of which the NSFR is the main metric. The NSFR is complemented with the internally defined net balance of stable funding ratio. Furthermore, the loan to deposit ratio is closely monitored together with the wholesale funding refinancing profile and rating agency metrics.\n\n## 8.5 Liquidity risk analysis\n\nNordea continues to have a strong and prudent liquidity risk profile with a strong funding base. At the end of 2023 the total volume utilised under CD and CP programmes was EUR 46.3bn (EUR 50.9bn) with an average maturity of 0.3 (0.3) year. The total volume under long-term programmes was EUR 143.6bn (EUR 138.3bn) with an average maturity of 6.1 (6.3) years. Nordea's funding sources are presented in the table below.\n\nThe liquidity risk position remained strong throughout 2023. The liquidity stress horizon was 631 days at the end of 2023 (1,095 days at the end of 2022) with an annual average of 1,059 days (1,084 days) - the Group limit is not below 90 days.\n\nThe annual average of the funding gap risk was EUR +44.8bn (EUR +51.8bn in 2022) against a limit of EUR -5bn. Nordea's liquidity buffer ranged between EUR 99.7bn and EUR 143.5bn throughout 2023 (EUR 111.9bn and EUR 141.2bn) with an average liquidity buffer of EUR 117.6bn (EUR 126.9bn).\n\nThe combined LCR for the Nordea Group was 165% at the end of 2023 (162%) with an annual average of 157% (152%). At the end of 2023 the LCR in EUR was 231% (149%) and in USD 207% (177%) with annual averages of 174% (186%) and 201% (202%), respectively. At the end of 2023 Nordea's NSFR was 118.7% (115.6%).\n\n## Funding sources, 31 December 2023\n\n| Liability type                                       | Interest   rate base      | Average  maturity  (years)   | EURm    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Deposits by credit institutions                      |                           |                              |         |\n| Shorter than 3 months                                | Euribor etc.              | 0.1                          | 28,446  |\n| Longer than 3 months                                 | Euribor etc.              | 0.7                          | 1,059   |\n| Deposits and borrowings   from the public            |                           |                              |         |\n| Deposits payable on demand                           | Administrative            | 0.0                          | 166,901 |\n| Other deposits                                       | Euribor etc.              | 0.2                          | 43,161  |\n| Debt securities in issue                             |                           |                              |         |\n| Certificates of deposit                              | Euribor etc.              | 0.3                          | 33,533  |\n| Commercial paper                                     | Euribor etc.              | 0.3                          | 12,769  |\n| Mortgage covered bond loans                          | Fixed rate,  market-based | 6.8                          | 111,687 |\n| Other bond loans                                     | Fixed rate,  market-based | 3.3                          | 26,238  |\n| Fair value changes of hedged  items                  |                           |                              | -1,680  |\n| Derivatives                                          |                           |                              | 30,794  |\n| Other non-interest-  bearing items                   |                           |                              | 67,280  |\n| Subordinated debt                                    |                           |                              |         |\n| Tier 2 subordinated   bond loans                     | Fixed rate,  market-based | 7.7                          | 3,548   |\n| Additional Tier 1 subordinated  bond loans (undated) | Fixed rate,  market-based |                              | 2,514   |\n| Fair value changes of hedged  items                  |                           |                              | -341    |\n| Equity                                               |                           |                              | 31,225  |\n| Total                                                |                           |                              | 557,134 |\n| Insurance contract liabilities                       |                           |                              | 27,568  |\n| Total, including   life insurance operations         |                           |                              | 584,702 |\n\n## Net stable funding ratio\n\n| EURbn                      | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Available stable funding   | 316.8         | 313.5         |\n| Required stable funding    | 266.9         | 271.1         |\n| Net stable funding         | 49.9          | 42.4          |\n| Net stable funding ratio 1 | 118.7%        | 115.6%        |\n\n1)  According to CRR2 regulation.",

Nordea Bank Abp is a public limited liability company organised under the laws of Finland with its head office located in Helsinki, Finland at the following address: Hamnbanegatan (Satamaradankatu) 5, FI-00020 Nordea Bank Abp, Helsinki, Finland. Nordea Bank Abp's ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq Nordic, the stock exchanges in Helsinki (in euro), Stockholm (in Swedish kronor) and Copenhagen (in Danish kroner), and its American Depository Receipts are traded in the US in US dollars.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements of Nordea Bank Abp are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act, the Finnish Act on Credit Institutions, the Decree of the Finnish Ministry of Finance on the financial statements and consolidated financial statements of credit institutions and investment firms as well as the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines.\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Commission have been applied to the extent possible within the framework of Finnish accounting legislation and considering the close tie between financial reporting and taxation.\n\nThe accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation are unchanged in comparison with the Annual Report 2022, except for the items presented in 'Changed accounting policies and presentation' below.

On 20 February 2024 the Board of Directors approved the financial statements, subject to final adoption by the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2024.\n\n## Changed accounting policies and presentation\n\nNew accounting policies and changes to the presentation were implemented during 2023. Impacts on Nordea Bank Abp's financial statements are described below.\n\n## Changed presentation of income statement and balance sheet\n\nThe Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority has made amendments to Regulations and Guidelines 2/2016 concerning financial sector accounting, financial statements and board of directors' reports. The amendments entered into force on 1 January 2023 and impact the presentation of income statements and balance sheets prepared in accordance with the Finnish accounting standards. The main purpose of the amendments is to allow the presentation of financial statements to be more aligned with IFRS reporting.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has implemented the changes in its income statement and balance sheet, and comparative figures have been restated accordingly. The impact can be found in the tables on the following page.\n\n## Translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\n\nNordea Bank Abp presents its financial statements in euro (EUR). Foreign currency is defined as any currency other than euro. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nExchange differences arising on the settlement of transactions at rates different from those on the date of the transactions, and unrealised translation differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss \" .\n\n## Exchange rates\n\n|                                            | Jan-Dec 2023   | Jan-Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| EUR 1 = SEK                                |                |                |\n| Income statement (average)                 | 11,4740        | 10,6274        |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year) EUR 1 = DKK | 11,1275        | 11,1202        |\n| Income statement (average)                 | 7,4509         | 7,4395         |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year) EUR 1 = NOK | 7,4527         | 7,4365         |\n| Income statement (average)                 | 11,4238        | 10,1023        |\n| Balance sheet (at end of year)             | 11,2120        | 10,5180        |",

The effective interest rate equals the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability at initial recognition.\n\nInterest income and expense are calculated and recognised using the effective interest rate method or, if considered appropriate, a method that provides a reasonable approximation in line with the effective interest rate method as the basis for the calculation. The effective interest rate includes fees considered to be an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for risk). Interest income and interest expense from financial instruments are, with the exceptions described below, classified as 'Net interest income'.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to all balance sheet items held at fair value in Markets are classified as \" Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss \" in the income statement. Also, interest on the net funding of operations in Markets, and on the net funding of fund investments in Treasury, measured at amortised cost is recognised in this line item to ensure that income and expense within these operations are presented in a consistent manner. See Note P2.4 ' Total net result from items at fair value'.\n\nThe interest component of derivatives is classified as \" Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss \", except for derivatives used for hedging purposes. In accounting hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability. In economic hedges the interest component of derivatives is classified as 'Interest income' if the derivative is used to hedge an asset and as 'Interest expense' if the derivative is used to hedge a liability.\n\n## Interest income\n\n| EURm                                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income calculated using   the effective interest rate method      | 14,244 | 5,996  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit  or loss                     | 360    | 143    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives  in economic hedges of assets | 207    | -269   |\n| Interest income 1                                                          | 14,811 | 5,870  |\n\n| EURm                                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash and balances with central banks                                       | 235    | 140    |\n| Debt securities eligible for refinancing   with central banks              | 1,310  | 329    |\n| Loans to credit institutions                                               | 4,840  | 1,484  |\n| Loans to the public                                                        | 6,711  | 3,542  |\n| Interest-bearing securities                                                | 464    | 228    |\n| Derivatives                                                                | 742    | 54     |\n| Yield fees                                                                 | 229    | 233    |\n| Other interest income                                                      | 73     | 129    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives  in economic hedges of assets | 207    | -269   |\n| Interest income 1                                                          | 14,811 | 5,870  |\n| -  of which negative interest on financial  liabilities                    | -      | 331    |\n\n## Interest expense\n\n| EURm                                                                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deposits by credit institutions and   central banks                             | -1,101 | -379   |\n| Deposits and borrowings from the public                                         | -4,165 | -886   |\n| Debt securities in issue                                                        | -2,798 | -1,161 |\n| Derivatives                                                                     | -1,414 | -3     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                                        | -221   | -252   |\n| Other interest expense                                                          | -14    | -15    |\n| Net interest paid or received on derivatives  in economic hedges of liabilities | 459    | 371    |\n| Interest expense                                                                | -9,254 | -2,325 |\n| -  of which negative interest on financial  assets                              | -      | -197   |\n| Net interest income                                                             | 5,557  | 3,545  |",

Asset management commissions and Life & Pension commissions are mainly generated from the services provided to group undertakings. The recognition of commission income depends on the purpose for which the fees are received.\n\nFee income is recognised as revenue when services are provided or in connection with the execution of a significant act. Fees received in connection with performed services are recognised as income in the period when these services are provided.\n\nLending fees that are not part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument are recognised at a point of time when the services are provided. Fees received for bilateral transactions are generally amortised as part of the effective interest rate of the financial instruments recognised. Loan syndication fees are recognised either as part of the effective interest rate of the participation or, if Nordea Bank Abp is acting as an agent in the transaction, as lending fee income. When the fee income is related to both activities, the fee that is recognised as part of the effective interest rate is based on the margin received by the other parties in the arrangement.\n\nVariable fees, such as performance fees, are recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative recognised amount does not occur.\n\nCommission expenses covering a certain period are expensed over that period, whereas transactional fees are recognised when the services are received.\n\n## Net fee and commission income 1, 2\n\n| EURm                                                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Asset management commissions                        | 402    | 427    |\n| - of which income                                   | 409    | 435    |\n| - of which expense                                  | -7     | -8     |\n| Life & Pension commissions                          | 25     | 26     |\n| - of which income                                   | 25     | 26     |\n| Deposit products                                    | 23     | 24     |\n| - of which income                                   | 23     | 24     |\n| Brokerage, securities issues   and corporate fnance | 195    | 174    |\n| - of which income                                   | 324    | 307    |\n| - of which expense                                  | -129   | -133   |\n| Custody and issuer services                         | 10     | 22     |\n| - of which income                                   | 54     | 63     |\n| - of which expense                                  | -44    | -41    |\n| Payments                                            | 260    | 259    |\n| - of which income                                   | 380    | 376    |\n| - of which expense                                  | -120   | -117   |\n| Cards                                               | 259    | 274    |\n| - of which income                                   | 394    | 391    |\n| - of which expense                                  | -135   | -117   |\n| Lending products                                    | 353    | 368    |\n| - of which income                                   | 359    | 371    |\n| - of which expense                                  | -6     | -3     |\n| Guarantees                                          | 193    | 243    |\n| - of which income                                   | 260    | 276    |\n| - of which expense                                  | -67    | -33    |\n| Other                                               | 11     | -1     |\n| - of which income                                   | 78     | 61     |\n| - of which expense                                  | -67    | -62    |\n| Total                                               | 1,731  | 1,816  |\n\n- 2) Fee income, not included in determining the effective interest rate, from fiduciary activities that result in the holding or investing of assets on behalf of customers amounted to EUR 758m (EUR 768m).",

Brokerage, securities issues and corporate finance are mainly transaction-based in relation to advising customers or executing customer transactions in securities where the services are recognised at a point of time when the services related to the transactions are completed. Payment commissions include fees for cash management and payment solutions that are recognised over time and transaction-based fees for services like domestic and foreign payments that are recognised at a point of time.\n\nCard fees are categorised as interchange fees which are recognised at a point of time when the customer uses the services, or as cardholder fees which are recognised over time or at a point of time if the fee is transaction-based.\n\nIncome from issued financial guarantees and expenses for bought financial guarantees are amortised over the duration of the instruments and classified as 'Fee and commission income' and 'Fee and commission expense', respectively.\n\nOther fee income is generally transaction-based.\n\nFor transactional services performed at a point of time, payments are generally made instantly when the services are performed. For services performed over time, the period of the services is normally short. Examples of such services are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset management services. For the services performed over time, the right to payment generally arises at the end of the period of the services when the performance obligations are satisfied and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consideration will occur. However, for some services with fixed monthly fees, the right to payment arises in advance.\n\nAccount receivables are recognised in 'Other assets', while unbilled receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract assets are recognised in 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income'. Short-term advances received where the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised in 'Accrued expenses and prepaid income'.\n\nCommission expenses are normally transaction-based and recognised in the period in which the services are received.\n\n## P2.4   Total net result from items at fair value\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nRealised and unrealised gains and losses on financial instruments are generally presented in ' Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss ' . The accounting policies used when estimating fair value can be found in Note P3.4 'Fair value'.\n\nThe following items are moreover recognised in the line item \" Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss \" :\n\n- \u00b7 Interest on the net funding of operations in Markets and on the net funding of fund investments in Treasury measured at amortised cost.\n- \u00b7 Realised gains/losses on assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n- \u00b7 The revaluation of the hedged risks of hedged items under hedge accounting.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange gains/losses.\n- \u00b7 Dividends received from shares held for trading.\n\nThe following item is not presented as ' Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss ' :\n\n- \u00b7 The interest component of derivatives used for hedge accounting and economic hedges. These components are presented in 'Net interest income' to ensure consistent accounting treatment with the hedged items.\n\nFor more information on accounting policies related to foreign exchange gains/losses, see Note P1 'Accounting policies' and Note P8.3 'Currency translation of foreign entities'. Hedge accounting is described in Note P3.5 \" Hedge accounting \" .\n\n## Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve\n\nRecycled gains and losses on financial instruments classified in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised in 'Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve'.",

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the tax effects relate to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax effects are recognised in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax base of the same assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the temporary differences reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences, tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when the legal right to offset exists and Nordea Bank Abp intends to either settle the tax asset and the tax liability net or recover the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities.\n\nTax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will accept the treatment used in the tax filings. Uncertain tax positions are considered independently or as a group, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If Nordea Bank Abp concludes that it is not probable that the tax authorities will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of uncertainty is reflected when determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. This is done by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty. Uncertain tax treatment can affect both current tax and deferred tax.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\n| EURm         |   2023 |   2022 |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax  |   -996 |   -547 |\n| Deferred tax |     35 |   -194 |\n| Total        |   -961 |   -741 |\n\nThe tax on operating profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate in Finland as follows:\n\n| EURm                                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before tax                                 | 5,700  | 4,696  |\n| Tax calculated at a tax rate of 20.0%             | -1,140 | -939   |\n| Effect of different tax rates in other  countries | -112   | -59    |\n| Tax-exempt income                                 | 332    | 465    |\n| Non-deductible expenses                           | -67    | -193   |\n| Prior year adjustments                            | 36     | 7      |\n| Change of tax rate 1                              | -      | -5     |\n| Other                                             | -10    | -17    |\n| Tax charge                                        | -961   | -741   |\n| Effective tax rate                                | 16.9%  | 15.8%  |\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                                             | Deferred tax assets   | Deferred tax assets   | Deferred tax liabilities   | Deferred tax liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| EURm                                                                        | 31 Dec 2023           | 31 Dec 2022           | 31 Dec 2023                | 31 Dec 2022                |\n| Loans to the public                                                         | 64                    | 66                    | 1                          | 1                          |\n| Derivatives/bonds                                                           | -                     | -                     | 41                         | 48                         |\n| Properties and  equipment                                                   | -                     | -                     | 1                          | 10                         |\n| Intangible assets                                                           | -                     | -                     | 45                         | 58                         |\n| Retirement benefits                                                         | 68                    | 66                    | 51                         | 62                         |\n| Liabilities/provisions                                                      | 60                    | 54                    | 5                          | 0                          |\n| Elimination of  temporary  differences existing  in multiple  jurisdictions | -                     | -                     | 81                         | 84                         |\n| Other                                                                       | 1                     | 4                     | 10                         | 15                         |\n| Netting between  deferred tax assets  and liabilities                       | -156                  | -165                  | -156                       | -165                       |\n| Total 1                                                                     | 37                    | 25                    | 79                         | 113                        |",

        "page_content": "## P3  Financial instruments\n\n## P3.1   Recognition on and derecognition from the balance sheet\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDerivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign exchange spot transactions are recognised on and derecognised from the balance sheet on the trade date. Other financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet on the settlement date. An asset or a liability is recognised in 'Other assets' or 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet between the trade date and the settlement date.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those for which trade date accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. The rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred when the counterparty has performed by e.g. repaying a loan to Nordea Bank Abp, i.e. on the settlement date.\n\nLoans and other financial assets where cash flows are modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised and a new loan recognised if the terms and conditions of the new loan are substantially different from the old loan. This is normally the case if the present value of the cash flows of the new loan discounted by the original interest rate differs by more than 10% from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows of the old loan. The same principles apply to financial liabilities. The terms and conditions are also considered to be significantly different for financial assets where the modified cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), but the original cash flows were not SPPI and vice versa.\n\nIn some cases, Nordea Bank Abp enters into agreements where it transfers assets that are recognised on the balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, the transferred assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised from the balance sheet when the liability is extinguished. Normally this occurs when Nordea Bank Abp performs, for example when Nordea Bank Abp returns a deposit to the counterparty, i.e. on the settlement date. Financial liabilities under trade date accounting are generally derecognised and a liability is recognised in 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet on the trade date.\n\nA sale of a security not owned by Nordea Bank Abp is defined as a short sale and triggers the recognition of a trading liability (sold, not held, securities) presented in 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. The short sale is generally covered through a securities financing transaction, normally a reverse repurchase agreement or other forms of securities borrowing agreements.\n\n## P3.2   Transferred assets and obtained collateral\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssets are considered to be transferred from Nordea Bank Abp if Nordea Bank Abp either transfers the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets or retains that right but has a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more parties. All assets transferred continue to be recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea Bank Abp is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\nCollateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet if Nordea Bank Abp is not exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\n## Transferred assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities\n\nRepurchase agreements are a form of collateral borrowing where Nordea Bank Abp sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price.\n\nSecurities lending agreements are agreements where Nordea Bank Abp lends securities to a counterparty and receives a fee. Generally, securities lending agreements are entered into on a collateralised basis.\n\nAs both repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements result in the securities being returned to Nordea Bank Abp, all risks and rewards associated with the instruments transferred are retained by Nordea Bank Abp although the instruments are not available to Nordea Bank Abp during the period during which they are transferred. The counterparties to the agreements hold the securities as collateral but have no recourse to other assets in Nordea Bank Abp. For this reason securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are not derecognised from the balance sheet. Securities delivered under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are also disclosed in Note P6.3 'Assets pledged'. Cash received under repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements is recognised on the balance sheet in 'Deposits by credit institutions and central banks' or 'Deposits and borrowings from the public'.\n\nIn derivative agreements Nordea Bank Abp delivers collateral which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. Such agreements are mainly related to collateral delivered under credit support annex agreements.\n\n## Transferred assets not derecognised from the balance sheet\n\n| EURm                          | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Repurchase agreements         |               |               |\n| Interest-bearing securities   | 9,375         | 10,025        |\n| Securities lending agreements |               |               |\n| Interest-bearing securities   | 837           | 230           |\n| Shares                        | 142           | -             |\n| Total                         | 10,354        | 10,255        |\n\n## Liabilities associated with the assets1\n\n| EURm                          | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Repurchase agreements         | 9,375         | 10,026        |\n| Securities lending agreements | 979           | 230           |\n| Total                         | 10,354        | 10,256        |\n| Net                           | 0             | -1            |\n\n1) Liabilities before offsetting between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\n## Obtained collateral permitted to be sold or repledged\n\nNordea Bank Abp obtains collateral under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements which, under the terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged. The transactions are conducted under standard agreements employed by financial market participants. Generally, the agreements require additional collateral to be provided if the value of the securities falls below a predetermined level. Under the stand-",

All other assets are classified based on the business model. Instruments included in a portfolio with a business model where the intention is to keep the instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured at amortised cost. Instruments included in a business model where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are measured at fair value through the fair value reserve in equity. Financial assets included in any other business model are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn order to determine the business model, Nordea Bank Abp has divided its financial assets into portfolios and/or sub-portfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. When determining the right level for the portfolios, Nordea Bank Abp has taken the current business area structure into account. When determining the business model for each portfolio, Nordea Bank Abp has analysed the objective of the financial assets as well as, for instance, past sales behaviour and management compensation.\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. The classification of financial instruments into different categories forms the basis for how each instrument is subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how changes in its value are recognised. The classification of the financial instruments on Nordea Bank Abp's balance sheet into the different categories under IFRS 9 is presented in the table 'Classification of financial instruments'.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the instruments within this category are measured at amortised cost. In an amortised cost measurement, the difference between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised in the income statement over the remaining term using the",

Amortised cost is defined as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation. The cumulative amortisation is calculated using the effective interest rate method. For more information about the effective interest rate method, see Note P2.2 'Net interest income'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note P3.7 'Loans'.\n\nInterest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost is generally recognised under 'Interest income' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement.\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. Changes in fair value are generally recognised directly in the income statement under 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss'. For estimation of fair value, see Note P3.4 'Fair value \".\n\nThe category consists of two sub-categories: 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' and 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)'. The sub-category 'Designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)' is an option to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. This option can be used if it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch and for liabilities if they are managed on a fair value basis. Changes in credit risk related to liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the fair value reserve unless it creates an accounting mismatch.\n\nInterest income and interest expense related to balance sheet items held at fair value through profit or loss are generally classified as 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss'. For more information, including exceptions from this general rule, see Note P2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value' and Note P2.2 'Net interest income'.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Changes in fair value, except for interest, foreign exchange effects and impairment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity. Interest is recognised under 'Interest income', foreign exchange effects under 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss' and impairment losses under 'Net loan losses' in the income statement. When an instrument is disposed of, the fair value changes previously accumulated in the fair value reserve are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve'. For information about impairment under IFRS 9, see Note P3.7 'Loans' , and about estimation of fair value, see Note P3.4 'Fair value' .\n\n## Hybrid (combined) financial instruments\n\nHybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts containing a host contract and an embedded derivative instrument. Such combinations arise predominantly from the issuance of structured debt instruments, such as issued indexlinked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps.\n\nFor structured bonds issued by Markets, Nordea Bank Abp applies the fair value option, and the entire combined instrument, the host contract together with the embedded derivative, is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss' except for changes in Nordea Bank Abp ' s own credit risk which is recognised in fair value reserve.\n\n## Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nA financial instrument issued by Nordea Bank Abp is either classified as a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities if the contractual arrangements result in Nordea Bank Abp having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and classified as equity, net of transaction costs. If issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nNordea Bank Abp offsets financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet if there is a legal right to offset and if the intent is to settle the items net or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legal right to offset should exist both in the ordinary course of business and in case of the default, bankruptcy and insolvency of Nordea Bank Abp and its counterparties.\n\nExchanged-traded derivatives are generally accounted for and settled on a daily basis when cash is paid or received, and the instrument is reset to market terms. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities against central counterparty clearing houses are set off on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities are settled in the same transaction currency and relate to the same central counterparty. Derivative assets, derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash collateral liabilities related to bilateral OTC derivative agreements are not set off on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with central counterparty clearing houses are set off on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same central counterparty, are settled in the same currency and have the same maturity date. Loans and deposits related to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are made in accordance with the Global Master Repurchase Agreement are set off on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are settled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and are settled through the same settlement institution.\n\nThe fact that financial instruments are accounted for on a gross basis on the balance sheet does not imply that the financial instruments are not subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Generally, financial instruments (derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements) are subject to master netting agreements, and Nordea Bank Abp is consequently able to benefit from netting any calculations involving counterparty credit risk in the event of the default of its counterparties.\n\nFor a description of counterparty credit risk, see also Note P10 'Risk and liquidity management', section 3 'Counterparty credit risk'.",

        "page_content": "P3.3  Classification and measurement, cont.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nThis category mainly consists of all loans (including those with embedded collars and caps) and deposits, except for reverse repurchase/repurchase agreements and securities borrowing/lending agreements in Markets. This category also includes subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue, except for structured bonds issued by Markets.\n\n## Lending with ESG targets\n\nSome loan contracts in Nordea Bank Abp include terms linking contractual cash flows to the customer's achievement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets (so-called sustainability-linked loans). The most common targets in these sustainability-linked loans are environmental, such as CO2 emission. At the end of the year the carrying amount of the sustainability-linked loans recognised on the balance sheet amounted to EUR 9,194m (EUR 6,775m).\n\nFor more information about the risk associated with sustanibility linked loans see the section 2.1 \"Credit risk definition and identification\" in Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\n## Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe sub-category 'Mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss' mainly contains all assets and trading liabilities in Markets, interest-bearing securities in the liquidity buffer, derivatives, shares and financial assets in pooled schemes. Deposits in pooled schemes are contracts with customers where most or all of the risk is borne by the policyholders. The deposits are invested in different types of financial assets on behalf of customers.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income mainly consist of the interest-bearing securities in the liquidity buffer.\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option)\n\nNordea Bank Abp applies the fair value option to structured bonds issued by Markets, EUR 1,922m (EUR 1,438m), as these hybrid instruments, such as issued index-linked bonds, include embedded derivatives not closely related to the host contract. The host contract together with the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented in 'Debt securities in issue' on the balance sheet. The change in the fair value of these issued structured bonds is recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss' except for the changes in own credit risk, which are recognised in equity. Nordea Bank Abp calculates the change in its own credit spread as the change in its total funding spread, thus assuming a constant issuance premium on all issues over time. The change in the credit spread is estimated by comparing the value of the trades using the initial funding spread on the issuance date and the actual funding spread on the reporting date. This model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk.\n\nDeposits in pooled schemes, EUR 4,251m (EUR 4,170m), are designated at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed at fair value. The value of these deposits is directly linked to the fair value of the underlying assets, and changes in own credit risk consequently have no net impact.\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm                                                         | Liabilities  for which  changes in  credit risk  are present- ed in fair  value  reserve   | Liabilities   for which  changes in  credit risk  are present- ed in profit   or loss   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Carrying amount at end of year                                            | 1,922                                                                                      | 4,251                                                                                   | 6,173   |\n| Amount to be paid at maturity                                             | 1,832                                                                                      | 4,251                                                                                   | 6,083   |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, during the year | 12                                                                                         | -                                                                                       | 12      |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, accumulated     | 4                                                                                          | -                                                                                       | 4       |\n\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm                                                         | Liabilities  for which  changes in  credit risk  are present- ed in fair  value  reserve   | Liabilities   for which  changes in  credit risk  are present- ed in profit   or loss   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Carrying amount at end of year                                            | 1,438                                                                                      | 4,170                                                                                   | 5,608   |\n| Amount to be paid at maturity                                             | 1,706                                                                                      | 4,170                                                                                   | 5,877   |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, during the year | 7                                                                                          | -                                                                                       | 7       |\n| Changes in fair value due to changes  in own credit risk, accumulated     | -9                                                                                         | -                                                                                       | -9      |\n\n## P3.4  Fair value\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFair value is defined as the price that at the measurement date would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value measurement assumes that the transaction takes place under current market conditions in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe existence of published price quotations in an active market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist, they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The absolute level of liquidity and volume required for a market to be considered active varies depending on the class of instruments.",

If quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions or if quoted prices are not available, fair value is established by using an appropriate valuation technique. The adequacy of the valuation technique, including an assessment of whether to use quoted prices or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nValuation techniques can range from a simple discounted cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models. Valuation techniques are designed to apply observable market prices and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use of unobservable model parameters. The adequacy of the valuation technique is assessed by measuring its ability to match market prices. This is done by comparing calculated prices with relevant benchmark data, e.g. quoted prices from exchanges, the counterparty's valuations, price data from consensus services etc.\n\nFor financial instruments whose fair value is estimated by a valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables used are predominantly based on data from observable markets. Nordea Bank Abp considers data from observable markets to be data that can be collected from generally available external sources and which is deemed to represent realistic market prices. If unobservable data has a significant impact on the valuation, the instrument cannot be recognised initially at the fair value estimated by the valuation technique and any upfront gains are thereby deferred and amortised through the income statement over the contractual life of the instrument. The deferred upfront gains are subsequently released to income if the unobservable data becomes observable.\n\nFair value measurements of assets and liabilities are categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The categorisation of these instruments is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nLevel 1 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities where directly quoted market prices are not available in active markets. The fair values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Alternatively, the fair values are estimated using valuation techniques or valuation models based on market prices or inputs prevailing at the balance sheet date and where unobservable inputs have not had a significant impact on the fair values.\n\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and liabilities for which fair values cannot be obtained directly from quoted market prices or indirectly using valuation techniques or models supported by observable market prices or rates.\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                 | 31 Dec 2023     | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022     | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Financial assets                     | Carrying amount | Fair value    | Carrying amount | Fair value    |\n| Cash and balances with central banks | 49,150          | 49,150        | 61,425          | 61,425        |\n| Loans 1                              | 218,259         | 218,716       | 223,402         | 222,890       |\n| Interest-bearing securities 2        | 73,763          | 73,810        | 74,504          | 74,578        |\n| Shares                               | 9,437           | 9,437         | 6,765           | 6,765         |\n| Derivatives                          | 27,832          | 27,832        | 38,870          | 38,870        |\n| Other assets                         | 8,256           | 8,256         | 8,516           | 8,516         |\n| Prepaid expenses and accrued income  | 311             | 311           | 295             | 295           |\n| Total                                | 387,008         | 387,512       | 413,777         | 413,339       |\n\n| EURm                                    | 31 Dec 2023     | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022     | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Financial liabilities                   | Carrying amount | Fair value    | Carrying amount | Fair value    |\n| Deposits and debt securities in issue 3 | 330,772         | 331,594       | 348,194         | 350,366       |\n| Derivatives                             | 32,202          | 32,202        | 39,874          | 39,874        |\n| Other liabilities                       | 11,105          | 11,105        | 14,107          | 14,107        |\n| Accrued expenses and prepaid income     | 20              | 20            | 21              | 21            |\n| Total                                   | 374,099         | 374,921       | 402,196         | 404,368       |",

Nordea Bank Abp also transferred items recognised in the line item 'Other liabilities' of EUR 294m (EUR 43m) from Level 1 to Level 2 and of EUR 8m (EUR 235m) from Level 2 to Level 1. The transfer of 'Interest-bearing securities' from Level 1 to Level 2 was mainly due to a reassessment of trading activity. Other transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 were due to the instruments ceasing to be actively traded during the year, which meant that fair values were obtained using valuation techniques with observable market inputs. The transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 were due to the instruments again\n\nbeing actively traded during the year, which meant that reliable quoted prices were obtained in the market. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year.\n\n## Movements in Level 3\n\nUnrealised gains and losses relate to assets and liabilities held at the end of the year. The transfers out of Level 3 were due to observable market data becoming available. The transfers into Level 3 were due to observable market data no longer being available. Transfers between levels are considered to have occurred at the end of the year. Fair value gains and losses in the income statement during the year are included in 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss' (see Note P2.4 'Total net result from items at fair value \" ). Assets and liabilities related to derivatives are presented net.\n\n## Movements in Level 3\n\n|                              | 1 Jan   | Fair value gains/losses  recognised in the income  statement during the year   | Fair value gains/losses  recognised in the income  statement during the year   | Recognised in       | Purchases/   |       |                | Transfers    | Transfers out   |                    |                          |              |\n|------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------|\n| 2023, EURm                   | 2023    | Realised                                                                       | Unrealised                                                                     | fair value  reserve | issues       | Sales | Settle-  ments | into Level 3 | of Level 3      | Reclassifi- cation | Translation  differences | 31 Dec  2023 |\n| Loans to the public          | -

unobservable inputs used in the valuation techniques and, for financial assets and liabilities, the fair value sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.\n\nThe column 'Range of fair value' in the tables above shows the sensitivity of the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments to changes in key assumptions. In case the exposure to an unobservable parameter is offset across different instruments, only the net impact is disclosed in the table. The range disclosed is likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in determining the fair value of these instruments as all unobservable parameters are in practice unlikely to be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. The disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.\n\nThe reported sensitivity (range) of the fair value of derivatives follows the same methodologies as applied to the reporting of the model risk and market price uncertainty additional valuation adjustments (AVAs) as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/101 of 26 October 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for prudent valuation under Article 105(14).\n\nIn order to calculate the sensitivity (range) of the fair value of shares and interest-bearing securities, the fair value is increased and decreased within a total range of 2-10 percentage points depending on the valuation uncertainty and underlying assumptions. Higher ranges are applied to instruments with more uncertain valuations relative to actively traded instruments and underlying uncertainties in individual assumptions.",

The result should be within a range of 80-125%.\n\nTransactions that are entered into in accordance with Nordea Bank Abp ' s hedging objectives but do not qualify for hedge accounting are economic hedge relationships.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are hedging changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability attributable to a specific risk. Fair value hedge accounting can be performed at both micro level (single assets/liabilities or closed portfolios of assets/liabilities where one or more hedged items are hedged using one or more hedging instruments) and macro level (open portfolios where groups of items are hedged using multiple hedging instruments).\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives (hedging instruments), as well as changes in the value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged, recognised in the income statement under 'Net result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve'. Given that the hedge is effective, the change in the fair value of the hedged item will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe changes in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the risks being hedged with the derivative instrument, are reflected in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item, which is also recognised in the income statement. The fair value changes of the hedged items held at amortised cost in hedges of interest rate risks in macro hedges are reported separately in the balance sheet item ' Fair value changes of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk \" .\n\nAny ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement under the item 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. The hedging instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss and the change in the fair value of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge relationship is terminated, is amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the hedged item.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging the exposure to variability in future cash flows. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised in equity and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recyled in the item 'Net result from securities ar fair value through profit or loss' in the income statement. The hedge is considered to be ineffective to the extent that the cumulative change in fair value from the inception of the hedge is larger for the hedging instrument than for the hedged item.\n\nGains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recycled and recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item affects profit or loss, normally in the period in which interest income or interest expense is recognised.\n\nA hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable cash flows from recognised assets or liabilities or from future assets or liabilities. Derivatives used as hedging instruments are always measured at fair value.\n\nIf the hedging relationship does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument will prospectively from the last time it was proven effective be accounted for in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity from the period when the hedge was effective is reclassified from equity to 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss' in the income statement if the expected transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nIf the expected transaction is no longer highly probable but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity from the period when the hedge was effective will remain in equity until the transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.\n\n## Derivatives used for hedge accounting\n\n|                     | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm   | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges 1 | 2,777        | 4,262        | 107,763         |\n| Cash flow hedges 1  | 1,921        | 1,017        | 22,276          |\n| Total derivatives   | 4,698        | 5,279        | 130,039         |\n\n|                     | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2022, EURm   | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Fair value hedges 1 | 3,236        | 5,185        | 99,881          |\n| Cash flow hedges 1  | 1,339        | 420          | 17,915          |\n| Total derivatives   | 4,575        | 5,605        | 117,795         |\n\nThe table above shows the fair value of derivatives used for hedge accounting together with their nominal amounts.

Balances with central banks consist of deposits in accounts with central banks and postal giro systems under government authority when the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 The central bank or the postal giro system is domiciled in the country where the institutions are established.\n- \u00b7 The balance on the account is readily available at any time.\n\n## P3.7   Loans\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nLoans are financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments that are not readily transferable without the consent of the debtor. Loans are classified in accordance with the description in Note P3.3 'Classification and measurement'. Nordea Bank Abp's accounting policies covering expected credit losses follow below. Additional information on credit risk on loans is disclosed in Note P10 'Risk and liquidity management \" .\n\nFinancial instruments classified as 'Amortised cost' or 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are subject to impairment testing due to credit risk. This includes assets recognised on the balance sheet in 'Cash and balances with central banks', 'Debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks', 'Loans to credit institutions', 'Loans to the public' and 'Interest-bearing securities'. These balance sheet line items include assets classified as 'Fair value through profit or loss', which are not subject to impairment testing. See also Note P3.3 'Classification and measurement'.\n\nOff-balance sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and loan commitments are also subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Recognition and presentation\n\nAmortised cost assets are recognised gross with an offsetting allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not regarded as final. The allowance account is netted against the loan balance on the face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is disclosed separately in this note. Changes in the allowance account are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nIf the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised. An impairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the financial outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when Nordea Bank Abp waives its claims either through a legally based or voluntary reconstruction, or when Nordea Bank Abp,\n\nfor other reasons, deems it unlikely that the claim will be recovered. See also the section 'Write-offs' on the following page.\n\nProvisions for off-balance sheet exposures are classified as 'Provisions' on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions classified as 'Net loan losses'.\n\nAssets classified as 'Fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet. Impairment losses calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement and classified as 'Impairment of other financial assets'. Any fair value adjustments are recognised in equity.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nNordea Bank Abp classifies all exposures into stages on an individual basis. Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 (impaired loans) includes defaulted assets. Nordea Bank Abp monitors whether there are indicators of exposures being credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows. Nordea Bank Abp applies the same definition of default as the Capital Requirements Regulation. More information on the identification of loss events can be found in Note P10 'Risk and liquidity management'. Exposures without individually calculated allowances will be covered by the model-based impairment calculation.\n\nFor significant exposures where a credit event has been identified, the exposure is tested for impairment on an individual basis. If the exposure is found impaired, an individual provision is recognised. The carrying amount of the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the carrying amount is higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss. The expected cash flows are discounted at the original effective interest rate and include the fair value of the collateral and other credit enhancements. The estimate is based on three different forward-looking scenarios that are probability weighted to derive the net present value.\n\nFor insignificant exposures that have been individually identified as credit impaired, the impairment loss is measured using the model described below but based on the fact that the exposures are already in default.\n\nNordea Bank Abp uses the 'low credit risk exemption' for exposures issued after transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018. Such exposures with a 12-month probability of default (PD) below 0.3% are classified as stage 1.\n\n## Model-based allowance calculation\n\nFor exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical model is used for calculating impairment losses. The provisions are calculated as the exposure at default times the PD times the loss given default. For assets in stage 1 this calculation is only based on the coming 12 months, while for assets in stages 2 and 3 it is based on the expected lifetime of the assets.",

        "page_content": "Business areas\n\nP3.7  Loans, cont.\n\nThe provisions for exposures for which there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are based on the 12-month expected loss (stage 1). The provisions for exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but which are not credit impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2). This is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired exposures in stage 3.\n\nNordea Bank Abp uses two different models to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. For assets held on transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the change in internal rating and scoring data is used to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or not. Internal rating/scoring information is used to assess the risk of the customers and a deterioration in rating/scoring indicates an increase in the credit risk of the customer. Nordea Bank Abp has concluded that it is not possible to calculate the lifetime PD at origination without the use of hindsight for assets already recognised on the balance sheet at transition. Changes to the lifetime PD are used as the trigger for assets recognised after transition.\n\nFor assets evaluated based on lifetime PD, Nordea Bank Abp uses a mix of absolute and relative changes in PD as the transfer criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 1%: Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 45bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 1%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 100% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 300bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD below 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% and an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 20bp are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail customers with an initial 12-month PD above or equal to 0.5%:\n- Exposures with a relative increase in lifetime PD above 150% or an absolute increase in 12-month PD above 400bp are transferred to stage 2.\n\nFor assets for which rating and scoring models are used, the change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime PD.\n\nIn addition, Nordea Bank Abp applies the following backstops for transfers between stages:\n\n- \u00b7 Customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to stage 2 unless already identified as credit impaired (stage 3). Exposures with forbearance measures will stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when the measures were introduced. Once transferred back to stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated as any other stage 1 exposure on the assessment of significant increase in credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Exposures more than 90 days past due are normally classified as stage 3, but this classification will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in default. Such exposures are classified as stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Exposures with a relative change in annualised lifetime PD exceeding 200% and with at least one rating grade of deterioration are transferred to stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Exposures classified as 'high risk', i.e. with a rating grade of 2 or below, are transferred to stage 2.\n\nWhen calculating provisions, including the staging assessment, the calculation is based on both historical data and probability-weighted forward-looking information. Nordea Bank Abp applies three macroeconomic scenarios to address the non-linearity in expected credit losses. The different scenarios are used to adjust the relevant parameters for calculating expected losses and a probability-weighted average of the expected losses under each scenario is recognised as provisions. The model is based on data collected before the reporting date requiring Nordea Bank Abp to identify events that could affect the provisions after the data is sourced to the model calculation. Management evaluates these events and adjusts the provisions if deemed necessary.\n\n## Write-offs\n\nA write-off is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision. When assets are considered uncollectible, they should be written off as soon as possible, regardless of whether the legal claim remains or not. A write-off can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded in full. Although an uncollectible asset is removed or written off from the balance sheet, the customer remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt. When assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and determining if write-offs are required, exposures with the following characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 Exposures past due more than 90 days. If, following this assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed as unrecoverable, it is written off.\n- \u00b7 Exposures under insolvency procedures where the collateralisation of the exposure is low.\n- \u00b7 Exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb the proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure and estimated recoveries are therefore expected to be low.\n- \u00b7 A partial write-off may be warranted where there is reasonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of the borrower to repay the full amount, i.e. a significant level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the execution of collateral.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring cases.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate used to measure impairment is the original effective interest rate for loans attached to an individual customer or, if applicable, to a group of loans. If considered appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation using the effective interest rate method as basis for the calculation.\n\n## Restructured loans and modifications\n\nIn this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where Nordea Bank Abp has granted concessions to the obligor due to their financial difficulties and where such concessions have resulted in an impairment loss for Nordea Bank Abp. After restructing the loan is normally regarded as not impaired if it performs according to the new terms and conditions. In the event of recovery, the payment is reported as recovery of loan losses.\n\nModifications of the contractual cash flows of loans to customers in financial difficulties (forbearance) reduce the gross carrying amount of the loan. Normally this reduction is less than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in the income statement due to modifications. If significant, the gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced.",

For example, a property taken over, not held for Nordea Bank Abp ' s own use, is reported together with other investment properties.\n\nAt initial recognition, all assets taken over for protection of claims are recognised at fair value and the possible difference between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value of the assets taken over is recognised in 'Net loan losses'.

For more information about accounting policies, see Note P3.4 'Fair value'.\n\nNordea Bank Abp enters into derivatives for trading and risk management purposes. Nordea Bank Abp may take positions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates or indices. The trading portfolio is treated as trading risk for risk management purposes. Derivatives held for risk management purposes include hedges that meet the hedge accounting requirements and hedges that are economic hedges but do not meet the hedge accounting requirements.\n\nThe table below shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments not used for hedge accounting together with their nominal amounts. The nominal amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at year end and are neither indicative of market risk nor credit risk. The derivatives are divided into derivatives not used for hedge accounting and derivatives used for hedge accounting. For more information about derivatives used for hedge accounting, see Note P3.5 'Hedge accounting'.\n\nThe fair value and nominal amount of derivatives in this note represent derivatives before offsetting between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet (gross amount) as the gross amount better reflects Nordea Bank Abp's exposure.\n\n## Derivatives\n\n|                                            | Fair value   | Fair value   |                 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 31 Dec 2023, EURm                          | Positive     | Negative     | Nominal  amount |\n| Derivatives not used for hedge  accounting | 169,144      | 173,608      | 7,439,969       |\n| Derivatives used for hedge  accounting     | 4,698        | 5,279        | 130,039         |\n| Gross amount                               | 173,842      | 178,887      | 7,570,008       |\n| Derivatives offset on the balance  sheet   | -146,010     | -146,685     | -

The assets are under Nordea Bank Abp's control, which means that Nordea Bank Abp has the power and rights to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource. Nordea Bank Abp's intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, internally developed software and software licences.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is recognised at cost less amortisation and any write-downs. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, which is normally 5-10 years. Goodwill is typically recognised when Nordea Bank Abp acquires an asset or business or in connection with the merger of a subsidiary.\n\n## IT development and computer software\n\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred. Costs directly associated with major software development investments, with the ability to\n\ngenerate future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include software development staff costs and overhead expenditures directly attributable to preparing the asset for use. Computer software also includes acquired software licences not related to the function of a tangible asset.\n\nAmortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the software, generally a period of three to five years, and in some circumstances for strategic infrastructure up to a maximum of ten years.\n\n## Impairment\n\nIT development not yet taken into use is not amortised but tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indications of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is also performed more frequently if required due to any indication of impairment. Intangible assets in use and amortised are also evaluated for indications of impairment and if such indications are found, the assets are tested for impairment. The impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.\n\n|                                                               | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023                      | 31 Dec 2023        | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022                      | 31 Dec 2022        | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                          | Goodwill      | Internally  developed   software | Software  licences | Total         | Goodwill      | Internally  developed   software | Software  licences | Total         |\n| Acquisition value at beginning   of year                      | 347           | 2,745                            | 434                | 3,526         | 317           | 2,604                            | 422                | 3,343         |\n| Acquisitions                                                  | -             | 387                              | 35                 | 422           | 38            | 302                              | 24                 | 364           |\n| Sales/disposals                                               | -             | -830                             | -20                | -850          | -             | -67                              | -1                 | -68           |\n| Reclassifications                                             | -             | -13                              | 0                  | -13           | -             | 0                                | -                  | 0             |\n| Translation differences                                       | 1             | -14                              | -2                 | -15           | -8            | -94                              | -11                | -113          |\n| Acquisition value at end of year                              | 348           | 2,275                            | 447                | 3,070         | 347           | 2,745                            | 434                | 3,526         |\n| Accumulated amortisation and  impairment at beginning of year | -283          | -1,249                           | -338               | -1,870        | -277          | -1,023                           | -307               | -1,607        |\n| Accumulated amortisation and  impairment on sales/disposals   | -             | 830                              | 18                 | 848           | -             | 66                               | 1                  | 67            |\n| Amortisation according to plan                                | -19           | -330                             | -39                | -388          | -13           | -315                             | -40                | -368          |\n| Impairment charges                                            | -             | -188                             | -                  | -188          | -             | -23                              | -                  | -23           |\n| Translation differences                                       | -             | 14                               | 2                  | 16            | 7             | 46                               | 8                  | 61            |\n| Accumulated amortisation and  impairment at end of year       | -302          | -923                             | -357               | -1,582        | -283          | -1,249                           | -338               | -1,870        |\n| Total                                                         | 46            | 1,352                            | 90                 | 1,488         | 64            | 1,496                            | 96                 | 1,656         |",

Items of properties and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price as well as any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the working condition for its intended use. Parts of an item of property and equipment are accounted for as separate items if they have different useful lives.\n\nImprovements are recognised as assets if they provide an improved function of the asset, while maintenance does not improve the function of the assets and is expensed as incurred.\n\nProperties and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The estimates of the useful life of different assets are reassessed on a yearly basis.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of the assets are specified below:\n\nBuildings\n\n30-75 years\n\nEquipment\n\n3-5 years\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\nFor changes within buildings, the short- er of 10 years and the remaining lease term. For new construction, the shorter of the principles used for owned build- ings and the remaining lease term. Fix- tures installed in leased properties are depreciated over the shorter of 10-20 years and the remaining lease term.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, Nordea Bank Abp assesses whether there is any indication that an item of property and equipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, and any impairment loss is recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## Properties and equipment\n\n|                                                                     | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023               | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022               | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| EURm                                                                | Equipment 1   | Leasehold  improve- ments | Total         | Equipment 1   | Leasehold  improve- ments | Total         |\n| Acquisition value at beginning of year                              | 417           | 486                       | 903           | 424           | 498                       | 922           |\n| Acquisitions                                                        | 6             | 23                        | 29            | 8             | 25                        | 33            |\n| Sales/disposals                                                     | -61           | -14                       | -75           | -4            | -21                       | -25           |\n| Reclassifications                                                   | 6             | -7                        | -1            | 2             | -3                        | -1            |\n| Translation differences                                             | -4            | -4                        | -8            | -13           | -13                       | -26           |\n| Acquisition value at end of year                                    | 364           | 484                       | 848           | 417           | 486                       | 903           |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment at beginning   of year      | -368          | -294                      | -662          | -370          | -299                      | -669          |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment charges on sales/ disposals | 61            | 11                        | 72            | 3             | 21                        | 24            |\n| Depreciation according to plan                                      | -16           | -25                       | -41           | -13           | -23                       | -36           |\n| Impairment charges                                                  | -             | -                         | -             | -             | -                         | -             |\n| Reclassifications                                                   | 1             | 0                         | 1             | -             | -1                        | -1            |\n| Translation differences                                             | 4             | 5                         | 9             | 12            | 8                         | 20            |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment at end of year              | -318          | -303                      | -621          | -368          | -294                      | -662          |\n| Total                                                               | 46            | 181                       | 227           | 49            | 192                       | 241           |\n\n- 1)   Including properties of EUR 2m (EUR 2m) and investment properties of EUR 1m (EUR 1m).

Lease payments are recognised as 'Other operating expenses \" in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic way better reflects the time pattern of Nordea Bank Abp's benefit. The lease terms normally range between 3 and 25 years. Leases are mainly related to office premises contracts and office equipment contracts  normal to the business.\n\n## Non-cancellable operating leases\n\n| EURm               | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Less than one year | 136           | 146           |\n| 1-2 years          | 120           | 108           |\n| 2-5 years          | 269           | 206           |\n| 5-10 years         | 332           | 299           |\n| 10-15 years        | 294           | 263           |\n| 15-20 years        | 101           | 164           |\n| 20-25 years        | 2             | 10            |\n| Total              | 1,254         | 1,196         |\n\nNordea Bank Abp operates from leased premises. The premises are mainly divided into head office contracts, branch office contracts and other contracts. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases which are payable by Nordea Bank Abp are presented in the table above.\n\nThe head office contracts in the different Nordic countries generally have a fixed lease term of 10-25 years. Usually these contracts either have continuation options or are automatically prolonged unless separately terminated at the end of the lease term.\n\nBranch office contracts generally have fixed lease term of 1-10 years or are without an end date with the right to terminate. The termination clauses are generally 6-24 months. The main principle is that the premises contracts do not contain purchase options. Company car contracts generally have a fixed lease term of less than five years.\n\n## P5  Provisions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions (which are presented as a liability) are recognised when Nordea Bank Abp has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event if it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nAccounting policies relating to employee benefits are further described in Note P7 'Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration \" and relating to financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments in Note P6 'Off-balance sheet items \" .

The remaining provisions are related to staff restructuring (EUR 63m) and premises-related obligations (EUR 15m).\n\nThe staff-related provision is related to contracts entered into, or activities communicated but not yet finalised, where payments remain to be executed on. These contracts are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Approximately EUR 69m out of the total restructuring provision EUR 78m is expected to be utilised/paid out in 2024. All staff-related activities are expected to be executed on in 2024, but payments are expected to extend into 2025. As for any other provision, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing and the amount to be finally paid. The uncertainty is expected to decrease as the plans are executed.\n\nLoan loss provisions on off-balance sheet items amounted to EUR 186m (EUR 202m).

The accounting policies covering provisions can be found in Note P5 'Provisions'.\n\nGuarantees and documentary credits are recognised on the balance sheet under the expected credit loss requirements as further defined in Note P3.7 'Loans'. Changes in provisions are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net loan losses'.\n\nPremiums received for financial guarantees are amortised over the guarantee period and recognised as 'Fee and commission income' in the income statement.

The legal costs can e.g. include required costs of legal defence and claims made (during and after their period of office) against Board members in cases where Board members are not found liable or guilty of any intentional wrongdoing or grossly negligent behaviour.\n\nAs of 1 June 2023, members of the GLT are afforded coverage and reimbursement corresponding to that of the Board in instances related to or arising from the respective GLT membership of each member. In addition, as of 2019, Nordea Bank Abp has undertaken to indemnify the members of the GLT against legal expenses incurred in relation to certain claims or investigations by third parties based on circumstances or events which occurred during the members' respective terms of office, excluding crimes or actions made with intent or gross negligence, up to a capped aggregate amount of EUR 37.5m, unless the Board decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis.\n\nNordea Bank Abp has undertaken, in relation to certain individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for the potential payment liability against these individuals in their capacity of managing directors or board members of group undertakings of Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nNordea Bank Abp purchases directors and officers liability insurance, which provides cover for personal liabilities of its Board of Directors and management as well as liability assumed by the bank to a certain extent following indemnification undertakings. The terms and conditions including the total limit of liability of the directors and officers liability insurance programme are in line with large European banks.\n\nA limited number of employees are entitled to severance pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retirement age. For further information, see Note P7.4 \" Key management personnel remuneration \" .\n\nWithin the framework of normal business operations, Nordea Bank Abp faces a number of operational and legal risks potentially resulting in reputational impacts, fines, sanctions, disputes, losses and/or litigation. This includes potential claims related to the provision of banking and investment services and other areas in which Nordea Bank Abp operates. Currently, such claims are mainly related to lending and insolvency situations, various investment services, and sub-custody and withholding taxation matters. At present, none of the current claims are considered likely to have any significant adverse effect on Nordea Bank Abp or its financial position. As previously stated, Nordea Bank Abp expects to be fined in Denmark for weak AML processes and procedures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing AML-related matters. Nordea Bank Abp cannot exclude the possibility of fines which could impact the bank's financial performance. In addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litigation.

        "page_content": "## P7   Employee benefits and key management personnel remuneration\n\nAll forms of consideration given by Nordea Bank Abp to its employees as compensation for services performed are employee benefits. Employee benefits consist of short-term benefits, post-employment benefits and share-based payment plans.\n\nShort-term benefits are to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period when the services have been performed. Short-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. For more information, see Note P7.1 'Fixed and variable salaries'.\n\nPost-employment benefits are benefits payable after termination of the employment. Post-employment benefits in Nordea Bank Abp consist only of pensions. For more information, see Note P7.2 'Pensions'.\n\nShare-based payment plans cover share-based payments for services from employees. For more information, see Note P7.3 'Share-based payment plans'.\n\nIn addition, remuneration to key management personnel is disclosed in Note P7.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n## Additional disclosures on remuneration\n\nThe Board of Directors' report includes a separate section on remuneration, see page 78. Further, in accordance with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 the Remuneration Report for Governing bodies 2023 will be prepared for the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2024. Finally aggregated disclosures for key management personnel and material risk takers (Pillar III, CRR article 450) will be published on nordea.com ahead of the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## P7.1   Fixed and variable salaries\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable salary. Both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the period when the employees perform services for Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nShort-term benefits that fulfil the capitalisation requirements defined in the accounting policies in Note P4.1 'Intangible assets' are included gross in this note, but subsequently capitalised and added to 'Intangible assets' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits normally arise if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or if an employee accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy.\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when Nordea Bank Abp has an obligation to make the payment. An obligation arises when a formal plan has been committed to on the appropriate organisational level and when Nordea Bank Abp is without realistic possibility of withdrawal, which normally occurs when the plan has been communicated to the affected individual or employee(s) or their representatives.\n\nTermination benefits can include both short-term benefits, for instance a number of months' salary, and post-employment benefits, normally in the form of early retirement.\n\n## Nordea Bank Abp's Short Term Incentive Plans\n\nNordea Bank Abp operates Short Term Incentive Plans (STIPs). These are the Nordea Incentive Plan (NIP), which is offered to the CEO and members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT) and subject to invitation, to other employees, or bonus schemes (bonus) for selected employees in specific business areas or units as approved by the Board of Directors (Board).

Pension costs for defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense as the employee renders services to the entity and the contribution payable in exchange for that service becomes due. In general, the payment is associated with and settled through regular salary payments. Nordea Bank Abp also contributes to state pension plans.\n\nPension costs for defined contribution plans that fulfil the capitalisation requirements defined in the accounting policies in Note P4.1 'Intangible assets' are included gross in this note, but subsequently capitalised and added to 'Intangible assets ' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe major defined benefit plans are funded, covered by assets in pension funds/foundations. If the fair value of plan assets associated with a specific pension plan is lower than the gross present value of the defined benefit obligation determined using the projected unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as a liability ('Retirement benefit liabilities'). If not, the net amount is recognised as an asset ('Retirement benefit assets'). Non-funded pension plans are recognised as 'Retirement benefit liabilities'.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's net obligation for defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned for their service in the current period and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Actuarial calculations, including the projected unit credit method, are",

Current and past service cost is recognised in the income statement in the current year. Current service cost is defined as the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period. Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods triggered by plan amendments or curtailments.\n\nThe present value of the obligation and the fair value of any plan assets are impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions (discount rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, salary increases, turnover and mortality) and experience effects, including actual outcome compared to assumptions. The remeasurement effects are recognised immediately in equity through the fair value reserve.\n\nThe discount rate is determined by reference to highquality corporate bonds where a deep enough market for such bonds exists. Covered bonds are in this context considered to be corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the discount rate is determined with reference to covered bonds, whereas in Finland and the UK it is determined with reference to corporate bonds. In Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, the observed bond credit spreads over the swap curve are derived from long-dated covered or corporate bonds and extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves. In the UK, the corporate bond credit spread over the government bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the pension obligations using the government bond curve.\n\nWhen the calculation results in a net asset, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nSocial security contributions are calculated and accounted for based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and are included on the balance sheet as 'Retirement benefit liabilities' or 'Retirement benefit assets'.\n\nPension costs to defined benefit plans that fulfil the capitalisation requirements defined in the accounting policies in Note P4.1 'Intangible assets' are included gross in this note, but subsequently capitalised and added to 'Intangible assets' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe companies within Nordea Bank Abp have various pension plans. They consists of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, reflecting national practices and conditions in the countries where Nordea Bank Abp operates.\n\n## Pension costs\n\n| EURm                       |   2023 |   2022 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Defined contribution plans |   -192 |   -184 |\n| Defined benefit plans1     |    -38 |    -54 |\n| Total                      |   -230 |   -238 |\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nAll new employees have been offered defined contribution plans since 2013 when the defined benefit plan in Sweden was closed for new members. The defined contribution plans follow the local collective agreements and regulations in each country.\n\nIn Norway, Nordea Bank Abp is part of a collectively agreed multi-employer pension plan in the private sector (AFP), providing entitled employees with a lifelong addition to their regular pensions. As no information is available on Nordea Bank Abp's share of the liabilities/assets and pension costs, the AFP is accounted for as a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe AFP plan is financed by an annual premium, for 2023 equal to 2.6% of employees' salary between 1 and 7.1 times the Norwegian social security base amount ('G'). The premium for 2023 amounted to EUR 3m (EUR 3m).\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe plans are operated in accordance with local regulatory requirements, collective agreements and local practice and are generally employer-financed final salary and service-based pension plans providing pension benefits in addition to the statutory systems. All defined benefit plans are closed for new entrants; new employees are offered defined contribution plans.\n\n## Retirement benefit assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                          |   31 Dec 2023 |   31 Dec 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Plans with net retirement benefit assets      |           220 |           159 |\n| Plans with net retirement benefit liabilities |           237 |           243 |\n| Net liability(-)/asset(+)                     |           -17 |           -84 |\n\nIn general, the liabilities are safeguarded by assets in dedicated pension funds or foundations or alternatively by credit insurance (Sweden only). Pension funds and foundations hold both the assets and the pension liabilities, except for Sweden where the pension foundation serves as collateral for the pension liabilities held by Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nMinimum funding requirements differ between the pension funds and foundations according to local regulatory requirements. The funding requirement is generally that the pension obligations measured using local requirements must be covered in full by a local predefined surplus. Other pension plans are not covered by funding requirements and are generally unfunded. The respective Nordea Bank Abp entities issuing the defined pension benefit serve as the sponsoring entity in accordance with the EU IORP II Directive.\n\nDefined benefit plans impact Nordea Bank Abp via changes in the net present value of obligations and/or changes in the market value of plan assets.",

        "page_content": "## P7.3   Share-based payment plans\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Equity-settled plans\n\nAn equity-settled share-based payment transaction occurs when Nordea Bank Abp receives goods or services and uses its own equity instruments as consideration. Such transactions are recognised as a staff expense and a corresponding increase in equity. The expense is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. In such cases, the expense is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded, which is the method used by Nordea Bank Abp.\n\nWhen Nordea Bank Abp issues such instruments, the award date fair value of these rights is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value per right is estimated at award date and not subsequently updated. The vesting period is the period over which the employees have to remain in service at Nordea in order for their rights to vest.\n\nFor rights with non-market performance conditions, the amount expensed is the award date fair value per right multiplied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, which is reassessed at each reporting date. For rights with market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimated based on the fair value of each right times the maximum number of rights at award date. Market conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments awarded. Therefore, if all other vesting conditions (e.g. service conditions) are met, Nordea Bank Abp recognises the expense for awards of equity instruments with market conditions over the vesting period irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.\n\nSocial security costs are also allocated over the vesting period. The provision for social security costs is reassessed on each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on the rights' fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Cash-settled plans\n\nA cash-settled share-based payment transaction occurs when Nordea Bank Abp acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price of equity instruments of Nordea Bank Abp. For cashsettled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. The liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recognised in the line item 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss' in the income statement.\n\n## Nordea Bank Abp's share-based remuneration plans\n\nNordea Bank Abp has several variable pay plans for selected Nordea Bank Abp employees (participants). The terms of the plans vary depending on the target group. Disclosures related to the share-based plans can be found below. All remuneration plans are also described in the section 'Remuneration' on page 78 of the Board of Directors' report.\n\nUntil the end of the performance/financial year 2018, Nordea Bank Abp's share-based variable remuneration plans were partly in the form of equity-linked total shareholders' return indexation (excluding dividends) and partly in the form of cash. The plans were consequently generally settled in cash and the portion indexed with Nordea's total shareholders' return was accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment plan. The total shareholders' return indexation resulted in a loss of EUR 1m in 2023 related to the remaining defered payments stemming from these plans.\n\n## Share-based payment plans\n\n| Plan year       | Equity-settled   or cash-settled   | Delivery period   | Expense 2023   | Expense 2022   | Liability  31 Dec 2023   | Liability  31 Dec 2022   | Outstanding  rights   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2023            |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP          | Equity-settled                     | 2026-2031         | 2              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes 1                 |\n| - NIP and bonus | Equity-settled                     | 2024-2029         | 11             | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes 2                 |\n| - Buy-outs etc. | Equity-settled                     | 2023-2027         | 0              | -              | -                        | -                        | Yes 2                 |\n| 2022            |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP          | Equity-settled                     | 2025-2030         | 2              | 1              | -                        | -                        | Yes 1                 |\n| - NIP and bonus | Equity-settled                     | 2023-2028         | 6              | 10             | -                        | -                        | Yes 2                 |\n| - Buy-outs etc. | Equity-settled                     | 2022-2026         | 0              | 0              | -                        | -                        | Yes 2                 |\n| 2021            |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n| - LTIP          | Equity-settled                     | 2024-2029         | 1              | 1              | -                        | -                        | Yes 3                 |\n| - EIP           | Equity-settled                     | 2022-2027         | -1             | -5             | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - VSP and bonus | Equity-settled                     | 2022-2027         | 0              | 8              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| - Buy-outs etc. | Equity-settled                     | 2022-2023         | 0              | 0              | -                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| Previous years  |                                    |                   |                |                |                          |                          |                       |\n|                 | Cash-settled                       | 2022-2025         | 1              | -2             | 6                        | 6                        | No                    |\n|                 | Equity-settled                     | 2022-2025         | -3             | -1             | 0                        | -                        | Yes                   |\n| Total           |                                    |                   | 19             | 10             | 6                        | 6                        |                       |\n\n- 1) Rights will be awarded following the end of the three-year performance period (2023-2025) over the delivery period (2026-2031).\n- 2) Rights will be awarded in 2024 based on the performance in 2023.\n- 3) Rights will be awarded following the end of the three-year performance period (2022-2024) over the delivery period (2025-2030).",

Control is generally achieved when Nordea Bank Abp holds, directly or indirectly through group undertakings, more than 50% of the voting rights.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's investments in group undertakings are recognised under the cost model. At each balance sheet date, all shares in group undertakings are reviewed for indications of impairment. If such indication exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of each holding of shares is fully recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Any impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount and is presented in the line item 'Depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges' in the income statement.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount is then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\nNordea Bank Abp applies fair value hedge accounting to the foreign exchange risk in its investments in foreign operations. Under fair value hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss along with the associated movement in the foreign currency risk on the designated portion of the investment in foreign operations. All changes in the fair value of the hedged item and hedging instruments are recognised in the income statement in the line item 'Net result from securities at fair value through profit or loss'. Exchange differences arising on internal long-term loans to foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the future are recognised in equity and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the investment.\n\n## Group undertakings\n\nThis specification includes all directly owned group under takings.\n\n|

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nJoint ventures are the entities where Nordea Bank Abp has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures are recognised under the cost model. At\n\neach balance sheet date, all shares in associated undertakings and joint ventures are reviewed for indications of impairment. If such indication exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of each holding of shares is fully recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Any impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount and is presented in the line item 'Depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges' in the income statement.\n\nImpairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount increases. The carrying amount in then increased to the recoverable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impariment loss been recognised.\n\n## Associated undertakings 1\n\n|                                        |                     |            | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |                 |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n|                                        | Registration number | Domicile   | 2023, EURm        | 2022, EURm        | Shareholding, % |\n| Eksportfinans ASA 2                    | 816521432           | Oslo       | 42                | 42                | 23              |\n| Eiendomsverdi AS                       | 881971682           | Oslo       | 10                | 11                | 25              |\n| Suomen Luotto-osuuskunta               | 0201646-0           | Helsinki   | 1                 | 1                 | 27              |\n| Bankomat AB                            | 556817-9716         | Stockholm  | 6                 | 6                 | 20              |\n| Financial Transaction Services B.V.  3 | 68914016            | Amsterdam  | -                 | 0                 | 0               |\n| Subaio ApS                             | 37766585            | Aalborg    | 2                 | 2                 | 20              |\n| CrediWire ApS                          | 37264628            | Copenhagen | 2                 | 2                 | 7               |\n| Other                                  |                     |            | 0                 | 0                 |                 |\n| Total                                  |                     |            | 63                | 64                |                 |\n\n## Joint ventures 1\n\n|                                 |                     |           | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   |                 |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n|                                 | Registration number | Domicile  | 2023, EURm        | 2022, EURm        | Shareholding, % |\n| Siirto Brand Oy                 | 3102648-1           | Helsinki  | 0                 | 0                 | 50              |\n| Tibern AB                       | 559384-3542         | Stockholm | 1                 | 0                 | 14              |\n| Invidem AB                      | 559210-0779         | Stockholm | 0                 | 4                 | 17              |\n| P27 Nordic Payments Platform AB | 559198-9610         | Stockholm | 0                 | 26                | 17              |\n| Total                           |                     |           | 1                 | 30                |                 |\n\n- 1)  All shares in associated undertakings or joint ventures are unlisted.\n- 2) Credit institutions.\n- 3) Financial Transaction Services B.V was sold in 2023.\n\n## P8.3   Currency  translation of foreign entities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements are presented in euro (EUR).

For equity, there are no requirements to distribute cash flows. Instruments are classified as financial liabilities if such genuine requirements exist, for instance to pay interest when a triggering event occurs that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instruments.\n\nAny payments connected to instruments classified as equity are accounted for directly in equity and presented as dividends. Nordea Bank Abp determines payments on financial instruments classified as equity (i.e. Additional Tier 1 instruments) as distribution of profits and they are therefore accounted for as dividends. Dividends to shareholders are recognised as a reduction of equity when the Annual General Meeting has adopted the proposal. The reduction of equity is accounted for when the Board of Directors decides on dividends in situations where the Annual General Meeting has given the Board of Directors a mandate to make such a decision up to a certain cap.\n\nInvestments in own shares are not accounted for as assets; instead, they are recognised as a reduction in equity net of any transaction costs. Acquisitions of treasury shares as part of the Markets trading operations are recognised as a reduction in invested unrestricted equity. Treasury shares acquired to optimise the capital structure and Nordea Bank Abp's buy-back programmes are recognised as a reduction in retained earnings. Transaction costs related to repurchasing of treasury shares are also recognised in equity. There is no impact on the financial statements when shares are cancelled. Sales of own shares in the trading operations are recognised as increases in invested unrestricted equity.\n\nContracts on Nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, for instance derivatives such as options and warrants, are either presented as financial assets or liabilities, meaning that these are not equity instruments.\n\n## Additional Tier 1 capital holders\n\nNordea Bank Abp has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of Nordea Bank Abp and non-accumulating. Some of these instruments also include a requirement for Nordea Bank Abp to pay interest if the instruments are no longer allowed to be included in Tier 1 capital. The inclusion of the subordinated loan in Tier 1 capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control of Nordea Bank Abp and the holders of the instruments, and Nordea Bank Abp therefore classifies the instruments as financial liabilities. Instruments without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no requirement for Nordea Bank Abp to pay interest or principal to the holders of the instruments.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe share capital amounts to EUR 4,049,951,919.

Related parties are grouped in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Shareholders with significant influence\n- \u00b7 Group undertakings\n- \u00b7 Associated undertakings and joint ventures\n- \u00b7 Key management personnel\n- \u00b7 Other related parties.\n\n## Shareholders with significant influence\n\nShareholders with significant influence are shareholders that have the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of Nordea Bank Abp but do not control those policies.\n\n## Group undertakings\n\nGroup undertakings are defined as the subsidiaries of the parent company, Nordea Bank Abp. Further information on the undertakings owned by Nordea Bank Abp is found in Note P8.1 'Investments in group undertakings'.\n\nTransactions between Nordea Bank Abp and its subsidiaries are performed according to the arm's length principle in conformity with OECD requirements on transfer pricing.\n\n## Associated undertakings and joint ventures\n\nFor the definition of associated undertakings and joint ventures, see Note P8.2 'Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures'.\n\n## Key management personnel\n\nKey management personnel are the persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities in Nordea Bank Abp, directly or indirectly, including any director of the entity.\n\n## Other related parties\n\nOther related parties comprise subsidiaries of shareholders with significant influence, close family members of key management personnel and companies controlled or jointly controlled by key management personnel or by close family members of key management personnel.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nA related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between Nordea Bank Abp and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged. See also accounting policies in Note P7.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\n| EURm             | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Asset management | 122,095       | 114,386       |\n| Custody assets   | 259,512       | 278,536       |\n| Total            | 381,607       | 392,922       |\n\nAll transactions with related parties are made on the same criteria and terms as those of comparable transactions with external parties of similar standing, apart from loans granted to employees as well as certain other commitments to key management personnel, see Note P7.4 'Key management personnel remuneration' and Note P6.1 'Contingent liabilities'.\n\nIn Nordea Bank Abp key management personnel includes the following positions:\n\n- \u00b7 Board of Directors\n- \u00b7 Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n- \u00b7 Deputy Managing Director\n- \u00b7 Group Leadership Team.\n\nLoans to key management personnel amounted to EUR 1.0m (EUR 0.0m) and interest income on these loans amounted to EUR 0.0m (EUR 0.0m). Deposits from key management personnel amounted to EUR 7.8m (EUR 7.3m) and interest on these deposits amounted to EUR -0.1m (EUR -0.0m). Loan commitments to key management personnel amounted to EUR 0.2m (EUR 0.0m).\n\nFor key management personnel employed by Nordea Bank Abp the same credit terms apply as for other employees. In Finland, the employee interest rate for mortgage loans corresponds to Nordea Bank Abp's funding cost with a margin of 30bp and for other loans the employee interest rate corresponds to Nordea Bank Abp's funding cost with a margin of 60-500bp. In Denmark, the employee interest rate for loans is variable and between 3.55% - 5.70% depending of the type of mortgage. In Norway, the variable interest rate on loans to employees is 5.01%. Mortgage loans with fixed interest rates are offered with the same rates as mortgage loans to Premium customers. In Sweden, loans approved with employee conditions are a maximum at SEK 3m for any type of loan and maximum amount at SEK 0.4m for car loans. The interest rate for these loans is 215bp lower than the corresponding interest rate for external customers. For interest on loans above SEK 3m and SEK 0.4m respectively, the employees receive the same maximal discount as Nordea's best external customers.\n\nLoans to family members of key management personnel who do not live in the same household as key management personnel are granted on normal market terms, as are loans to key management personnel who are not employed by Nordea Bank Abp. For more information about transactions with key management personnel, see Note P7.4 'Key management personnel remuneration'.\n\nThe loan quality for key management personnel and their family members is good with no significant increase in credit risk. Loan loss provisions for key management personnel are included in the collectively assessed allowances shown in Note P2.10 'Net loan losses \" .\n\nFor information about remuneration to key management personnel, see Note P7.4 'Key management personnel remuneration \" .",

The intention of granting forbearance for a limited time period is to help the customer return to a sustainable financial situation ensuring full repayment of the outstanding debt. Examples of eased terms are changes in amortisation profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as ease of covenants. Forbearance is undertaken on a selective and individual basis and is followed by impairment testing (corporate customers) as forbearance is considered a credit event. Individual loan loss provisions are recognised if necessary. Forbearance is approved according to the powers to act, and forborne exposures can be performing or non-performing.\n\n## Forbearance\n\n| EURm                                                               | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forborne loans                                                     | 1,775         | 1,563         |\n| - of which defaulted                                               | 912           | 768           |\n| Allowances for individually assessed   impaired and forborne loans | 430           | 337           |\n| - of which defaulted                                               | 399           | 317           |\n\n| Key ratios                   | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Forbearance ratio 1          | 0.9%          | 0.8%          |\n| Forbearance coverage ratio 2 | 24.0%         | 22.0%         |\n| - of which defaulted         | 44.0%         | 41.0%         |\n\n## Credit portfolio\n\nIncluding on- and off-balance sheet exposures, the total credit risk exposure at year end was EUR 458bn (EUR 479bn). Credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in different ways. On-balance sheet lending consists of amortised cost lending and fair value lending and constitutes the major part of the credit portfolio. Amortised cost lending is the basis for impaired loans, allowances and loan losses.\n\nCredit risk in lending is measured and presented as the principal amount of on-balance sheet claims, i.e. loans to credit institutions and to the public, and off-balance sheet potential claims on customers and counterparties, net after allowances. Credit risk exposure also includes the risk related to derivative contracts and securities financing. The overall credit quality is solid with strongly rated customers.\n\nNordea Bank Abp's loans to the public was unchanged at EUR 150bn in 2023 (EUR 150bn). Of the lending to the public portfolio, corporate customers accounted for 65.7% (66.3%), reverse repurchase agreements for 13.9% (12.3%), household customers for 18.4% (18.5%) and the public sector for 1.9% (2.9%). Loans to central banks and credit institutions decreased to EUR 69bn at the end of 2023 (EUR 73bn).\n\n## Loans to corporate customers\n\nLoans to corporate customers at the end of 2023 amounted to EUR 119bn (EUR 118bn). The sector that increased the most in 2023 was Real estate, while Industrials decreased the most. The contribution of the two largest industries (Real estate and Industrials) was approximately 50% of total lending (50%). Real estate remained the largest industry in Nordea Bank Abp's lending portfolio, at EUR 26bn (EUR 25bn). The real estate (commercial and residential) portfolio predominantly consists of relatively large and financially strong companies, with 90% (92%) of the exposure in rating grades 4and higher. The distribution of loans to corporate customers by size of loans, seen in the table below, shows a high degree of diversification with approximately 50% (51%) of the corporate volume representing loans up to EUR 50m per customer.\n\n## Loans to corporate customers, by size of loans\n\n|              | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Size in EURm | Loans EURm    |               | % Loans EURm  | %             |\n| 0-10         | 25,681        | 22            | 26,975        | 23            |\n| 11-50        | 34,195        | 29            | 33,320        | 28            |\n| 51-100       | 22,098        | 19            | 19,771        | 17            |\n| 101-250      | 25,667        | 21            | 22,856        | 19            |\n| 251-500      | 6,503         | 5             | 9,618         | 8             |\n| 501-         | 5,255         | 4             | 5,877         | 5             |\n| Total        | 119,399       | 100           | 118,417       | 100           |\n\n## Loans to household customers\n\nIn 2023 lending to household customers remained at EUR 28bn (EUR 28bn).

Loan allowances for 2023 were EUR 1,259m (1,264m). This was driven by stage 3 write-offs in the Shipping and Oil, gas and offshore portfolios after concluded work-outs. Of loan allowances to the public, stage 1 accounted for EUR 129m (140m), stage 2 for EUR 298m (EUR 296m) and stage 3 for EUR 826m (EUR 827). The coverage ratio was 0.07% for stage 1 (0.07%), 4.1% for stage 2 (5.3%) and 48% for stage 3 (52%).\n\n## Net loan losses\n\nNet loan losses amounted to EUR 119m (up from EUR -9m in 2022), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 9bp. Including fair value gains of EUR 9m, net loan losses and similar net result amounted to EUR 110m corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 7bp. Net loan losses were driven by the corporate portfolio, which saw net loan losses of EUR 70m mainly related to the Real estate, Consumer discretionary and services and Industrials sectors. The household portfolio had net loan losses of EUR 49m mainly driven by Finland and Sweden.\n\nManagement judgements was reduced by EUR 62m during the year, from EUR 442m to EUR 380m. The cyclical management judgement was EUR 329m at the end of the year, down from EUR 338m and was assessed to be at an appropriate level. The structural management judgement allowances of EUR 51m cover the known IFRS 9 model and data issues to be captured in later model updates. The total allowance at the end of 2023, compared to the end of 2022, was reduced by EUR 53m following the transfer of allowances for aged non-performing retail loans to the model-calculated collective provisions and implementing the corresponding capital deductions for aged non-performing corporate loans. This resulted in shifts between modelled allowances, structural management judgement allowances and capital deductions, without any impact on the actual level of coverage.\n\n## Net loan losses and loan loss ratios\n\n|                                                              |   2023 |   2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net loan losses, EURm                                        |   -119 |      9 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, amortised cost, bp                      |      9 |     -1 |\n| - of which stage 3                                           |     11 |     -1 |\n| - of which stages 1 and 2                                    |     -2 |      0 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, including fair value gains, bp 1        |      7 |     -1 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Personal Banking, bp 1                  |     27 |    -15 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Business Banking, bp 1                  |     13 |      7 |\n| Net loan loss ratio, Large Corporates   & Institutions, bp 1 |     -1 |     -2 |",

The payment would be distributed based on the annual accounts to be adopted for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and the authorisation would remain in force until the beginning of the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe dividend would be paid from retained earnings. After a maximum dividend payout of EUR 3,239,688,285.20 corresponding to 66% of the net profit of the year, EUR 14,615,332,238.78 would be carried forward as distributable retained earnings.\n\nIn the opinion of the Board of Directors, the proposed distribution of earnings does not risk the solvency of Nordea Bank Abp.

In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 200 million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | 0.65% of equity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Rationale for the materiality benchmark  applied | We chose equity as the benchmark because, in our view, it is  the benchmark against which the capital resources of the bank  are most commonly measured by users and is a generally  accepted benchmark. We chose 0.65% which is within the  range of acceptable quantitative materiality thresholds in |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the Nordea Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\n\nWe determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or by component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instructions. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we issued specific instructions to reporting component auditors which included our risk analysis, materiality and audit approach to centralised systems. Audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets and liabilities of the Group.\n\nBy performing the procedures above at group companies, combined with additional procedures at the group level, we have obtained sufficient and appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the Group as a whole to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "Strategic report\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matter in the audit of the Group\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Impairment of loans to customers\n\nRefers to Note G1 - Accounting policies (Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty), Note G2.10 - Net loan losses and Note G3.8 - Loans to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nA high level of judgement is involved in determining the appropriate impairment loss to be recognised. For individually assessed loans, judgement is involved in determining whether a loan has a loss event and in assessing the loan loss amount.\n\nExpected credit losses (ECL) are calculated as a function of the probability of default, the exposure at default and the loss given default as well as the timing of the loss.\n\nNordea categorises loans into three stages depending on the level of credit risk or changes in credit risk for each individual loan. For loans without a significant increase in credit risk, stage 1, expected credit losses are calculated for estimated defaults within 12 months. For loans where there is a significant increase in credit risk, stage 2, or loans in default, stage 3, the calculation is based on the lifetime of expected losses.\n\nThe current macroeconomic situation, including high inflation, increasing energy prices, higher interest rates and lower global growth, has impacted management's determination of the ECL. To address the uncertainties inherent in the current and future environment and to reflect all relevant risk factors not captured in Nordea's modelled results, management developed post-model adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, Nordea uses adjustments to the model-driven ECL results to address impairment model limitations.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nOur audit included a combination of testing of internal controls over financial reporting and substantive testing.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the loan origination process, credit risk management and the impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers.\n\nWe had a special focus on post-model adjustments developed by management and the credit risk development for large customers.\n\nBased on risk, we selected individual loans and performed detailed credit file reviews and assessed their credit risk.\n\nWe assessed the design and effectiveness of governance and controls over the estimation of ECL.\n\nFor ECL models, we involved our modelling specialists to assess the methodology, challenge the underlying assumptions and to independently reperform the calculation for a sample of loans.\n\nWe have evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions and accuracy of underlying data used to develop post-model adjustments and reviewed that governance procedures have been performed.\n\nWe have also assessed the disclosures related to impairment of loans.",

        "page_content": "## Valuation of certain Level II and III financial instruments held at fair value\n\nRefers to Note G1 - Accounting policies (Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty), Note G2.5 - Total net result from items at fair value, Note G3.3 - Classification and measurement, Note G3.4 - Fair value, Note G3.6 - Hedge accounting and Note G3.12 - Derivatives.\n\nHeightened geopolitical tensions and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty while confirming the trend of improving financial conditions continue to be a key theme across major markets. The challenging valuation environment emphasises the importance of robust valuation and reporting controls and the valuation of financial instruments continues to be an area of inherent risk.\n\nThe valuation of Level II and III financial instruments utilises observable and unobservable inputs, respectively, for recurring fair value measurements.\n\nSignificant portfolios of financial instruments are valued based on models and certain assumptions that are not observable by third parties.\n\nImportant areas in the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 framework and policies relating to models and valuation\n- \u00b7 internal controls relating to fair value adjustments, price testing, fair value hierarchy and model control and governance\n- \u00b7 disclosures of financial instruments.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions related to the Life business\n\nRefer to Note G1 - Accounting policies (Critical judgements and estimation uncertainty) and Note G4 Insurance contract liabilities to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nTechnical provisions involve subjective judgements over uncertain future outcomes. The value is based on models where significant judgement is applied in setting economic assumptions, actuarial assumptions as well as customer behaviour. Changes in these assumptions can materially impact the valuation of technical provisions.\n\nWe assessed and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 the identification, measurement and oversight of the valuation of financial instruments\n- \u00b7 fair value adjustments, independent price verification and the fair value hierarchy\n- \u00b7 model control and governance.\n\nWe examined the Group's independent price verification processes, model validation and approval processes, controls over data feeds and inputs to valuation and the fair value hierarchy and the Group's governance and reporting processes and controls.\n\nFor the valuations dependent on unobservable inputs or which involve a higher degree of judgement, we assessed the assumptions, methodologies and models used by the Group. We performed an independent valuation of a sample of positions, including fair value hierarchy testing.\n\nIn respect of fair value adjustments, specifically credit, debt and funding fair value adjustments (CVA, DVA and FFVA) for derivatives, we assessed the methodology applied, underlying models and assumptions made by the Group and compared it with our knowledge of current industry practice. We tested the controls over the data inputs to the underlying models and on a sample basis tested underlying transactions back to supporting evidence.\n\nWe have also assessed the disclosures related to the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value.\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the process for calculating provisions within the Life business.\n\nOur audit also included assessments of applied methods, models and assumptions used in calculating the provisions. We have on a sample basis performed recalculations of the provisions. The audit was carried out involving PwC actuaries.\n\n## IT systems supporting processes for financial reporting\n\nDue to the significant number of transactions that are processed, the Group's financial reporting is highly dependent on IT systems supporting automated accounting and reconciliation procedures. To ensure complete and accurate financial records, it is important that controls over appropriate access rights, program development and changes are designed properly and operate effectively.\n\nThis is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nWe have tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls related to the IT systems relevant for financial reporting. Our assessment included access to programs and data as well as program development and changes.\n\nFor logical access to programs and data, audit activities included testing of the addition of access rights, the removal of access rights and the monitoring of appropriateness as well as the appropriate segregation of duties. Other areas tested included monitoring of IT systems and controls over changes to IT systems.",

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

Definitions of our four strategic pillars are presented below. In the Sustainability notes, we present our sustainability disclosures through these four strategic pillars.\n\nUnder each pillar, we have identified relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals and specific sustainability-related matters that impact us or that we can have a significant impact on -  by reducing the negative impact or increasing the positive impact through our financing, investments and internal operations. We have set measurable long-term and medium-term objectives and 2023-2025 targets to support a more sustainable future for each of the strategic pillars. All of these sustainability targets and their progress are presented in the respective sections within the Sustainability notes.\n\nIn Note S2 \"Financial strength\" we describe how we integrate ESG in our credit and investment decisions. In this section we also cover our ESG-related product and service offerings, our active engagement practices as well as how sustainability is integrated into our funding and liquidity strategy.\n\nIn Note S3 \"Climate and Environment\" our climate action agenda is described in detail. This includes all our climate targets on Group, portfolio and sector level. Additionally, we expand our biodiversity and nature-related as well as financed emissions disclosures. In Note S4 \"Social responsibility\" we explain how human rights, labour right, employment conditions, gender equality and education are considered in our operations and value chain.\n\nIn Note S5 \"Governance and culture\" we cover our sustainability governance. This note includes descriptions of our Code of Conduct, our practices related to financial crime prevention, anti-bribery and corruption, cyber security, data privacy and sustainable procurement. This year we also expanded our tax-related disclosures to cover our total tax contribution.\n\nIn Note S6 \"Materiality and impact analysis\", Note S7 \"Our stakeholders\" and Note \"S8 Position statements and guidelines\", we provide supplementary information to support the understanding of our sustainability approach and disclosures.\n\n## Sustainability disclosures\n\nWe have reported on environmental and sustainability performance on an annual basis since 2002. Our sustainability reporting in the Annual Report for 2023 constitutes sustainability disclosures found: (i) in the Sustainability at the core chapter on pages 16-17, (ii) in the Non-financial statement (incl. our EU taxonomy reporting) on pages 84-98, (iii) in the Corporate Governance Statement 2023 on pages 61, (iv) in Note G11 \"Risk and liquidity management' on pages 241-242 and (v) in the Sustainability notes on pages 329-380, which provide in-depth information and data related to the sustainability disclosures. In addition, indices referring to our reporting in relation to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) are published as a separate appendix available at nordea.com/sustainability.\n\n## Sustainability at the core\n\nActively engaging to drive transition and capture growth opportunities\n\n## Financial strength\n\nUnderstanding and managing  environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities is crucial to maintaining our financial strength and strong capital position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social responsibility\n\nBy considering human and labour rights throughout our value chain and promoting  gender equality, fair employment conditions and education we aim to create social impact where it matters the most.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate and environmental action\n\nTo become a net-zero emissions bank by 2050 at the latest, we are engaging with and supporting our customers and portfolio companies in reducing their climate impact, while reducing our own.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance and culture\n\nStrong governance and a healthy corporate c ulture will lead to the successful execution of our strategic sustainability agenda for a greater good.",

As ESG factors can have both negative and positive impacts on Nordea, our customers and business environment, they can be used to identify risks as well as opportunities. Therefore, we integrate ESG factors into risk management processes for both our lending and investment portfolios. We manage our ESG-related risks so that our financial strength and position is well supported and our ability to raise the funding we need at competitive prices is maintained. Financial strength is therefore fundamental for our sustainability strategy and our commitment to service customers.\n\nWe develop and supply financial products supporting sustainable practices through our ESG-related offering, where active engagement with customers and investees is a key enabler of our sustainability strategy and targets. These ESG-related offerings allow us to incorporate sustainability into our funding and liquidity strategy, via our sustainability-related funding activities.\n\n## ESG-related risk strategy and management\n\nESG factors can be significant drivers of credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. The principle of embedding ESG factors into risk management and business strategy is based on the importance of each factor as a driver of existing risks. We use qualitative and quantitative measures for the risk identification and materiality assessment of ESG-related risks. We subsequently develop monitoring, mitigation and management strategies for the identified material risk. Where relevant, we assess the potential need for capitalisation while accounting for good practices and regulatory guidance.\n\n## ESG-related risk assessments impacting our customers and balance sheet\n\nAs a key principle of effective risk management, we maintain a diversified lending portfolio, distributed between corporate and household customers and diversified across geographies, industries and products. For all impacted financial risk categories, existing processes are progressively being enhanced to identify, evaluate and monitor material ESG-related risks. Process enhancements for all risk categories will continue in 2024 as part of our multi-year ESG Programme to align with the regulatory supervisor's expectations on climate-related and environmental risk management. We provide a detailed\n\ndescription of existing processes in the Capital and Risk Management Report available at nordea.com.\n\nESG assessments are performed for both lending and investment portfolios on Nordea's balance sheet to identify, evaluate and monitor material ESG-related risks.\n\nNordea continues to redevelop aspects of the credit customer ESG assessment process to systematically integrate ESG-related considerations in the credit process. For corporate borrowers ESG assessments are performed according to the size and type of the transaction and the customer's internal segmentation. ESG assessments are performed on new customers, in ordinary reviews of existing customers, and when the ESG-related risk(s) or credit exposures to existing customers significantly change. ESG-related risks identified qualitatively as material at customer level inform the credit risk assessment, with conclusions on the customer group's risk level included to the credit memorandum. The purpose of the assessments is to conclude on ESG-related risk components relevant to credit customers' repayment capacity. Approvals are made according to the established credit decision-making process. For customers associated with a high level of ESG-related risks, decisions are escalated to higher-level credit committees where relevant.\n\n2023 saw the further development of ESG risk management at the level of individual corporate customers. ESG credit risk definitions were established which form the basis for identifying ESG risks in the credit process. The ambition is to screen corporate customers for whom individual ESG risks could materially impact their credit risk. This will be accomplished by a semi-automated tool supplemented by human oversight, to flag customers that require enhanced ESG assessments by dedicated ESG analysts with focus on identifying and assessing their vulnerability and resilience towards material ESG issues. To support these analyses, external databases are used to assess performance on specific ESG-related risks and to assess if the company has been, or is, involved in ESG-related controversies.\n\nClimate-related transition risks are assessed with an enhanced focus for larger customers. The key components of the assessment include counterparties' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity developments, the corresponding quality of their transition planning, and the resulting impact of climate- related transition and physical risks on customer repayment capacity. This analysis is aligned with the Group targets on financed GHG emissions reductions and transition plan coverage.",

The process includes e.g. ensuring that sufficient policies and programmes are in place to reduce potential harmful impacts on the environment, communities and indigenous rights.\n\nESG-related considerations in the credit process are further guided by our internal industry credit policies, which can include ESG-related exclusion criteria for exposure to harmful or controversial economic activities, and requirements on engagement and monitoring of climate-related transition plans.\n\nIn addition to these processes, where relevant, we carry out an environmental and social impact assessment when financing certain large infrastructure and industrial projects, as part of our commitment to the Equator Principles. We also follow applicable valuation standards and regulatory requirements, which includes taking ESG factors into account in applying market values for collateralised real estate assets, when available or relevant.\n\nNordea's loan pricing frameworks reflect strategic choices in Nordea's business selection and risk appetite, including established targets for risk-adjusted returns on allocated credit risk capital. Our approach is to integrate ESG factors into existing pricing components, like credit risk (as a key driver), profitability, business strategy, risk appetite or any other pricing considerations.\n\nESG factors affect business selection decisions be it through established sector targets, sector guidelines or decisions on individual credits risk. These strategic choices are also reflected in the capital allocation and pricing decisions, as ESG factors may also affect risk-based pricing. ESG factors can also be reflected in the margin of certain sustainable lending products, such as green loans and sustainability-linked loans where the margin is tied to the financed assets or the customer's ESG performance.\n\nFor mortgage borrowers, the main ESG-related risks relate to collateral energy efficiency and physical hazard exposures. In 2023 we continued to improve understanding of our mortgage portfolio's energy efficiency and physical risk exposure through data improvements.\n\nFor the long-term illiquid asset portfolio, ESG and impact principles guiding investment decisions include the introduction of concrete ESG criteria, which fund managers seeking to secure investments from Nordea are expected to either satisfy at the outset or strive to satisfy as soon as practically possible. The principles also include the requirement to monitor the progress of the ESG performance of the portfolio, with plans to develop KPIs for stronger performance tracking and reporting. For further details, see our Capital and Risk Management Report available at nordea.com.\n\nBeyond monitoring and managing these potential risks at counterparty level, we also monitor ESG-related risks at portfolio, product and sector levels through deep dives and our risk appetite framework. Through these activities we assess exposure to any vulnerable or potentially harmful economic activities and manage our balance sheet according to the related aspects of our business strategy. For further information on these activities, see our Capital and Risk Management Report available at nordea.com.\n\n## Business environment scanning related to climate and environmental driven changes\n\nWe aim to continuously improve the scanning of our business environment with regard to impacts of climate and environmentally driven changes at global, European and Nordic levels. Business environment scanning covers large corporations and institutions, business banking and personal banking operations, focuses on sectors that are most material to us,\n\nand includes consideration of climate and environmental physical and transition risks.\n\nThe business environment is defined as including explicit consideration of the macroeconomy, the competitive landscape, policy and regulatory trends, technological trends and societal/demographic developments which shape business conditions at industry and geographical levels and related to the products and services that we are active in or are considering becoming active in. We have established a team of dedicated sector experts and established a process to integrate the insights on opportunities and risks into relevant risk management and strategy processes.\n\n## Integrating ESG-related risks into investment decisions in our asset management business\n\nIn order to ensure that investment decisions are based on comprehensive information, we seek to integrate ESG factors into our investment analysis. Since ESG factors can have both a negative and a positive impact on our portfolio companies and their business environment, they can be used to identify sustainability risk as well as investment opportunities.\n\nESG-related risk considerations are integrated into our investment decision-making framework as part of the overall risk assessment. This assessment, based inter alia on quantitative and qualitative ESG information, allows for a robust identification of ESG-related risks. We identify ESG-related risks by considering ESG factors in the investment process and by assessing the materiality of the potentially negative impact of these ESG factors on the value of the investment. In addition to the integration of  climate-related risks, we include risks related to social factors as well as governance-related risks in our considerations.\n\nThe integration of ESG-related risk considerations into our investment decision-making process may differ between our investment teams as the relevance, availability of information and time horizon of ESG-related risks will vary depending on the characteristics of the investment product, including asset class, investment strategy, customer objectives and market trends.\n\nESG-related risks are considered in the investment decision-making process together with traditional investment risks (e.g. market, credit or liquidity risk). ESG-related risks may have a significant impact on traditional investment risks and be a factor that contributes to their materiality. The identification, evaluation and consideration of ESG-related risks in the investment decision-making process are done in accordance with the characteristics of the investment strategy and may result in a range of actions, including but not limited to: not investing, divesting, engaging or excluding.\n\n## Managing climate-related risks in investment portfolios\n\nFulfilling our mission to deliver returns responsibly requires us to manage the exposure to climate-related risks in our investment portfolios. We assess material climate-related risks and opportunities across asset classes using a range of tools and data sets. For listed equity and corporate bond exposures, we use the MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk (Climate VaR) model to assess transition risks and physical risks under different  climate scenarios.\n\nIn addition, we conduct climate alignment analysis for individual issuers to establish the extent to which a company's strategy and decarbonisation trajectory support the achievement of a desirable target scenario.\n\nInvestment teams in Nordea Asset Management (NAM) have access to a proprietary ESG data platform, allowing them to integrate climate-related analyses into the investment research process, and portfolio managers regularly receive portfolio risk reports, which include climate dash-",

Monitoring of key metrics and elevated risk areas is conducted regularly, and a climate risk report is provided to NLP's Board of Directors and Sustainability Committee regularly.\n\n## Assessing transition and physical risks in investments\n\nIn both NAM and NLP, the MSCI Climate VaR tool is used for listed equities and corporate bonds to assess climate risk across a number of plausible climate change scenarios. Our choice of scenarios includes three scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System.\n\nThe first one is the Divergent Net Zero scenario where emissions are reduced in line with at least a 50% probability of limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century. Net zero is achieved by 2050 but at higher costs due to divergent policies introduced across sectors and a quicker phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nThe second one is the below 2\u00b0C scenario where the stringency of climate policies is increased gradually, resulting in a 67% probability of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C.\n\nThe third one is the 3\u00b0C NDC scenario, where nationally determined contributions (NDCs) represent a pathway in which climate-related policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but global efforts are not ambitious enough to stop global warming. The transition risk is low, but physical risks are high in this 'hothouse' scenario.\n\nFor each of these scenarios, climate risk can be assessed using three distinct climate metrics: policy risk, technology opportunities and physical risk. Policy risk refers to the investment value at risk due to the future climate policy. Technology opportunities represent the investment upside due to low carbon technology revenues, which, combined with policy risk, gives us net transition risk. Physical risk refers to the investment value at risk materialising from climate-related acute events and chronic changes, such as extreme heat and cold, rainfall, flooding and tropical cyclones.\n\nThe MSCI Climate VaR model is used for listed equities and corporate bonds in both NAM and NLP to assess transition risks (policy risk) and physical risks (extreme weather risk) in different climate scenarios. In addition, NLP uses the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor to assess transition risk in its directly held real estate portfolio. For sovereign bonds, NLP notes a positive trend in the increased availability of carbon accounting methodologies and required data. For illiquid asset classes, retrieving sufficient data remains a challenge.\n\n|                              | Divergent Net Zero   | Divergent Net Zero            | Divergent Net Zero   | Below 2.0\u00b0C      | Below 2.0\u00b0C                   | Below 2.0\u00b0C        | 3.0\u00b0C NDCs       | 3.0\u00b0C NDCs                    | 3.0\u00b0C NDCs         |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Climate VaR as of end 2023 1 | Policy risk  (%)     | Techno logy  opportunity  (%) | Physical risk  (%)   | Policy risk  (%) | Techno logy  opportunity  (%) | Physical risk  (%) | Policy risk  (%) | Techno logy  opportunity  (%) | Physical risk  (%) |\n| Nordea Asset Management      |                      |                               |                      |                  |                               |                    |                  |                               |                    |\n| Listed equities (%)          | -11.2                | 2.4                           | -1.4                 | -2.1             | 0.4                           | -2.0               | -1.5             | 0.2                           | -2.9               |\n| Corporate bonds (%)          | -1.4                 | 0.0                           | -0.4                 | -0.1             | 0.0                           | -0.6               | -0.1             | 0.0                           | -1.0               |\n| Nordea Life & Pension        |                      |                               |                      |                  |                               |                    |                  |                               |                    |\n| Listed equities (%)          | -10.2                | 2.7                           | -1.4                 | -2.0             | 0.5                           | -2.0               | -1.4             | 0.3                           | -3.0               |\n| Corporate bonds (%)          | -3.5                 | 0.1                           | -1.2                 | -0.2             | 0.0                           | -1.9               | -0.2             | 0.0                           | -2.9               |\n\n## ESG-related opportunities\n\nOver the past couple of years we have seen a significant increase in the demand for our sustainability offering, accelerated by customer demand and the growing strength of our product range, guidance and engagement. With our experience with sustainability-linked and green lending, ESG-focused investment products as well as active ownership, we are well placed to accelerate our customers' and investee companies' transition to a sustainable future. Within all of these areas, we aspire to be a leading voice.\n\n## Sustainable financing\n\nWe offer a range of sustainable financing solutions that broadly cover transition financing and the financing of sustainable activities and projects. Our offering includes lending products, such as green loans and sustainability-linked loans, as well as facilitating our customers' access to capital markets financing, such as green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds. Additionally, we have, together with the European Investment Fund, introduced a new range of guaranteed loans under the InvestEU Programme for small and medium-sized enterprises to accelerate the transition to a green and sustainable economy.\n\nOur green financing offerings follow the criteria of the Nordea Green Funding Framework. Sustainable financing adheres to, and takes into account, Nordea's sector policies\n\nand guidelines. Our customer relationship teams and debt product specialists are supported by our dedicated Sustainable Finance Advisory team as we tailor sustainable finance solutions to align with our customers' sustainability objectives and material ESG factors. With these offerings, we are able to link our financing to our customers' ESG objectives and align with relevant sustainable financing criteria.\n\nSustainability-linked loans are a type of lending arrangement where the company's borrowing costs are tied to its progress in meeting certain set and measurable annual sustainability targets. In addition to offering sustainability-linked loans to our customers, we help customers select the right targets for their specific situation.\n\nWe also continue supporting our household customers' transition by offering financial advice, combined with our sustainable product offering. We offer homeowners green mortgages and energy efficiency loans. In addition, we offer specifically tailored loans for electric vehicles, to support the transition to less emission intensive transport modes.\n\nDuring 2023, we have strengthened our internal rules for responsible product development ensuring regulatory compliance and mitigation of reputational risks. The responsible product guideline is built on several frameworks, both Nordea specific, internal and external, and regulatory, guiding and contributing with standards for the development of our responsible products.

Global Finance named Nordea the winner of its 2023 Sustainable Finance Awards in Denmark, Finland and Norway, and Transition/Sustainability-Linked Loans Western Europe in recognition of our outstanding leadership position.\n\nDuring 2023 we helped facilitate EUR 77bn of sustainable financing, predominantly for our large corporate and institutional customers. We facilitated 127 green, sustainable, sustainability-linked, and social bond transactions, Together with the green and sustainability-linked loans, this puts us on track to meet our 2025 target to facilitate more than EUR 200bn of sustainable financing.\n\nWe continue to invest in our sustainable platform to provide a leading lending and bond offering. Throughout 2023 we have increased our advisory capacity and ensured that the Sustainable Finance Advisory team is locally present throughout the Nordics.\n\n## Corporate sustainable finance league tables 2023\n\n## Bonds\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Loans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting SMEs with carbon accounting\n\nAs larger companies are, through the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), expected to disclose supply chain emissions (scope 3), SMEs are increasingly requested to disclose emissions as well. When it comes to measuring and reporting on emissions and creating credible transition plans, SMEs are naturally less mature. This is why we launched a partnership with Normative, a global company with headquarters in Stockholm, which has specialised in carbon accounting since 2014. With Normative's Business Carbon Calculator, our customers can measure their carbon footprint and report reduction progress to value chain stakeholders, such as customers or investors.\n\n## Net-Zero Commitment Loan\n\nTo cater for our SME customers' need for transition financing, we are piloting a new Net-Zero Commitment Loan for customers publicly committing to net zero through the SME Climate  Hub.  Nordea is a frontrunner in offering this solution and we hope it will encourage even more customers to commit to climate transition and net zero.\n\n## Strengthening frontline ESG capabilities\n\nKnowledge, data and systems are key enablers to our sustainability objectives. Therefore, we have launched an internal sustainability training programme with a bespoke curriculum to build our employees' competence and knowledge, so they can best support customers in their transition to a low-carbon economy. We have also invested in enhancing internal processes and tools to support our offering to customers and the expected continued growth while at the same time ensuring the integrity of our offering. We have introduced new business intelligence tools for our frontline to get a firm picture of our customers' GHG emissions transition plans, including, for example, trajectories and alignment to Nordea's sector targets. We have initiated a new governance structure for financed emissions and profitability, enabling a closer link between return and climate-related risks.\n\nWe continue to invest in technology tools that will support climate data for analysis, the setting of KPIs related to our sustainability-linked products and revisions to our sustainability-linked and green lending processes. The development of our internal sustainability platforms and business intelligence tools will continue in 2024.\n\n## Total facilitation of sustainable financing 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur target is to facilitate more than EUR 200bn of sustainable financing by 2025.

The company aims to lead the way by becoming a low-carbon, circular, inclusive and fair business.\n\nTo that end, Pandora broke new ground in 2023 when it issued an inaugural 500m euro sustainability-linked bond, tying its financing to its climate and circularity goals. Nordea played a pivotal role as the sole sustainability structuring advisor, helping Pandora formulate its sustainability-linked bond framework and select ambitious sustainability targets.\n\nThe bond is linked to Pandora's commitments to purchase 100% recycled silver and gold for use in its jewellery by 2025, to become carbon neutral in its own operations by 2025 and to reduce its scope 3 emissions in line with its validated Science-based target. The targets are aligned with Pandora's core business and were assessed by Moody's to have a 'high contribution' to sustainability. To underscore Pandora's commitment to achieving its goals, the structure's financial penalties for missed targets exceed market averages.\n\n'Pandora has integrated sustainability across the business, so it is only natural that the company's financing be sustainability-linked. The ambitious nature of our targets is a testament to our desire to lead the jewellery industry forward on this most important topic,' says Marissa Saretsky, VP of Global Sustainability at Pandora.\n\nIn March 2023, Pandora announced the successful placement of 500m euros in senior unsecured sustainability-linked notes under the framework - a significant milestone under the company's newly established Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) program.\n\nThe sustainability-linked bond marks the third time Pandora has tied its financing to ambitious sustainability targets, highlighting the company's dedication to advancing its sustainability agenda, with Nordea by its side.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial strength, cont.\n\n## ESG-focused investment offering\n\nAs the largest financial services group in the Nordics, we have a significant impact through our advice and products, supporting our customers in making more sustainable investment choices. Individual customers, together as a collective, can contribute with their investments while making a good risk-adjusted return on their capital in line with market returns in the long term.\n\nIn 2023 we launched an array of initiatives to help our customers make more informed investment decisions in terms of sustainability. We also increased and improved our product offerings. For example, we:\n\n- \u00b7 launched more detailed ESG information about funds in our digital channels\n- \u00b7 started assessing the sustainability level of selected individual equities and incorporated that into the investment advice process\n- \u00b7 released a publication on how ESG risks affect investments\n- \u00b7 added new funds to our advisory offering - a social bond fund and a biodiversity fund\n- \u00b7 tightened and added additional thresholds to the criteria for our sustainability-focused product offering\n- \u00b7 expanded our sustainability-focused discretionary solution to Swedish retail customers.\n\nNordea Sustainable Selection (previously Sustainable Choice) is Nordea's framework for assessing and selecting investment products based on Nordea's rigorous ESG criteria. Both the provider of the product and the product itself need to pass our assessment. To drive real change, we believe that sustainability needs to be integrated into the core business of all product providers. Therefore, we, among other things, evaluate our selected product providers' commitments, resources and focus on collaborative engagements across their assets. When assessing products for Nordea Sustainable Selection, we emphasise current financial and sustainability performance as well as long-term strategy and intentions. For example, we look for products with proper integration of ESG risks and opportunities in the investment decision-making process, a strong active ownership approach and a commitment to invest in companies that contribute positively to the environment and to society. Products also need to apply exclusionary criteria to tobacco, gambling, weapons and other controversial sectors.\n\nWe have set a target for gross flows to Nordea Sustainable Selection funds at 33% of total flows by 2025 as a means to contribute to the Nordea climate targets to reduce emissions in our investment portfolio by 40-50% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels. By the end of 2023 the share of gross flows to Nordea Sustainable Selection reached 22%.\n\nWe categorise all our savings and investment customers according to their sustainability profile and preference, as we do for return targets and risk tolerance, to be able to recommend the most suitable product for the individual customer. Our Nordea Sustainable Selection products are primarily recommended to customers with sustainability preferences. These customers find it important to consider the positive contribution of their investments to the environment and society, and to reduce negative impacts. During 2023 we assessed our customers' sustainability preferences 370 000 times where in 4 out of 10 cases, or 43%, the customer expressed that they have sustainability preferences. We started asking customers about whether they were interested in considering sustainability in their investments already back in 2019 and have had over two million dialogues since then. Hence, we supported our customers in making more sustainable investment choices several years before it became a regulatory requirement in 2022.\n\nWe offer a variety of investment products focusing on sustainability. Identifying the sustainability level of a product can be complex, but Nordea Sustainable Selection can help our customers identify products with a credible sustainability strategy. The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) also classifies products in categories where Article 9 funds have sustainability as their objective and Article 8 funds promote environmental and social objectives. Nordea Sustainable Selection includes products from both categories. As Article 8 includes a very wide range of products with varying sustainability ambitions, the SFDR classification alone is not enough for products to be included in Nordea Sustainable Selection. Our offering of sustainability-focused products will continue to develop and grow as the market matures and we strive to meet new customer demands.\n\n| Investments                                                                                          | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| AuM - SFDR article 9 products  (products with sustainable invest- ment as objective)                 |         |         |         |\n| AuM in EURm                                                                                          | 13,113  | 13,622  | 14,568  |\n| Share in relation to total AuM at  Nordea Asset Management (%)                                       | 5.2     | 5.7     | 5.0     |\n| AuM - SFDR article 8 products  (products that promote environ- mental and/or social characteristics) |         |         |         |\n| AuM in EURm 1                                                                                        | 160,860 | 143,732 | 180,007 |\n| Share in relation to total AuM at  Nordea Asset Management (%)                                       | 64.1    | 60.2    | 61.5    |\n| AuM in Nordea Sustainable Selec- tion products                                                       |         |         |         |\n| AuM in EURm                                                                                          | 60,290  | 51,728  | 59,048  |\n| Share in relation to total AuM at  Nordea Asset Management (%)                                       | 24.0    | 21.7    | 20.2    |\n\n## Active engagement\n\nWe continually engage with customers and investee companies to understand the sustainability challenges and opportunities they face in their business environments. This enables us to address material sustainability risks and concretely put to action our sustainability related commitments. Our approach prioritises dialogue over disengagement.\n\n## Engagements with our customers\n\nWe engage with our Personal Banking customers via our advisory and digital channels. Our advice is centred around financial well-being and increasingly touches on sustainability. This is enabled by our advisers' increasing understanding of sustainability from completing training programmes. Our digital channels promote sustainable choices and their benefits, for example benefits of renovating homes, and provide links to further insights, for example government subsidies. In addition, we regularly organise webinars on home renovation to inspire our customers to transition.\n\nWe also take collective action by engaging in external activities. One example is the recently completed Nordic Energy Efficient Mortgage (NEEM) Hub research programme funded by the EU. The aim of the programme is to identify how best to support homeowners' transition, for example by identifying barriers and solutions.\n\nEngaging with our corporate customers enables us to address and understand material sustainability risks and opportunities, and concretely put to action our commitment",

We believe that this structured approach to understanding our customers and engaging with them can help us proactively drive business and sustainability in the same direction.\n\nOur engagement, with the companies we finance, combines the expertise of our corporate advisers, Sustainable Finance Advisory team, ESG experts and analysts to shape a customer engagement. In 2023, we engaged with mid-corporate customers to increase our understanding of their progress in climate transition planning. We saw an increase from estimated 58% in 2022 to estimated 70% in 2023 of large corporate customers exposure in climate-vulnerable sectors now covered by transition plans, which is considered a strong progress towards our 2025 target of 90%. Through client dialogues we hope to encourage more clients to start formulating transition plans and progress on their climate transition planning.\n\nWe also take collective action by engaging in external activities through for instance Bankinitiativet H\u00e5llbar Byggbransch in Sweden, the Poseidon Principles and the Responsible Ship Recycling Standards.\n\n## Active ownership\n\nEngaging with our investee companies enables us to address material sustainability risks and opportunities. Our engagement activities combine the perspectives of the portfolio managers, the financial analysts and the ESG experts to form a holistic opinion and establish coherent engagement objectives. Portfolio managers actively participate in engagement activities together with our ESG analysts. Engagements often\n\nDuring 2023 43% of  advised customers expressed that they have sustainability preferences\n\nCustomers' preferences were addressed 370 000 times where in 160 000 cases the customer expressed a preference to consider their investments' negative or positive impact to the environment and society.\n\nrun over several years and are carried out either by NAM alone or in collaboration with other institutional investors.\n\nDuring the engagement period, we conduct regular meetings with the company in question and track progress against predefined engagement objectives. Engagement may entail a dialogue with the company's executive bodies, influence on board composition, cooperation with other investors on joint voting at annual general meetings and keeping a strict eye on the company in general. The dialogue allows us to put forward our expectations on corporate behaviour and to support companies in enhancing their sustainability performance. Progress reports and outcomes of the engagement are communicated to portfolio managers and financial analysts, allowing the information to be considered in investment decisions. In cases where an engagement relates to critical issues material to the specific investment case or the general investability of a company, failure to meet expectations will entail escalation of the issue through other stewardship activities, such as voting, and ultimately the consideration of quarantine or divestment.\n\nOur engagement activities typically fall into one or more of four different categories: investment-led engagement, normsand incident-based engagement, thematic engagement or political engagement. Each theme is closely aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and relevant ESG risks and has been selected and defined through close collaboration between ESG experts, portfolio managers, financial analysts and customers. In addition to engagements with companies, we are increasing our work in the sovereign engagement sphere.\n\nIn 2023 we engaged with 1,179 companies on environmental, social and governance issues. We estimate that this corresponds to 52% of the total number of the equity assets under management in NAM portfolios. We provide more information on our engagement activities in our Responsible Investments Report available at nordea.com.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our engagement with investee companies includes proxy voting in line with our Corporate Governance Principles. We exercise our right, on behalf of our customers, to promote sound corporate governance and protect shareholder interests in the companies in which our funds have invested capital through voting at shareholders' annual general meetings (AGMs). In 2023 we voted at around 3,700 general meetings and achieved a voting frequency of over 95% for our holdings. We show how we have voted in our voting portal at nordea.com.\n\n## Sustainable funding and our frameworks\n\nOur sustainability-related lending product offering allows us to also incorporate sustainability into our funding and liquidity strategy. The Nordea Green Funding Framework and the Sustainability-Linked Loan Funding Framework represent a further step in our efforts to integrate ESG and sustainability considerations into all our core operations. We believe that green bond and sustainable-linked loan financing creates transparency of the funds allocated to climate change mitigation and other environmentally beneficial uses. In 2023 we issued more than EUR 5bn in sustainable funding across six currencies, bringing our total outstanding sustainable issuance to above EUR 10bn.\n\nThe Nordea Green Funding Framework defines how we identify, select, verify and report the green assets financed by the proceeds of our green funding. It also establishes how we manage such proceeds. The framework is based on the Green Bond Principles published by the International Capital Markets Association. We review it annually and, where necessary, update and expand it as the Green Bond Principles and market practices evolve. We are committed to supporting the growth and integrity of the market for sustainable financing.\n\nWe have engaged the external provider ISS Corporate to verify the Nordea Green Funding Framework and our green bond assets. These are reviewed at asset level before being included in the green bond asset portfolio. Both the green assets recorded in the green covered bond registers and the green covered bond process follow a separate track in terms of verification. The second party opinion is publicly available on our website. Our aim is to engage ISS Corporate in an annual reverification where updates to the framework and new asset inclusions are verified.\n\nIn 2023 we timed the reverification for December and only made minor updates to the framework content. We strengthened the coupling of Nordea's green funding with our general sustainability direction by including updated information on targets, NZBA commitments and the initiated biodiversity work in the Nordea Green Funding Framework. We also aligned the Green Buildings asset category criteria with the green covered asset category criteria for buildings for increased clarity, by utilising EU taxonomy criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The green asset portfolio includes only green corporate loans verified on asset level by a second party opinion. The portfolios for green covered bonds includes green mortgage loans and reclassified mortgage assets fulfilling the green funding framework criteria.\n\nGreen bonds tend to have lower yields and attract stronger investor demand than conventional bonds. The cost of fund benefit or 'greenium' that Nordea receives for green bonds is transferred to the business areas on a quarterly basis.\n\nWith our Sustainability-linked loan funding framework, we look to advance the market for sustainable finance by providing an opportunity for investors to support companies that have set material and ambitious sustainability goals. An amount equal to the net proceeds issued under this framework is intended to be used specifically for sustainability-linked loans - as defined by the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles  published by the Loan Market Association, the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association - that are considered to meet certain criteria around materiality and ambitiousness and with a positive contribution to at least one of the impact objectives defined in this framework.\n\nOur Sustainability-linked loan funding framework is an innovative framework launched in 2022 and builds on the successful development of the use-of-proceeds bond market, such as green bonds, while also recognising the considerable developments seen in the sustainability-linked loan market. In 2023 we issued our first EUR benchmark bond on the back of the framework in addition to the previously issued bonds in local Nordic currencies.\n\nFor further information on the green bonds, sustainability-linked loans and bonds and the respective asset portfolios, see our Sustainable funding page available at nordea.com.\n\n## Deposits with climate focus\n\nDeposits with climate focus are the latest addition to our sustainability offering. They combine our sustainable lending and savings offerings and our sustainable funding frameworks and practices. A deposit with climate focus is a term deposit where funds are held for a fixed term and where an equivalent amount is intended to be invested and reinvested in the green bond asset categories according to the Nordea Green Funding Framework.\n\nWe provide our customers with a platform to invest their surplus cash balances in a way that contributes to eligible environmental projects within renewable energy, clean transport, pollution prevention and control, green buildings, sustainable water, wastewater management and other projects.\n\nDeposits with climate focus were launched as a pilot in September 2021  in Norway, with Nordea being the first large bank in the Nordics with this offering in the corporate market. After a successful pilot with positive feedback from the customers, the product was introduced to retail customers in Norway in April 2023 and also to corporate customers in Sweden in June 2023.\n\nA strong ESG performance is becoming an important KPI for companies in the Nordics where sustainability is a top priority for companies wanting to stay relevant in the future. As the next step in the expansion of our sustainable product offering to serve our customers, we are planning to launch deposits with climate focus to corporate customers in Denmark and Finland. Since the pilot launch in Norway, we have interacted with several hundreds of customers who have invested their surplus funds in the product. More than EUR 3bn in total has been invested in the product, and we see increasing customer demand.",

The summer was the hottest on record and the majority of the global population experienced extreme weather events causing significant disruption and economic losses all around the world. Therefore 2023 is a stark reminder of the urgency to decarbonise the global economy. According to the IPCC, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C degrees.\n\nGlobal climate action is speeding up in both public and private spheres. Countries' net zero targets cover 90% of the global economy and are increasingly backed by regulation and policies. The EU 2030 climate package was finalised in July and will set a new direction for the entire region on climate action. We've also seen a lot of companies set net zero targets and take action during the year.\n\nAccording to the IEA, the world was set to invest a record USD 1.8 trillion in clean energy in 2023. Solar energy was expected to have to attracted more capital than oil production for the first time ever in 2023. Both innovation and deployment of green technology are increasingly aligning with what\n\n## Climate targets\n\nGroup-wide 2050 long-term objective for the bank\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2) By the end of 2025\n\nis needed to be on track with net zero. For the first time, IEA projects that demand for coal, oil and natural gas will all peak before 2030, even without any new climate policies.\n\nThe past year was an important test for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, with the first global stocktake at the COP28 Climate Conference providing a comprehensive assessment of what still needs to be done. Success requires rapid and deep emissions reductions by all countries in all sectors during this decade.\n\nIn addition to the emerging global climate actions, there is an increasing recognition of the huge societal risks associated with the loss of biodiversity and nature degradation. The 2022 adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), sometimes referred to as the equivalent of a Paris Agreement for nature, brought a focus to the urgent need to take action across sectors.\n\nThe role of financial institutions is explicitly stated in the GBF: to substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources, mobilising at least USD 200 billion per year by 2030. The GBF proposes to stimulate investments in biodiversity, including through impact funds and other instru-",

Expectations are high also for transparent disclosures.\n\n## Our climate agenda\n\nAs the leading Nordic bank, we have the capacity to support the transition to net zero - via our customer offerings, through our lending and investment decisions and by reducing emissions from our internal operations and supply chain. Therefore, our business objective is to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain in terms of scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by the end of 2050 at the latest.\n\nAs we have made this long-term commitment to align our business to the goals of the Paris Agreement, we have set interim targets to reduce emissions by 2030 across both our lending and investment portfolios. These targets were set using scenarios and modelled pathways that align with the long-term trajectory to limit warming according to the Paris Agreement. These are normative scenarios showing what is\n\nrequired to limit warming to a certain level using a range of socio-economic and technological assumptions across different sectors of the economy. While these targets intend to help us reduce transitional risks in our portfolios and support the decarbonisation of the economy, we also acknowledge and recognise that there are strategic risks associated with rapidly decarbonising our portfolios if the broader economy is not decarbonising at the same rate. We are enhancing and further developing our monitoring of these risks and dependencies.\n\nAs a financial institution our largest challenge and impact come from scope 3 emissions from our investment and lending portfolios, so-called financed emissions. In 2023 these represented 99.9% of our total disclosed GHG footprint. Total scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions for 2023 can be seen in the figure on the next page.\n\nAdditionally, each business area has set individual climate-related targets and actions for 2023-2025 and 2030 that are monitored and reported regularly. See details of the business area targets in the table below.\n\nTo support the lending portfolio interim objective to reduce absolute financed emissions by 40-50% by 2030, we have\n\n## 2023 2025 and 2030 targets\n\n| Target                                                                                                                                                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reduce the weighted average  carbon intensity (WACI) of  listed equities and corporate  bonds by 50% before the end  of 2030 compared with a 2019  baseline | NAM has set a target to reduce the weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of listed equities and corporate bonds  by 50% before the end of 2030 compared with a 2019 baseline.

Climate and environment, cont.\n\nperformed climate risk sector-specific deep dives and set sector-specific targets in order to align with regional sector roadmaps and scientific pathways. The process and targets are discussed in more detail in the section \"Sector analysis and targets\" of this report.\n\nOur Group net zero transition plan will be reviewed and updated in 2024 and 2025, at a time when we expect data availability and data quality to have significantly increased. Several of our targets are already aligned, or closely aligned, with the requirements set out in the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As the SBTi is currently working on a Net-Zero Standard for the financial sector, which will replace the existing standard, potential validation of our climate targets through the SBTi will be assessed and considered once the new Net-Zero Standard is finalised.\n\nThe climate and environmental policy and the expectations towards us and our customers develop at a rapid pace. We acknowledge that keeping up with these expectations will require significant efforts from us, our customers and society. We engage with our peers, civil society and the public sector on climate action and the role of banks in transitioning the real economy towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient future. We also continue to play an active role in the international climate finance ecosystem, helping to further develop the ambition and standardisation of carbon accounting, target setting and net zero alignment across the financial industry.\n\n## Towards net zero\n\nWe have joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance, the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance and the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in order to establish common guidelines and work with peers on the roadmap towards net-zero emissions in the real economy as well as in our portfolios.\n\nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero recommends financial institutions to provide feedback and support to customers and portfolio companies as well as encourage net zero transition strategies. It is also in our interest for customers to have a gradual and predictable transition, which we can help support.\n\nWe offer to finance our customers' transition plans and help them become more mature. We have therefore developed and offer products and services such as sustainability-linked, green financing and other ESG-focused products. Find out more about our ESG offering in Note S2 'Financial Strength'.\n\n## Distribution of our total emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupporting and engaging with our customers is central to our climate strategy. We focus on developing products and solutions that both support their transition and enable us to increase the positive impact (financing sustainable activities) while decreasing the negative impact (financing the transition away from high-emitting activities). Through close dialogue, we encourage our customers to further develop and strengthen their transition plans. And we provide them with financing to enable their transition.\n\nIn order to build skills and a culture to support our customers' transition, we have developed a proprietary Nordea Climate Transition Handbook and a climate transition maturity ladder that we use for training customer-facing staff in Large Corporates & Institutions and Business Banking as well as staff in Procurement. Read more about the climate transition maturity ladder from the next page.\n\nAdditionally, we have regular internal training on topics such as net zero transition plans, sustainable finance, ESG data and the EU taxonomy. These trainings range from generalist trainings to external ESG analyst certification of selected client executives, analysts and sales staff.\n\nIntegrating climate assessment into the credit and investment processes is crucial to understanding and managing risks in our portfolios. This includes continuous updates to our sector guidelines, industry credit policies and responsible investment policies, which are described in more detail in Note S5 \"Governance and culture\".\n\nOur strategy is supported by Board and executive-level oversight and responsibilities, and in 2023 we further integrated climate-related targets applicable to remuneration. The variable pay or Profit Sharing Plan of all GLT members, senior leaders and other employees is now linked to climate-related goals in addition to financial targets.\n\nFor our lending portfolio, we have included targeted financed emissions development in regional policy frameworks and real customer level transition plans in our financial planning to ensure progress towards our lending portfolio targets for 2030 and 2050. Portfolio emissions and climate risk analysis have been performed in several areas to understand the portfolio footprint, resulting in actions to derisk and steer the balance sheet in the right direction. Between 2019 and 2023 we saw a 29% decrease in the lending portfolio financed emissions mainly due to volume reductions in shipping and animal husbandry as well as exit from offshore and Russia.\n\n## Financed emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1)  Investment portfolios is defined as the combination of Nordea Asset Management (NAM) and Nordea Life & Pension (NLP) investments.

Targeted sector analysis covers more than 70% of lending exposures and more than 80% of lending financed emissions. We have also updated our business environment scanning to cover the most relevant climate policies and regulations as well as sector decarbonisation roadmaps in the Nordic region.\n\nSector deep dives enabled insights into each portfolio to understand climate- and environment-related risks and opportunities, by means of estimating financed emissions and building transition pathways to align our overall targets and strategy. In the absence of adequate publicly available data, we engaged directly with customers to understand the challenges they face and their plans to adapt their business models. In support of our climate goals, we have also made significant progress in mapping the transition plans of our large\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncorporate customer base. Descriptions of the deep dives conducted during 2023 covering motor vehicles, commercial real estate, agriculture and aquaculture can be found on page 348.\n\nFollowing the deep dives,  we have since 2021 set eight sector targets and transition pathways relative to Paris Agreement-aligned benchmarks. Power production, agriculture and motor vehicles are the newest additions set during 2023.\n\nTurbulence in the energy sector and the COVID-19 pandemic had a visible impact on progress related to targets for oil and gas exploration and production, thermal peat mining, shipping as well as power production in the 2019-2022 period. We are on track to meet our oil and gas exploration and production as well as offshore and thermal peat mining targets. Oil and gas exploration and production is a sector where we target absolute reduction in full value-chain emissions until 2030. Due to reduced exposures we are well in line with\n\n## Climate transition maturity ladder\n\nDuring 2023 we introduced out Nordea's climate transition maturity ladder to our corporate customer responsible teams. This internal framework for evaluating customers' climate transition plans and the extent to which they are adapting their business models towards being aligned with 1.5\u00b0C supports targeted customer engagements.\n\nThe maturity ladder addresses key dimensions such as climate target setting and governance across five  maturity tiers with tightening expectations for disclosures and climate commitments. The maturity ladder enables a systematic targeted engagement approach that ensures risk mitigation and enables identification of commercial opportunities to help finance our customers on their transition journey.\n\nNordea's climate transition maturity ladder is a tool to enable achieving our 2025 target to have 90% of our lending exposure to large corporate customers covered by transition plans. Any customer that feeds into this performance target will be evaluated and scored across the tiers. Many SMEs do not disclose climate-related data and thus customer dialogues play a significant role in supporting and assessing the maturity of their climate transition plans.\n\nThe climate transition plan maturity ladder approach supports our products and service offering, policies and credit assessments as well as our business selection criteria. We believe that the climate transition plan approach can help us proactively drive business and sustainability in the same direction. During the year we initiated customer transition plan dialogues with our customers with the largest carbon footprint in climate-vulnerable sectors.\n\nOverall, our customers have responded well to the climate transition plan approach, which has enabled direct structured discussions on emissions and a closer understanding of transition financing needs. We will continue developing a more targeted engagement plan and working on advancing our engagement model.",

Offshore and thermal peat mining are sectors that we aim to exit in full already by 2025. Offshore is well in line for that exit, while exposures to thermal peat are still largely unchanged. We are still confident to deliver on this target as set out.\n\nFor the shipping sector, progress during the year 2022 (a one year lag of data) indicates a slight reduction, but from a 2021 level that was slightly elevated due to COVID-19 (particularly the cruise segment). The residential real estate sector (the PCAF asset class Mortgages) is highly dependent on the transition of energy production across the Nordics, particularly in Denmark and Finland which account for the largest share of fossil energy. We are currently not seeing a reduction in line with the targeted levels. Although availability of energy performance certificates for financed properties increased during the year, intensities are still based on fixed national proxies, meaning that we are not yet capturing actual reductions in the energy mix in society. For this sector we have access to customer level GHG data on 77% of the Nordic lending portfolio. For further information on sectors and targets, see the documents 'Climate targets and actions for the lending portfolio' and 'Climate target methodologies for the lending portfolio' available at nordea.com.\n\nDuring the year three new sector targets for power production, agriculture and motor vehicles were added. Together they made up 30% of total financed emissions but only 4% of the exposures in 2021.\n\nPower production is a key sector for society to decarbonise faster than other sectors. Our ambition is to be part of the journey to fossil-free power production, with the aim of decreasing the physical intensity by 70% by 2030.\n\nAgriculture (excluding fishing and aquaculture) is a sector with high emissions intensity, where the transition will be slower than in most other sectors. One large obstacle for the agriculture target is the availability of reported emissions data since most customers are small corporations. We only have access to customer-level GHG data on 1% of the Nordic lending portfolio.\n\nMotor vehicles sector (cars and vans) is experiencing a fast transition from fossil-fuel to particularly electric solutions. Our ambition is for our car financing business to play a leading role in lowering the average tank-to-wheel emissions per kilometre.\n\n## Sector targets\n\n| Sector                   | Sub-sector                                                                     | Emissions   scope   | Metric                                  | Benchmark   scenarios             | Base   year   | Baseline                         | Target  year                     | Target                           | 2023  actuals 1                  | 2023 vs  baseline                |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Residential  real estate | Households and  tenant-owner  associations                                     | 1 and 2             | Emissions  intensity    kgCO2e/m 2      | Utility  sector  NDC 2 ,  CRREM 3 | 2019          | 17.6                             | 2030                             | -40-50%                          | 16.6                             | -6%                              |\n| Shipping                 | Vessels                                                                        | 1                   | Emissions  intensity  AER,  gCO2/dwt-nm | Poseidon  principles  (IMO  2050) | 2019          | 8.3                              | 2030                             | -30%                             | 8.1                              | -2%                              |\n| Agriculture              | Crops, plantation  and hunting, and  animal husbandry                          | 1 and 2             | Emissions  intensity    tCO2e/EURm      | National  sector  targets  SBTi   | 2021          | 738                              | 2030                             | -40-50%                          | 681                              | -8%                              |\n| Motor   vehicles         | Cars and vans                                                                  | 1 5                 | Emissions inten- sity gCO2e/km          | IEA NZE 6                         | 2022          | 117                              | 2030                             | -40%                             | 116                              | -1%                              |\n| Power  production        | Electricity  generation                                                        | 1 and 2             | Emissions  intensity    gCO2e/kWh       | IEA NZE 6 ,  SBTi  1.5\u00b0C          | 2021          | 220                              | 2030                             | -70%                             | 117                              | -47%                             |\n| Oil and gas              | Exploration and  production                                                    | 1, 2 and 3          | Absolute  emissions  MtCO2e 7           | IEA NZE 6                         | 2019          | 3.0                              | 2030                             | -55%                             | 0.4                              | -85%                             |\n| Offshore                 | Drilling rigs and off- shore service vessels  within oil and gas  and shipping | -

        "page_content": "Strategic report\n\n## Motor vehicles (cars and vans)\n\nIn 2023 we analysed our motor vehicle portfolio and became the first bank to set a Paris aligned target to this sector. By 2030, Nordea aims to reduce emission intensity of the car and vans financing portfolio by >40% from 2022 levels. Intensity is 117 gCO2e/km for 2022. The target is measured as a physical emission intensity in gCO2e/km (tank-towheel) and assessed to fulfil 1.5C requirements.\n\nTransport has the highest reliance on fossil fuels of any sector, and vehicles still run mostly on internal combustion engines. This sector accounts for a third of global CO2 emissions from end-use sectors. To be on track to net zero by 2050, transport emissions need to be reduced significantly by 2030. Emissions need to decline even with rising passenger and freight activity. According to the IEA, battery electric vehicles will come to dominate all land transport segments, but the different segments are not decarbonising at the same rate because\n\n## Commercial real estate\n\nDuring 2023 we performed a thorough analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities in the commercial real estate (excluding construction) sector. Our customer base is diverse across the Nordic countries and asset types. Analysing the energy performance and GHG emissions of our commercial real estate exposures enables a targeted approach needed to improve our financed emissions data quality.\n\nThe emissions profiles mainly depend on local electricity sources, which vary greatly across the Nordics: Norway relies mostly on hydroelectric power, Sweden on hydro and nuclear power, whereas the electricity production of Denmark and Finland is a mix of fossil and non-fossil sources. Where the energy sources are predominantly fossilfree, energy efficiency is a more relevant metric than GHG emissions. This sets the Nordics somewhat apart from Southern Europe.\n\nDuring 2024 we aim to expand our energy efficiency data further. To strengthen our risk management, we monitor the financed emissions development against relevant external benchmark and we have introduced climate transition plan requirements in a phased approach in our industry credit policy. This will tighten the requirements for large real estate customers and help to transition our book towards more energy efficient assets.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nThe agricultural sector is a key sector to provide access to safe, affordable and nutritious food. However, it is also necessary to maintain a sustainable food production system. We are committed to supporting our customers to be part of the transition in this sector, and we have set a target to reduce the economic emissions intensity of the agricultural lending portfolio by 40-50% from 2021 to 2030.\n\nAccounting for 26% of the Danish national emissions in 2021, the agricultural sector is also key to reach the Danish climate targets for 2030. In the other Nordic countries, agriculture contributes less to national emissions. The sector represents a material share of our financed emissions and is therefore key for us to reach our targets for reducing financed emissions.\n\n## Aquaculture and fishing\n\nThe aquaculture and fishing sectors are both important for the Norwegian economy but have somewhat different value drivers and risks. Our aquaculture customer base consists predominantly of large Norwegian companies with diversified business through vertically integrated operations across the fish farming value chain. These companies have ambitious emission reduction targets by 2030. As of 2023, estimated 86% of the customers have a quantifiable and time-bound climate target. Our fishing customer base consists mainly of ocean-going fishing vessels capturing wild fish resources. The majority of these do not currently publish emissions or targets to reduce emissions. Emission reduction activities within vessels relies to a greater extent on the transition to alternative fuels, new technologies, retrofitting and newbuilds.\n\nDuring 2023, we have collected GHG emissions data from the largest customers in the fishing and aquaculture sectors and, where\n\ntechnology maturity varies. The development in the Nordics is, however, encouraging. Regulation, together with consistent technology development and favourable economics, is changing the Nordic passenger vehicle market rapidly. Led by Norway, our domestic markets are switching to electric vehicles at the fastest pace in the world. This development is further supported by car manufacturers' net zero targets and investment plans. Nordic governments and the car industry are planning and targeting a phase-out of internal combustion engines during this decade. The EU has also regulated the phase-out of vehicles that are not zero emission by 2035. Decarbonisation will require significant changes and investments throughout the entire value chain. To balance risks and opportunities, we will use our sector target to make sure that we are aligned with net zero and facilitate the real economy transition with our financing.\n\nIn addition, we support our customers' green transition by financing building energy renovations and on-site renewable power generation that lower the energy consumption and emissions of buildings. We will continue to engage directly with our customers to support and encourage them in their climate transition journey.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1)  Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) 1.5C benchmark weighted according to the geographical distribution of Nordea's portfolio\n\nThe target covers lending to companies whose primary activity is animal husbandry, crops, plantation and hunting and covers customers' scope 1 and 2 emissions. The target is aligned with the national agriculture targets in Denmark and Finland, and to the SBTi Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) target-setting tool, and is assessed to fulfil 1.5\u00b0C requirements.\n\nTo reach the target we will conduct climate screening and consider portfolio composition where we want to focus on sustainable foods, for example plant-based farming, green energy farming and technology developments such as grass protein facilities. We will also initiate dialogues with our customers on their climate data, targets and transition plans and support customers leaving peat soils.\n\npossible, assessed their climate transition plans using Nordea's proprietary Climate Transition Plan Maturity Ladder. To strengthen our risk management we have introduced requirement to classify the maturity of customers transition plans and have close dialogues to strengthen plans where needed in the instituted an industry credit policy. Biodiversity is a key factor for both sectors. We have recently outlined our position and commitment in our first thematic guideline on biodiversity and developed a biodiversity risk assessment framework to be included our ESG-related Risk Appetite Statement.\n\nWe will continue to support our customers' transition by financing and through direct client engagement. Our Sustainable Finance Advisory also supports with advisory in respect of sustainable finance in this sector.",

Climate and environment, cont.\n\n## Our internal carbon footprint\n\nAlthough our greatest impact is through our engagement with customers in financing and investments, we also work to reduce carbon emissions from our internal operations by more than 50% by 2030 compared with our 2019 baseline. Our work is based on the precautionary principle.\n\nSo far on our journey towards meeting our targets, we have reduced carbon emissions from our internal operations by 51% compared with 2019. Travel emissions accounted for the largest part of the reduction since we decided to more than halve our travel compared with 2019, enforced by our Travel Guidelines.\n\nAs the 2023 target has been met, we have set a new 2025 target to maintain emission reductions at a level that keep us on track to meet the 2030 target of more than 50% reduction.\n\n## New ways of working\n\nWe had set 2023 as the target year for reducing our carbon emissions from air travel by 50% compared to our baseline year 2019. We have managed to exceed the target as carbon emissions from air travel has reduced by 53%. We will continue to encourage our employees to only travel when it is absolutely necessary and to use more sustainable means of travel than air travel. We have set a new target for 2025 to reduce our carbon emissions from air travel by 60% compared to our 2019 baseline year. Since 2021 our company car policy only allows electric and plug-in hybrid company cars and these now account for 83% of our total registered company cars, which is a 21 percentage point increase compared with 2022 (62%). During 2023 we continued with the transition of company cars and are on track with our ambition to have a complete low-emission fleet.\n\n## Resource efficiency\n\nWe continuously work to introduce more customer-friendly digital solutions, primarily through our internet banks and mobile banking apps. Since 2019 we have digitalized more than 50% of all customer letters, enabling a reduction in carbon emissions from the distribution of letters.\n\nAt the same time, we have continued to improve the condition of our premises by replacing more fluorescent lights with LED, as well as installing solar panels on the roof of our head office in Norway, to go with the ones already in place in Denmark and Finland. Over 70% of our large head offices are LEED or BREEAM certified to ensure energy efficiency. We purchase 100% renewable electricity through guarantees of origin equal to our electricity consumption in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Poland and Luxembourg. Our Technology unit also progressed on its journey to reduce its carbon footprint to align with its internal objectives in 2023. One of the key initiatives was to improve the operating environment in the data centres. In 2023, we actively lowered the use of cooling in the data centres, thereby also reducing the consumption of electricity otherwise used.\n\nIn Denmark we have seen an increase in energy consumption from our premises where we have our technology located, impacted by the increased amount of digital services to our customers. Furthermore, warm temperatures in the early autumn has led to a reduced demand for reuse of our surplus heat from the data centres, as well as an increased need for cooling at our premises.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nManaging our supply chain and cooperating with suppliers to reduce our carbon footprint are key enablers to deliver on our short- and long-term climate targets. Climate and environmental indicators are integrated into our supplier screening\n\nand monitoring process as well as into our tender process. In addition, we have set a target that 70% of our spending by the end of 2023, with full-year 2022 data as the baseline, should be with suppliers that are aligned with the Paris Agreement or are subject to active engagement. In practice, this means that we have conducted a review of 194 of our suppliers that operate in carbon-intensive sectors and/or suppliers with whom we have a large spend. We have assessed their maturity on five parameters covering their net-zero commitment, short- and medium-term targets, their scope 1, 2 and 3 disclosures, their decarbonisation strategy and whether they have an externally verified climate commitment. We have used data sources, such as the CDP and the SBTi, as input for the assessment, which showed that 32% of our spend is with suppliers that are aligned and 38% is with suppliers that are subject to active engagement. For 2025 we have set a new target that 80% of our spend should be with suppliers that are aligned with the Paris agreement or are subject to active engagement, with an aspiration for all our large suppliers to have a science-based transition plan in place by 2028.\n\n## Offsetting\n\nDespite our best efforts to limit our internal carbon footprint, some emissions still remain difficult to reduce. We therefore purchase carbon offsets to reduce equivalent emissions elsewhere. We supported the generation of renewable energy through the purchase of carbon credits for 2023. We will continue to fully offset residual emissions from our internal operations. Going forward, we will switch to a long-term carbon removal portfolio, which will be reviewed periodically to align with evolving best practices for achieving net-zero emissions.\n\n## Internal carbon footprint data\n\nOur total emissions of 20,372 (18,155) tonnes of CO2e in 2023 marked a 51% reduction from the 2019 baseline. Our internal carbon footprint includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Estonia and Luxembourg as this is where we have our main operations and where we have operational control. This covers 99% of our employees.\n\n| Internal carbon footprint tCO2e                                                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 1                                                                                 | 1,142  | 1,315  | 1,446  |\n| Scope 2 2                                                                                 | 3,116  | 4,150  | 3,311  |\n| Scope 3 3                                                                                 | 16,114 | 12,690 | 6,570  |\n| Total internal carbon footprint                                                           | 20,372 | 18,155 | 11,327 |\n| CO2e emissions intensity (total tonnes  CO2e emissions/EURm of total operating  income) 4 | 1.73   | 1.76   | 1.18   |\n\nGHG accounting is performed according to the GHG Protocol, including scopes 1-3 and the following sources: mobile combustion of leased cars and stationary combustion from diesel generators (scope 1); purchased electricity, heating and cooling (scope 2); and emissions from production of energy carriers, business travel, postal services, paper and water consumption (scope 3).

Climate and environment, cont.\n\nCarbon emissions from electricity are disclosed as marketbased, i.e. after buying 100% renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin. Renewable energy equals our electricity consumption of 55,303 MWh and 450 litres of EcoPar of our fuel consumption. All emissions are stated in tonnes of CO2-equivalent (CO2e). The calculations cover the relevant GHGs, namely CO2, CH4 and N2O.\n\nWe disclose the emissions factors that we have used as a basis for our calculations in relation to each source of emission in a separate table in our GRI Index available at Nordea. com. Applied Global Warming Potentials (GWP) based on the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR5) (2014) are: CO2 - 1, CH4 - 28 and N2O - 265.\n\nThe base year for our carbon footprint is 2019 as the scope of our GHG accounting by then also included the additional sources we could retrieve data for and was as such complete. Furthermore, in 2019 we had fairly normal temperatures in the Nordics, making that year suited to serve as our base year from which to track progress.\n\n| Fuel and energy consumption                               | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fuel consumption for diesel  generators  (MWh) 1          | 250    | 292    | 255    |\n| Fuel consumption for leased cars (MWh) 2                  | 4,668  | 5,300  | 6,085  |\n| Electricity (MWh) 3                                       | 55,303 | 52,184 | 57,783 |\n| District heating (MWh)                                    | 23,180 | 25,329 | 29,933 |\n| District cooling (MWh)                                    | 3,292  | 4,998  | 4,943  |\n| Energy intensity (MWh/EURm of total  operating  income) 4 | 7.38   | 7.99   | 9.63   |\n| Water use (m 3 )                                          | 94,153 | 92,111 | 74,530 |\n\n## Biodiversity and nature-related impacts\n\nThe rate and scale of biodiversity loss and nature degradation is increasingly recognised as a societal threat. Expectations are increasing to take urgent action across society to halt and reverse the negative impact. At Nordea, we have identified that our financing and investment activities have an impact on biodiversity, as described in Note S6 'Materiality and impact analysis'. In 2023 we published the Nordea thematic guideline on biodiversity where we recognise our responsibility to contribute to societal goals and describe our current work to address biodiversity issues across the organisation and our commitment to action going forward. This guideline forms an important and first step in our roadmap towards 2025 to integrate biodiversity dependency, impact and related risks and opportunities into our sustainability strategy and our sustainability governance.\n\nWe recognise this topic as material to us and have therefore selected biodiversity as our second impact area as part of our commitment to the UNEP FI Principles of Responsible Banking. We set practice targets in 2023, adopting a progressive approach towards setting impact targets where data availability and quality allow. During 2024 we will assess biodiversity dependencies and impacts covering the corporate lending portfolio and make a physical and reputational biodiversity risk assessment of all Nordea's offices. We will also conduct an environmental impact assessment of material sourcing categories, including biodiversity risks.\n\nAn important part of the 2025 roadmap is to build understanding across the organisation, to enable the integration of biodiversity issues into our business, stakeholder engagements and offerings over time. The aim is to understand the consequences our lending and financing activities have on biodiversity and what risks we are exposed to.\n\nWe conducted training on biodiversity for Nordea's Board, the Group Leadership Team, the Sustainability and Ethics Committee, spokespersons and selected relevant teams across the organisation during 2023. Biodiversity is incorporated into the training plan for 2024 to continue this capability building. The roadmap will evolve over time and strategic opportunities will result in biodiversity integration into the business at a different pace across the organisation. NAM continued with an active approach to biodiversity in 2023, publishing a white paper in which ambitions, actions and commitments are described, including actions as a signatory to the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. In 2023 NAM became a member of the Nature Action 100 initiative, a global investor engagement initiative focused on driving greater corporate ambition and action to reverse nature and biodiversity loss, representing USD23.6 trillion in assets under management or advice.\n\n## Biodiversity practice targets 2024\n\n| Area                | Practice target  2024                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Lending             | Assess biodiversity dependencies and impacts  covering the corporate lending portfolio                                                                   |\n| Internal operations | Biodiversity physical and reputational risks'  assessment of all Nordea offices, including a  process for biodiversity risk assessment of new  locations |\n| Supply chain        | Conduct an environmental impact assessment  of material sourcing categories, including biodi- versity risks                                              |\n\n## Our financed emissions\n\nRecognising the role we play in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy and in line with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), we are committed to disclosing our share of climate responsibility for the emissions associated with the loans and investments we provide to our customers and investees, known as financed emissions.\n\nIn 2023 we concentrated our efforts on improving our data quality, looking for new alternatives and developing own approaches to providing a more comprehensive view of our climate impact. We also worked to include financed emissions from the commercial real estate asset class and counterparty scope 3 emissions for a wider scope of industries. Limited data and use of assumptions are the main challenges that we face, but we are committed to increasing transparency to our stakeholders and, more importantly, to showing progress in our decarbonisation journey.\n\nOur financed emissions cover a selection of on-balance and off-balance sheet asset classes in our lending and investment portfolios. For our lending portfolio, i.e., on-balance sheet, we cover the PCAF asset classes of business loans, motor vehicles, residential real estate and, for the first time commercial real estate for the years 2022 and 2023. As of 2023, we managed to cover financed emissions for ~95% of the exposures of our total on-balance sheet lending portfolio.\n\nFor our investment portfolio we include investments in listed equities and corporate bonds from Nordea Asset Management (NAM) and Nordea Life & Pension (NLP) as well as directly held real estate in NLP. NAM investments are off the balance sheet of the Nordea Group. This portfolio encompasses information from 2021 to 2023.",

Furthermore, in accordance with the PCAF Standard we report counterparty scope 3 emissions for oil and gas, mining, transport (air, land and maritime), construction, buildings management, materials, paper & forest products and industrial activities for the lending portfolios. This is also in line with the Implementing Technical Standards on Pillar 3 disclosures on ESG risks. For the investment portfolio we report investees' scope 3 emissions for all sectors. In addition, we include intensity metrics for sector-specific targets in the lending portfolio and weighted average carbon intensity for NAM and NLP.\n\nThis report does not cover financed emissions from bonds and equities in Markets and Treasury operations as they are held for shorter durations and liquidity management purposes. Similarly, financed emissions from the sovereign debt PCAF asset class as well as emission removals and facilitated emissions are not included this reporting period. We expect to include information about these in the near future as our work progresses.\n\nOur methodology for estimating financed emissions is mainly based on the PCAF Standard, but we also apply certain deviations and own methods to meet specific characteristics of our lending portfolio. We are continually reviewing and updating our methodology, with the principles approved on an annual basis by the Asset & Liability Committee and controlled through the quarterly risk appetite monitoring carried out by our second line of defence. Detailed information can be found in the document 'Financed emissions methodology for the lending portfolio' at nordea.com.\n\nTo ensure transparency of our financed emissions estimates, we assess the data using the PCAF scoring. The score ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the score for the most accurate data (audited and direct customer and investee data) and 5 being the score for the uncertain data (estimated data).\n\nFor 2023 reporting of financed emissions, estimates across all asset classes in the lending and investment portfolios were based on 2023 or earlier financial data, and on 2022 or earlier emissions data, depending on the latest available information from customers and investees.\n\n## Baseline recalculation\n\nIn 2023 the inclusion of commercial real estate in the scope of financed emissions and data quality improvements across the lending portfolio impacted our baseline and historical figures. Regarding data enhancements, we integrated more actual data from corporate exposures into business loans and applied our own proxy for power production; within residential real estate  and commercial real estate we collected publicly available Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). Within\n\nmotor vehicles we collected data for passenger cars and vans from external providers (see section \"Lending portfolio\"). With these improvements, the 2019 baseline accounted for 23,357,424 tCO2e (-7.6% compared with the baseline disclosed in our Annual Report 2022). Financed emissions for 2022 were also recalculated and accounted for 17,703,876 tCO2e (-13.8% compared to the data reported in 2022). Our sector-specific targets were not affected by these recalculations.\n\nThese improvements were carried out according to our Recalculation Guidelines on Financed Emissions, which states the circumstances under which we should recalculate our base year financed emissions and the threshold (>5%) for what we consider a significant impact. Detailed information on these guidelines is included in the document 'Financed emissions methodology for the lending portfolio' available at nordea.com. Further data collection and refinement of data and methodologies for historical years are planned and expected.\n\n## Lending portfolio\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, we saw a 29% decrease in the total lending portfolio financed emissions mainly due to a reduction of exposures in certain sectors within business loans.\n\nFinanced emissions from business loans are presented by a breakdown of sectors, including climate vulnerable industries. Financed emissions weighted company-specific data is 37%, corresponding to an average PCAF data quality score of ~3.57. The remaining financed emissions are estimated using the proxies from the PCAF.\n\nWe reported a 35% decrease in the business loans financed emissions from 2019 to 2023 mainly due to a reduction of exposures in shipping and animal husbandry as well as exit from offshore and Russia. Furthermore, within the power production sector we have introduced a green production proxy for fully renewable energy producers that do not report emissions. Based on information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) we have estimated that those customers can generate 5gCO2/kWh, which has led to an improvement in the data quality score from 5 to 3.\n\nFinanced emissions from motor vehicles include lending and leasing. While the PCAF Standard only provides guidance for motor vehicles lending, we have decided to include leasing by calculating and treating it in the same way as lending. The decision was made given that customers always gain possession of the vehicle after the short lease term. Leasing accounts for the major share (~70%) of financed emissions from this asset class. In 2023, we have managed to source emissions data for passenger cars and vans from external\n\n## Lending portfolio financed emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreduction in financed emissions from lending portfolio  between 2019 and 2023",

The average PCAF data score was ~3.85 as of 2023.\n\nFor residential real estate financed emissions, our improvements were centred around the collection and updating of EPC labels. Financed emissions in this asset class are estimated using the 2018 emission factor from the PCAF. In addition, we have chosen to treat EPCs that expired up to five years ago as valid and give them a data quality score of 4. We believe that this provides a better estimation of financed emissions from properties with expired EPCs than the PCAF proxy. The average PCAF data quality score for residential real estate was ~4.03 as of 2023. We will continue to improve data quality over time.\n\nDuring the year part of our efforts were focused on analysing our commercial real estate portfolio, and we are now pleased to report this asset class for the first time. The commercial real estate baseline for 2019 is 467,200 tCO2e and the current financed emissions are 414,699 tCO2e. T he inclusion of this new asset class had an impact on our total baseline financed emissions. The recalculated baseline can be found from the next page.\n\nThe methodology for estimating financed emissions in commercial real estate is the same as for residential real estate, including the treatment of the expired EPCs. The exception is commercial real estate financed emissions with data quality score of 5 where we have developed an internal proxy to close the information gap on physical emissions intensity.\n\nFinanced emissions from tenant-owner associations (TOAs) are also estimated and included in residential real estate as TOAs are mainly used for residential purposes.\n\n## Investment portfolio\n\nFinanced emissions estimates in NAM's off-balance sheet investment portfolio are based on the collection of information from investee companies through data vendors MSCI and ISS ESG. The GHG emissions data sourced from these vendors includes emissions that are directly reported by investee companies, as well as modelled estimates for these emissions when reported emissions are lacking.\n\nReported emissions data is considered equivalent to PCAF data quality score 2. For this data, NAM's data providers have governance and quality assurance procedures in place to validate the accuracy of the emissions data that NAM subsequently extracts. For example, for MSCI this includes processes such as anomaly detection, dual vendor validation (comparing collected values from various sources) and company outreach. NAM consolidates data from several data vendors to improve the overall data coverage, and consequently, NAM has been able to identify cases where different vendors provided significantly different emissions data for the same company and the same year. In such cases, NAM has created an additional layer of quality assurance to select the data that is most likely to be correct.\n\nIf reported data is not available, or of sufficient quality, NAM's data vendors provide estimated scope 1 and 2 GHG emission values, based on their respective estimation models. For MSCI, the production model (E.PROD) is used for electric utilities where the type of fuel is known as being equivalent to a PCAF score of 2. The MSCI company-specific intensity model (E.CSI) is used for companies where we have historical but not current emissions data equivalent to a PCAF score of 3. The MSCI industry segment-specific intensity model\n\n(E. Segmt) is based on sector averages for companies that have not made any disclosures and are equivalent to a PCAF score of 4. In addition, NAM complements MSCI data with data from ISS ESG. The data reported from ISS ESG is assigned a score of 2 and modelled emissions a score of 4. NAM's final data consolidation across providers seeks to optimise the overall PCAF data quality.\n\nIn 2023 NAM has chosen to report unscaled financed emissions, i.e. financed emissions for all companies where data coverage is complete. This corresponds to 95% of the investments. This approach was chosen because it is considered the most transparent, and fully enables interested parties to calculate scaled emissions. Whenever there is less than 100% data coverage, there is a systematic underreporting of financed emissions, although the extent of the underreporting is not known. One way to approximate the missing emissions data is to scale up financed emissions figures by assuming that the companies for which data is missing are exactly as emissions intensive as the portfolio average. Dividing the unscaled financed emissions figure by the data coverage percentage will give this higher scaled figure. In 2023 NAM did not have sufficient data coverage to estimate financed emissions for 5% of the investments.\n\nFor NLP, financed emissions are reported for all managed assets where NLP makes investment choices on behalf of our beneficiaries. NLP reports financed emissions from all asset classes where data coverage is sufficient and established methodologies are available. Regarding asset classes where this is not the case yet we assume that data and methodologies will become available in the future, and we are encouraged by the development of methodologies for calculating financed emissions from sovereign bonds.\n\nReported financed emissions from NLP's investments are based on data from investee companies provided by MSCI. The above description of data quality in accordance with the PCAF categories also applies to NLP. For NLP's directly held real estate portfolio, we use vendor-specific reported data corresponding to a score of 1 in PCAF's data quality hierarchy for commercial real estate.\n\n## Participation in PCAF\n\nNordea has an active role within PCAF. Since 2020 Nordea has been represented on the PCAF Board of Directors, and in 2023 Nordea joined the PCAF Core Team which is mandated to lead the developments of new methodologies and standards.\n\nWithin the PCAF initiative, PCAF Nordic is a regional group with the aim to align efforts across the Nordic market methodologies as well as to ensure a close dialogue with the PCAF global initiative. During the year we played an active role in the real estate and agriculture working groups. We have had an open collaboration with the participating banks to share knowledge and different methodological approaches to address the common concerns and characteristics of the region.\n\nAs a result, in the residential real estate working group, we have decided to collaborate for a more standardised methodology on TOAs with our peers to enhance the comparison of data. In the agriculture working group, we have explored more databases to estimate financed emissions from agriculture. We expect to strengthen the collaboration with the PCAF Nordic banks and continue solving common challenges.",

This is to minimise the risk under reporting, given that many companies are failing to disclose emissions for material scope 3 categories. The average PCAF data quality score for these scope 3 emissions was 3.9 in 2023.\n- 2) 2022 financed emissions scope 3 have been restated to include scope 3 for all energy and basic materials companies. Last year's reporting included only the subset of companies that were in oil and gas or mining.",

Sustainability is at the core of our business strategy, integrated into all aspects of our business operations. As part of our sustainability strategy, managing social impacts, both positive and negative, is vital in our work.\n\nWe see human rights as the foundation for the work within our social responsibility strategy and fundamental to ensuring continued business growth and a social licence to operate. In 2023 we therefore published a human rights policy that provides information about our commitments and efforts to respect human rights in all our business activities and relationships. In addition, we published a supporting thematic guideline describing our strategic position and actions.\n\nTo further support our social responsibility strategy, in 2023 we assessed and identified three thematic focus areas where we can leverage our market position and size to make a positive contribution to society. In 2024 we will increase our efforts in these three thematic areas:\n\nJust transition : This refers to preserving human rights and mitigating adverse societal impacts from the transition to a low-carbon economy. A balanced transition is essential to mitigate negative human rights impacts, in particular for vulnerable groups.\n\nDiversity and inclusion : We use our position as the leading financial services group in the Nordics and draw on our diversity and inclusion expertise to engage with our customers and contribute to creating more diverse, equitable and inclusive companies and a more diverse and inclusive society.\n\nFinancial well-being : With our position in the Nordic countries we will help create and maintain financial well-being built on human rights and thus contribute to inclusive economic growth and reduced inequalities.\n\n## Supporting human rights\n\nWe take our corporate responsibility to respect human rights seriously and are guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in all our business operations.\n\nWe work to continually integrate human rights considerations into our policies, practices, and decision-making processes, ensuring that respect for human rights is integral to how we conduct business. Through ongoing awareness building, training, and accountability mechanisms, we empower employees to uphold human rights in their daily activities.\n\n## Integrating human rights in investments and financing\n\nAs a responsible investor, we expect companies to conduct due diligence as defined by the UN Guiding Principles on Business Human Rights, become more transparent and report on their political risk and impact analysis, including their human rights impact. Our Nordea-branded investment strategies are subject to norm-based screening, which identifies companies that are allegedly involved in breaches of international law and norms on environmental protection, human rights, labour standards and anti-corruption. If a company is identified in this screening process, an internal assessment of both the company and the incident is conducted. Typical actions include engagement, quarantine or exclusion.\n\nOur target states that by the end of 2023, all direct investments in companies made by funds directly managed by NAM will be assessed against the minimum safeguards in the area of human rights (in line with the EU taxonomy). In order to achieve this target, we continued developing the process of assessing investee companies on their human rights performance through our norm-based screening but also using additional sources of information such as the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark or other data to identify investee",

To address the limitations in regard to qualitative human rights data, we also joined a collaborative investor engagement targeting data service providers and proxy advisers. We also engaged with a number of companies on their human rights performance and disclosures and exercised voting rights when relevant.\n\nIntegrating human rights into sector guidelines, industry credit policies and ESG risk assessment tools is key to embedding human rights in our lending process. In addition to complying with national laws and regulations, customers in relevant industries are expected to follow international norms and standards and manage and mitigate adverse human rights impacts.\n\nFor more information on how we manage ESG-related risks in financing and investments, including social risks and human rights risks, see Note S2 \"Financial strength\".\n\n## Monitoring customer transactions for human rights breaches\n\nAlongside traditional transaction monitoring scenarios across all our customers and transactions, we also undertake targeted proactive, intelligence-based reviews of different financial and predicate crimes.\n\nHuman trafficking causes tremendous harm and, as such, we treat human trafficking risk as a priority in our crime detection and prevention efforts. The Nordic region is primarily a destination for exploitation of victims trafficked from other countries. However, the recruitment and transport of people can also happen within the Nordic countries. Financial products and services can be abused by organised crime networks and individual perpetrators to finance crime, receive revenues from criminal activities or launder criminal proceeds.\n\nSince completing our analysis on human trafficking for sexual exploitation (2021-2022), we continued in 2023 to work on investigations that covered a wide scope of human trafficking typologies, including possible forced labour and sexual exploitation.\n\n## Joint initiative for a sustainable construction industry in Sweden\n\nIn November 2023, the Bank initiative Sustainable construction industry (Bankinitiativet H\u00e5llbar byggbransch) was launched in Sweden. Nordea and four other Nordic banks have in cooperation with the real estate and construction industry, agreed to introduce common requirements on construction companies to have deployed necessary control and follow-up systems for sub-contractors involved.\n\nThe purpose is to contribute to more sustainable and healthier competition, by improving controls when financing new construction, remodeling and extensions. The common requirements aim to address fraud, working conditions and health and safety. Nordea has incorporated these requirements to the credit process for construction credits.\n\n## Human rights in the supply chain\n\nThe respect for human rights is embedded throughout our procurement process. As part of our supplier due diligence prior to contracting, and continuous supplier management after contracting, we conduct screening on indicators such as the risk of child labour, the risk of modern slavery, the right to freedom of association and decent working conditions. Our screening process also covers if the supplier is subject to negative media exposure or regulatory actions due to misconduct related to human rights, enabling us to take appropriate actions.\n\nAll our suppliers must contractually commit to the principles in our Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct is a mandatory document in all Nordea's supplier contracts and includes positions on human rights and labour rights and an obligation for suppliers to ensure that these principles also apply to subcontractors. By having a contractual commitment from our suppliers, we ensure that sustainability requirements are an integrated part of our supplier and contract management. To increase our assurance, the Supplier Code of Conduct also includes an audit clause, where we reserve the right to audit the supplier and its subcontractors to validate that the principles stated in Nordea's Supplier Code of Conduct are also implemented in practice. Every year we complete a number of sustainability audits with the support of an external auditor.\n\nDuring 2023 we further formalised our human rights due diligence process and detailed these principles in our Sustainable Procurement Guideline. The guideline describes how we identify and assess, take action to prevent and mitigate, take action to track progress and communicate about the risks and impacts identified in the different stages of the procurement process.\n\nWe also conducted a human rights impact assessment of the supply chain during 2023, where we identified in which industries in our supply chain there might be an elevated risk of negative impact on people. Based on the operating context of our suppliers and the nature of the service or product they deliver to us, we identified the salient human rights issues in our supply chain, i.e. the human rights that are at risk of most severe negative impact. We identified poor working conditions, child labour and forced labour as the areas of greatest importance in our supply chain. This information will be reflected in our requirements towards the suppliers in the sectors exposed to enhanced risk. Our frameworks and internal guidelines will be updated to secure this is enforced. In 2024 we will focus on improving the understanding and tracking of our impacts to ensure that our actions have the intended effect.\n\n## From respecting human rights to promoting them\n\nWe recognise that the international framework for the corporate responsibility to respect human rights has its primary focus on preventing adverse human rights impacts. In the following sections we address the focus areas in our own operations, value chain and society that we believe are important for fulfilling our commitments, which go beyond the responsibility to respect human rights.\n\n## Financial well-being\n\nIn 2024 we will, as part of our thematic focus areas, continue facilitating improved financial well-being by strengthening the financial skills of individuals and businesses and unlocking access to financial opportunities for our customers. This should be achieved by making sure that our products and services are availiable to our customers on equal terms.\n\nFinancial inclusion is a prerequisite for achieving financial well-being. We therefore strive to create a more inclusive financial future for our customers and the communities in which we operate.",

Community engagement is about creating positive change in collaboration with non-profit organisations and with the contribution of our employees.\n\nIn our three community engagement programmes focus is on building financial skills, fostering entrepreneurship and supporting refugees to settle in a new country. These programmes are activated in our own initiatives and also in collaboration with a wide variety of partnerships and sponsorships.\n\nExamples of our 2023 activities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Launched a new digital skills initiative in Norway to offer support for elderly within digital services and online safety.\n- \u00b7 Extended financial skills activities in Finland to reach all age groups from first-grade children to young adults.\n- \u00b7 Arranged several fraud management workshops for refugees in Estonia.\n- \u00b7 Supported money handling with the help of over 100 volunteers across Denmark in the national fund collection for the Danish Red Cross and the Danish Cancer Society.\n- \u00b7 Launched Fearless Founders mentorship events in Finland especially targeted at future founders and female founders, who are an under-represented group among growth company founders.\n- \u00b7 As an indicator of our commitment to community engagement, we were nominated for the Swedish Publishing Prize in the category 'Information and facts for children' with our very own math book for young people.\n\nOur workforce\n\n~ 31,500\n\nemployees from all over the world\n\n107\n\ncitizenships represented\n\nspoken languages 66\n\nspanning across seven decades\n\nAll Nordea employees are invited to volunteer 16 hours each year through Nordea's community engagement programmes. We offer employees face-to-face volunteering activities as well as online and hybrid volunteering activities, which continue to be popular as participants are able to join regardless of geographical area. In 2023 more than 1600 Nordea employees volunteered in 2,600 activities, equating to over 10,400 hours of volunteering.\n\n## Our people\n\nTo enable our vision to be a preferred employer in the financial industry, our focus is on retaining our people and attracting new talent, driving performance and efficiency and creating a great employee experience. Our promise as an employer is to encourage people to come as they are and bring their different perspectives. We believe that with a variety of viewpoints, expertise and eagerness we can enable positive change. We provide people with a wealth of opportunities to develop and move forward in their career. We focus on leadership that inspires and supports our vision and on being a sustainable employer with a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace with equal opportunities. We integrate sustainability into all our people processes and have set ambitious targets that support us in following our progress towards our goals. To identify and address critical competency needs of our workforce to deliver on our strategic objectives and priorities, we have introduced an annual strategic workforce planning process conducted in business areas and Group functions and consolidated on Group level. This also helps us prioritise key actions to acquire the competencies needed and mitigate potential execution risks. This includes creating transparency around key workforce changes and reskilling and upskilling our people, building a fit-for-future workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continue to see good results for overall engagement. The likelihood of employees recommending Nordea as a workplace remained stable, the index score being 82 (81 in 2022) and the Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) score 42 (42 in 2022). The score for feeling valued as an employee also remained stable with an index score of 78 (78 in 2022). Our people continued to experience clear leadership communication from the senior leaders of the business areas and Group functions, with the index score remaining stable at 78 in 2023 (78 in 2022). We promote and support physical, mental, social and financial well-being by building awareness with trainings and events and providing tools for our people and leaders. In 2023 we launched a Group-wide guideline on occupational health and safety and introduced a wellbeing index to the People Pulse survey. We believe in bringing people together at our offices, while at the same time treasuring flexibility. We are further embedding our hybrid working model as we see that this mix of working together at the office and from home has proven to be positive in terms of performance and engagement. We aim for the right balance between individual preferences, opportunities for networking and collaboration in person with teams or wider communities and on Group level, taking shared responsibility for our culture and ensuring that all of our people understand our business and ways of working. We saw a slight decrease in sick leave to 3.21% (3.44%). According to the People Pulse, the results indicate a positive development on Group level in the perception of workload, which was 78 (76).\n\n## Welcoming all perspectives\n\nAll perspectives are welcome and valuable to move forward to something better. In line with one of our focus areas in our social strategy, we continuously work towards being a diverse and inclusive bank - for our people, our customers and society at large. Our ambition is to ensure that equality, as a fundamental human right, is embedded in our business. Our scope for diversity is broad, including gender equality, age diversity, ability variation, cultural diversity and LGBTQ+. This is also\n\ndescribed in our Diversity & Inclusion Policy. We continue to support the EU Diversity Charters, which we have now signed in seven countries. Our Pride commitment continues, and in 2023 we participated in nine countries. We measure our people's perception of fair treatment twice a year. In 2023 the respondents' average index score was 92, (92) indicating that they felt they had been treated fairly regardless of gender, gender identity, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, (dis)ability etc. In 2023 we introduced a new inclusion index and set a target to further improve our people's perceptions of fair treatment, equal opportunities, and inclusion in our People Pulse survey. We continued to increase awareness and strengthen our tools to counteract bias and enhance inclusion in teams, leadership, recruitment and customer relations.\n\n## Gender balance\n\nWe strive for gender balance in all parts of the organisation, where each gender 1 has at least 40% representation. In 2023 we achieved this and maintained gender balance among our total workforce and improved it on all leader levels. Additionally, we are ahead of our target to reach gender balance at the top three leadership levels combined by the end of 2025. To further improve at all levels of the organisation, including the senior leadership level, we are focusing on recruitment, retention and promotion of a diverse workforce. Such ambitions are also linked to the remuneration of the GLT and other senior leaders.\n\n## Harassment and discrimination prevention\n\nWe condemn all kinds of discrimination, harassment or other victimisation and strive to be a safe and inclusive workplace, promoting equality, fair treatment and respect, as stated in our Code of Conduct and our policy against discrimination and harassment. We have firm processes in place to handle cases as well as tools to work proactively against such behaviours. In 2023 1.4% (1.4%) of the People Pulse respondents stated that they had been subjected to some form of harassment or other mistreatment. During 2023, 12 (30) discrimination and harassment cases were reported through various channels, including our whistleblowing function, Raise Your\n\n## Gender 1 balance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board of  Directors                      | 40%   | 60%   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Top three   leadership levels 2 combined | 40%   | 60%   |\n| Leaders                                  | 44%   | 56%   |\n| Total   workforce                        | 52%   | 48%   |\n\n- 1)  'Gender' refers to biological or legal sex.

We take mistreatment of any kind seriously and continue to proactively ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all employees, and have tools and trainings available for leaders and teams.\n\n## We drive performance and develop people\n\nThrough our annual performance, learning and development cycle we ensure that our people know how they can perform to support Nordea's overall vision and direction. We encourage a culture where goal-setting is accompanied by meaningful dialogue and feedback between employee and leader on an ongoing basis. We continuously focus and improve our offering for development and career opportunities. Our ambition is for 80% of our people (100% of senior leaders) to have a development plan in place by 2025, with tangible goals linked to the Group strategy and priorities that can support personal career ambitions. In 2023,  65% of people had development plans, a 14 percentage point increase since 2022. We introduced a common and transparent job framework in 2023 to provide an even clearer overview of career opportunities and possible career paths for our people. This is one of the tools used in dialogues between employees and leaders, further enabling our people to build their careers and reach their full potential. Our active internal job market and growth opportunities are key to retaining our people and developing a sustainable workforce to meet current and future business needs. As part of our succession planning, we aim for efficient and fast recruitment processes and strategic development of our workforce. As a result of structured succession pipelines, internal recruitments at senior leadership level have been more than 80% in 2021-2022. In 2023, 61% of our open senior leader positions were filled by internal candidates. The reduction compared to previous years which was mainly driven by the need to acquire specific skills, aligned to the annual strategic workforce planning process. Our Graduate Programme is one of the levers we use to acquire and develop future talents. The two-year programme is built around future critical skills and offers learning journeys consisting of rotations, on-the-job learning and trainings. In the past two years 80+ graduates were hired with a gender split in 2023 of 51% women and 49% men. We recognise that significant learning and development happen outside of formal training and that the best results are achieved through a combination of training and practice. Our learning is based on a 70-20-10 framework: 70% learning by doing, 20% learning from others and 10% formal learning. We offer equal opportunities also in our\n\n## Performance and people development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                    | Total   |      |      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|------|------|\n| Formal learning  hours per  employee               | 15.6    | 16.1 | 15.1 |\n| Virtual learning   marketplace hours  per employee | 2.1     | 1.5  | 2.9  |\n| People who had a  PLD dialogue                     | 94%     | 52%  | 48%  |\n\nlearning programmes and have a gender balance target of minimum representation of both genders of 40%. In 2023 participants in the leadership programmes were within this target. We prioritise that our people are fit for current and future customer and societal expectations. As an example, we have launched award-winning trainings on greenwashing risk and the impact of sustainability to improve our competencies on ESG matters.\n\n## We reward people\n\nOur remuneration policy supports our ability to recruit, develop and retain highly motivated, competent and performance-oriented people and support the Group strategy. We have a competitive and market-aligned total reward offering recognising the performance of people with a passion to serve our customers. Our approach is to reward our people for not only what they contribute, but also for how they contribute. We also ensure that remuneration is aligned with effective risk management, our purpose and values and applicable regulations.\n\nOur diversity and inclusion strategy, as well as our pay principles, support that we make decisions that result in equal pay for equal work. In order to ensure the highest possible experience and quality in approach, but also to remove any bias from the analysis, a third-party provider conducted an objective, thorough analysis of pay equity at Nordea. The analysis uses regression models accounting for factors that impact differences in pay in objective way including job complexity, experience, performance and location, and identifies pay differences between women and men in comparable positions that are not due to those factors.\n\nFor 2023 pay differences between women and men in similar positions, which are not due to those fair drivers, were 2.08% in men's favour. Though this gap is in the lower end of the market, it is Nordea's ambition to close the gap between women and men holding similar jobs by the end of 2026, that is reducing the pay gap to a level where the difference in pay is not statistically significant. That is specifically done as part of our yearly pay review which includes a targeted focus on addressing identified individual pay gaps. We also ensure awareness, training and support among our leaders to help them in making unbiased decisions on remuneration and other employment terms. The other perspective on pay equity is provided by comparing the average pay for all women with the average pay for all men at Nordea. In this case men are on average paid higher, since men tend to hold more senior positions associated with higher pay. The difference in the average\n\nWe aim to continuously improve development and career opportunities",

Nordea is actively working to ensure more women are represented on senior leadership levels and in succession pipelines etc. See also the section on gender balance and our 2025 target to create an equal gender balance on senior leadership levels. We have set a 2025 target for no gender to have less than 40% representation at the top three leadership levels of Nordea, and are ahead of our plan towards 2025.\n\nWe continued to integrate ESG targets into all our variable pay plans including the Profit Sharing Plan, which covers most of our employees, and Group Pool, which covers all short-term incentive plans. Our Long Term Incentive Plans also include ESG scorecards supporting our 2025 ambitions. This means that GLT members, senior leaders as well as other employees at Nordea have their variable pay or Profit Sharing Plan linked to ESG goals.\n\nThe ratio of Nordea's CEO's total remuneration to median total remuneration of Nordea employees including those in the Nordics, Poland and Estonia was 40.5 in 2023, which is lower than most other large European companies. For further information of the remuneration and pay ratio of Nordea's CEO refer to our 2023 Remuneration Report for Governing bodies.\n\n## We handle employment conditions\n\nWe take pride in handling organisational changes with respect for the people affected and adhere to labour agreements in our markets and collaborate closely with trade unions. Our goal is to always treat our people with respect and to provide support to people affected by changes in developing skills and finding new job opportunities inside or outside Nordea. In 2023 84.8% (85.7%) of our employees were covered by collective agreements. The terms and conditions of employees who are not covered by collective agree-\n\nments are typically determined by individual contracts, applicable local laws and/or the collective agreements that may apply to Nordea, depending on the country in question.\n\n## Human rights due diligence in own operations\n\nEnsuring human rights and decent working conditions are in place for our people is crucial to our role as an employer and our commitment to uphold fundamental human rights, including labour rights.\n\nWe operate in a number of different countries, creating a complex legislative landscape with local and EU requirements to uphold. We follow and in many instances exceed minimum requirements, as stated in our Code of Conduct, Diversity & Inclusion policy and policy against discrimination and harassment. Performing due diligence is key to efforts to respect fundamental human rights and work is ongoing to formalise this process.\n\n## People data\n\nWe saw a decrease in our voluntary turnover rate, which has now stabilised (6.1% in 2023 compared with 9.6% in 2022). The total turnover rate was 8.6%. We encourage internal career mobility by promoting the internal job market and showcasing the inspiring career opportunities we offer across the bank. We hire external workers in selected areas, such as IT development in projects as well as IT management, end-user support, application operations and maintenance. At the end of 2023 a total of 4,998 FTEs (4,771) were contracted on a time and material basis. The number of employees totalled 31,439 and is reported as headcounts in the tables below. This is different from the employee-related information in the financial notes where employees are disclosed as full-time equivalents.\n\n|                       | 2023              | 2023

Our Code of Conduct (the 'Code') defines the high-level principles that guide our business, how we treat our customers and the conduct expected from our employees. The Code is based on the relevant legal requirements and internationally agreed-upon standards, primarily the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. The Code includes the application of the precautionary principle and a principle stipulating respect of human rights. All persons working for Nordea are subject to the Code, including the Board of Directors, and it applies to all countries in which Nordea operates. Furthermore, persons working for Nordea and who enter into agreements with third parties on behalf of Nordea are required to ensure that these third parties commit to the principles of the Supplier Code of Conduct. It is the responsibility of each leader to ensure that the Code is known and complied with by all employees. They are required to undertake annual mandatory training including an assessment to confirm their understanding of the Code.\n\nThe Code, together with our purpose and values, which are at the core of everything we do, sets the aspiration for whom we want to be: always being purpose-led and guided by values and having a strong ethical mindset. Our purpose and values define our behaviour and help us make the right decisions. Our purpose is to enable dreams and aspirations for a greater good. Our values - collaboration, ownership, passion and courage are a clear expression of the culture we want to maintain.\n\n## Compliance is fundamental to our corporate culture\n\nBeing compliant means conducting business in accordance with financial laws, regulations, market standards, rules of conduct, and supervisory requirements from financial regulators governing our licensed activities in any jurisdiction where Nordea operates. It also includes data protection laws and regulations as well as other customer protection-related regulation relevant to our licensed activities.\n\n## Raise Your Concern\n\nOur whistleblowing function, Raise Your Concern (RYC), ensures that all stakeholders, including customers, partners, affected communities and employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of human rights or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in our operations, products or services. This includes any action that\n\nconstitutes a violation of laws or regulations or of our internal policies, instructions or guidelines. Reporting can be made verbally or in writing and we ensure that all reporting is treated in the strictest confidentiality. Reports can be made in all countries where Nordea operates. Furthermore, it is also possible to report anonymously via WhistleB, an electronic reporting channel. This platform, managed by an external party, is entirely separate from our IT systems and does not track IP addresses or other data that could identify the sender of a message. Cases reported through RYC form part of the monitoring of compliance with the Code of Conduct. A summary of key trends and statistics on cases are also reported on a no-names basis to the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief People Officer and the Chief Risk Officer in addition to being included in management reports and reports to the Group Board. Furthermore, the RYC process and investigations are subject to regular quality controls with defined escalation procedures to report any process deviations. In 2023 no cases concerning severe human rights issues and incidents connected to our own workforce (for example forced labour, human trafficking or child labour) were reported via RYC. At Nordea, in accordance with internal policies, we do not intimidate or retaliate against colleagues or others who raise a concern in good faith or against those who assist with inquiries or investigations of such violations.\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nAt Board level, the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee assists the Group Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability, which encompass governance, strategy, risk management and operationalisation. The committee receives quarterly updates on the implementation of sustainability in our Group business strategy. The Board Audit Committee also reviews and monitors our sustainability reporting as part of our Annual Report and the Capital and Risk Management Report.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning risk management and related frameworks, controls and processes relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as drivers of existing risk. The Board Remuneration and People Committee is responsible for preparing and presenting proposals to the Board on remuneration matters, including integration of ESG KPIs, as well as diversity and inclusion. The committee also supports the Board in monitoring the impact of diversity and inclusion policies and practices within Nordea.

The Board has previously received an update on global and European climate science and global biodiversity risk status as an emerging issue.\n\nThe Chief of Staff is accountable for overseeing and facilitating the Group-wide integration of ESG factors into the risk management framework and business processes. Additionally, the Chief of Staff is accountable for the development of the Group's strategic sustainability priorities and analysis of emerging topics, ensuring that Nordea's sustainability agenda remains aligned with the business environment developments, such as geopolitical and regulatory trends, and Nordea's long-term net-zero commitment. We also have an executive-level Group-wide committee - the Sustainability and Ethics Committee - as a sub-committee of the CEO's Group Leadership Team. The Sustainability and Ethics Committee consists of representatives from the business areas and Group functions, including Group Risk, Group People, Group Corporate Legal and Group Finance, and supports the Group CEO, the Group Leadership Team, the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee and the Group Board in their oversight responsibilities concerning sustainability. The Sustainability and Ethics Committee is mandated to facilitate the integration of sustainability into the business strategy and supports the integration of ESG factors into our risk management framework. It is tasked with recommending to the Group CEO a long-term plan for fully integrating sustainability into the business strategy and ensuring appropriate implementation to achieve the Group level targets. Part of this is to approve sector and thematic guidelines. It is also responsible for influencing and following the Group's status and progress regarding ethics and culture in line with our purpose and values. This involves advising the Group CEO on decisions on whether Nordea should participate in or withdraw from voluntary commitments related to sustainability and providing guidance to the business areas regarding ethical business dilemmas.\n\nThe executive-level Group Risk Committee promotes interaction and coordination within the Group on risk matters. With respect to sustainability, the Group Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the implementation of ESG factors as embedded drivers of existing risks. In addition to the Group Risk Committee, the Sustainability and Ethics Commit-\n\n## Sustainability governance structure\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nBoard Audit Committee\n\nBoard Risk Committee\n\n## Group Leadership Team\n\nGroup Risk Committee\n\ntee also monitors and, when relevant, supports the business areas and Group functions in risk management activities related to the long-term plan for fully integrating sustainability into the business strategy and the associated targets. The Asset & Liability Committee and its sub-committee, the ESG Reporting Subcommittee, support the preparation of balance sheet-based disclosures of ESG-related information such as the EU taxonomy and financed emissions.\n\nTo ensure that sustainability is integrated into all business areas and Group functions, a Group-wide implementation programme has been established with dedicated work streams and an Operational Steering Committee. The progress of the programme is monitored by the Sustainability and Ethics Committee and the Board Operations and Sustainability Committee on a quarterly basis. During 2023 we continued to integrate ESG KPIs applicable to remuneration for the Group Leadership Team and other senior leaders across the Nordea Group. Also, other employees now have their variable pay or Profit Sharing Plan linked to ESG goals in addition to financial targets.\n\nFor more information on sustainability governance, see 'Corporate governance statement 2023' on page 60.\n\n## Policies and guidelines\n\nOur Sustainability Policy sets out our principles for ensuring the long-term sustainability of our operations and, in so doing, strengthens our long-term customer relationships and contribution to a greater good. In addition to the policy, we have position statements as well as thematic and sector guidelines that provide guidance and principles for dealing with both business opportunities and risk mitigation.\n\nTo support our Sustainability Policy we published a Human Rights Policy in 2023 that provides information about our commitments and efforts to respect human rights in all our business activities and relationships. In addition, we published a supporting social responsibility thematic guideline describing our strategic position and actions. In 2023, we also published a thematic guideline on biodiversity describing our current work to address biodiversity issues and our commitments to action ahead.\n\nWe have described our commitments regarding climate change in our Position Statement on Climate Change. We also have guidelines addressing the climate issue and our position in relation to other sectors, including agriculture, forestry, fossil fuels, mining and real estate.

We update the corresponding internal documentation and processes to implement these sector guidelines.\n\nOn the investment side, we are committed to integrating ESG factors into our analysis, decision-making processes and active ownership practices. NLP's policy framework for ESG areas and climate change consists of a Responsible Investment Policy and Climate Change Policy. For own managed assets in NLP, we exclude investments in issuers that base any exploration and production volumes on unconventional oil and gas.\n\nOur polices together with all our position statements, thematic and sector guidelines can be found at nordea.com/sustainability and is further detailed in Note 'S8 Position statements and guidelines' and Note 'S9 Directives, instructions and policies' on pages 377-378.\n\n## Financial crime prevention\n\nWe fully recognise the threat that societies face from human trafficking, terrorism, corruption, drug smuggling, tax evasion and other forms of illegal activity and have over the years built strong defences to prevent that our resources, products, and services are used to facilitate financial crime. Tracking down and stopping the flow of money from these activities is key to disrupting the criminals involved. Therefore, as a financial institution, we are uniquely positioned to be part of the solution. We commit to complying with the laws and regulations relevant to anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In 2023 we further strengthened our financial crime prevention capabilities through new investments in technology, additional employees, training, and more sophisticated prevention and detection techniques.\n\nSimilar to 2022, in 2023 a number of countries and international bodies continued to introduce new sanctions in continuous response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. The sanctions currently include the freezing of assets, deposit restrictions, restrictions on economic relations with certain regions in Ukraine, restrictions focusing on the energy and finance sector, import and export restrictions and overflight bans. Nordea has implemented the applicable sanctions rules introduced by the relevant authorities.\n\nAs a consequence of the current sanctions regime and the increasing breadth and complexity of sanctions in force, in 2022 Nordea has decided not to conduct any business activities that relate to the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. A similar policy was already in place with respect to Crimea and Sevastopol. Furthermore, due to the current sanctions regime and the restrictions in force, in 2022 Nordea stopped the automated processing of payments to and from Russia and Belarus. These policy decisions continue to be in place.\n\nAs sanctions measures continue to curb the ability to support and finance the war in Ukraine, the sanctioned parties and facilitators are seeking alternative ways to circumvent sanctions. Nordea remains vigilant to the risk of the bank's products and services being used to evade sanctions and continues to enhance its controls to mitigate sanctions evasion risks.\n\nOur Fraud unit continues to mitigate the threats of phishing (phone calls, e-mails and text messages) and scams through prevention, detection and awareness activities.\n\nFinancial crime is a broader societal issue which no financial institution can fight alone. We work together with a wide range of external stakeholders, including financial superviso-\n\nry authorities, industry associations, tax authorities and the financial units in each of the countries we operate in, and promote information sharing between banks and the relevant authorities, enabling more effective and proactive detection of financial crime.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nNordea has a holistic Group-wide anti-bribery and corruption programme, which outlines how we prevent, detect and correct matters related to bribery and corruption. Key features include: a clear tone from the top, a Group Accountable Executive for anti-bribery and corruption, an extensive suite of internal policies and procedures, communication and training and a dedicated advisory function. In addition, the programme includes gifts and hospitality reporting requirements, management reporting, an annual risk assessment, monitoring and testing, and third-party risk management capabilities. The programme encompasses all three lines of defence. A cornerstone of the anti-bribery and corruption control framework is the Raise Your Concern programme as outlined in a separate section.\n\nAll employees must complete annual awareness training on financial crime risks, including bribery and corruption. The training outlines the key bribery and corruption concepts, Nordea's potential exposures and prevention programme, requirements placed on all employees and provides references to additional information. Moreover, 7.4% of the total workforce have completed further in-depth anti-bribery and corruption training tailored to their risk profile. The Group Board and the Group Leadership Team undertake biennial specialised financial crime training, emphasising their responsibilities in relation to bribery and corruption.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nIntroducing new technologies, exploring new ways of doing business and connecting with customers widen banks' attack surface. At the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming more organised, resourceful and experienced. Banks must also deal with the asymmetry of having to protect all assets, while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need to find one weak spot. Combined, these factors pose an unprecedented risk to the banking industry. In the normal course of business, we focus not only on maintaining effective basic information security controls but also on enhancing our cyber defence with new tools and functions for security, detection and response. We develop innovative security practices to meet new business demands, such as robust mobile banking applications and proactive customer support for fraud detection and prevention. We develop our information security practice based on recognised industry best practices such as the ISO 27000 series standards and the frameworks provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US. Furthermore, we need to comply with financial industry legislation, for example European Banking Authority guidelines and other European legislation introducing specific information security requirements. To respond to the increased cyber threat level caused by the continued war in Ukraine, we have scaled up selected cyber controls and implemented a wide range of tactical measures to further improve our cyber resilience. In addition, we have teamed up with partners from governmental organisations, law enforcement agencies, intelligence networks, peers in the industry and others to share intelligence and experience.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nKeeping our personal data safe is part of our commitment to be a safe and trusted bank. Data privacy is therefore an integral part of our business and operations and an important element of our digital strategy. In 2023 we continued to enhance our ability to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws",

Our privacy units continued their important work, which included providing training, advice and support and carrying out assurance activities on privacy-related issues. In 2023 we also updated the content of our mandatory Data Privacy training and rolled it out to all our employees. All new employees are equally obliged to complete training courses on the GDPR.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nWith an annual spend of around EUR 2.5bn, we recognise that we have an important role to play in contributing to the sustainable transformation of our society. Sustainability is key to our procurement processes, and we have set ambitious targets. Working with suppliers that share our mindset and ambitions is crucial for us to be able to deliver on our targets.\n\nTo further strengthen transparency about our aspirations and direction, we developed a supplier vision in 2023, which not only outlines what we commit to as a buyer, but also describes what our expectations are towards our suppliers. We aim to be part of a collective movement that works towards a just transition of our society, to achieve a low-carbon, climate-resilient and circular economy, and partnering up with suppliers is a prerequisite for succeeding with that.\n\nAll our contracted suppliers must sign our Supplier Code of Conduct, which states our requirements related to human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-bribery and corruption. It has a sub-contractor clause highlighting that we expect our suppliers to adopt similar principles in dealing with their suppliers. It also has an audit clause and a termination clause, and in the event of severe breaches, we reserve the right to terminate the agreement. However, that is considered the very last resort as we always aim to engage and support our suppliers in changing their practices to prevent it from happening again.\n\nDuring 2023 we further matured how sustainability is integrated into all aspects of our procurement process. All new suppliers are being pre-screened before contracting for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naspects such as country and sector risk, carbon intensity, violations of international norms, financial crime and adverse media. Any risks captured in this process are included in the dialogue with the suppliers and can result in deselection or mitigating actions prior to contracting. For selected high impact categories, we have developed product- or service-specific requirements, and we have guidelines stipulating that sustainability must be given a weight of 5-20% in these tenders. In relevant cases these requirements are translated into contractual clauses, which is an area we intend to develop further in 2024, recognising that our suppliers' commitments and actions are critical to ensure delivery on our joint transition. During the contract lifecycle, all our suppliers are monitored on the same aspects as in the pre-screening process, and identified risks are assessed and, if needed, addressed with the supplier.\n\nIn addition to the procurement process, we also conduct an annual assessment of the supply chain to identify suppliers with potentially elevated sustainability risks. These suppliers are subject to an in-depth review conducted by an external party and result in in agreed actions of improvement between Nordea and the supplier. In 2023 we conducted a sustainability review of a supplier providing cash handling services, and two suppliers of IT consultants. Again this year, we conclude that sustainability is becoming more anchored to the core business of our suppliers. No severe findings were identified during the reviews, but minor gaps were found related to the scope of diversity being too narrow focussing solely on gender, immature procurement practises where sustainability was not embedded as a selection criteria, lack of formalised and science based environmental targets, as well as immaturity on readiness to share relevant data aligned with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. In addition to the reviews conducted by our external auditor, we also conducted an in-depth engagement with an IT consultant supplier, which was identified to have potential negative social impacts related to allegations of harassment and potential\n\nSustainable procurement\n\n100%\n\nof new suppliers screened for environmental  and social issues\n\nEUR 2.5 bn\n\ntotal spend in supply chain",

Improvements were agreed upon as result of the assessment.\n\nIn addition to the reviews, efforts have continued in 2023 to improve the sustainability performance of our branded gift and give-aways. In 2023 we reached 83% of our portfolio meeting defined sustainability requirements like certifications on textiles or recycled material content. The gap to reach 100% is caused by stock product which will be removed from the portfolio when stock is out.\n\nIn 2023 we consolidated our sustainability requirements into a Sustainable Procurement guideline which is embedded in our internal rules framework. The guideline explains how we conduct continuous due diligence, and how we identify and assess areas at risk of negative potential or actual impacts. In addition, it also covers how to cease, prevent, mitigate and remediate adverse impacts on people or the planet. Recommendations obtained from the inaugural UN Global Compact Human Rights Accelerator initiative have been included in the\n\nguideline and adopted into our practices, including principles and tools on how to embed the risk to people.\n\nTo support the implementation of the guideline on Sustainable Procurement, we have empowered and provided dedicated training sessions for our procurement practitioners in areas like human rights, circular economy, scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and biodiversity. We recognise that competence development in the area of sustainability is, and will continue to be, a requirement to stay on top of regulations and topical matters also for our procurement practitioners.\n\nWe seek to promote progress on sustainable procurement at a more structural level and have, together with a range of other large companies, participated in a research initiative with Copenhagen Business School. Here we seek to share knowledge and advance best practices to support progress on the overall sustainable procurement agenda.\n\nAs part of our stakeholder engagement, we remain engaged in Atea Sustainability Focus (ASF) with participation\n\n## Supply chain data\n\nIn the table below, the supply chain data covers Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Luxembourg and Estonia.

ASF is an initiative with the purpose of providing a multi-stakeholder platform for Nordic procurement organisations and the global IT industry to engage in how to achieve more sustainable operations. Through Nordea's representation on the Advisory Board of the ASF initiative, we seek to accelerate sustainability efforts in the IT industry. On an annual basis, the ASF Advisory Board provides recommendations for the Responsible Business Alliance, the world's largest industry coalition dedicated to supply chain sustainability. The coalition consists of more than 145 member companies related to the IT and electronics industry with collective annual revenues of around USD 5.5trn, representing over six million workers in the sup-\n\nply chain. In 2023 we also joined the TCO Certified Purchaser Advisory Forum as one of the founding members. We believe that cross-industry engagement is crucial to achieve change at the scale needed.\n\n## Responsible taxpayer\n\nContributing and being a responsible taxpayer in the jurisdictions in which we operate is one of the key elements in the sustainability work we carry out. Reporting and communicating our tax contributions in a transparent manner is a fundamental part of this work.\n\nIn addition to our own taxes, we also administrate and collect taxes such as VAT, payroll taxes for employees and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal tax contribution\n\nEUR 2,544 m Taxes collected globally\n\n## Taxes collected by the Group 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaxes collected constitute taxes that we do not directly incur but collect from our shareholders, customers and employees on behalf of governments. These include:\n\n## Employee payroll taxes\n\nWe withhold income taxes and other social security contributions when paying remuneration to employees.\n\n## Withholding taxes\n\nWithholding taxes on dividends and interest payments collected by Nordea on behalf of authorities.\n\n## Net VAT collected and reported\n\nWe collect VAT and other sales taxes on sales of taxable products and services to customers. We also report and pay reverse charge VAT on purchases made from other countries, when applicable. Net VAT collected and reported constitutes both VAT charged on our sales as well as reverse charge VAT paid on purchases made from abroad after a deduction of own input VAT has been made. It corresponds to the amounts reported on the final line in the VAT returns submitted to local tax authorities.\n\n## Other taxes\n\nYield tax for Danish and Swedish life & pension companies, Financial Transaction Tax and other taxes collected by Nordea on behalf of authorities.\n\nEUR 2,243 m Taxes paid globally\n\n## Taxes paid by the Group 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaxes that are paid represent a cost to Nordea and impact our financial results. The following taxes are included:\n\n## Corporate income tax\n\nTax paid in 2023 on income in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In some cases, this may include payments in relation to previous years as tax payments are often made in arrears or in advance. Also accrued withholding tax on dividends and interest payments to Nordea entities are included.\n\n## Social security contributions\n\nAs an employer, we pay social security contributions based on the remuneration paid to employees. This item includes, in addition to paid social security contributions, also accrued social security contributions on personnel costs.\n\n## VAT\n\nWe pay value added tax (VAT) and other sales taxes on goods and services. As we can only deduct or claim back a small proportion of the input VAT incurred, the part of an input VAT amount that cannot be deducted, recovered or reclaimed constitutes a tax income for the jurisdictions in which we are registered for VAT purposes.\n\n## Other taxes\n\nOther taxes include mainly bank tax and property taxes.",

Starting from 2023, we voluntarily publish a breakdown of taxes paid and collected by jurisdiction - the main focus being on the four Nordic countries where we have our main markets. This represents a tax contribution report within the Sustainability note, describing our tax governance, our tax strategy and information on taxes paid and collected in a transparent manner, with a commitment to provide this information within the Annual Report timeline to ensure availability of this data to all stakeholders as early as possible. This is an expansion from previous years when only corporate income tax by jurisdiction was presented. Therefore, no comparison data for previous years is available in 2023.\n\n## Our approach to tax\n\nOur approach to tax aims to balance the interest of our stakeholders which include shareholders, customers, governments and tax authorities. This includes handling our own taxes in a responsible, compliant and effective manner, not promoting or acting as a platform for aggressive tax planning as well as being transparent around our tax positions. Nordea's policy statements on tax are described in the Nordea Position Statement on Tax available at nordea.com. The tax strategy and tax policy are adopted by the CEO and reviewed annually by the Board Audit Committee to ensure that emerging risks are addressed.\n\nWe apply tax positions consistent with the tax laws and practices of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we also strive to act in accordance with the purpose of the tax legislation, i.e. the legislators' intention. Furthermore, we are committed to applying the arm's length principle between related parties, in accordance with the OECD as well as internal guidelines on transfer pricing.\n\nNordea is represented in the banking associations and similar organisations in the Nordic countries, and we actively engage in advocacy in relation to tax regulations.\n\n## Tax governance at Nordea\n\nWe operate under the three lines of defence model as the primary principle for managing risks and compliance. To ensure\n\ncoherent governance of taxes, the Nordea Group Tax function is organised as a first line of defence support function, ensuring central oversight over tax matters in the Group. Group Tax supports with advice and recommendations in relation to tax, both in terms of our own taxes and in customer-related tax matters. Group Tax is also represented in special tax forums in each business area and performs quality and risk assessments to ensure proper management of tax risks in the Group. In addition, Group Tax issues guidelines for example for transfer pricing, aggressive tax planning and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS)/the US Foreign Tax Account Compliance Act (FATCA) and holds training sessions for employees on these and other tax-related matters. The tax risk appetite is decided annually by the Group Board within the Group Risk Appetite Framework. Breaches in relation to applicable tax legislation, Nordea's tax policy or any other actions relating to tax perceived as illegal or unethical may be raised through Nordea's whistleblowing function, Raise Your Concern. To ensure tax compliance and accurate disclosures on tax in our financial statements, tax calculations prepared by the Group entities are reviewed by Group Tax, and the Group's effective tax rate is analysed and monitored by Group Tax.\n\n## Statement on commitment to information sharing and a fair tax system\n\nWe are committed to the legal obligations of information sharing within the tax area and to complying with international reporting standards as implemented in national laws or bi- or multilateral conventions as well as other national legal requirements on customer tax reporting. By this we help tax authorities fight tax evasion and international tax crime.\n\nThe international reporting standards implemented in national legislation are mainly the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the International Government Agreements entered into on the basis of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). In addition, there are EU directives on administrative cooperation, including DAC6 regarding reporting of cross-border arrangements.\n\n| Nordea tax contribution EURm       | Finland   | Sweden   | Denmark   | Norway   | Other   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|\n| Taxes paid by the Group            |           |          |           |          |         |         |\n| Corporate income tax 1             | 344       | 395      | 405       | 129      | 86      | 1,358   |\n| Social security contributions      | 16        | 183      | 128       | 54       | 49      | 431     |\n| Irrecoverable / non-deductable VAT | 107       | 110      | 106       | 28       | 6       | 357     |\n| Other                              | 4         | 83       | 8         | 1        | 0       | 97      |\n| TOTAL                              | 471       | 771      | 648       | 212      | 141     | 2,243   |\n| Taxes collected by the Group       |           |          |           |          |         |         |\n| Employee payroll taxes             | 129       | 156      | 316       | 170      | 45      | 816     |\n| Withholding tax                    | 620       | 180      | 0         | 30       | 8       | 839     |\n| Other taxes 2                      | 103       | 117      | 211       | 48       | 0       | 480     |\n| Net VAT collected and reported 3   | 92        | 115      | 120       | 76       | 7       | 410     |\n| TOTAL                              | 945       | 568      | 647       | 324      | 60      | 2,544   |\n\n- 1) Yield tax is not presented here, but in the row Other taxes in Taxes collected\n- 2) Other taxes include yield tax, Financial Transaction Tax and other taxes collected on behalf of authorities.\n- 3) Also including State Sales Tax in the USA (NY).\n- In addition to taxes, Nordea pays several industry-related fees and charges such as resolution fees and deposit guarantee fees, thus contributing to financial stability.",

Governance and culture, cont.\n\nThe CRS is a global standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information between local competent authorities from different countries issued by the OECD. The standard requires financial institutions to identify and document financial accounts held by customers with tax residence in another country or jurisdiction other than their own and report that information to the local competent authorities which will exchange the information. Over 100 jurisdictions have committed to the reporting standard and implemented it in their national legislation.\n\nFATCA is a legal framework requiring financial institutions to identify and report financial accounts held by US persons to the local tax authorities which will subsequently submit the information to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Approximately 100 countries and the US have entered into information exchange agreements.\n\nDAC6 requires intermediaries and taxpayers to disclose potentially aggressive tax planning arrangements to the tax authorities to minimise the use and promotion of such schemes. The tax authorities will report the arrangements to a central database accessible by the authorities of the EU member states. In relation to DAC6, we have implemented a governance procedure across our business areas to enable us to fulfil our reporting obligations as an intermediary.\n\nIn addition to international customer tax reporting, we report financial information about our customers to the tax authorities in each of the Nordic countries. The reporting is a mandatory requirement in the national legislation, and the reported information is used by the tax authorities to prepare taxpayers' income tax returns and for control purposes.\n\n## Fair, effective and balanced tax system\n\nWe support global initiatives and measures for a fair, effective and balanced tax system.\n\nBase erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to tax planning strategies used by multinational enterprises to exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to avoid paying tax. Within the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, over 135 countries and jurisdictions are collaborating on the implementation of 15 measures to tackle tax avoidance, improve the\n\n## Tax strategy key elements\n\n## Key elements in Nordea's approach to tax\n\n## Tax transparency\n\n- \u00b7  Reporting and communicating our tax contributions and tax positions in a transparent manner\n- \u00b7   Committing to the legal obligations of information sharing within the tax area and complying with international reporting standards\n\n## Interaction with tax authorities\n\n- \u00b7  Maintaining a professional, constructive and transparent relationship with the tax authorities and aim at ensuring a good local tax reputation\n\ncoherence of international tax rules and ensure a more transparent tax environment. We support the BEPS measures as a step towards fair taxation.\n\nAs part of this, we also support the OECD Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. Pillar 1 focuses on changing the taxation of digital business. Pillar 2 (Global Anti-Base Erosion - GloBE) will impose a global minimum tax rate of 15% on the profits of multinational enterprises as of 2024. We ensure that we can comply with the GLoBE rules.\n\n## Statement on relationship and collaboration with tax authorities\n\nFor our tax practices, the tax authorities are the key stakeholder in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have a professional, constructive and transparent relationship with the tax authorities and aim at ensuring a good local tax reputation. The collaboration with the tax authorities can be characterised as good with mutual respect and truthful communication.\n\nWe have regular interactions with the tax authorities in each of the Nordic countries - our main markets - where we discuss relevant and any material tax issues. We are proactive and inform about significant transactions and seek clearance through binding rulings when needed.\n\nIn the tax returns we provide clear and complete information, and in some cases we make use of advance pricing agreements. Audits are handled in a timely, professional and effective manner, and feedback received from the tax authorities in audits and from other interactions is used to reduce our tax risk. We always act according to our values.\n\n## Tax management\n\n- \u00b7  Handling our own taxes in a responsible, compliant and effective manner\n- \u00b7  Not promoting or acting as a platform for aggressive tax planning\n- \u00b7  Applying tax positions consistent with the tax laws and practices of the jurisdictions in which we operate",

        "page_content": "## S6 Materiality and impact analysis\n\nAs a member of the core group of founding banks and a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), we are committed to the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. We have performed a combined materiality and impact analysis of our activities, addressing the requirements set out in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and in the PRB. The purpose of the analysis is to identify our most significant sustainability impacts to use as input for our long-term plan for how to integrate sustainability into our business strategy. The combined analysis was undertaken at two levels in parallel:\n\n- \u00b7 A strategic level looking at the SDGs, the Paris Agreement as well as international, regional and national regulations and frameworks to identify material sustainability topics.\n- \u00b7 An impact level using the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks to identify specific targets to drive alignment with and contribution to the sustainability areas identified as significant at the strategic level.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive materiality and impact analysis in 2020 and we have revisited the analysis annually. In 2023 we conducted a new impact analysis of the lending portfolio. The conclusion is that the areas of most impact are still valid. As preparations for CSRD and double materiality assessment is ongoing, there will be significant updates to the process in 2024. Below is a detailed description of the steps in the materiality and impact analysis.\n\n## Materiality analysis at a strategic level\n\nAt the strategic level, we used the SDGs as a basis for identifying potentially relevant material sustainability topics since the Paris Agreement and most of the other relevant regulations and frameworks relate to topics that are accommodated in the SDGs.\n\nThe entire Nordea Group was considered in the analysis, which means all business areas, all products and services as well as internal operations. In order to identify the SDGs most material to Nordea, we assessed which topics could have an impact on us as well as the topics that we can impact. This resulted in the identification of topics relating to eight SDGs that are of significance to us from either a direct or an indirect impact perspective: quality education, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, responsible consumption and production and climate action.\n\n## Impact analysis\n\nIn 2020 we conducted an impact analysis alongside our strategic evaluation, with a specific focus on lending and our balance sheet. This analysis considered the needs of each country and the extent of exposure. It included three of our four business areas: Personal Banking, Business Banking and Large Corporates & Institutions. As a Nordic bank predominantly serving Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the impact analysis naturally covered these countries.\n\nIn 2022 we conducted the impact analysis on investments for Nordea Asset Management(NAM) based on the Investment Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool launched in 2021. Leveraging this tool, we incorporated NAM's asset under management data as of 31 August 2022 and used the global view of needs linked to the SDGs due to the diversity of countries and sectors of NAM's investments.\n\nIn 2023 we performed a new round of impact analysis for our lending portfolio. This initiative was driven by an update to the impact analysis tool, providing more detailed sector-specific information and a more comprehensive data requirement. We used the products perspective for Personal Banking and industry classification for Large Corporates & Institutions and Business Banking. The outcome of the analysis in 2023 aligned with our previous findings in 2020 and\n\n2022, with the same Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) continuing to be of importance for us.\n\nWe populated the UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool with exposure at default (EAD) for both the 2020 and 2023 data for the analysis of our lending portfolio. For a full list of the exact exposure per sector and country for 2023, see Note G11 'Risk and liquidity management'.\n\nWhen populating the impact tools with our data, we could conclude that the same SDGs we had identified at a strategic level were also relevant from a portfolio perspective. In addition, the tool helped us determine that our financing and investments have an impact on resource efficiency and that our financing also has an impact on biodiversity.\n\n## Feeding analysis results into the strategy\n\nAll in all, the combined materiality and impact analysis identified ten SDGs that are of significance to Nordea from an impact perspective - either negative or positive. The ten SDGs were grouped into three strategic pillars: financial strength, climate and environmental action and social responsibility. We also work with upholding peace, justice and strong institutions as part of a strong foundation and we work in partnerships to achieve the goals. These make up our fourth strategic pillar: governance and culture. In the table on the next page we describe the rationale and impact of each significant SDG and map them in relation to the strategic pillars. We have identified climate change and biodiversity as our two significant impact areas.\n\nAll four pillars are connected to 2023-2025 targets, whereas climate and environmental action also has measurable long and medium-term objectives. In addition, we have established sector targets for the climate impact in relation to our financing activities within specific sectors and industries. The objectives and targets are presented in the relevant sections of the report in Note S2 'Financial strength', Note S3 'Climate and environment', Note S4 'Social responsibility' and Note S5 'Governance and culture'.\n\nThe strategy was decided by the Group Leadership Team and supported by the Board in December 2020 and it has been evaluated and confirmed annually in the following years. We have established a comprehensive sustainability governance structure for the integration of sustainability into our business strategy as described on pages 364-365 in Note S5 'Governance and culture'.\n\n## Stakeholder interaction\n\nWhen conducting the materiality and impact analysis in 2020, we worked closely with internal stakeholders from all levels and parts of the organisation and we also had a dedicated group of Board members as an advisory group who were consulted on several occasions. In addition, we sought input from external stakeholders such as academia, NGOs, investors and customers. The purpose was to put our suggested strategy into a holistic context, challenging our approach to ensure that all relevant impacts had been taken into consideration.\n\nWe believe feedback and opinions from all of our customers and stakeholders make us a better bank and business partner. One important stakeholder group with insights from the broader civil society is non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and non-profit organisations. In 2023 we met with several of these organisations to share our practices and be advised on various issues within sustainability.\n\n## UNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks\n\nThe impact analysis was performed using the UNEP FI Port folio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks, which covers the four requirements for undertaking impact analysis: scope, scale of exposure, context and relevance and scale and intensity/salience. They are described in the PRB Reporting and Self- Assessment Template included in a separate indices document available at nordea. com/sustainability.",

Assessment and certification can take place at a number of stages in the built environment life cycle, from design and construction through to operation and refurbishment.\n- C Climate VaR -CVaR (Climate Value at Risk) is a methodology designed to provide a forward-looking and return-based valuation assessment to measure climate-related risks and opportunities in an investment portfolio.\n- C CSRD -Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) modernises and strengthens the rules concerning the social and environmental information that companies have to report. EU law requires large companies and listed companies to publish regular reports on the social and environmental risks they face, and on how their activities impact people and the environment.\n- G GHG Protocol GHG Protocol (the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) establishes global standardised frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. It is the most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standard in the world.\n- GDPR GDPR (the General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR primarily aims to provide individuals with control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying regulation within the EU.\n\nGRI Standards GRI Standards (GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards) are provided by the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and used for sustainability disclosures. The GRI Standards create a common language for organisations and stakeholders, with which the economic, environmental, and social impacts of organisations can be communicated and understood. The GRI Standards are designed to enhance the global comparability and quality of information on these impacts, thereby enabling greater transparency and accountability of organisations.\n\n- I IPCC IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. In October 2019 the IPCC released a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.\n- L LEED LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is an internationally recognised green building certification system, pro viding  third-party  verification that a building or community was designed and built using strategies aimed at improving performance across all the metrics that matter most: energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.\n- M  MSCI Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) is an investment research firm that provides stock indexes, portfolio risk and performance analytics and governance tools to institutional investors and hedge funds.\n- P Paris Agreement At COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015, parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future. The Paris Agreement brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so.\n- S SDGs SDGs (the Sustainable Development Goals) are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The goals are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand in hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality and spur economic growth - all the while tackling climate change and working to preserve oceans and forests.",

In addition the assurance engagement has covered the disclosures on Scope 3 emissions and of Business Loans and Commercial real estate in Lending portfolio for reporting of baseline year of 1 January to 31 December 2019.\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to the Company's self-assessments/assertions of its commitments as a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Banking in the Nordea Sustainability Indices 2023, the assurance engagement has covered the following areas:\n- -  2.1 Impact Analysis\n- -  2.2 Target Setting\n- -  2.3 Target Implementation and Monitoring\n- -  5.1 Governance Structure for Implementation of the Principles\n- \u00b7 EU taxonomy reporting as disclosed in Nordea Bank Abp's Board of Directors' report of Nordea Bank Abp's Annual Report 2023.\n\n## Management's responsibility\n\nThe Management of Nordea Bank Abp is responsible for preparing the Selected sustainability information in accordance with the Reporting criteria as set out in Nordea Bank Abp reporting instructions described in Nordea Bank Abp's Annual Report 2023, the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative, the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry (2022) of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and supplementing Delegated Act's and in the The Principles for Responsible Banking self-assessment (V2) (collectively Reporting criteria). The Management of Nordea Bank Abp is also responsible for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Selected sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Practitioner's independence and quality management\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Oy applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Practitioner's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Selected sustainability information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) 'Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' This Standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited\n\nHelsinki 26 February 2024\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nTiina Puukkoniemi Partner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Sustainability Reporting & Assurance\n\nJukka Paunonen\n\nPartner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT)\n\nassurance about whether the Selected sustainability information is free from material misstatement.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other Selected sustainability information. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Selected sustainability information.\n\nOur work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviewing the senior management of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting Selected sustainability information at the Group level.\n- \u00b7 Assessing how Group employees apply the reporting instructions and procedures of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7 Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7 Considering the disclosure and presentation of the Selected sustainability information.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Nordea Bank Abp's Selected sustainability information for the reporting period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria.\n\nWhen reading our limited assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of Selected sustainability information should be taken into consideration.\n\nOur assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to Nordea Bank Abp for our work, for this report, or for the conclusion that we have reached.",
