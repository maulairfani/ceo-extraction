        "page_content": "For our people to thrive, mental and physical wellbeing is critical. This year, we initiated several activities to better understand how we can support mental and physical health across our business. These activities will culminate in the delivery of a psychosocial risk profile for Orica. We will capture and adopt emerging best practices to continue to manage our psychosocial risks and better protect our people.\n\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of respect and belonging. In FY2023 we proudly launched our new global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, to foster an inclusive organisation with leadership accountability and alignment. We have made good progress, but there is always more work to be done. We will continue working to ensure we have the right culture and environment to attract, retain and develop a diverse, engaged workforce.\n\n## Our external market\n\nOur evolving operating context presents both challenges and opportunities for our company that impact how we create value and deliver on our purpose to sustainably mobilise the earth's resources.\n\nOur technology remains a key enabler, allowing us to deliver smarter solutions to address shifting challenges and priorities. Demand for technology solutions that improve safety, sustainability, productivity and recovery is increasing across our industry, with strong technology adoption rates sustained throughout FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we continue to navigate geopolitical tensions, our global network increases both our exposure and resilience. With global supply constraints expected to remain in the near term, we have continued to ensure the security of supply for our customers, and our manufacturing and supply networks remain a source of competitive advantage to Orica.\n\nWe are cautious of external challenges and are committed to continuing ongoing cost-efficiency initiatives and commercial discipline, diversifying our customer and commodity portfolio, and delivering unique integrated products and solutions to reduce the impact of these external factors.\n\n## Strategy and performance\n\nIn FY2023 we made strong progress towards our strategic priorities, focusing on our four key business verticals: Mining, Quarry and Construction, Digital Solutions and Mining Chemicals. However, there is more we can do to realise the full potential of our expertise and solutions while supporting the global energy transition.\n\nFor the first time, our Orica Digital Solutions vertical was launched as a separate segment and is delivering robust growth in a market with an accelerated focus on digitisation and automation. Increased technology adoption, the launch of new digital solutions offerings including OREPro\u2122 3D Predict and the successful ongoing integration of Axis Mining Technology have contributed to a strong financial result this year.\n\nIn our Mining and Quarry and Construction verticals, we achieved improved performance across all regions. The benefits of commercial discipline, supply security, growth in emerging markets including Africa and Asia and a focus on technology delivery were key drivers. The combined exposure of copper and other future-facing commodities (FFC) remains Orica's largest commodity exposure, in line with demand.\n\nWe successfully launched WebGen\u2122 200 in both underground and surface markets. Our 4D\u2122 bulk systems surface coal technology has transitioned from customer trials to multiple commercial contracts, while 4D\u2122 bulk systems surface metal customer trials are underway in Chile and Canada. In conjunction with our joint venture partner, we launched DragonDet\u2122 Electronic Blasting System (EBS) to service the China market. Globally, we have increased our EBS capacity to realise sourcing and cost benefits through the optimisation of our discrete network.\n\nDespite challenging conditions in our Mining Chemicals vertical, there remains a continued interest in our value-add cyanide services, including our industry-leading sparge technology.\n\nWe are committed to delivering on and accelerating our climate change commitments and decarbonisation efforts. We have anticipated shifting expectations, invested responsibly and are well-positioned to remain competitive in response to macro environments and trends.\n\n- 'Our technology remains a key enabler, allowing us to deliver smarter solutions to address shifting challenges and priorities.'",

        "page_content": "## LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR\n\n## Business performance\n\nThis year, we are pleased to deliver another improved financial performance. Underlying EBIT was $698 million from continuing operations, an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year, reflecting the embedded commercial discipline across our company and a continued focus on the quality of earnings. Statutory NPAT in FY2023 was $296 million, including a $73 million individually significant items expense after tax. We achieved a return on net operating assets of 12.6 per cent, an increase on the previous year driven by our improved earnings performance and strong market conditions.\n\nOur robust financial performance is a testament to the remarkable efforts of our people, who continue to deliver on our strategy amid a volatile external environment. The external market conditions, while challenging, have highlighted the strength of our people and unmatched global asset and technology portfolio, which has allowed us to adapt to and mitigate these conditions.\n\nAs this macroeconomic volatility continues, commercial discipline, strong customer demand, supply security, technology and a diversified customer and commodity mix will support our company throughout the cycle.\n\nIn March this year, we completed the issuance of US$350 million of fixed-rate unsecured notes in the United States Private Placement market, extending Orica's drawn debt maturity. This proactive debt management further strengthens our financial position. Our prudent balance sheet positions us well to continue managing our volatile external environment while supporting further business growth, advancing climate change initiatives and seeking to deliver improved shareholder returns.\n\nWe have continued to apply our disciplined approach to capital expenditure to support the base business and pursue growth opportunities and decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nThe final ordinary dividend of 25.0 cents per share unfranked, brings the total dividend payout to 43.0 cents per share, reflecting a payout ratio of 53 per cent of full year underlying earnings.\n\n## Sustainability performance\n\nThis year has been characterised by continued global volatility and a renewed urgency to deliver positive environmental, social and governance outcomes, particularly on the energy transition to more renewable sources.\n\nSustainability is an integral part of our strategy and at the core of our purpose. We continue to embed sustainability into our strategic, financial and operational decision-making while demonstrating strong environmental stewardship across our value chain.\n\nThis year, we made good progress towards our climate targets. Our net Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 1,704 ktCO2-e, a nine per cent decrease on the previous year and 22 per cent below 2019 baseline levels.\n\nOur achievements so far give us the confidence to accelerate our climate change commitments and accountability. This year, we announced strengthened climate-related targets, accelerating our pathway towards net zero and driving the industry towards a lower-carbon future.\n\nWe have increased our commitment to reduce net operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our direct control by at least 45 per cent by 2030 from 2019 levels, an uplift from our previous 40 per cent commitment. This also includes a new short-term target to reduce net Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30 per cent by 2026, from 2019 levels.\n\nAdditionally, we acknowledge that Scope 3 is a material portion of our overall emissions profile and are committed to partnering with our suppliers and customers to introduce a new ambition of reducing our Scope 3 emissions by 25 per cent by 2035, from 2022 baseline levels.\n\nLastly, we have expanded the boundary of our 2050 net zero ambition, to include Scope 3 emissions associated with our purchased goods and services and the use of our products in blasting activities.\n\nOur accelerated targets and new Scope 3 ambition support our long-term ambition to achieve net zero emissions by latest 2050, creating a clear pathway and evidence-based roadmap to achieve it.\n\nAs the world continues to move towards net zero, the demand for critical minerals will grow, and exploration and production of these commodities will need to increase. In Australia, we have partnered with Origin Energy and The Hydrogen Utility to develop future renewable hydrogen and ammonia opportunities, and with Alpha HPA to support lower-carbon technologies including lithium-ion batteries and LED lighting.\n\nWe continue to deliver technologies and solutions to support our customers' sustainability goals and more sustainable mining outcomes. As we progress our sustainable solutions offering, we expect this to deliver an even more compelling customer proposition over time, creating further commercial advantage for customers and Orica.\n\nAs stakeholder expectations and material regulatory drivers for climate action increase, we are proactively improving our accountability and transparency. This year we will adopt the 'Say on Climate' initiative, allowing our shareholders to consider our Climate Action Report at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Community and relationships\n\nAs a complex global business, we are committed to respecting and upholding the human rights of our people and continually seek to improve our governance to ensure those protections are extended to all people in our value chain. While there is more work to do to address such a complex issue, especially in an increasingly challenging landscape, we will strive to meet our stakeholder expectations and continue to provide leadership and focus on human rights in our industry.\n\nWe continue to work collaboratively with our customers and the communities in which we operate globally, to protect cultural heritage and progress our work with First Nations Peoples around the world.\n\nIn Australia, for example, we are in the early stages of our reconciliation journey, having released our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan in December 2022. Our vision for reconciliation is a future based on mutual respect where we acknowledge and learn from our shared past and forge a path forward for a more hopeful future.",

Mark brings more than 30 years' experience in commercial and senior leadership roles in the chemical industry, across diverse global markets. Vanessa's considerable leadership experience in the resources sector spans over three decades, having held a diverse set of senior leadership roles across operations, environment, community, indigenous affairs, corporate development and sustainability.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAs we look to FY2024, we remain deeply committed to the continued execution of our strategy. As a result of our commercial discipline, strong customer demand and increased earnings from our blasting and digital technology offerings, the strength of our underlying business is expected to continue. While external challenges remain, we will continue to work hard to mitigate the impact of these on our business.\n\nOur prudent balance sheet positions us well to manage the volatile external environment, supporting further business growth, advancing climate change initiatives and delivering improved shareholder returns.\n\nWe are committed to accelerating our sustainability agenda, helping our customers achieve their targets while ensuring we remain competitive in a lower-carbon future.\n\nTo our shareholders, customers and industry partners, we also thank you for your continued support of Orica.\n\nMalcolm Broomhead AO Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSanjeev Gandhi Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn behalf of our Board and the Executive team, we thank the entire Orica team for their ongoing commitment and dedication to delivering on our strategy and purpose.

Our evolving operating context creates risks and presents opportunities that impact how we create value and deliver on our purpose to sustainably mobilise the earth's resources.\n\n## Changing commodity demand\n\n## Expectations in relation to ESG actions\n\n## Climate change and adaptation\n\nLink to key value drivers:\n\nLink to key value drivers:\n\nLink to key value drivers:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal demand for copper, nickel and other FFCs remains strong as the energy transition gains momentum. A continued acceleration in production of these commodities is required for the manufacture of renewable technologies such as batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, which are fundamental to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe continue to actively grow our presence in FFCs, which forms a considerable proportion of mining pipelines in Australia Pacific, Latin America and Africa. This is providing growth opportunities for our blasting business and Orica Digital Solutions, particularly in exploration and resource definition activities, and the processing phases of the mining value chain.\n\nThe energy crisis triggered by the RussiaUkraine conflict continues to drive high demand and prices for thermal coal in the short term as global markets attempt to secure alternative supply of coal and fuel. However, thermal coal production is still expected to decline in the long term. We will continue to supply and service our coal customers throughout the energy transition while diversifying our offerings to prosper in a lower-carbon economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExpectation to deliver positive ESG outcomes continues to evolve and strengthen with a shift towards regulatory requirements, mandatory disclosures and due diligence. Greenwashing and meaningful action on material ESG issues are increasingly important agenda items for stakeholders.\n\nClimate change and decarbonisation continue to be a core focus for our industry. There is an expectation that organisations work to achieve deep decarbonisation in their operations and, increasingly, throughout their supply chains. Our strategic decarbonisation actions to date have created long-term value for Orica while positioning us well to meet rising expectations. We are delivering on and accelerating our decarbonisation targets and remain committed to a coordinated transition that mitigates climate change without leaving people behind.\n\nWe are focused on anticipating and improving performance ahead of regulation, addressing material sustainability issues and providing transparent disclosure of our performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Stakeholders page 34.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the world proceeds with its energy transition and a focus on reducing emissions, the physical impacts of climate change (e.g. flooding, storms, bush fires, etc.) are being increasingly observed across the world.\n\nWe are focused on ensuring our strategy is robust, resilient and considers the potential impacts of physical climate change. To this end, we updated our long-term climate scenarios in FY2023, and for the first time estimated a financial impact of physical climate events under each of the four scenarios that were addressed.\n\nAs a business, we have also commenced a process to assess potential physical climate risks at each of our major sites. These assessments will be used to consider mitigation and/or adaptation measures that can be taken to ensure that our operations are safe and resilient.",

Demand for innovative blasting and digital solutions is increasing, with high customer adoption rates and competition for digital solutions emerging from digital technology providers in other industries. As mines go deeper and ore bodies become more complex and remote, demand for innovative technological solutions continues to increase.\n\nWe employ technology and innovation for continual improvement across our core blasting business and through Orica Digital Solutions. In FY2023, we launched 4D\u2122 bulk systems for underground, allowing for precision matching of blast energy to geological and mine needs and commercialised the next generation of our WebGen\u2122 wireless initiating systems, increasing the safety and efficiency of blasting. Building on our established blasting solutions, our digital growth strategy seeks to expand our portfolio of digital solutions through product technology development and acquisition. The unique value proposition of our digital solutions is the seamless connection of our customers' physical blasting operations and digital platforms. This enables our customers to readily understand and optimise their operations at every step of the value chain through integrated workflows, real-time data and end-to-end predictability, from mine to mill.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInflation is a key driver of volatility and uncertainty for the global economy. Orica is also directly exposed to inflationary impacts as we experience rising costs including salaries and raw material inputs. We mitigate inflation risk through our ongoing cost efficiency initiatives, commercial discipline, diverse customer and commodity portfolio and technology penetration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Material risks and opportunities on page 28 reflect the above trends and further detail how we are managing their impact.\n\nWe are delivering on and accelerating our decarbonisation targets, and remain committed to a coordinated transition that mitigates climate change without leaving people behind.\n\nOur global network increases both our exposure and our resilience to geopolitical tensions and other global events. Maintaining security of supply to our customers is critical to fulfilling our role as a trusted partner. Our strategically located global manufacturing network and thirdparty purchasing arrangements are the key levers we utilise to increase our agility in the context of global uncertainty.\n\nWe maintained security of supply for our customers through the supply chain disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in FY2023, by increasing production at our own ammonium nitrate (AN) plants in Australia and Canada, and continuing to retain access to and purchase third-party explosive grade AN in other regions.\n\nWith global AN supply expected to remain constrained in the near term, our manufacturing and supply networks will continue to be a source of competitive advantage.",

        "page_content": "## SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS\n\n## Workplace safety and wellbeing\n\nOur safety performance has markedly improved this year, with no fatalities or serious life changing injuries occurring in our controlled operations, and a significant reduction in serious injuries. 6\n\n## Major Hazard Management (MHM)\n\nAs in previous years, our priority focus has been on ensuring controls to prevent potential fatal and serious life-changing injuries are in place at all our operations in alignment with our Safety strategy.\n\nMHM is our key program to deliver this strategy, identifying the most serious risks to our people, and implementing controls to manage those risks. Our MHM program covers 19 major hazards common to most of our operations, supplemented by additional Major Hazard information specific to important processes and technologies. We use feedback from our assurance processes and High Potential Incidents (HPIs) to develop and improve our MHM controls. This year, we made significant improvements to the control frameworks for major hazards related to rockfalls and flyrock.\n\nOur Health strategy continues to focus on controlling exposure to material harmful agents, managing fitness for work and building health systems and processes that allow us to enhance the physical and mental wellbeing of our people. Improved exposure monitoring reporting has identified a 32 per cent increase in exposure incidents allowing for the further prioritisation of controls for respirable dust, trinitrotoluene (TNT) and lead exposure. Site-based competency reviews were completed, and additional health resources and capabilities were added to support the implementation of more robust controls.\n\nWe completed over 13,000 control verifications this year, generating more than 3,800 improvement actions. In a program that has taken three years, we also completed the first round of verification for all Major Hazards at all sites. This program generated 12,000 improvement initiatives, 90 per cent of which have been completed.\n\nAdditionally, following a pilot program, we incorporated the Dust Suppression and Mitigation Key Control Performance Statement ('KCPS') and Manager Key Control Verification ('mKCV') material into our MHM program. This material is designed to manage exposure to respirable mine dusts, such as silica, and protect our people from their associated health hazards. It is currently being rolled out by the regions.\n\nWe empower our people to call an immediate stop to work if they observe a potentially hazardous situation to people, environment and cultural heritage. In FY2023, the number of stops called was 4,181. Our employees understand they are empowered, and expected, to call a stop work to ensure safety controls are in place.\n\n## Serious injury performance\n\nIn FY2023, no serious life-changing injuries were recorded. Our Serious Life-Changing Injury Rate (SLCIR) per 200,000 hours worked was 0.000 against a target of under 0.011. Our Serious Injury Case Rate (SICR) was 0.131, which is a 17 per cent improvement on our FY2022 performance, and below our target of 0.149 serious injuries per 200,000 hours worked. With approximately 20-40 per cent of our serious injuries arising from hazardous situations which should be controlled under our MHM program, there is still an opportunity to reduce our SICR target in FY2024.\n\n## Product distribution safety\n\nSafe distribution of our products continues to provide challenges, particularly where activities are outside of Orica's control. In some regions road infrastructure also presents higher risks. There were eight significant distribution events recorded in FY2023, one of which was under Orica's control. The remainder were outside our Orica-controlled network, and occurred during product shipments by third-party providers. One of these events resulted in two fatalities to members of the public, when the light vehicle they were travelling in collided with a truck in a convoy carrying Orica products in Uganda. The event is under investigation and any learnings will be shared across our transport networks.\n\n- 6.   Those where personnel are unable to report for work because of their injuries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety Leadership in Action\n\nOrica's NextGen Safety Leadership program is designed for operational leaders who lead teams on the frontline and manage our Major Hazards every day. NextGen builds an understanding of the role of trust in achieving safe, high performing teams and effectively influencing safety-critical behaviour. The NextGen program gives frontline leaders an understanding of the psychological drivers of behaviour, and the ways successful leaders influence their team's thinking and behaviours. It provides practical tactics to build trust and develop safe behaviours in everyday working situations such as pre-start meetings, inspections, inductions and other safety interactions, and a supportive team environment where these skills can be practised. In FY2023, we completed 91,067 safety leadership interactions, up 9.7 per cent from FY2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more\n\norica.com/Sustainability/ responsible-business",

        "page_content": "## Mental and physical health in the workplace\n\nMental and physical wellbeing is critical for our people to thrive. To understand where we can support mental and physical health across Orica, we designed and implemented a psychosocial risk assessment for parts of the organisation. Psychosocial risks are factors that may increase the risk of workrelated stress and can lead to psychological distress and physical harm. Common psychosocial hazards at work include poor organisational change management, remote or isolated work, poor physical environment, lack of inclusion and equity, bullying and harassment. The work included a surveybased assessment, organisational desktop review and focus group interviews to identify and assess workplace psychosocial factors that can impact our people's mental health and wellbeing. In FY2024, we will analyse and evaluate the data collected to deliver a risk profile for the areas of the organisation studied. This will allow for demonstratable data and risk-based prioritising of effective risk mitigation initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY2024 safety and wellbeing priorities\n\n- Continue to focus on the development and verification of Key Controls within our MHM program.\n- Focus on reducing the highest frequency High Potential Incidents globally.\n- Establish a global Mental Health Strategy.\n\n## Product security\n\nAt Orica, we implement controls to mitigate risks associated with products potentially being used for unintended purposes. In line with our strategy and to demonstrate our commitment to product stewardship, we are implementing Track and Trace across our global sites that manufacture packaged explosives and initiating systems, regardless of whether there is a regulatory requirement to do so.\n\nThe technology enables us to provide detailed information to authorities in the event of lost or stolen product, or, if product is recovered in the hands of unauthorised persons. Track and Trace technology has been proven to facilitate the rapid apprehension of malicious actors and has the added benefit of higher accuracy inventory management. In FY2023, we had zero Severity 3 7 product security incidents and 13 Severity 2 incidents. Of these, 10 occurred outside of Orica's control.\n\nWe regularly communicate to our employees on case studies, learnings across the organisation and the organisational standards and guidance tools in place to support the organisation.\n\nWe participated in the Global Congress on Chemical Security and presented the transport security practices we have implemented in Latin America. The Global Congress is co-sponsored by INTERPOL, the US Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the US Defence Threat Reduction Agency. Orica is a member of the Emerging Threats Industry Advisory Group that is part of the Global Congress. This group is focused on preventing access to explosives precursor chemicals and is working toward the development of a global security standard for transport.\n\n## FY2024 product security priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Continue to implement Track and Trace at sites manufacturing packaged explosives and initiating systems.\n- Actively participate in international forums and advocate for a global transport security standard.\n- 7.   Severity 3: Misuse of security sensitive Orica product to cause actual harm while Orica has no control of the product; or Significant regulatory action taken with total cost of legal action/fines or prosecution between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000; or Sustained adverse media reporting at the national level.\n\nSeverity 2: Loss of a security sensitive Orica product. The product may or may not be recovered and if recovered was in the possession of an unauthorised third party; or Significant regulatory action taken with total cost of legal action/fines or prosecution between $100,000 and $1,000,000; or Sustained adverse media reporting at the sub-national level.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nCyber security is key to protecting Orica's customers, people, products, sites and sensitive information. Orica's cyber strategy is focused on four key outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7   Single pane of glass visibility, correlation and management of cyber events within business, digital and manufacturing systems.\n- \u00b7 Zero trust requiring constant verification of identity, device, access and services.\n- \u00b7   Advanced detection, response and recovery controls to safeguard our data.\n- \u00b7   Relentless focus on foundational controls including privileged access management, multi-factor authentication, security patching, system hardening and testing of backup and recovery.\n\nThe cyber security risk landscape is constantly evolving. To stay ahead of malicious actors, we constantly test and improve our cyber security protections and response plans.\n\nIn FY2023, we implemented a specialist Cyber Physical Systems Protection Platform and related processes across 100 per cent of our key manufacturing sites to decrease the risk of cyber-related impacts. We also implemented multiple engineering controls to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from cyber security events. This includes providing a single security layer across our cloud environments, to protect our public online environments, and identify, prioritise and remediate security vulnerabilities across our systems.\n\nOur Cyber Security team continues to grow in key centres around the world to support the increased capability. We also continue to mature the cyber awareness program with regular training and phishing email simulations that build company-wide capability. We regularly test our cyber security posture and our response preparedness in case of malicious cyber events.\n\n## FY2024 cyber security priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Enhance access management\n- tools and related processes.\n- Refresh Data Loss Prevention Strategy.",

It establishes how we conduct ourselves to deliver on Orica's purpose, vision and strategy. Our Code has five sections aligning with each of Our Charter values - Safety, Respect, Together, Integrity and Excellence.\n\nOur Code was updated in July 2022 to reflect changing societal expectations, strengthen our culture of safety and emphasise our strong position on respect for the communities in which we operate. To accompany the updated Code, a mandatory online training module was rolled out in 14 languages across our global operations.\n\n## Respect@Work\n\nAt Orica, we are committed to providing respectful workplaces in which every employee works in a safe and secure environment that is free from discrimination, vilification, harassment, bullying and victimisation. Orica will not tolerate any unacceptable behaviour and appropriate action will be taken if this policy is breached.\n\nIn line with our commitment to prevent and eliminate non-inclusive behaviours, especially targeting sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, in FY2023, we continued our Respect@ Work approach to embed a culture of respect and safety. Mandatory leader and employee learning modules that clearly define the expectations and obligations of our people within Australia were successfully implemented, resulting in an increase in reported cases. Respect@Work has helped to shift our culture to empower people to speak up, demonstrate practices of building psychological safety and call out unacceptable behaviour.\n\nBased on the success, learnings and constructive feedback received from the Australian roll-out, the global Respect@Work program will be deployed in FY2024.\n\n## Reporting issues and grievances\n\nWe are committed to ensuring everyone can raise concerns freely and without fear. Concerns are dealt with swiftly, fairly and confidentially using our Speak Up service (operated by third-party provider Navex) and authorised internal and external recipients, as per our Whistleblower Policy.\n\nIn FY2023, we received 185 whistleblower reports, equivalent to 1.4 reports per 100 employees. Based on benchmarking supplied by our independent Speak Up service provider, 1.5 reports per 100 employees represents an optimal rate that is high enough to demonstrate broad employee awareness of whistleblowing processes but low enough to indicate there are not excessive issues and grievances.\n\nWhistleblower reports in FY2023 were primarily in relation to bullying and harassment, conflict and inappropriate behaviours. Twice a year, whistleblowing reports are provided to the Board Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nIn FY2023, 57 per cent of reports were partially or fully substantiated.

The review found our program is established, embedded and operating to meet expectations within recognised standards. Identified areas for improvement will be our focus areas for FY2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Code\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nTax transparency is a critical element of ethical business behaviour. We comply with all relevant taxation laws in a responsible manner, with all taxes properly due, accounted for and paid. A tax standard and relevant procedures are in place to ensure our tax compliance obligations are managed. Our effective tax rate before individually significant items was 30 per cent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2023 Tax Transparency Report\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe are committed to respecting and upholding the human rights of our people and those who may be impacted by our operations and business activities. With the mining and metals industry facing increased scrutiny over its human rights obligations and approaches, we continue to work to meet stakeholder expectations and support the industry in raising human rights protections and processes.\n\nOur approach to respecting human rights is guided by internationally recognised standards such as the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the International Labour Organisation's\n\nDeclaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our approach is embedded within Our Charter, Our Code, risk management approach and organisational policies.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nEfforts to address modern slavery require a sustained, united collaboration among various stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organisations, and businesses. While we are actively strengthening our approach to managing modern slavery risks throughout our operations and supply chain, we are cognisant that there is still work to be done.\n\nIn FY2023, we made progress against our commitments and continued to prepare for increasing legislative requirements across Orica's global footprint. We are conscious of strengthening our due diligence across our value chain as we progress into FY2024. We have engaged a professional services firm with human rights and modern slavery experience to complement our team undertaking a modern slavery risk assessment across our operations and supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2023 Modern Slavery Statement\n\n## FY2024 human rights priorities\n\n- Finalise enterprise-wide human rights risk high-level review.\n- Embed modern slavery risk assessment findings and recommendations into enterprise risk management approaches.\n- Renew Australian Reconciliation Action Plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First Nations engagement and cultural heritage protection in Australia\n\nFollowing formal endorsement from Reconciliation Australia, Orica officially launched our first Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia in late 2022.\n\nOur vision for reconciliation is a future based on mutual respect, where we acknowledge and learn from our shared past and forge a path forward for a more hopeful future. We seek to form a genuine connection to the land and waters on which we operate by building respectful and meaningful relationships with First Nations communities who have always cared for their surrounding environments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead about our First Nations-related community investment work in Community and Relationships .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more\n\norica.com/Sustainability/ responsible-business",

EBIT growth in FY2023 reflected growth in volumes, increased utilisation of manufacturing plants, benefits from commercial discipline in both customer and supply contracts, and increased earnings from digital technology offerings. This was offset partly in Mining Chemicals, mainly due to the planned cyanide plant turnaround.\n\n## FY2022 to FY2023 EBIT (A$M)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Russia's contribution\n\nFollowing the sanctions placed on Russia in FY2022, Orica completed the exit of its operating business in Russia in September 2022. There has been no contribution from the Russia operations in FY2023.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nDuring FY2023, the Australian dollar depreciated against key foreign currencies, resulting in a favourable impact to EBIT on translation of foreign currency denominated earnings.\n\n## Volume\n\nAmmonium nitrate (AN) volumes, after removing Russia volumes, increased by two per cent on the pcp reflecting increased mining activity driven by strong commodity demand, and Orica's ability to provide security of supply to customers in a continuing tight supply market.\n\nElectronic blasting systems (EBS) volumes increased by three per cent on the pcp as new contracts ramped up and customers continued the shift away from conventional detonators. EBS accounted for 25 per cent of the volume uplift contribution in EBIT.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing performance improved as a result of increased volumes at the large continuous plants. The pcp result included costs for alternate sourcing of AN during the Carseland plant turnarounds in North America, which have not been repeated in FY2023.\n\n## Mix and margin\n\nEBIT growth across the regions was led by sustained commercial discipline and greater technology penetration.\n\nThe benefit of the high level of recontracting which occurred in the second half of FY2022 has flowed into the FY2023 results.\n\n## Digital Solutions\n\nCustomers' desire for productivity gains and efficiency improvements, as well as increasing ESG obligations, is increasing customer demand for our products and solutions.\n\nGrowth in adoption of digital technologies, the introduction of new solutions, and contribution from the newly acquired Axis Mining Technologies (Axis) business, grew earnings in the new Digital Solutions segment.\n\n## Mining Chemicals\n\nMining Chemicals earnings were impacted by lower production volume at Yarwun due to a turnaround and lower sales of cyanide in Latin America.\n\n## Global Support\n\nGlobal Support costs increased versus the pcp primarily due to inflation and increased non-billable employment costs.",

Demand and supply balance for AN continued to be tight. Security and flexibility of supply remained a key customer need.\n\nTechnology and premium product adoption increased as expected as miners sought to gain productivity and meet sustainability commitments.\n\nHigh gold and copper prices supported increased demand. However, mining activity was impacted by wet weather on the Australian east coast in the first half while recovering in the second half. Coal activity was strong across the region, driven by China's energy consumption.\n\nTight labour market and high inflation in Australia and Asia put cost pressure on mining activity and supply chains.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nEBIT increased by 24 per cent on the pcp driven by contract improvements and increase in volume due to high demand.\n\nIn the Australia and Pacific region, Orica continued to strengthen its market position across coal, metal and Q&C segments with high retention rates and new contract wins.\n\nGrowth in Asia remained strong. Commercial discipline resulted in increased earnings particularly in Indonesia.\n\nTechnology penetration continued to increase. Successful trials of 4D\u2122 across multiple sites were converted to commercial contracts in Australia and Indonesia. WebGen\u2122 experienced significant growth in Asia.\n\nIn manufacturing, turnarounds were completed safely and on budget at Yarwun, Kooragang Island, Bontang and Burrup. Tertiary catalyst abatement was successfully installed at KI's three nitric acid plants, and new improved secondary catalyst was introduced at Bontang and Yarwun.\n\nThere was a controlled shutdown at the Burrup plant in the first half following an operational incident at an ancillary facility. A temporary solution was put in place, allowing Burrup to resume production. One of Orica's strongest competitive advantages is its strong and flexible global supply network; so there has been no impact on customer supply.",

Mining activity in Mexico was impacted by prolonged industrial action late in the financial year.\n\nRising inflation and interest rates impacted customers' operational costs and limited project investment in parts of the United States.\n\nUS domestic gas pricing normalised in the second half, resulting in demand from thermal coal customers returning to normalised levels.\n\nQ&C activity remained robust in the United States, supported by significant government infrastructure investment.\n\nThe extreme cold weather in parts of the United States and Canada also constrained logistics networks and impacted rail availability. Ongoing challenges in the labour market also limited some project investment and further industry growth.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nNorth America delivered a resilient earnings performance despite external challenges caused by extreme weather in the United States and Canada, and prolonged industrial action impacting supply in Mexico.\n\nEBIT increased by 11 per cent year on the pcp. Improved quality of earnings was driven by ongoing strong EBS conversion, technology earnings growth, commercial discipline and cost management initiatives together with favourable contribution from foreign exchange rates. This was partly offset by increased freight costs due to\n\n## Latin America\n\n| Year ended 30 September                     | 2023    | 2022  (restated 4 )   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|----------|\n| External sales revenue (A$M)                | 1,733.1 | 1,650.3               | 5%       |\n| EBITDA 1  (A$M)                             | 104.5   | 99.7                  | 5%       |\n| EBIT 2  (A$M)                               | 54.2    | 53.6                  | 1%       |\n| Total AN and Emulsion Volumes ('000 tonnes) | 924.2   | 973.2                 | (5%)     |\n\n## Market conditions\n\nMining and exploration activity in the region was strong across the region, particularly in Southern Peru. Local community issues and individual union disputes were less severe than in previous years, although there were some logistics interruptions in Chile and Peru.\n\nAN supply chain interruption, due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, continued in FY2023. Continued uncertainty over the availability and price of AN and the current restrictions on Panama Canal capacity added an extra level of complexity.\n\nDemand continued to grow for technology and premium products in Orica's established markets, with more miners looking for solutions to enhance productivity and maintain their licence to operate.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nUnderlying EBIT performance was driven by commercial discipline and technology penetration.\n\nVolume was lower due to mine closures and mine operational issues.\n\nSecurity of supply remained Orica's competitive advantage in the region.\n\nOrica was able to leverage its global makeand-buy network to ensure supply continuity to customers albeit at higher costs.\n\nTechnology adoption and demand for premium products continued to grow within the region, including increased commercial adoption of WebGen\u2122 200 in FY2023.\n\nGlobal manufacturing optimisation activity continues in the region. The Lurin EBS manufacturing capacity and assembly expansion is on track to be the major supplier for Orica's mining customers in the Americas.\n\nextreme weather and prolonged industrial action in Mexico. Depreciation increased versus the pcp following the Carseland plant turnarounds in 2022.\n\nThe region progressed with the strategic transitioning of its commodity base, with strong revenue growth in the metals and Q&C segments in FY2023.\n\nStrong technology growth was supported by conversion to WebGen TM 200, accelerated EBS conversion and increased demand for nitrate-reducing products Fortis\u2122 Protect, Centra\u2122 Protect and Centra\u2122 Gold HV.\n\nThe Carseland AN manufacturing plant continues to perform well following the turnaround completed in 2022.

In the Middle East, growth opportunities continued with Saudi Arabia investing heavily in infrastructure development projects and strongly incentivising mining investments in gold and copper. Robust commodity prices drove strong mining activity for gold, copper and other future-facing commodities across Africa.\n\nThe weak economic outlook and high inflation in Northern Europe continued to impact Q&C activity. Rising costs caused project delays and a reduction in construction activity in the Nordic region.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nEBIT improved by 24 per cent compared to the pcp despite the loss of volume and earnings from Russia. Excluding Russia from FY2022, EBIT was up 124 per cent on the pcp. The improvement was driven by strong growth and margin improvements in Africa, Southern Europe, Middle East and Central Asia, together with favourable foreign exchange movements.\n\nInitiating System volumes and AN volumes were down versus the pcp due to Orica's exit from Russia operations. Excluding Russia, volumes were up 14 per cent on the pcp.\n\nRevenue from gold, copper and other FFC customers increased as Orica's exposure to Africa grew.\n\n## Digital Solutions\n\nIn line with Orica's strategy to grow the Digital Solutions vertical, a new reporting segment was created at the start of the 2023 financial year, comprising three categories; Orebody Intelligence (Axis Mining Technology, HIG and RIG), Blast Design and Execution solutions (BDE), and GroundProbe (previously reported within the Monitor segment).\n\n| Year ended 30 September      |   2023 |   2022  (restated 4 ) | Change   |\n|------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|----------|\n| External sales revenue (A$M) |  211.7 |                 146.6 | 44%      |\n| EBITDA 1  (A$M)              |   96.9 |                  45.2 | 114%     |\n| EBIT 2  (A$M)                |   54.3 |                  26.7 | 103%     |\n\n## Market conditions\n\nDemand for software, sensors and data science continues to increase as orebodies are increasingly becoming harder to find and extract against a backdrop of high commodity prices, and as ESG obligations and commitments increase.\n\nStrong demand also continued for both discrete and integrated end-to-end workflows as customers seek operational efficiency across the mining value chain.\n\nCustomers are also seeking ways to unlock the value of digitisation and automated workflows.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nThe strong EBIT performance compared to the pcp was due to revenue growth across all three sub-verticals, margin improvements, and the contribution of Axis.\n\nSubstantial growth from strong demand was evident across all regions and commodities.\n\nCustomer retention was strong with contribution to segment revenue from recurring contracts such as product leasing, software as a service, monitoring services, and care plans supporting the resilience of earnings. The annual revenue from recurring contracts remained stable, within the\n\ntargeted range of 60 to 70 per cent of segment revenue.\n\nOrica completed the acquisition of Axis Mining Technology in October 2022. The integration has progressed to plan with Orica's ownership opening new international markets for the business. Axis expanded to new markets in Canada, Africa, and the USA in the second half.\n\nDigital Solutions continued to innovate and build integrated workflows. Fifteen new features were released this financial year, with an increasing focus on Artificial Intelligence applications across the portfolio.\n\nQ&C activity was impacted by project delays due to macroeconomic conditions in the Nordic region.\n\nTechnology adoption continued to progress. Earnings from new technology increased versus the pcp, driven by sales of Cyclo\u2122 and WebGen\u2122 200. Orica launched the Exel\u2122 Neo, the world's first lead-free detonator range, further helping customers with their ESG commitments.",

Increased capital expenditure in FY2023 of $439 million (pcp of $349 million) reflects the successful delivery of planned turnarounds, further investment in customer-facing assets at both existing and new customers' sites, the continued optimisation of the discrete manufacturing network, and strategic growth in the Digital Solutions segment. A deposit was received during the year in respect of the planned sale of stage one of the Deer Park non-operational industrial land. The finalisation of the sale is subject to completion requirements.\n\n## Net financing cash flows\n\nOther net financing cashflows include $116.0 million of net repayment on debt facilities and $73.3 million of lease payments. The prior year cash inflows include net proceeds of $681.7 million from an equity raise.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nOrica's capital management framework is based on three key objectives:\n\n- \u00b7  maintaining an investment grade credit rating\n- \u00b7 preserving the flexibility to facilitate future investment alternatives and to respond to changes in the external operating environment\n- \u00b7  maximising returns to shareholders.\n\nAs part of ongoing management of Orica's debt structure and debt maturity profile, during the year $656.0 million of US Private Placement debt was repaid, and $526.0 million of longer dated debt was issued into the US Private Placement bond market. The average tenor of drawn debt at 30 September 2023 was 5.9 years (September 2022: 4.3 years).\n\nS&P Global Ratings reaffirmed Orica's investment grade credit rating of BBB stable during the year.\n\nThe strengthened balance sheet continues to provide resilience in a volatile external environment, supports progress against Orica's strategic priorities and is delivering increased distributions to shareholders.",

Our WebGen\u2122 products are not only transforming mining methods for underground and surface blasting, but also addressing the critical aspects of blasting close to communities.\n\nWebGen\u2122 wireless initiation reduces the complexity of mining when blasting in sensitive areas or close to communities through dust and flyrock suppression, reduction of lightning risk, and optimising the output while reducing the number of times customers have blasting events.\n\nThe wireless initiation makes covering a blast much faster, easier, and safer. Due to the absence of wires and signal tubes on the surface, machines can safely drive over loaded blastholes to dump fill material and place mats with reduced risk of causing unplanned initiation or misfire. WebGen\u2122 allows a blast to be fired at short notice, because there is no need to connect wiring across blastholes and run out firing cables. By using WebGen\u2122 it is easy to change the blasting plan to suit the wind conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more\n\norica.com/wireless\n\n## Exel\u2122 Neo - the world's first lead-free non-electric detonator range\n\nAt Orica, product stewardship extends to designing products to meet compliance and in ways that reduce negative environmental, human health and safety impacts. This year we launched Exel\u2122 Neo. The Neo range of non-electric detonators is produced using a safer and lead-free formulation in Gyttorp, Sweden, close to Orica's customer base in Europe. There are no lead or lead compounds used in the manufacturing process of the pyrotechnic delay compositions and lead is now eliminated from release into the natural environment.\n\nThe newly launched Exel\u2122 Neo range is designed for use in civil infrastructure, and surface and underground mining operations. The lead-free alternative can burn with the same accuracy as our current lead-based delay compositions, as confirmed through independent tests on timing accuracy and scatter patterns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more\n\norica.com/exelneo",

Employees have different expectations of their work environment, and by adapting to these evolving expectations, Orica will continue to be an employer of choice. This supports the realisation of our business strategy. Employee attrition in a tight candidate market further emphasises the importance of Orica prioritising internal mobility and mature talent management practices to retain talent and encourage our people to grow with Orica.\n\n## Listening and engaging with our people\n\n## 'Our Say' pulse survey\n\nIn FY2023, two global culture and engagement pulse surveys, 'Our Say', were deployed across the organisation. Both recorded a healthy participation rate of at least 50 per cent from selected populations. The pulse survey themes career development, leadership, strategy, inclusion and reward and recognition - were directly aligned to global action areas identified through a global employee survey held in FY2022.\n\n## Results demonstrated:\n\n- \u00b7 Orica's leadership results were significantly above external mining global benchmarks.

Employee feedback will continue to be sought in FY2024 through various channels, with key actions identified and used to measure progress as part of our broader employee listening strategy.\n\n## bravO, Orica's global recognition platform\n\nOngoing feedback from our employees has shaped our global program for recognising our people's work. In FY2023, we launched our enterprise-wide recognition platform, bravO. Along with localised employee engagement programs and action plans, bravO encourages peer and leader recognition and appreciation.\n\nIn May 2023, bravO was deployed to all Orica employees across more than 45 countries. It is available in 10 languages to better enable employees to connect, collaborate and recognise each other. In line with our values, peers and leaders are encouraged to share their appreciation for each other and celebrate their contributions across the moments that matter. Since its launch, over 50 per cent of our employees have engaged with bravO, with more than 11,000 recognitions shared. bravO will continue to be embedded across Orica in FY2024 as a critical enabler of a culture of recognition.\n\n## Shaping Orica's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategy\n\nOur Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategy is integral to strengthening Orica's position as an attractive employer for diverse people in an increasingly competitive talent market. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategy has been shaped by our people for our people and grounded by Our Charter values, with a particular focus on Safety and Respect. Workplace culture, inclusivity and feeling valued are high priorities for our diverse and global workforce.\n\n- 2.  Our Say results are the percentage of respondents who agreed with the statement.\n\n## Orica as the home of the future shaper\n\nOrica's activated Employee Value Proposition provides a point of differentiation in the external talent market. Our approach to recruitment and retention focuses on experience, employee advocacy and enhanced employer branding. We have established a new careers website, our global Ambassador Program and advocacy program, and implemented a learning pathway to build our capability to attract and retain talent. By generating momentum, we are driving local activation throughout the employee lifecycle, and ultimately strengthening our position as an employer of choice globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Learn more\n\norica.com/sustainability/peopleand-capabilities\n\nThrough a structured approach, our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategy seeks to foster leader accountability and alignment across Orica, with a focused three-year plan to:\n\n- 1.

We believe a coordinated transition to a net zero emissions economy is required and we are committed to doing our part. Our purpose is to sustainably mobilise the earth's resources and we help our customers responsibly extract the materials that are critical to supporting the lower-carbon transition. As a global leader in mining services, we have a fundamental role to play in addressing climate change.\n\n## Transparency with shareholders\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of accountability and transparency for our shareholders, and as a result, Orica is putting its FY2023 Climate Action Report to a non-binding advisory vote at the 2023 Annual General Meeting. Orica's Climate Action Report articulates how we aim to navigate and capture opportunities in the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\n## FY2023 performance\n\nOur net operational Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions for FY2023 were 1,704 ktCO2-e 3 . This represents a nine per cent decrease from FY2022 and a 22 per cent reduction from our base year of FY2019.\n\nGross Scope 1 GHG emissions decreased by 14 per cent from FY2022, driven primarily by abatement at our continuous manufacturing facilities. This year, low-emissions technology was installed and optimised at our facilities, namely tertiary catalyst abatement at Kooragang Island's three NAPs, and more effective secondary catalyst at one plant each in Bontang, Indonesia and Yarwun, Australia.\n\nAbatement technologies contributed to emissions intensity improvements and lowered site-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity per tonne of AN produced by 20 per cent in FY2023 compared to FY2022. These reductions in emissions intensity were partially offset by increased AN production volumes, which were up six per cent globally from FY2022.\n\nGross Scope 2 GHG emissions remained stable from FY2022, decreasing by 0.2 per cent, with 335 MWh (0.10 per cent) of electricity generated from renewable sources. Despite increased global operations resulting in higher consumption, Scope 2 emissions arising from purchased electricity were down two per cent. This was primarily due to electricity grid factors decreasing\n\nin key operational jurisdictions, including Australia. With the establishment of our company-wide renewable electricity sourcing target, we intend to transition to dual location- and market-based Scope 2 emissions reporting over the coming years.\n\nGlobal Scope 3 emissions increased two per cent in FY2023 compared to FY2022, primarily due to increased global production and associated raw material requirements (including purchased ammonia and AN). Gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions were down one per cent compared to FY2022 as our reductions in operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions were offset by the increase in indirect Scope 3 emissions arising from purchased goods and use of our products.\n\n## Global nitric acid plant emissions intensity (Scope 1 Nitrous Oxide - tCO2-e/t of nitric acid produced)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress towards achieving GHG emissions reduction targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual change in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (ktCO 2 -e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3.

Capital allocation for emissions reduction is delivering positive shareholder returns, with $54 million invested in tertiary abatement projects from FY2021 to FY2023. Given the economic and successful mitigation of process emissions and the development of a strategy for value chain decarbonisation, we are well positioned to strengthen our suite of climate commitments.\n\nWe have refreshed our operational net Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets adding an interim short-term target to reduce emissions by 30 per cent by 2026 and increasing our 2030 target to at least 45 per cent (from 40 per cent).\n\nThese strengthened targets complement the delivery of our purpose and strategy. Reaching our 2030 targets and 2050 net zero emissions ambition requires us to take several actions to reduce emissions, including catalyst abatement, renewable electricity, feedstock and fuel switching, and site efficiencies. We have developed pathways to achieve these objectives. Details on these roadmaps are included in our FY2023 Climate Action Report.\n\nLooking ahead, our most material remaining Scope 1 emissions arise from Kooragang Island, as a result of steam-methane reforming of natural gas in the production of ammonia. Planning and concept studies for alternative chemical feedstocks have commenced, including the co-development of the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub with Origin Energy. Read more in our Climate Action Report.\n\nTo increase accountability internally, we strengthened corporate governance by introducing long-term links between executive remuneration and climate change. A new FY2024-26 long-term incentive (LTI) metric will focus on portfolio resilience and diversification, rewarding outcomes that strengthen business resilience in alignment with our strategic plan.\n\n- 4.   Coverage includes all categories of Scope 3 emissions deemed relevant for Orica under the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard (excluding categories 8, 13 and 14). Base year emissions will be recalculated consistent with GHG Protocol emissions accounting standards if methodology or structural changes occur such as acquisitions or divestments.\n\n## New ambition to decarbonise Scope 3 emissions\n\nWe are committed to playing our part to mitigate the impact of the emissions from our value chain. We are focused on understanding the sources of our Scope 3 emissions, accurately quantifying these emissions and identifying pathways for reduction.\n\nDuring FY2023, we developed an evidencebased roadmap for decarbonisation across our value chain, focusing on upstream and downstream sources. This includes our most material emissions arising from purchased goods and services and the use of bulk explosive products in blasting activities.\n\nWhile our Scope 3 emissions are broadly outside of our direct control, a framework for value chain decarbonisation can be built around the core principles of control,\n\npartner and influence. These principles have informed the development of our value chain decarbonisation roadmap and our ambition to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 25 per cent by 2035, from a 2022 baseline 4 .\n\nAchieving our Scope 3 ambition is dependent on supportive government policy and regulatory frameworks, transparency and collaboration across our value chain and the pace of technology development, commercialisation and adoption. Key enablers in our Scope 3 roadmap include the emergence of low-carbon feedstocks and renewable fuels at commercial scale, key suppliers achieving their emissions reduction commitments, alternate sourcing strategies, consideration of product design and internal governance mechanisms that enable supportive decision-making.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2023 Climate Action Report\n\n## Global Scope 3 emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

By developing lower-carbon products and technologies that improve mining efficiency for our customers and mobilising the resources required to drive the transition, we are positioning Orica to thrive in a lower-carbon world.\n\n## Lower-carbon customer solutions\n\nWe aim to collaborate and enable our customers to achieve their own sustainability goals. Our efforts to decarbonise move us towards producing lower-carbon products and solutions, helping to facilitate the reduction of our customers' value chain emissions profiles. Building on our established suite of blast optimisation and digital products and services that increase the efficiency of resource extraction, we are now developing lower-carbon end products.\n\nIn FY2023, we produced our first emulsifiers using bio-based renewable energy feedstock and are currently undertaking a life cycle assessment to quantify carbon benefits. This innovation will provide opportunity to modify the feedstock of our existing emulsifiers to customers in coming years. As part of our Scope 3 work, a number of low-carbon AN purchase agreements are in early development. We have signed Memorandum of Understanding and Letter of Intent in both EMEA and LATAM to bring products to those customers interested in lower-carbon blasting.\n\n## Increasing exposure to futurefacing commodities\n\nOur purpose is to sustainably mobilise the earth's resources, and our role will be critical as the net zero transition drives exponential demand for the materials required for clean energy technologies. We continue to diversify our commodity exposure and position our portfolio towards higher growth commodities, including FFC. We have a strong global presence in copper and are serving future-facing mines, particularly nickel and lithium in Australia.\n\nIn LATAM, the ongoing shift in the region's commodity exposure reflects the strong recovery in copper customer demand.

        "page_content": "## CLIMATE AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Stewarding natural resources\n\n## Avoiding environmental harm\n\nAt Orica, our focus is on preventing and managing Loss of Containment (LOC) as part of our environmental stewardship approach. Since FY2018, we have recorded no serious environmental incidents. LOC events are decreasing year-on-year and remain below our target of 22 events equal to or greater than severity 1. 5\n\nOur year-on-year improvement reflects a greater internal focus on rapid response and earlier intervention.\n\nAs part of our approach to environmental stewardship, we assess and mitigate key individual sites' environmental risks through our Material Environmental Issues Review (MEIR) program. We apply a global environmental standard across all our regions, going beyond local standards in some jurisdictions. Environmental impacts are remediated where identified.\n\nEnvironmental factors at our sites can include bodies of water, groundwater, soil, air quality, cultural heritage sites and communities in which we operate. We assess environmental pathways at each of our sites to identify and mitigate the risk of spillage and contamination of the surrounding environment, local communities and cultural heritage. Our people are empowered to proactively identify and address key failure points and mitigate environmental risks to avoid spills and contamination.\n\n## Nature and biodiversity\n\nWe acknowledge that effective management of biodiversity is emerging as a core tenet of natural stewardship. There is an increased emphasis on businesses to understand their dependencies and impacts on nature and biodiversity, and develop methods to maintain and regenerate areas of high nature value and prevent significant degradation.\n\nEcosystem health is considered across our operational and commercial activities. To protect biodiversity, we manage environmental risks, water, waste and climate, and we deploy innovative remediation techniques that provide biodiversity co-benefits.\n\nIncreasing stakeholder expectations require a more targeted and sophisticated approach to nature and biodiversity that leverages emerging methods to manage and account for impacts. We are working to determine the most effective approach and gain a more comprehensive understanding of our nature-related risks and opportunities, with consideration to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework 6 and the rapidly evolving landscape of frameworks, including the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD).\n\nThis year, we participated in a pilot study and provided feedback on the learnings and existing barriers to adopting and implementing the TNFD Framework in the Australian context. The pilot study was sponsored by the Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.\n\n## Nature Action 100\n\nNature Action 100, a global investor engagement initiative focused on nature and biodiversity, has identified Orica as one of the first 100 companies to be included as part of its investor engagement process. We will engage proactively and constructively with Nature Action 100 in due course and evolve our disclosures over time.\n\n## Water\n\nThe management of freshwater resources is an issue that directly impacts the communities and ecosystems in which we operate. Orica's assessment of physical climate risks identifies water stress as a key risk hazard. With competition for water resources increasing globally due to multiple pressures, particularly climate change, population growth and pollution, we are increasing our focus on optimising our water use.\n\nOur sites use water from various sources including potable, ground, recycled, surface, recycled and wastewater. We are reducing our dependency on potable water by\n\n- 5.   Severity 1 events are minor, reversible environmental effects. Short-term impacts only in the immediate vicinity of the release. Minor clean-up required with the total cost of any clean-up is less than $100,000.\n- 6.  The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was adopted during the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 15) and outlines a pathway to reach the global vision of a world living in harmony with nature by 2050.\n\nincreasing the efficiency with which we use water and maximising our use of recycled water, wherever possible. We aim to limit the impact on our host communities and ecosystems and increase resilience to water stress.\n\nGross water consumption fell three per cent to 8.35 million kL. While recycled water increased to 31.6 per cent of total consumption, potable water consumption decreased by five per cent' to 2.56 million kL.\n\nIn FY2023, we used 1.57 kL of potable water per tonne of AN manufactured at six material sites.\n\n## Water use at Kooragang Island\n\nMeasuring our water consumption can help us understand our dependencies and where we can place appropriate controls to guide efficient water use. At our Kooragang Island site, several factors influenced water consumption over the reporting period including:\n\n- \u00b7  An underground leak on the potable water supply, which was rectified in September 2022.\n- \u00b7  The reliability of the supply of recycled water has been poor at times across the year, which has required the use of potable water as an alternate supply.\n- \u00b7   We completed a project updating cooling water supply at our Kooragang Island site from potable water to recycled water.\n\nTo manage the potential influence of an El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern in the coming summer, contingency planning has been undertaken to ensure we are well equipped to operate in hotter, drier conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Learn more\n\norica.com/Sustainability/ environment-and-climate-change",

MCi is a carbon capture and utilisation start-up which will react waste carbon dioxide provided by Orica with alkaline materials to produce a range of products for construction, manufacturing and consumer markets.\n\nWe continue to pursue initiatives and partnerships that help us address the circular economy. We formally launched our innovative Cyclo\u2122 service, which reuses waste oil from mine sites to make an emulsion explosive, which displaces virgin oil consumption to reduce our customers' waste and GHG.\n\nIn FY2023, we expanded our strategic partnership with Alpha HPA by investing in a five per cent equity position. Alpha HPA offers a suite of high-purity alumina products, which are critical raw materials for decarbonisation. Highpurity alumina manufactured by Alpha HPA has a carbon footprint potentially 70 per cent lower than traditional production processes. This partnership leverages chemical process synergies between Orica and Alpha HPA. Its proprietary technology requires reagents to purify raw materials - which Orica manufactures at our Yarwun plant, Australia. At the same time, Alpha HPA produces ammonium nitrate solution as a waste byproduct of its manufacturing process which is key to our Yarwun operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more\n\norica.com/sustainability",

Orica's waste profile is variable year-on-year due to waste generated through remediation work.\n\n## FY2024 stewarding natural resources priorities\n\n- Continue to prevent losses of product to soil and water (LOCs) against target of 22 severity 1 events and 0 severity 3 or higher.\n- Expand Orica's portfolio of water stewardship initiatives across material global sites.\n\n## Environmental remediation\n\nWe work with technology and nature to progress environmental remediation where our operations have impacted natural systems and resources. We aim to remediate land to permanently reduce risks to human health and the environment and to allow divestment, reuse and ongoing operations.\n\nEstimated costs for the remediation of soil, groundwater and untreated waste are recognised as provisions or contingent liabilities. In FY2023, a total $280 million of environmental and decommissioning provisions was reported. Refer to Notes to the Financial Statements, Section 6: Provisions for more information.\n\nWe seek out opportunities to identify and implement the best available options to achieve our remediation goals, leveraging knowledge and skills from around the world. Our major remediation projects are associated primarily with legacy issues at our former chemical manufacturing sites but also arise from ongoing manufacturing activities. A core team of remediation experts is responsible for progressing our complex, ongoing contamination remediation projects, working with and providing technical advice to regional SHES 7 teams where necessary.\n\n## Gross waste disposal by destination and waste diverted from landfill (kt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Yarraville thermal remediation Clean Up Plan\n\nIn FY2023, we successfully completed Australia's first use of in situ thermal remediation technology to treat legacy contamination at a site adjacent to our Yarraville site in Victoria, Australia. The organic contaminants were removed through a system of soil and groundwater heating and gas/vapour extraction. The last stages of the site clean up will be completed in FY2024 making the Yarraville site ready for divestment.\n\n## Sixth shipment of HCB waste completed\n\nThe sixth shipment of waste to specialist treatment plants in Sweden and Finland was completed this year, as part of our ongoing program for the safe destruction of the hexachlorobenzene (HCB) stockpile in New South Wales. The program to eliminate this long-term legacy safely and responsibly has seen 11,000 tonnes of HCB shipped to date. We envisage one final shipment of HCB left, to complete in FY2024.\n\n## Gomia phytoremediation continues\n\nSince 2021, we have conducted a large-scale phytoremediation project in Gomia, India, using more than 50,000 seedlings to address elevated concentrations of contaminants including nitrates, lead and perchlorate in surface water and groundwater. Harvesting and planting occurs annually, using indigenous reeds, grasses and lilies to remediate the contaminants. In FY2023, surface water and groundwater monitoring demonstrated significant reductions of all target contaminants. Recent research has also demonstrated the successful composting of harvested shoots, and the efficacy of certain species in stabilising and remediating highly impacted sediments.\n\nPhytoremediation uses plants to consume and absorb contaminants as they grow and prevent contaminants from spreading further to surrounding areas. Through this process, contaminants are either degraded into harmless substances or accumulated and removed when the plants are harvested. Phytoremediation can also be used to immobilise contaminants in the soil in the root zones, and to control or reduce the flow of surface water and groundwater.",

We aim to help our communities grow and flourish by making safety a top priority, responsibly managing natural resources and investing in social and economic development.\n\nOur sustainability function sets and promotes a consistent approach to community engagement, community issues management and community investment. Our primary emphasis is on cultivating enduring partnerships founded upon the principles of trust and transparency. We are committed to delivering impactful and strategically directed investments, following the guidance outlined by our Community Impact and Investment Framework. In FY2023, our community investment totalled $4.1 million.\n\nWe are on track to achieve our five-year community investment target of at least $15 million by 2025, and have contributed $10.2 million since FY2021. This includes investments made through the Orica Impact Fund (OIF), regional spend and matched payroll giving.\n\n## Disaster response and relief\n\nWhen a crisis or a natural disaster hits, our priorities are to ensure the safety of our employees and help the community recover from the devastation. The increase in extreme weather events this year presented impacts to our people and their local communities.\n\nOur local Orica teams step up to support their communities. In Aljustrel, Portugal, the Orica team donated pallets of water bottles to the local Fire Department to support them during the fire season. In Yarwun, Australia, Orica donated large tarps left over from an old project to the State Emergency Services. We have also funded tree replanting following disasters through the Orica Impact Fund. Read more in our Arbor Day Foundation case study online.\n\n## Orica Impact Fund (OIF)\n\nThe OIF was introduced in FY2021 within the scope of our updated Community Investment and Impact Framework. The OIF complements our ongoing community investment efforts in various regions and prioritises support for local endeavours aimed at promoting education and environmental awareness and nurturing a sense of togetherness within communities.\n\nThe OIF grants range from $10,000 to $100,000 annually, for up to three years. The goal is to create significant, tangible effects and facilitate a more profound impact in the communities in which we operate.\n\nThis year we launched round three of OIF with applications received from across our global operations, on behalf of local community partners, more than doubling since FY2021.\n\n## Investing in First Nations communities\n\n## The Clontarf Foundation, Puwampi Unti Kunarr, and Stars, Australia\n\nOrica is committed to our partnership with the Clontarf Foundation as well as supporting other First Nations organisations.\n\nThe Clontarf Foundation helps to improve the education, discipline, life skills, selfesteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men by setting up school engagement and mentoring programs in school communities around Australia. This year we held several site and career planning discussions and hosted the Kalgoorlie Clontarf Academy at our head office.\n\nThis year, we were the major sponsor for the Aboriginal Student Dance Group 'Puwampi Unti Kunarr' who attend a local school in the Hunter Valley, Australia. The dance group\n\nis supported by local Elders and performs at community events. The translation from Wonnarura to English is 'Guardian Spirit of the Hunter Valley Dance Family'.\n\nOrica has also donated to the Stars Foundation, a program that supports Indigenous girls and young women to attend and remain engaged at school, complete Year 12 and move into work or further study.\n\nA total of $80,000 was invested across these initiatives in FY2023.\n\n## The Water and Community Education Project, Philippines\n\nTo support access to safe drinking water, round two of the OIF awarded $65,000 to a water and community education project in the Philippines. The Aeta people of Nabuclod live in a remote area of the Philippines and need to trek 16 kilometres to access potable water and supplies. The project will be used to build a bridge that will help transport water and other goods to and from the community. Funding has also been allocated to the purchase of computers and printers and to enhance internet connectivity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

While the external environment remained challenging, we saw improved performance across all our key financial and non-financial metrics including significant growth in underlying EBIT and importantly, no fatalities or serious life-changing injuries across our controlled operations.\n\nOur people remain central to what we do and aligned with our commitment to building a culture where our people feel engaged, respected and connected, this year we are pleased to have launched our new global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, a key driver in fostering leadership accountability and ensuring an inclusive culture where everyone feels valued. Other examples of the work being undertaken to support the development and wellbeing of our people are outlined on page 58 of the Annual Report. With operations in over 45 countries including Executives located in each of our key regions, we continue to compete with other large global organisations for critical skills. It is important for us to reward our people appropriately through a market competitive remuneration framework that supports pay for performance.\n\n## FY2023 remuneration outcomes\n\nFY2023 short-term incentive (STI) outcomes reflect strong business performance, including improved outcomes across all scorecard metrics.\n\n- \u00b7 For the second consecutive year, we have achieved a reduction in our Serious Injury Case Rate (SICR), with our Major Hazard Management (MHM) program successfully driving a global safety culture.\n- \u00b7 The number of Loss of Containment (LOC) events decreased in FY2023, with increased awareness throughout the organisation since the LOC metric was introduced, and the development of a strong culture of event review and subsequent action.\n- \u00b7 Solid progress has been made to decarbonise Orica's operations leading to a substantial decrease in net Scope 1 and 2 emissions, ahead of our global sustainability plan.\n- \u00b7  Management delivered an increase in underlying EBIT from continuing operations of 24 per cent, and a 10 per cent increase in Return On Net Assets (RONA), on the prior year.\n- \u00b7 Our Cash Generation Efficiency (CGE) improved across the year with close management of our trade working capital balanced with capital expenditure on sustainability and sustenance projects.\n\nThe result of this is a final STI for the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of 147.6 per cent of his target opportunity (98.4 per cent of maximum). Outcomes for the other Executive KMP also reflected their individual and business unit performance, including the delivery of key priorities within their STI strategic components. Further detail on STI outcomes, including associated performance commentary, is provided in Section 3.2 of this report.\n\nThe FY2020-22 long-term incentive (LTI) award (with a performance period from 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2022) did not vest following testing in November 2022, as average RONA performance was below the required threshold. The FY2021-23 LTI award (performance period from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2023) was similarly impacted by a slow recovery from COVID-19 and while the final vesting outcome will be confirmed following the release of Orica's FY2023 full-year results, no vesting is anticipated.",

This was the first FAR increase since his appointment to the CEO role and ensures his remuneration is positioned competitively against our market peers. Following no Executive FAR increases for FY2022, other than for those individuals who had a change in role or accountability, external remuneration benchmarking was also conducted for the other Executive roles in late-2022. Effective 1 January 2023, FAR for the Chief Technology Officer and President Safety, Health, Environment and Security (SHES), Discrete Manufacturing and Supply, was increased by 1.5 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively.\n\n## Outcomes of Executive remuneration framework review\n\nAs foreshadowed in the FY2022 Remuneration Report, the Board undertook a full review of the Executive remuneration framework in FY2023 to test its alignment with Orica's long term objectives under the refreshed strategy and the delivery of shareholder value, whilst also ensuring we are rewarding our people competitively.\n\nWhile the Board agreed that the existing framework remains the most appropriate approach for Orica as we continue to focus on improved efficiency and growth, the review identified opportunities to improve our incentive plan arrangements to better align with business needs. The resultant key changes to the FY2024 Executive remuneration framework are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 A new LTI Business Sustainability metric with a 20 per cent weighting, which recognises the need for Orica to undertake a suite of critical actions in the coming years that will enable us to deliver long term, sustainable returns for our shareholders. To allow for this new metric, the weightings on the existing relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and RONA metrics have been reduced to 40 per cent on each.\n- \u00b7 Expanding the Global Scope 1 & 2 Absolute Emissions Reduction STI metric to a broader Decarbonisation metric which will include a more complete assessment of both our absolute emissions reduction and the delivery of key emissions reduction initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion of an Operational Priorities component within the CEO's STI scorecard which will initially focus on the delivery of key operational milestones and results that are critical to Orica's long term success, providing a more balanced assessment of overall performance. To allow for this component, the RONA metric has been removed, however it remains within the LTI.\n\n- \u00b7 Removal of the post-vesting holding lock on STI deferred shares to better align with our market peers, noting the one-year vesting period remains. This change will first come into effect for the FY2024 STI and no changes will be made in respect of deferred shares granted in prior years, or that will be granted under the FY2023 STI. Long term shareholder alignment will continue to be driven by the LTI design where the two-year post-vesting holding lock will remain, as well as our Executive minimum shareholding policy.\n\nWe appreciate the feedback provided by shareholders during FY2023 and the support for what we are seeking to achieve through our modified Executive incentive plans. Further detail on the review outcomes and full suite of incentive plan changes, including the CEO's FY2024 STI metrics and weightings, is provided in Section 3.7 of this report.\n\nOn behalf of the People and Remuneration Committee, I would like to thank you for your ongoing support and invite you to read the full report in detail.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Karen Moses\n\nChair, People and Remuneration Committee",

Key stakeholder questions\n\n## 2.1  How is Executive remuneration structured?\n\nOur Executive remuneration framework is weighted towards variable (at-risk) remuneration to align with the interests of our shareholders and drive performance against short and long term business objectives.\n\nAssuming target STI and the face value of LTI granted to Executives, the current policy remuneration mix is:\n\n- \u00b7 CEO: 75.0 per cent variable based on performance, 62.5 per cent of which is delivered as deferred shares or performance rights.\n- \u00b7 Other Executives: 64.3 per cent variable based on performance, 50.0 per cent of which is delivered as deferred shares or performance rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2  How does the CEO's fixed equity component operate?\n\nOn Sanjeev Gandhi's appointment to the CEO role in FY2021, the Board determined it appropriate for a portion of his FAR to be delivered in the form of Orica equity to ensure immediate and ongoing alignment with shareholders. At the same time, the CEO's minimum shareholding requirement was increased from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of FAR and the time period allowed to reach this holding reduced from six to five years from appointment. For FY2023, Mr Gandhi again received $300,000 of his FAR as fixed equity, granted in the form of restricted rights which vest monthly in alignment with the payment of fixed cash. The allocation value for the FY2023 grant made in December 2022 was based on the five-day VWAP following FY2022 full-year financial results, consistent with the FY2023-25 LTI plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrant of restricted rights\n\nVesting date\n\nVested rights are exercisable for a five-year period from grant, with the underlying shares subject to a holding lock until the CEO exceeds his minimum shareholding requirement, except where the sale of shares is required to meet tax obligations.\n\nFurther information on the CEO's fixed equity is detailed in Section 3.1.",

Refers to FY2023 Executive STI plan cash payments that will be received by Executives in December 2023 (in accordance with the STI plan rules, associated deferred shares will also be granted in December 2023 to all Executives).\n- 3.  Refers to the face value of Executive equity awards (using the share price at the vesting date) that vested during FY2023. No deferred shares vested in FY2023 due to there being no FY2021 Executive STI and correspondingly no associated deferred shares awarded. The FY2020-22 Executive LTI also did not vest. For Sanjeev Gandhi, the amount includes FY2023 fixed equity which is part of his FAR.\n- 4.  Refers to other benefits and allowances provided (where applicable) including fees relating to managing trailing tax obligations associated with international assignments and/or permanent relocations. Movements in annual leave and long service leave balances have not been shown.\n\nRefer to Section 6.1 for the remuneration table prepared in accordance with the accounting standards.\n\n## 2.5  Will there be any changes to the FY2024 Executive incentives?\n\nDuring FY2023, the Board undertook a formal review of the Executive remuneration framework with a focus on support for Orica's objectives under our refreshed strategy, delivering outcomes aligned with long term shareholder returns, and motivating and retaining our critical talent. The review confirmed that our current framework, with a separate short- and long-term incentive, remains the most appropriate approach as we continue to focus on improved efficiency and growth within our core business whilst also looking towards a more sustainable future. However, several changes to our short- and long-term incentives will be made for FY2024. Refer Section 3.7 for detail on these changes.",

Differences in outcome reflect individual performance and the performance of the business units and/or functions over which the Executives were accountable during FY2023, considering delivery against applicable strategic objectives determined by the Board at the start of the financial year with clear alignment to Orica's corporate plan. Performance commentary for each Executive is outlined in the table below.\n\n| Chief Financial Officer                          | Ms Kerr achieved strong results against her strategic objectives. Proactive debt management, including extending  Orica's drawn debt maturity through completion of the issuance of USD$350m of fixed-rate unsecured notes in  the US Private Placement market and embedding a disciplined approach to capital expenditure across all parts  of the business positions Orica well to continue pursuing growth opportunities and decarbonisation initiatives.

Mr Melbourne oversaw the successful launch of Orica's Digital Solutions vertical, which together with the  integration of Axis Mining Services, is delivering robust growth in a market with an accelerated focus on  digitisation and automation. Growth in new technology returns across all regions was a significant contributor  to Orica's strong financial results and we continue to see increased technology adoption as new digital  and technology solutions are launched or transition from customer trials to commercialisation.

The current face value (and the estimate of the maximum possible total value) of LTI Plan awards granted during FY2023 that are yet to vest, can be determined by multiplying the number of awards shown in Section 6.2 by the current share price of the Company. The minimum possible total value of the awards is nil.

In determining the average RONA outcome, the Board applied discretion to adjust EBIT and Net Operating Assets (being the inputs used to calculate RONA) to remove the acquisition year impact of the Exsa transaction, the impact of the IRFS-16 leasing standards and SaaS accounting changes, the sale of Minova and Nitro Consult, and Orica's exit from Russia. Net Operating Assets was also adjusted to ensure management were not advantaged from impairments to IT and other assets or business impairments that occurred during the performance period. Overall, management were neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the adjustments made and they did not change the vesting outcome.\n\n| FY2020-2022 LTIP      | Final outcome   | Vesting position         | % Rights vesting   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| RONA (3-year average) | 9.6%            | Below threshold of 13.4% | 0%                 |\n\n## 3.4  Equity granted in FY2023\n\nThe table below presents the equity granted at face value to Executive KMP during FY2023.\n\n| Executives (KMP)   | FY2023   LTI 1 $000   | FY2022   Deferred shares  $000   | Other 2 $000   | Total  $000   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Sanjeev Gandhi     | 3,400.0               | 1,057.4                          | 300.0          | 4,757.4       |\n| Kim Kerr           | 960.0                 | -                                | -              | 960.0         |\n| Leah Barlow        | 960.0                 | 189.4                            | -              | 1,149.4       |\n| Angus Melbourne    | 1,120.8               | 301.7                            | -              | 1,422.5       |\n| Total              | 6,440.8               | 1,548.5                          | 300.0          | 8,289.3       |",

        "page_content": "## REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)\n\n## 3.7  Executive remuneration in FY2024\n\nAs a result of the Board's review of Executive remuneration in FY2023, several changes will be made to FY2024 incentives as outlined below.\n\n## Introduction of a Business Sustainability LTI metric\n\nOur refreshed strategy balances continued growth in Orica's underlying business with the need to make substantial operating changes that will ensure the longevity of the company and ongoing returns for our shareholders. The new Business Sustainability metric will encourage our Executives to make these long term decisions and complement our existing RONA and rTSR metrics. For the FY2024-26 LTI award, the Business Sustainability metric will be specifically focused on Portfolio Resilience and Diversification, rewarding for the delivery of initiatives and outcomes that strengthen the resilience and sustainability of Orica's portfolio in alignment with our strategic plan. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Increasing our exposure to and delivering on the growth potential of key emerging markets within Asia, Africa and Latin America;\n- \u00b7 Growth in Orica Digital Solutions through the accelerated adoption of innovative blasting technologies and expansion in high-growth Mining Chemicals markets, balancing our core blasting business and accelerating customer usage of more sustainable solutions; and\n- \u00b7 Moving towards more progressive and sustainable commodities that are essential to a broader energy transition, including rebalancing our portfolio mix towards gold, copper, future-facing commodities and the Quarry and Construction vertical.\n\nIncorporating the new Business Sustainability metric, the FY2024-26 LTI Plan metrics and weightings are shown below:\n\n| Measure                                                                | Weighting   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Return on Net Assets                                                   | 40.0%       |\n| Relative Total Shareholder Return                                      | 40.0%       |\n| Business Sustainability: Portfolio Resilience and Diversification      | 20.0%       |\n| -  Increasing exposure to key emerging markets                         |             |\n| -  Accelerating growth in Orica Digital Solutions and Mining Chemicals |             |\n| -  Moving towards a more progressive and sustainable commodity mix     |             |\n\nThe outcome of the Business Sustainability metric will be determined by the Board at the end of the three-year vesting period considering our progress in each of the relevant areas against a set of challenging internal targets directly aligned to our long term strategic plan. The Board's final vesting assessment and associated rationale will be clearly communicated to investors in the relevant Remuneration Report. With regard to what may be considered commercially sensitive information at the time of vesting, this will include how we have performed against the relevant targets.\n\n## Changes to the STI scorecard\n\nSTI design changes for FY2024 primarily seek to provide a more balanced view of performance with the introduction of an Operational Priorities component within the CEO scorecard and expansion of the existing emissions reduction metric to include an assessment of delivery of key Net Zero Program initiatives that are viewed as being critical to meeting Orica's stated targets.\n\nChanges have also been made to the Financial metrics, taking into consideration investor feedback on RONA duplication and shifting from Cash Generation Efficiency (an internal metric) to Net Operating Cash Flows (an externally reported metric). The latter change will continue to drive a strong focus on cash generation from operations while being a metric that is better understood internally and externally.\n\nA fatalities gateway has also been introduced over our Safety metric such that the outcome of this metric may be reduced to nil in the event of a fatality, having regard to its circumstances.",

At the end of the performance period the Board will conduct a detailed assessment of what has been delivered against a robust set of internal targets to determine the outcome of each metric. Performance commentary will be included in the FY2024 Remuneration Report to provide investors with transparency regarding the basis for the Board's vesting assessment.\n\nExecutive STI scorecards will contain the same measures as in the CEO scorecard, however the weightings will differ and underlying Operational Priorities metrics will be based on each individual's key accountabilities.\n\n## Other structural amendments\n\nIn addition to the incentive design changes outlined above, two structural amendments will also be made:\n\n- \u00b7 Removal of the three-year STI post-vesting holding lock, which the review confirmed as being out of step with ASX-listed market peers and deemed to no longer be necessary given substantial Executive shareholdings, re-introduction of rTSR into the LTI from FY2022 and retention of the two-year LTI post-vesting holding lock. The one-year vesting period on STI deferred shares will remain. This change will first come into effect for the FY2024 STI and no changes will be made in respect of deferred shares granted in prior years, or that will be granted under the FY2023 STI.\n- \u00b7 Effective 1 October 2023, a reduction to the minimum shareholding time period for Executives from six to five years from their appointment to the Executive Committee to align with the CEO time period which was similarly reduced to five years on appointment of the new CEO. All Executives are on-track to achieve their minimum shareholding within this reduced time.",

Committee fees are not paid to the Chairman of the Board.\n\n## 4.2  Fees and other benefits\n\nThe table below sets out the elements of Directors' fees and other benefits applicable for the full FY2023, noting there were no changes to Board or Committee fees from the prior year.\n\n| Fees/benefits       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2023  $   | Included in  shareholder  approved  cap   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Board fees          | Main Board                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |                                           |\n|                     | Chairman  -

Remuneration governance\n\n## 5.1  Responsibility for setting remuneration\n\nThe People and Remuneration Committee is delegated responsibility by the Board for reviewing and making recommendations on our remuneration policies, including policies governing the remuneration of Executives.\n\nActivities of the Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference, which is available on our website at www.orica.com. Among other responsibilities, the Committee assists the Board in its oversight of:\n\n- \u00b7 remuneration policy for Executives\n- \u00b7 level and structure of remuneration for Senior Executives, including STI and LTI plans\n- \u00b7 the Company's compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in respect of remuneration matters; and\n- \u00b7 approval of the allocation of shares and awards under Orica's equity programs.\n\n## 5.2  Use of remuneration advisors during the year\n\nIndependent remuneration advisors are engaged from time to time to provide relevant information including benchmarking and other market data or to give an external perspective that may assist the Committee with its decision making. No remuneration recommendations were received from remuneration advisors during FY2023, as defined under the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## 5.3  Securities dealing policy and Malus\n\n## Securities dealing\n\nAll Executives are required to comply with our Securities' Dealing Policy at all times and in respect of all Orica shares held, including any defined employee share plans. Trading is subject to pre-clearance and is not permitted during designated blackout periods unless there are exceptional circumstances. Executives are prohibited from using any Orica shares as collateral in any margin loan or derivative arrangement.\n\n## Malus\n\nOrica's Malus Standard allows the Board to require any Executive to forfeit in full or in part, any unvested LTIP or deferred STI award as a result of:\n\n- \u00b7 a material misstatement in financial results;\n- \u00b7 behaviour that brings Orica into disrepute or has the potential to do so;\n- \u00b7 serious misconduct; or\n- \u00b7 any other circumstance, which the Board has determined in good faith.\n\nIn considering whether any adjustment is necessary in respect of any or all participants, the Board may take into account the individual's level of responsibility, accountability or influence over the action or inaction, the quantum of the actual loss or damage, any impact on our financial soundness or reputational standing, the extent to which any internal policies, external regulations and/or risk management requirements were breached, and any other relevant matters.",

The requirement is 150 per cent of FAR over five years from appointment for the CEO and following a change in the timeline from 1 October 2023, 50 per cent of FAR over five years from appointment for other Executives.\n\n## Non-executive Directors\n\nTo create alignment between Directors and shareholders, Directors are required to hold (or have a benefit in) shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least one year's base fees. Such holdings must be acquired over a reasonable time using personal funds.\n\nThe table below sets out the number of shares held directly and indirectly by Directors and Executive KMP employed as at 30 September 2023:\n\n|                   | Balance at   1 October  2022   | Acquired 1   | Disposed   | Balance at   30 September  2023   | Minimum  Shareholding  Required 2   | Date Minimum  Shareholding  Required to   be met 3   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Executive KMP     |                                |              |            |                                   |                                     |                                                      |\n| Sanjeev Gandhi 4  | 77,571                         | 19,685       | -          | 97,256                            | 175,112                             | 31 March 2026                                        |\n| Kim Kerr 5        | -                              | 5,421        | -          | 5,421                             | 25,657                              | 10 October 2027                                      |\n| Leah Barlow       | 3,810                          | 4,071        | -          | 7, 8 81                           | 25,657                              | 31 March 2027                                        |\n| Angus Melbourne   | 62,291                         | 745          | -          | 63,036                            | 29,955                              | 31 December 2022                                     |\n| Directors         |                                |              |            |                                   |                                     |                                                      |\n| Malcolm Broomhead | 39,847                         | -            | -          | 39,847                            | 32,713                              |                                                      |\n| John Beevers      | 14,800                         | -            | -          | 14,800                            | 11,353                              |                                                      |\n| Mark Garrett 5    | 12,000                         | -            | -          | 12,000                            | 11,353                              |                                                      |\n| Denise Gibson     | 13,000                         | -            | -          | 13,000                            | 11,353                              |                                                      |\n| Vanessa Guthrie 5 | -                              | -            | -          | -                                 | 11,353                              |                                                      |\n| Karen Moses       | 14,348                         | -            | -          | 14,348                            | 11,353                              |                                                      |\n| Gordon Naylor     | 11,500                         | 3,000        | -          | 14,500                            | 11,353                              |                                                      |\n| Gene Tilbrook     | 16,033                         | -            | -          | 16,033                            | 11,353                              |                                                      |\n\n- 2.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThis is a general purpose Financial Report which has been prepared by a for-profit entity in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001 and complies with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nIt has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, superannuation commitments and investments in financial assets which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars with all amounts rounded off, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest tenth of a million dollars, in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016.\n\nOrica's Directors have included information in this report that they deem to be material and relevant to the understanding of the consolidated financial statements. Where appropriate, comparative information has been reclassified to conform to changes in presentation and to enhance comparability.\n\nDisclosure may be considered material and relevant if the dollar amount is significant due to size or nature, or the information is important to understand the:\n\n- \u00b7 Group's current year results\n- \u00b7 impact of significant changes in Orica's business\n- \u00b7 aspects of the Group's operations that are important to future performance.\n\nExcept as described in note 24, the financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies in line with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\nThe Company's functional and presentation currency is Australian dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\n## Transactions and Balances\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or entity concerned are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies at the balance date are retranslated at closing exchange rates. Non-monetary assets are not retranslated unless they are carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement, except where the application of hedge accounting requires inclusion in other comprehensive income (refer to note 10).\n\n## Consolidation of Group Entities\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at the closing rate at balance date. The results of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at average exchange rates for the period where these do not materially differ from rates applicable on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign operations are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nApplication of the Group accounting policies requires management to make judgements, and to apply estimates and assumptions to future events. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and which are material to the report, are highlighted in the following notes:\n\nNote 3\n\nNet debt and net financing costs\n\nNote 9\n\nImpairment testing of assets\n\nNote 5\n\nWorking capital\n\nNote 11\n\nTaxation\n\nNote 6\n\nProvisions\n\nNote 14\n\nBusinesses and non-controlling interests acquired\n\nNote 7\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\nNote 19\n\nDefined benefit obligations\n\nNote 8\n\nIntangible assets\n\nNote 20\n\nContingent liabilities",

This section highlights the results and performance of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2023.\n\n## 1.  Segment report\n\n## (a)  Identification and description of segments\n\nOrica's reportable segments are based on internal reporting to the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Group's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer).\n\nEffective 1 October 2022, Orica made changes to its segment reporting to provide transparency of the growing Digital Solutions vertical, in line with Orica's refreshed strategy.\n\nThe new Digital Solutions segment comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 Orebody Intelligence (OBI) businesses (Axis Group, HIG and RIG)\n- \u00b7 Blast Design and Execution (BDE) solutions\n- \u00b7 GroundProbe (previously reported within the Orica Monitor segment).\n\nHIG and RIG were previously reported in Australia Pacific & Asia, while BDE was reported across Australia Pacific & Asia, North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East & Africa and Global Support.\n\nThe 2022 financial year segments have been restated to reflect the new segment reporting structure. OBI and BDE results prior to the 2022 financial year are considered to be immaterial and have not been restated.\n\nThere is no change to the Orica Group earnings and balance sheet as previously reported.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the consideration includes a variable amount (net of trade discounts and volume rebates), the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. The majority of the Group's operations are conducted under Master Service Agreements which require customers to place orders for goods or services on a periodic basis. The performance obligations are identified at the point that the customer places the order.\n\n## Supply of products and provision of services\n\nRevenue is derived from contractual agreements for either:\n\n- \u00b7  the supply of products, or\n- \u00b7 the supply of products and the provision of services.\n\nContracts for the supply of products are one performance obligation. Contracts for the supply of products and services include one or two separate performance obligations depending on whether the customer can benefit from the products independently of the services.\n\nProduct revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the contracted point of delivery as this is the point at which the customer gains control of the product and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Group.\n\nService revenue is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group's performance. Where products and services are combined into one single performance obligation, revenue is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance.\n\n## Contracts to provide a designated output\n\nThe provision of goods and services in contracts that provide a designated quantity of output results in the identification of a single performance obligation to deliver an integrated service to the customer. Revenue from this performance obligation is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group's performance.",

Capital management\n\nOrica's objectives when managing capital (net debt and total equity) are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to ensure the capital structure enhances, protects and balances financial flexibility against minimising the cost of capital. This section outlines the principal capital management initiatives that have been undertaken, current year drivers of the Group's cash flows, as well as the key operating assets used and liabilities incurred to support financial performance.\n\n## 3. Net debt and net financing costs\n\nIn order to maintain an appropriate capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend paid to shareholders, utilise a DRP, return capital to shareholders such as through a share buy-back, or issue new equity, in addition to incurring an appropriate level of borrowings. Orica maintains a dividend policy and expects the total dividend payout ratio to be in the range of 40-70 per cent of underlying earnings. It is also expected that the total dividend paid each year will be weighted towards the final dividend.\n\nOrica monitors debt capacity against a number of key credit metrics aligned to debt covenants, principally the gearing ratio (net debt excluding lease liabilities divided by net debt excluding lease liabilities plus equity) and the interest cover ratio (EBIT excluding individually significant items, divided by net financing costs excluding lease interest). These ratios, together with performance measure criteria determined by S&P Global Ratings (S&P), are monitored in support of maintaining an investment grade credit rating, which enables access to borrowings from a range of sources. S&P's key measures include Funds from Operations (FFO)/Debt and Debt/EBITDA. Of note, S&P's rating methodology adjusts Orica's net debt to incorporate post-retirement benefit obligations, asset retirement obligations (i.e. environmental and decommissioning provisions) and leases. Orica's debt covenants are exclusive of these items.\n\nThe Group's target range for gearing is 30-40 per cent and the interest cover financial covenant is two times or greater. Gearing may move outside of the target range for relatively short periods of time after major acquisitions or other significant transactions.\n\nIn addition, the gearing and interest cover ratios are monitored to ensure an adequate buffer against covenant levels applicable to the various financing facilities.\n\n|                                                                                                            | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                                                                            | 2023   $m      | 2022   $m      |\n| The gearing ratio is calculated as follows:                                                                |                |                |\n| Interest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities - continuing operations (refer to note 3a)        | 2,075.4        | 2,167.5        |\n| less cash and cash equivalents - continuing operations                                                     | (1,152.1)      | (1,255.3)      |\n| Total net debt                                                                                             | 923.3          | 912.2          |\n| Total equity                                                                                               | 4,051.8        | 3,729.2        |\n| Total net debt and equity                                                                                  | 4,975.1        | 4,641.4        |\n| Gearing ratio (%)                                                                                          | 18.6%          | 19.7%          |\n| The interest ratio is calculated as follows:                                                               |                |                |\n| Profit before financing costs and income tax (excluding individually significant items - refer to note 1b) | 698.1          | 578.5          |\n| Net financing costs excluding lease interest (note 3b)                                                     | 128.2          | 88.5           |\n| Interest cover ratio (times)                                                                               | 5.4            | 6.5            |",

Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the liabilities on an effective interest basis, unless they are liabilities designated in a fair value relationship in which case they continue to be measured at fair value (refer to note 10).\n\n## Financing costs\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to qualifying assets where interest on funds are capitalised. Interest income and interest expense relating to interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps are presented on a net basis.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nThe Group recognises all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets, with the exception of short-term (12 months or less) and low-value leases, on the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, amounts payable under residual value guarantees and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option which the Group can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the liability. Lease payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee unless the rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined.\n\nLease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the assessed lease term. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount has been reduced to zero.",

Net debt and net financing costs (continued)\n\nThe Group applied judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rates as well as the lease term for some lease contracts that include extension or termination options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right of use assets recognised.\n\nThe Group recognises depreciation of the right of use assets and interest on the lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term.

The expected impairment loss calculation for trade receivables considers both quantitative information from historic credit losses as well as qualitative information on different customer/debtor profiles and segments. The net carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values. A risk assessment process is used for all accounts, with a stop credit process in place for most long overdue accounts.\n\n## (a)(iii)  Trade payables\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised when the Group is required to make future payments as a result of the purchase of goods or as services provided prior to the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of trade payables approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.\n\n## (b)  Non-trade working capital\n\nNon-trade working capital includes all other receivables and payables not related to the purchase of goods and is recognised net of provisions for impairment of $23.0 million (2022: $18.5 million).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nIn the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing the carrying value of various elements of working capital, principally inventory and accounts receivable. Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving inventories. Actual expenses in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences would impact future earnings of the Group.",

The present value of the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located are recognised as a depreciable asset with a corresponding provision being raised where a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nAt each reporting date, the liability is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, timing and estimated cash flows. Any changes in the liability are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than the unwinding of the discount which is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Environmental\n\nAs a result of historical and current operations, certain sites owned or used by the Group will require future remediation activities to address environmental contamination. Estimated costs for the remediation of soil, groundwater and untreated waste are recognised as a provision when:\n\n- \u00b7 there is a present legal or constructive obligation to remediate\n- \u00b7 a probable outflow of economic resources will occur to undertake the remediation\n- \u00b7 the associated costs can be reliably estimated.",

Any costs which result in the total carrying value exceeding the expected proceeds on sale are expensed.\n\nThe amount of each provision reflects the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle each respective obligation having regard to a range of potential scenarios, input from subject matter experts on appropriate remediation techniques and relevant technological advances.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\n## Environmental provisions for other sites\n\nJudgement is required in determining whether a constructive obligation to remediate environmental contamination exists. The Group considers that a constructive obligation exists where there is a current risk to human health or the environment arising from environmental contamination; or where an expectation has been established with a third party (including regulators, employees, neighbours or other stakeholders) that remediation activities will be undertaken.\n\nWhere an obligation (legal or constructive) exists, further judgement is necessary to determine the future expenditure required to settle the obligation. This is due to uncertainties in assumptions regarding the nature or extent of the contamination, the nature of the remedial solution deployed and its effectiveness, the application of relevant laws or regulations and the information available at certain locations where Orica no longer controls the site. Changes in these assumptions may impact future reported provisions. Subject to those factors and taking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature, Orica considers that the provision balances are appropriate based on currently available information. Changes in the assumptions noted above may result in costs incurred in future periods being greater than or less than amounts provided.\n\nEnvironmental provisions are reviewed bi-annually taking into account any material changes to facts or circumstances which would be expected to impact the valuation of the provision.\n\n## Botany groundwater remediation\n\nOrica's historical operations at the Botany Industrial Park resulted in contamination of the soil and groundwater. Due to the complex nature of the chemicals involved and its distribution e.g. Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL), the lack of known practical remediation approaches and the unknown scale of the contamination, a practical solution to completely remediate the contamination has not been found. Orica continues to work in close cooperation with the New South Wales (NSW) Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to address the contamination.\n\nOrica has a current obligation to contain and mitigate the effects of the contamination on the groundwater at the site. Orica and the NSW EPA entered into a Voluntary Management Proposal to contain groundwater contamination while an effective remediation approach to the DNAPL source contamination is identified (refer to contingent environmental liabilities section below).\n\nThe findings from the 2018 review of costs and operational duration of the Groundwater Treatment Plant (GTP) indicated that the cessation of groundwater extraction using the GTP is possible within an 18-year timeframe. After this period, Orica anticipates that the contamination levels will be materially below current levels and will be able to be managed through natural attenuation or less intensive technologies.\n\n## Contingent environmental liabilities\n\nIn addition to the obligations for which an environmental provision has been recognised, certain sites may require future remediation activities to address environmental contamination.\n\nWhere the criteria for recognition of a provision are not met, a contingent liability may exist in the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 Sites where known contamination exists but does not pose a current threat to human health or the environment and there is no current legal or regulatory requirement to remediate. Orica has a possible obligation for remediation which may be confirmed by future events and the likelihood of a future outflow of resources is not remote; or\n- \u00b7 Sites where contamination is known or likely to exist and it is probable that a future outflow of resources will occur, however the financial impact cannot be reliably measured due to uncertainties related to the extent of Orica's remediation obligations or the remediation techniques that may be utilised.\n\nAny costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. Information regarding each class of contingent liability is set out below.\n\n## Botany - remediation of source contamination\n\nSpecifically related to the remediation of DNAPL source contamination a reliable estimate of the costs to complete remediation is not possible given the lack of proven remediation techniques that can be effectively deployed at the site and uncertainty of the scale of the DNAPL contamination.",

Provisions (continued)\n\n## Other sites\n\nContingent liabilities exist with respect to a number of other sites owned or used by Orica where future remediation may be required and possible obligations exist. Orica's obligations with respect to these sites will be confirmed by future events and are subject to the following uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of future outflows:\n\n- \u00b7  Orica's future decisions regarding the use of the site including the timing of any changes to the current use\n- \u00b7 the requirements of laws and regulations at an unknown future point in time and the outcome of discussions with regulators at that time\n- \u00b7 the nature and extent of environmental remediation required at a future point in time\n- \u00b7 the availability and determination of solutions to address identified environmental issues and the cost and duration of the method selected.\n\nDepending on the outcome of these factors, Orica may be required to incur expenditure to prevent or remediate environmental contamination. Due to the uncertainties described above, it is not practicable to estimate the financial effect of the possible future outflows.\n\n## 7.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item and includes capitalised interest. Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nThe right of use asset at initial recognition reflects the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date plus any make good obligations and initial direct costs incurred (refer to note 3). The leases recognised by the Group under AASB 16 predominantly relate to property leases including offices and storage as well as plant & equipment leases including vehicles and rail cars.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nManagement reviews the appropriateness of useful lives of assets at least annually, any changes to useful lives may affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. Depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis using the following useful lives:\n\n|                                | Owned assets   | Right of use assets - leased   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Land                           | Indefinite     | 1 to 70 years                  |\n| Buildings and improvements     | 25 to 40 years | 1 to 20 years                  |\n| Machinery, plant and equipment | 3 to 40 years  | 1 to 15 years                  |",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Identifiable intangibles\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Identifiable intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful life to the Group, being up to thirty years. Expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which it relates and which the Group controls (therefore excluding Software as a Service). All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nManagement reviews the appropriateness of useful lives of intangible assets at least annually. Any changes to useful lives may affect prospective amortisation rates and asset carry values.\n\n## 9.  Impairment testing of assets\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\n## Methodology\n\nFormal impairment tests are carried out annually for goodwill. In addition, formal impairment tests for all assets are performed when there is an indication of impairment. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values at each reporting period, which is used as a source of information to assess for any indications of impairment. External factors, such as changes in expected future prices, costs and other market factors, are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated.\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined using the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to dispose. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group's continued use and does not consider future development. The value in use calculations use cash flow projections which do not exceed five years based on actual operating results and the operating budgets approved by the Board of Directors. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated in the table below. Growth rates are specific to individual cash-generating units (CGUs) and reflect expected future market and economic conditions. Fair value less costs to dispose is the value that would be received in exchange for an asset in an orderly transaction.\n\nThe discount rates applied to the post-tax cash flows are derived using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Adjustments to the rates are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows, including country risk. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management's estimate of the long-term compound annual EBIT growth rate.\n\nIn testing for indications of impairment and performing impairment calculations, assets are considered as collective groups and referred to as CGUs. CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets with each CGU being no larger than a segment. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The test of goodwill and its impairment is undertaken at the segment level, except for the Pilbara CGU which contains the joint operation with Yara International ASA Group.\n\nThe capital outflows required to meet the Group's 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target have been incorporated into the cash flows. As part of the Group's Climate Action Report (CAR) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting, an assessment of climate-related risks and scenario analysis was performed but did not identify a risk of impairment at this time. As the Group's financial and non-financial reporting develops and quantitative analysis is performed, financial implications will continue to be considered and built into future cash flow assumptions.",

The value in use calculations are sensitive to earnings forecasts, changes in discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require an impairment to goodwill. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Growth in post-tax cashflows for the region of $32.3 million from FY2024 to FY2028. This is reliant on achieving future growth in earnings primarily due to securing new or expanded contracts and delivery of value added services and growth in the future facing commodities.\n- \u00b7 A weighted average terminal growth in line with local country economic forecasts of 3.0 per cent.\n- \u00b7 A weighted average post-tax discount rate of 9.6 per cent.\n\n## 2022\n\n## T\u00fcrkiye\n\nThe significant decline in the local economy and the devaluation of the Lira has resulted in the impairment of our investments in Orica Nitro Patlayici Maddeler Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi and GeoNitro Limited. The total impairment charge is $32.7 million of which $18.3 million is attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nAs at 30 September 2022, there was a foreign currency translation reserve balance of $92.4 million debit (of which $45.5 million is attributable to non-controlling interests) which would be released on sale, liquidation, repayment of share capital or abandonment of the entity.\n\n## Russia\n\nThe escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and imposed sanctions and export restrictions, led to our decision to exit the Russian operations.\n\nOn 9 September 2022, the Group executed a contract to sell JSC 'Orica CIS' Joint-Stock Company for cash consideration of $13.1 million. Orica has risk adjusted the proceeds given the trade sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\nThe Group has recognised a gross impairment expense of $89.9 million ($1.8 million was booked as a debit to tax expense), reducing the value of the Russian business to nil. In addition, there was a loss on disposal of $40.6 million ($9.3 million was booked as a credit to tax expense), relating to the release of foreign currency translation reserve as required by Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## EMEA\n\nDue to the issues outlined above impairment testing was performed on the EMEA region. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 no future cashflows for the T\u00fcrkiye or Russian businesses.\n- \u00b7 growth in post-tax cashflows for the region of $17.5 million between FY2023 and FY2027.\n- \u00b7 a weighted average terminal growth rate in line with local country economic forecasts of 4.2 per cent.\n- \u00b7 a weighted average post-tax discount rate of 12.3 per cent.\n\nThe present value of cashflows in EMEA no longer support the carrying value of goodwill. Therefore, the remaining balance of $45.3 million has been impaired.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require a further impairment of other assets.",

Managing Financial Risks\n\nOrica's Review of Operations and Financial Performance highlights funding and other treasury matters as material business risks that could adversely affect the achievement of future business performance.\n\nThis section discusses the principal market and other financial risks that the Group is exposed to and the risk management program, which seeks to mitigate these risks and reduce the volatility of Orica's financial performance.\n\n## 10.  Financial risk management\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nFinancial risk management is carried out centrally by the Group's treasury function under policies approved by the Board.\n\nThe Group's principal financial risks are associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 interest rate risk (note 10a)\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange risk (note 10b)\n- \u00b7 commodity price risk (note 10c)\n- \u00b7 credit risk (note 10d)\n- \u00b7 liquidity risk (note 10e).\n\n## (a)  Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group is primarily exposed to interest rate risk on outstanding interest bearing liabilities. Non-derivative interest bearing assets are predominantly short-term liquid assets. Interest bearing liabilities issued at fixed rates expose the Group to a fair value interest rate risk while borrowings issued at a variable rate give rise to a cash flow interest rate risk.\n\nInterest rate risk on long-term interest bearing liabilities is managed by adjusting the ratio of fixed interest debt to variable interest debt. This is managed within policies determined by the Board via the use of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps. As at September 2023, fixed rate borrowings after the impact of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps were $1,305.0 million (2022: $1,413.9 million), representing a fixed/floating split of 63 per cent and 37 per cent respectively (2022: 65 per cent and 35 per cent).\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nA 10 per cent movement in interest rates without management intervention would have a $4.0 million (2022: $4.6 million) impact on profit before tax and a $3.4 million (2022: $3.2 million) impact on shareholders' equity.\n\n## (b)  Foreign exchange risk\n\n## i)  Foreign exchange risk - transactional\n\nForeign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, recognised asset, liability or cash flow will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency rates.\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to foreign currency borrowings and sales and/or purchases denominated, either directly or indirectly, in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nForeign exchange risk on foreign currency borrowings is managed using cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. As at September 2023, the notional balance of derivative contracts hedging foreign currency debt was $1,197.8 million (2022: $1,106.8 million).\n\nIn regard to foreign currency risk relating to sales and purchases, the Group may hedge up to 100% of committed exposures utilising a declining percentage over time methodology. Only exposures that can be forecast to a high probability are hedged. Transactions can be hedged for up to five years. The derivative instruments used for hedging purchase and sale exposures are bought vanilla option contracts and forward exchange contracts. Forward exchange contracts may be used only under Board policy for committed exposures and anticipated exposures expected to occur within 12 months. Bought vanilla option contracts may be used for all exposures. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are recognised at their fair value. At reporting date, Orica held foreign exchange contracts with a fair value loss of $0.8 million (2022 fair value gain of $8.3 million).",

Derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under Australian Accounting Standards. Board approved policy allows hedging of this exposure in order to reduce the volatility of full year earnings resulting from changes in exchange rates. At reporting date, Orica held no derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures (2022: nil).\n\n## Net investment in foreign operations\n\nHedging of foreign investment exposures is undertaken primarily through originating debt in the functional currency of the foreign operation, or by raising debt in a different currency and swapping the debt to the currency of the foreign operation using derivative financial instruments. The remaining translation exposure is managed, where considered appropriate, using forward foreign exchange contracts, or cross currency interest rate swaps. As at reporting date, 21.2 per cent of the Group's net investment in foreign operations was hedged (2022: 28.9 per cent).",

Financial risk management (continued)\n\n## (c)  Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk refers to the risk that Orica's profit or loss or equity will fluctuate due to changes in commodity prices.\n\nNatural gas or ammonia are the primary feedstocks in Orica's production process.  Orica manages its contract portfolio so that on a mass balance basis it seeks to maintain a low risk position across the contract cycle such that material input cost variations are passed through to customers in price variations through rise and fall adjustments contained in all significant contracts.\n\nThe Group may enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity price risk that is not eliminated via contractual or other commercial arrangements. In FY2022, Orica executed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to source renewable energy for Kooragang Island for 10 years commencing FY2025. At reporting date, the fair value of the PPA was $2.8m loss (2022: nil).\n\nThe following table summarises the impact of changes to the key unobservable inputs on the fair value of the PPA for 2023:\n\n| Key unobservable inputs   | Range of inputs   | Relationship of key unobservable inputs to fair value                                        |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Forward electricity price | +/-10%            | A change in the electricity price by +/-10% would increase/decrease the fair  value by $5.5m |\n\n## (d) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to meet their obligations under a contract or arrangement. The Group is exposed to credit risk from trade and other receivables and financial instrument contracts.\n\nThe creditworthiness of customers is reviewed prior to granting credit, using trade references and credit reference agencies. Credit limits are established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit insurance may be purchased when required.\n\nThe Group manages bank counterparty risk by ensuring that actual and potential exposure is monitored daily against counterparty credit limits, which have been assigned based on counterparty credit ratings. The Group does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit exposures.\n\nOrica's maximum exposure to credit risk as at 30 September is the carrying amount, net of impairment, of the financial assets as detailed in the table below:\n\n| Financial assets            | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 1,152.1   | 1,255.3   |\n| Derivative assets           | 50.4      | 74.7      |\n| Trade and other receivables | 964.4     | 1,086.5   |\n| Total                       | 2,166.9   | 2,416.5   |\n\n## (e)  Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the possibility that there will be insufficient funds available to make payment as and when required.\n\nThe Group manages this risk via:\n\n- \u00b7 maintaining an adequate level of undrawn committed facilities in various currencies that can be drawn upon at short notice\n- \u00b7 using instruments that are readily tradeable in the financial markets\n- \u00b7 monitoring duration of long-term debt\n- \u00b7 spreading, to the extent practicable, the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities\n- \u00b7 comprehensively analysing all forecast inflows and outflows that relate to financial assets and liabilities.\n\nFacilities available and the amounts drawn and undrawn are as follows:\n\n|                                                 | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Unsecured bank overdraft facilities             |            |            |\n| Unsecured bank overdraft facilities available   | 41.9       | 57.1       |\n| Amount of facilities undrawn                    | 41.9       | 57.1       |\n| Committed standby and loan facilities           |            |            |\n| Committed standby and loan facilities available | 3,550.1    | 3,596.6    |\n| Amount of facilities unused                     | 1,466.7    | 1,422.8    |\n\nThe bank overdrafts are payable on demand and are subject to an annual review.

Assumptions are based on market conditions existing at each balance date. The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate marketbased yield curve, which is independently derived and representative of Orica's cost of borrowings.\n\nThe fair value of the PPA is determined using an electricity forecasting model and key inputs used include the contract strike price, forecast electricity volumes, forward NSW electricity spot prices and the credit worthiness of the service provider.\n\nThere have been no reclassifications between Level 1 and Level 2 or changes in the valuation techniques applied since the prior year.\n\nThe following table presents the changes in the PPA fair value (Level 3 instruments) for 2023:\n\n|                                             | Level 3  Instruments  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Opening balance at 1 October 2022           | -                          |\n| Losses recognised in the income statement 1 | (2.8)                      |\n| Closing balance at 30 September 2023        | (2.8)                      |\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables (note 5), and trade and other payables (note 5) approximates their carrying amount due to their short maturity.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities have a carrying amount of $2,075.4 million (2022: $2,167.5 million including discontinued operations). The carrying amount of bank and other loans which are primarily short-term in nature approximates fair value. Private Placement debt which is primarily long-term in nature has a carrying amount of $2,050.0 million (2022: $2,160.7 million) and a fair value of $1,957.1 million (2022: $2,068.0 million). Fair value of Private Placement debt is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yields having regard to timing of cash flows.\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where Orica currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. No financial assets or liabilities are currently held under netting arrangements.\n\nOrica has entered into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but allow for the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances, such as the event of default. As Orica does not presently have a legally enforceable right of set-off, derivatives are presented on a gross basis on the balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\n## 10.  Financial risk management (continued)\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge its exposure to currency, interest rate and commodity price risk exposures arising from operational, financing and investing activities. Where applicable, these instruments are formally designated in hedge relationships as defined by AASB 9. To qualify for hedge accounting the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge, risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement and methodology used for measuring effectiveness.\n\nHedge accounting relationships are categorised according to the nature of the risks being hedged:\n\n| Hedge type           | Description                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fair value hedge     | Hedges the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities.                                                                                            |\n| Cash flow hedge      | Hedges the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with an asset,  liability or highly probable forecast transaction. |\n| Net investment hedge | Hedges the foreign currency translation exposure of the net assets of foreign operations.                                                                        |\n\nCritical terms of hedging instruments and hedged items are transacted to match on a 1:1 ratio by notional values. Matching critical terms enables economic offset thereafter to be determined qualitatively.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness arises primarily from the counterparties' and the Group's own credit risk which is included in the fair value of the derivative hedge instrument but not the hedge item. During the current and prior financial years, there was no material impact on profit or loss resulting from hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nAASB 9 also allows certain costs of hedging to be deferred in equity. Gains or losses associated with 'currency basis' cost of hedging are deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve as they are not material for separate disclosure. The amounts are systematically released to the income statement to align with the hedged exposure.\n\n## Effects of hedge accounting on financial position and performance\n\n## Fair value and cash flow hedges\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group's Private Placement debt and the derivatives which are designated in fair value and/or cash flow hedge relationships to hedge them.\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying amount of the Private Placement debt includes foreign exchange remeasurements to year end rates and fair value adjustments when included in a fair value hedge.\n- \u00b7 The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at year end rates, fair value movements due to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income and ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement.\n- \u00b7 Hedged value represents the carrying amount of the Private Placement debt adjusted for the carrying amount of the designated derivatives.\n\n## Fair value of derivatives 1\n\n| 2023                   | Carrying  amount $m   | Foreign  exchange  notional @  spot $m   | Fair value  interest  rate risk $m   | Balance in  cash flow  hedge  reserve  - gross of  tax 2 $m   | Recognised  in income  statement 3 $m   | Total  carrying  amount  liability/ (asset) $m   | Hedged  value $m   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Private Placement debt | 2,050.0               | (112.7)                                  | 103.0                                | 21.3                                                          | (2.1)                                   | 9.5                                              | 2,059.5            |\n| 2022                   |                       |                                          |                                      |                                                               |                                         |                                                  |                    |\n| Private Placement debt | 2,160.7               | (105.6)                                  | 97.1                                 | 6.5                                                           | (1.0)                                   | (3.0)                                            | 2,157.7            |",

As at 30 September 2023 the Group has entered into a 10 year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) commencing January 2025 and due to expire in December 2035. The PPA is a contract for difference (CfD) derivative financial instrument classified as non-current on the balance sheet. All other derivatives not in a designated hedge arrangement are classified as current on the balance sheet. All derivatives not in a designated hedge arrangement are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised within raw materials and inventories in the income statement. The Group policy is to not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes.",

Taxation\n\nThis section outlines the taxes paid by Orica and the impact tax has on the financial statements.\n\nOrica has operations in more than 45 countries, with customers in more than 100 countries. In 2023, Orica paid $252.7 million (2022: $188.7 million) globally in corporate taxes and payroll taxes. Orica collected and remitted $157.1 million (2022: $200.1 million) globally in GST/VAT.\n\nAs Orica operates in a number of countries around the world, it is subject to local tax rules in each of those countries. Orica's tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of profits earned in different countries with different tax rates, as tax will be due in the country where the profits are earned. Many of the jurisdictions Orica has operations in have headline tax rates lower than 30 per cent.\n\n## 11.

Where amounts are recognised directly in equity the corresponding tax impact is also recognised directly in equity.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation of the asset or settlement of the liability, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date.\n\nA deferred tax asset will be recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets will be reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nOrica Limited is the parent entity in the tax consolidated group comprising all wholly-owned Australian entities.\n\nDue to the existence of a tax sharing agreement between the entities in the tax consolidated group, the parent entity recognises the tax effects of its own transactions and the current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from the subsidiary entities.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\n## 11.  Taxation (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations and is subject to periodic challenges by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business. These include transfer pricing, indirect taxes and transaction-related issues. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\n\nThe Group recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nIn addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be available having regard to the nature and timing of their origination and compliance with the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment.\n\nAssumptions are also made about the application of income tax legislation. These assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty and there is a possibility that changes in circumstances or differences in opinions will alter outcomes which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recorded on the balance sheet and the amount of tax losses and timing differences not yet recognised. In these circumstances, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change, resulting in an impact on the earnings of the Group.\n\n## Contingent tax liabilities\n\nIn the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from tax investigations or legal proceedings. Where management are of the view that potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nConsistent with other companies of the size and diversity of Orica, the Group is the subject of ongoing information requests, investigations and audit activities by tax and regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which Orica operates. Orica co-operates fully with the tax and regulatory authorities. It is possible that Orica may incur fines and/or other penalties as a consequence of these investigations and audits.\n\n## (i)  Brazilian Tax Action\n\nThe Brazilian Taxation Authority (BTA) is claiming unpaid taxes, interest and penalties of approximately $31 million for the 1997 financial year relating to an alleged understatement of income based on an audit of production records. Orica believes BTA has misinterpreted those production records and has received a favourable decision from the Brazilian Civil Court in relation to an excise dispute based on the same factual matter. This decision should support the income tax dispute.\n\nICI plc, the vendor of the business to Orica, has been notified to preserve Orica's rights under the tax indemnity obtained upon acquisition of the business which provides indemnity for amounts exceeding certain limits. The BTA has been granted a bank guarantee of up to approximately $31 million.",

Investments in controlled entities\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the entities that comprise the Group, being the Company (the parent entity) and its subsidiaries as defined in AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nOn acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.\n\nWhen the Group relinquishes control over a subsidiary, it derecognises its share of net assets. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the Company obtains control until such time as the Company ceases to control such entity. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances, transactions and unrealised profits arising within the Group are eliminated in full.\n\nRefer to note 23 for the list of investments in controlled entities.\n\n## 13.  Equity accounted investees and joint operations\n\n## (a)  Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nThe table below shows material investments (based on carrying values). All other investments are included in 'Individually immaterial'.\n\n|                                        |                                      |               | Ownership   | Ownership   | Profit/(loss)   for the year   | Profit/(loss)   for the year   | Consolidated  Carrying value   | Consolidated  Carrying value   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Name                                   | Principal activity                   | Balance  date | 2023  %     | 2022  %     | 2023   $m                      | 2022   $m                      | 2023   $m                      | 2022   $m                      |\n| Nelson Brothers, LLC 1                 | Manufacture and   sale of explosives | 30-Sep        | 50.0        | 50.0        | 14.7                           | 9.0                            | 47.3                           | 43.2                           |\n| Nelson Brothers Mining  Services LLC 1 | Sale of explosives                   | 30-Sep        | 50.0        | 50.0        | 7.2                            | 8.9                            | 38.0                           | 37.2                           |\n| Poly Orica Management  Co., Ltd 2      | Manufacture and   sale of explosives | 31-Dec        | 49.0        | 49.0        | (4.7)                          | 3.8                            | 73.6                           | 78.3                           |\n| Southwest Energy LLC 1                 | Sale of explosives                   | 30-Sep        | 50.0        | 50.0        | 16.8                           | 14.1                           | 165.3                          | 151.0                          |\n| Individually immaterial                | Various                              |               |             |             | (11.7)                         | 4.0                            | 2.3                            | 14.1                           |\n|                                        |                                      |               |             |             | 22.3                           | 39.8                           | 326.5                          | 323.8                          |\n\nAll equity accounted investees disclosed in the table above are classified as joint ventures.",

Equity accounted investees and joint operations (continued)\n\n## (c)  Transactions with equity accounted investees\n\nTransactions during the year with equity accounted investees were:\n\n|                                                          |   2023   $m |   2022   $m |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Sales of goods to equity accounted investees             |       358.4 |       397.2 |\n| Purchase of goods from equity accounted investees        |       156.1 |       118.1 |\n| Dividend income received from equity accounted investees |        22.5 |        23.2 |\n\n## (d)  Transactions with related parties\n\nAll transactions with other related parties are made on normal commercial terms and conditions and in the ordinary course of business.\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nThe Group's interests in investments accounted for using the equity method comprise interests in associates and joint ventures.\n\nAn associate exists where Orica holds an interest in the equity of an entity, generally of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, and is able to significantly influence the decisions of the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Orica recognises its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in the consolidated financial statements under applicable headings.\n\n## 14.  Businesses and non-controlling interests acquired\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group, in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations . On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. The transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.\n\n## Consolidated - 2023\n\n## Acquisitions of business and controlled entities\n\nOn 3 October 2022, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Axis Group, who designs, develops and manufactures specialised geospatial tools and instruments for the mining industry. The purchase price comprises $255.8 million paid on completion and potential earnout payments of up to $90.0 million based on the achievement of cumulative EBITDA generated from 1 October 2022 to 31 December 2024, and contingent on certain key management remaining employed by Orica during the earnout period. An accrual of $26.6 million has been recognised in the income statement as an individually significant Item for 2023.\n\n|                                                                           | Axis Group  2023   $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Consideration                                                             |                         |\n| cash paid                                                                 | 255.8                   |\n| Total consideration                                                       | 255.8                   |\n| Fair value of net assets of businesses acquired                           |                         |\n| Intangibles                                                               | 100.0                   |\n| property, plant and equipment                                             | 2.4                     |\n| deferred tax liability                                                    | (30.0)                  |\n| other assets                                                              | 6.6                     |\n| Total fair value of net assets of businesses/controlled entities acquired | 79.0                    |\n| Goodwill on acquisition                                                   | 176.8                   |",

The entity was fully impaired and the proceeds have been risk adjusted given the trade sanctions imposed on Russia. As required by Australian Accounting Standards, the foreign currency translation reserve was released to the income statement on disposal. This resulted in a gross loss of $40.6 million ($31.3 million loss after tax).",

Businesses disposed and discontinued operations (continued)\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group where the operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group. It represents a separate major line of operations and is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of operation or business.\n\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal date or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\n\nWhen an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement and statement of comprehensive income is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.\n\nDisposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.\n\nSuch disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\n## 16.

Defined benefit obligations\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nContributions to defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised in the income statement in the year in which the expense is incurred.\n\nFor each defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing retirement benefits is expensed in the income statement so as to recognise current and past service costs, interest cost on net liabilities, and the effect of any curtailments or settlements. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group's net liabilities in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the future benefit employees have earned, less the fair value of any plan assets (subject to any restrictions placed).\n\n## (a)  Defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe Group participates in several Australian and overseas defined benefit post-employment plans that provide benefits to employees upon retirement. Plan funding is carried out in accordance with the requirements of trust deeds and the advice of actuaries. Information within these financial statements has been prepared by the local plan external actuaries. Orica were assisted by Willis Towers Watson to consolidate those results globally. During the year, the Group made employer contributions of $24.8 million (2022: $27.0 million) to defined benefit plans. The Group's external actuaries have forecast total employer contributions and benefit payments to defined benefit plans of $19.5 million for the 2024 financial year.\n\n## (b) (i)  Balance Sheet amounts\n\nThe amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:\n\n|                                                              | 2023   $m   | 2022   $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Present value of the funded defined benefit obligations      | 517.7       | 527.6       |\n| Present value of unfunded defined benefit obligations        | 61.4        | 65.4        |\n| Fair value of defined benefit plan assets                    | (507.4)     | (512.8)     |\n| Deficit                                                      | 71.7        | 80.2        |\n| Restrictions on assets recognised                            | 2.6         | 3.1         |\n| Net liability in the balance sheet                           | 74.3        | 83.3        |\n| Amounts comprised of:                                        |             |             |\n| Liabilities                                                  | 81.0        | 91.0        |\n| Assets                                                       | (6.7)       | ( 7.7 )     |\n| Net liability recognised in balance sheet at end of the year | 74.3        | 83.3        |\n\n## (b) (ii)  Amounts recognised in the income statement\n\nThe amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows:\n\n|                                                  |   2023   $m | 2022   $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Current service cost                             |        10.3 | 14.1        |\n| Interest cost on net defined benefit liabilities |         3.2 | 4.5         |\n| Loss/(gain) from immediate recognition           |         0.2 | (0.4)       |\n| Past service cost                                |         0.1 | 0.8         |\n| Total included in employee benefits expense      |        13.8 | 19.0        |",

Other\n\nThis section includes additional financial information that is required by Australian Accounting Standards and which management considers to be relevant information for shareholders.\n\n## 20.  Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities relating to environmental uncertainties are disclosed in note 6 and those relating to taxation in note 11. All others are disclosed below.\n\n## (a)  Guarantees, indemnities and warranties\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has entered into various long-term supply contracts. For some contracts, minimum charges are payable regardless of the level of operations, but the levels of operations are expected to remain above those that would trigger minimum payments.\n- \u00b7 There are guarantees relating to certain leases of property, plant and equipment and other agreements arising in the ordinary course of business.\n- \u00b7 Contracts of sale covering companies and assets which were divested during the current and prior years include commercial warranties and indemnities to the purchasers.\n\n## (b)  Legal, claims and other\n\nThere are a number of legal claims and exposures which arise from the ordinary course of business. Where there is significant uncertainty as to whether a future liability will arise in respect of these items, no amounts have been disclosed. Management have concluded that any potential liabilities over and above those already provided for in the financial statements would not have a material effect on the Group's financial performance.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWhere management are of the view that potential liabilities that arise in the normal course of business have a low probability of crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nThe outcome of currently pending and future legal, judicial, regulatory, administrative and other proceedings of a litigious nature (Proceedings) cannot be predicted with certainty. Proceedings can raise complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, issues regarding the jurisdiction in which each Proceeding is brought and differences in applicable law. Thus, an adverse decision in Proceedings could result in additional costs that are not covered, either wholly or partially, under insurance policies and that could significantly impact the business and results of operations of the Group. Therefore, it is possible that the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Group could be materially affected by an unfavourable outcome of those Proceedings. Proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that from legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes.\n\n## Warranties and Indemnities\n\nIn the course of acquisitions and disposals of businesses and assets, Orica routinely negotiates warranties and indemnities across a range of commercial issues and risks, including environmental risks associated with real property. Management uses the information available and exercises judgement in the overall context of these transactions, in determining the scope and extent of these warranties and indemnities. In assessing Orica's financial position, management relies on warranties and indemnities received, and considers potential exposures on warranties and indemnities provided. It is possible that the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Group could be materially affected if circumstances arise where warranties and indemnities received are not honoured, or for those provided, circumstances change adversely.",

We focused on both the forecast growth for the Group and the impact of the Group's future business plans when assessing the feasibility of the Group's forecast cashflows.\n- \uf0b7 Terminal growth rates: in addition to the uncertainties described above, the Group's models are highly sensitive to changes in terminal growth rates.  This drives additional audit effort specific to their feasibility and consistency of application having regard to the Group's strategy.\n- \uf0b7 Discount rates: these are complicated in\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 We considered the appropriateness of the value in use method applied by the Group to perform the impairment tests against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n- \uf0b7 We assessed key controls in the Group's impairment process, such as Board approval of budgets and review and approval of the impairment assessments, including cash flow forecasts, by examining the review and approval of information by the Board.\n- \uf0b7 We assessed the integrity of the value in use models used, including the accuracy of the underlying calculation formulas.\n- \uf0b7 We compared the forecast cash flows contained in the value in use models to the future business plans approved by the Board.\n- \uf0b7 We compared the Group's cumulative value in use to the Group's market capitalisation to inform our evaluation of the current forecasts incorporated in the models.\n- \uf0b7 We assessed the accuracy of previous Group cash flow forecasts for the respective CGUs to inform our evaluation of current forecasts incorporated in the models.\n- \uf0b7 We assessed the scope, competence and objectivity of the Group's external expert engaged to assist with the determination of the discount rates for the respective CGUs.\n- \uf0b7 Working with our valuation specialists, we independently developed a discount rate range",

We used this knowledge to challenge the Group's current cost estimates and to inform our further procedures.\n- \uf0b7 We obtained a sample of the Group's quotations for remediation activities, as well as other internal and external underlying documentation for the Group's determination of required future activities, their timing and associated cost estimates.  We compared them to the nature, timing and quantum of cost contained in the provision balance. We compared the basis for recognition of the provision with the criteria in the accounting standards.\n- \uf0b7 We made enquiries of various personnel regarding the Group's strategy for remediating certain source contamination and compared these for consistency with our understanding of their strategy and its impact to the provision.\n- \uf0b7 We challenged the Group where provisions were unable to be made for source contamination, in particular for treatment of Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid source areas at Botany, New South Wales, in relation to the existence of information which would enable a reliable estimate of the provision to be made.  We compared this to our understanding of the matter and the criteria in the accounting standards for recording a provision or contingent liability.",

In accordance with the Standard, we have:\n\n- \u00b7 Used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance that we are not aware of any material misstatements in the Content Elements Index whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 Considered relevant internal controls when designing our assurance procedures, however we do not express a conclusion on their effectiveness; and\n\nensured that the engagement team possess the appropriate knowledge, skills and professional competencies.\n\n## Summary of Procedures Performed\n\nOur limited assurance conclusion is based on the evidence obtained from performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviews with management responsible for the preparation of the Content Elements Index and Annual Report 2023;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness and completeness of the disclosures in the Annual Report 2023 that the Contents Elements Index references to;\n- \u00b7 Reconciling the sections and page numbers included in the Content Elements Index to the disclosures within the Annual Report 2023, Materiality Supplement 2023 and the Criteria; and\n- \u00b7 Review of final draft Annual Report 2023 for consistency.\n\n1\n\n2023 KPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

KPMG has not been engaged to provide an assurance conclusion on the appropriateness or the operating effectiveness of the Orica strategy or how Orica creates value, including the governance, strategic management and other key business processes.\n\nThe Annual Report 2023 includes prospective information. Inherent to prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the Annual Report 2023.\n\n## How the Standard Defines Limited Assurance and Material Misstatement\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nMisstatements, including omissions, are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence relevant decisions of the Directors of Orica Limited.\n\n## Use of this Assurance Report\n\nThis report has been prepared for the Directors of Orica Limited for the purpose of providing an assurance conclusion on the Content Elements Index and may not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of Orica Limited, or for any other purpose than that for which it was prepared.\n\n## Management Responsibility\n\nManagement are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 determining that the Criteria is appropriate to meet their needs\n- \u00b7 preparing and presenting the Content Elements Index in accordance with the Criteria; and\n- \u00b7 establishing internal controls that enable the preparation and presentation of the Content Elements Index that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to perform a limited assurance engagement in relation to the Content Elements Index for the 30 September 2023, and to issue an assurance report that includes our conclusion.\n\n## Our Independence and Quality Management\n\nWe have complied with our independence and other relevant ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) issued by the Australian Professional and Ethical Standards Board, and complied with the applicable requirements of Australian Standard on Quality Management 1 to design, implement and operate a system of quality management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPMG\n\nSarah Newman\n\nDirector, KPMG\n\nMelbourne\n\n8 th November 2023\n\n2\n\n2023 KPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the Selected Performance Disclosures have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria defined below.\n\n## What our review covered\n\nWe reviewed the Selected Performance Disclosures in Orica's Annual Report 2023 and Climate Action Report 2023 (collectively the 'Report') as presented in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1 - Selected Performance Disclosures\n\n| Selected Performance Disclosures                                                                                                                          | Value   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| \u25ba  Gross* Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions in kilotonnes of carbon                                                                           | 1,704   |\n| \u25ba  Gross* Scope 3 GHG emissions associated                                                                                                                | 5,040   |\n| ammonia (ktCO2-e)  \u25ba  Scope 1, 2 and 3 (Scope 3 purchased  volumes of AN and ammonia only) GHG  emissions intensity per tonne AN product  sold (tCO2-e/t) | 1.59    |\n| \u25ba  Gross* Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction,  from FY2019 levels (%)                                                                                      | 22      |\n| \u25ba  Potable water consumption intensity per  tonne of AN manufactured for six material  sites (kL/t)                                                       | 1.57    |\n| \u25ba  Women in senior leadership (%)                                                                                                                         | 34.8    |\n\n* In FY2023 gross and net emissions are equivalent.\n\nOther than as described in the preceding paragraphs, which set out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the Report, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or conclusion on this information.\n\n## Criteria applied by Orica\n\nIn preparing the Selected Performance Disclosures, Orica applied the following Criteria:\n\n- \u25ba National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007\n- \u25ba National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Regulations 2008\n- \u25ba National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting\n- (Measurement) Determination , as compiled 1 July 2022\n- \u25ba  International Greenhouse Account Factors, equivalent to the Australian National Greenhouse Account Factors, February 2023\n- \u25ba  Orica's methodology for reporting Scope 3 emissions, progress against emissions reduction targets, potable water consumption intensity and women in senior leadership\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n## Orica's responsibility\n\nOrica's management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the Selected Performance Disclosures in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## EY's responsibility and independence\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.\n\nWe have complied with the independence and relevant ethical requirements, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nThe firm applies Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements , which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our approach to conducting the review\n\nWe conducted this review in accordance with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board's International Standard on Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE3000') and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with Orica on 18 May 2023. That standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.\n\n## Summary of review procedures performed\n\nA review consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Selected Performance Disclosures and related information and applying analytical and other review procedures.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

The procedures we performed included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u25ba  Conducted interviews with personnel to understand the business and reporting process\n- \u25ba  Conducted interviews with key personnel to understand the process for collecting, collating and reporting the Subject Matter during the reporting period\n- \u25ba  Conducted site visits to the Yarwun, Kooragang Island and Deer Park facilities\n- \u25ba  Assessed that the calculation criteria have been correctly applied in accordance with the methodologies outlined in the Criteria\n- \u25ba  Undertook analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data\n- \u25ba  Identified and tested assumptions supporting calculations\n- \u25ba  Tested, on a sample basis, underlying source information to assess the accuracy of the data\n- \u25ba  Checked the presentation of the Subject Matter in the Report\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our review conclusion.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nProcedures performed in a review engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a review engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nWhile we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to assessing aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\nThe greenhouse gas quantification process is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement of greenhouse gases. Additionally, greenhouse gas procedures are subject to estimation and measurement uncertainty resulting from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation\n\nPage 2\n\n## Other matters\n\nWe have not performed assurance procedures in respect of any information relating to prior reporting periods, including those presented in the Selected Performance Disclosures. Our report does not extend to any disclosures or assertions made by Orica relating to future performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in Orica's Annual Report 2023, Climate Action Report 2023 and supporting disclosures online.\n\n## Use of our Assurance Report\n\nWe disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this assurance report to any persons other than management and the Directors of Orica, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\nOur review included web-based information that was available via web links as of the date of this statement. We provide no assurance over changes to the content of this web-based information after the date of this assurance statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnst & Young Melbourne, Australia 08 November 2023",
