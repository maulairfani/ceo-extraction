This  transaction  is  aligned  with  the Company's determination to actively pursue the redemption of the French State support package and the granted  liquidity  measures,  in  combination  with  its recovery path and sustainability ambition.\n\nThis  transaction  issuance  is  framed  into  the  newly  set Air France-KLM's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework,  aligned  with  the  Sustainability-Linked  Bond Principles  ('SLBP')  published  by  the  ICMA  in  June  2020, and  received  a  Second  Party  Opinion  from  Moody's Investors  Services  with  a  qualification  of  'Significant contribution to Sustainability'.\n\nThis  inaugural  transaction  links  the  Company's  financial strategy with its environmental objectives and represents an  additional  milestone  in  Air  France-KLM's  ambition  to achieve its decarbonization targets, as a leader for a more sustainable  aviation  industry.  As  such,  it  represents  the first  public  sustainability-linked  bond  issuance  in  EUR  in the airline sector.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  Group  and  its  airlines  are  fully committed  to  reducing  their  environmental  footprint  as part of a transparent  and  responsible  approach  to sustainability, with the objective to diminish its well-to-wake scope 1 and 3 jet fuel greenhouse gas protocol emissions by 30% per revenue tonne kilometer (RTK) by 2030 compared to  2019.  In  that  context,  the  SBTi's  Target  Validation  Team approved in December 2022 the Group's scope 1 and scope 3 emissions reduction targets and has confirmed that they are in line with a well-below 2\u00b0C objective, as determined by the Paris Agreement signed in 2015.\n\nThe  Sustainability-Linked  Financing  Framework  and  the Second-Party Opinion are available at:\n\nhttps://www.airfranceklm.com/en/finance/investors-andanalysts/debt\n\nAn application will be made for the bonds to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris.\n\n## On January 27, 2023\n\nAir France-KLM continues to renew its fleet and places firm order for 4 Airbus A350F full freighter aircraft for Martinair (part of the KLM Group), and 3 A350-900 passenger aircraft for Air France.\n\nAir  France-KLM's  fleet  renewal  continues  in  an  ongoing effort to improve the Group's economic and environmental performance.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  Group  announced  today  that  the Air France-KLM Board of Directors has approved:\n\n## a) A firm order for 4 Airbus A350F full freighter aircraft, to be operated by Martinair on behalf of KLM Cargo.\n\nThese Airbus A350Fs will replace the fleet of 4 Boeing 747Fs currently operated by KLM Cargo and Martinair. They will be based at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.\n\nIn December 2021, Air France-KLM had placed an order for 4 Airbus A350F full freighter aircraft for Air France.\n\nDeliveries to Martinair and Air France are expected as of the second half of 2026, meaning both airlines will be  among  the  launch  operators  of  the  A350F  full freighter.\n\nBenefiting  from  the  latest  technological  innovations and powered by Rolls-Royce Trent  XWB-97 engines, the  Airbus  A350F  delivers  significantly  improved environmental  performance  with  an  over  40% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the Boeing 747F. Its noise footprint is also 50% lower;\n\n## b) A  firm  order  for  3  additional  Airbus  A350-900 passenger aircraft for Air France, bringing the total number of A350-900 expected by Air France to 41.\n\nThese  Airbus  A350s  will  replace  previous-generation aircraft and be based at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.\n\nThey will feature a three-class configuration (Business, Premium Economy, Economy).\n\nDeliveries  are  expected  in  2024.  Fleet  renewal  is  the key driver to cutting CO2 emissions, with immediate effect. Alongside the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)  and  eco-piloting,  it  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  the Group's  decarbonization  trajectory,  which  aims  for  a 30% reduction of CO2 emissions per passenger km by 2030 compared to 2019. These targets have recently been approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).",

'I am delighted to announce that KLM  and  Air  France's  cargo  divisions  will  soon operate the quietest and most advanced full freighter aircraft  available  on  the  market,  the  Airbus  A350F. This  investment is  evidence  of  our  confidence  in  the sustainable  growth  of  the  cargo  market  in  the coming years, as well as our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint. I am also very happy to announce that Air France will continue to accelerate the  renewal  of  its  fleet  with  the  addition  of  3  A350 passenger  aircraft.  Since  its  entry  into  service  at Air France, the A350-900 has proved to be a reliable and efficient  aircraft,  as  well  as  a  game  changer  in terms  of  reduction  of  CO2  per  passenger  km  and noise emissions. We will continue our efforts to renew our  fleet  as  quickly  as  possible  to  provide  our customers with the best customer experience possible and to meet our ambitious decarbonization targets '.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Air France-KLM operated a fleet of 506 aircraft, including 6 full freighters.\n\n## On March 15, 2023\n\nAir France-KLM announces the full repayment of its bank loan guaranteed by the French State ('PGE'), making a final step towards the full repayment of States support liquidity measures.\n\n- a) Air France-KLM  has  fully  repaid  the  remaining \u20ac2.5  billion  from  its  initial  \u20ac4  billion  Bank  loan guaranteed by the French State, granted during the Covid-19 crisis;\n- b) The  Group's  solid  cash  position  combined  with  the \u20ac1 billion proceeds of the Sustainability-Linked Bond issued in January 2023, has enabled to accelerate and close the repayment in full of the outstanding 'PGE';\n- c) This full repayment will contribute to smoothing the Group's debt profile, reduce financial costs and limit residual exposure to floating rates.\n\nIn 2022, Air France-KLM recorded a strong rebound of its revenues, an improved operating result and a positive net income resulting in a strong cash position of \u20ac10.6 billion by the end of 2022. On the back of this robust operational performance,  the  Group  successfully  issued  in  January 2023  an  inaugural  Sustainability-Linked  Bond  for  a  total aggregate amount of \u20ac1.0 billion.\n\nGiven  this  context,  Air  France-KLM  has  now  reached  an agreement  with  the  French  State  and  the  syndicate  of nine banks participating in the 'PGE' to proceed with the full repayment  of  the  outstanding  \u20ac2.5  billion,  as announced  during  the  FY  2022  results  presentation  on February  17 th , 2023.  To  do  so,  the  Group  used  the\n\n\u20ac1.0  billion  proceeds  of  the  Sustainability-Linked  Bond and  \u20ac1.5  billion  of  its  available  cash.  This  full  repayment will  contribute  to  smoothing  the  Group's  debt  profile, reduce  financial  costs  and  limit  residual  exposure  to floating  rates,  and  marks  a  final  step  towards  the  full repayment of the  current  French  State  liquidity  support measures.\n\n## On March 17, 2023\n\nAir France-KLM announces the repayment of \u20ac300 million of the outstanding \u20ac600 million perpetual hybrid bonds held by the French State, reaching the 75% threshold of Covid-19 recapitalization State aid redemption. Air France-KLM also announces the refinancing of \u20ac320 million via the issuance of new French state perpetual hybrid bonds.\n\n- a) Air France-KLM has repaid \u20ac300 million of outstanding French State perpetual bonds, exceeding  the  75%  Covid-19  recapitalization  aid redemption threshold;\n- b) The Group will refinance \u20ac320 million through a new issuance of  perpetual  hybrid  bonds  with  the  French State, without any 'bans' attached.\n\nIn April 2021, Air France-KLM and the French State agreed to  convert  the  direct  French  State  loan  of  \u20ac3  billion, granted by the French State to Air France-KLM in late May 2020, into perpetual hybrid bonds  as  a  Covid-19 recapitalization  aid  to  Air  France  and  Air  France-KLM approved by the European Commission on 5 April 2021.\n\nIn 2022 the Group repaid \u20ac2.4 billion of the aforementioned \u20ac3 billion, leaving \u20ac600 million remaining.  As  announced  at  the  Group's  FY2022  results presentation,  Air  France-KLM  and  Air  France  intend  to fully  exit  the  current  Covid-19  recapitalization  aid  and  its related 'bans' as from April 19 th , 2023.\n\nFollowing  the  European  Commission's  approval  on February  16 th ,  2023,  of  a  French  State  compensation  aid granted  to  Air  France  without  any  bans  attached,  the Group today takes the  first  step  of  repaying  and  exiting the  Covid-19  recapitalization  State  aid.  This  step  enables the Group to exceed the 75% redemption threshold of the Covid-19 recapitalization aid.\n\nAdditionally, the  Group  will  refinance  \u20ac320  million through  the  issuance  of  new  French  State  perpetual hybrid  bonds  as  an  approved  compensation  aid  to Air  France.  These  new  perpetual  bonds  with  no  'bans' attached  contain  similar  financial  conditions  as  the  one repaid,  with  non-call  date  and  interest  rate  step-up postponed by an additional two years (March 2029).",

The investigating judges of the Court of First Instance ruled in favor  of  Air  France  and  Airbus  by  issuing  an  order dismissing  the  case  on  September  4,  2019.  The  Public Prosecutor's Office and most of the civil parties (including the Pilots' associations and unions) appealed this decision. The Paris Court of Appeals ruled on May 12, 2021, referring Airbus and Air France to the Criminal Court. Following the rejection by the Court of Cassation on August 26, 2021 of the appeal a criminal trial took place from October 10 th to December 8 th 2022 at Criminal Court.

These indicators  are  in  line  with  Air  France-KLM  and  the  two airlines'  commitment  to  sustainable  development  and  a gradual  decarbonization  of  activities.  The  two  RCFs include a financing cost margin adjustment mechanism (upward  or  downward)  conditional  to  the  independent achievement of these dedicated Indicators (reduction  of the unit CO2 emission, increase of the share of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, among others).\n\nThis set of agreements  is the second  successful sustainability-linked transaction undertaken by Air FranceKLM combined with Air France and KLM after its inaugural Sustainability-Linked Bond issued in January 2023.\n\n## Air France-KLM and Air France\n\nAir  France-KLM  and  Air  France  as  combined  borrower signed a \u20ac1.2bn Sustainability-Linked RCF.\n\nThis new facility has an initial 2026 maturity, includes two one-year extension options and provides for a \u20ac100 million accordion increase option at the lenders' discretion during one year following the signing date.\n\nThis RCF was coordinated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment  Bank  (CACIB)  and  Natixis,  jointly  acting  as Global Coordinators, ESG Coordinators and Documentation Agents, and concluded with a syndicate of 15 international banks.\n\n## KLM\n\nKLM signed a \u20ac1.0bn RCF including ESG Key Performance Indicators.\n\nThis  new  RCF  has  an  initial  2027  maturity  and  includes two  one-year  extension  options  and  provides  for  a \u20ac200  million  accordion  increase  option  at  the  lenders' discretion.\n\nThe  RCF  was  coordinated  by  ABN  AMRO,  ING  and Rabobank, with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (CACIB) acting as coordinator for the ESG targets. It was concluded with a syndicate of 14 international banks.\n\nThis  facility  replaces  both  the  remaining  direct  loan granted to KLM by the Dutch State and the credit facility guaranteed  by  the  Dutch  State,  both  of  which  were cancelled by KLM.\n\nPursuant to this cancellation, conditions attached to this aid no longer apply.\n\n## On April 19, 2023\n\n## Air France-KLM and Air France announce today the full exit of the French Recapitalization State Aid under the EU Covid-19 Temporary Framework.\n\n- a) Air  France-KLM  has  fully  repaid,  the  \u20ac300  million remaining French State hybrid perpetual bonds and paid the required compensation of the French State for the shares subscribed in April 2021 without change required of the capital ownership;\n- b) The Group has therefore refinanced \u20ac407 million with a  new  issuance  of  hybrid  perpetual  bonds  with  the French State, without any restrictions attached.",

The  Group announces  today  that  it  has  entered  into  exclusive discussions  with  Apollo  Global  Management  regarding the  potential  financing  of  \u20ac500  million  of  a  dedicated operating affiliate of Air France, owning a pool of assets of Air France dedicated to its Engineering and Maintenance Activity (spare components).  The  proceeds  of  the transaction  would  be  allocated  to  General  Corporate Purposes.\n\nThis financing would be non-dilutive, structured through a  quasi-equity  financing  instrument,  similarly  to  the  one raised  by  Air  France  on  a  pool  of  spare  engines  in  July 2022.\n\nThe  contemplated  structure  related  to  this  financing would  involve  no  change  on  operational  and  social aspects. Therefore, there would be no change in the way to  use  the  spare  components,  and  no  impact  on Air France or Air France-KLM employees contracts.\n\nThe instrument would be qualified as equity under IFRS, hence  strengthening  Air  France-KLM's  and  Air  France's balance  sheet  (please  also  refer  on  this  subject  to  the section 'Outlook and subsequent events' below).\n\n## On June 16, 2023\n\n## Air France-KLM: key decisions approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023.\n\nThe Air France-KLM Annual General Shareholders' Meeting was  held  on  Wednesday  June  7,  2023  at  14h30  at  the Hilton Paris Charles de Gaulle Hotel, 8 rue de Rome, 93290 Tremblay-en-France.

The Air France-KLM Group supports the project.\n\nHolcim, IFPEN ('IFP Energies nouvelles'), Axens and EDF announce  that  they  have  signed  Memorandum  of Understanding  to  develop  'Take  Kair',  an  innovative industrial  e-kerosene  pilot  in  Pays  de  la  Loire,  which  will meet  the  needs  of  the  new  French  e-SAF  industry.  The Air France-KLM Group would be the main off-taker of the ekerosene  produced  by  this  new  industrial  facility.  The production  of  hydrogen  and  synthetic  fuels  would  take place in Loire-Atlantique, France, with commercial openings, either local, regional or national.\n\nThis  cooperation  will  contribute  to  the  development  of the  French  SAF  production  industry,  a  priority  raised  by the  French  President  of  the  Republic  during  his  speech on  16  June  2023.  The  production  of  e-kerosene  will contribute to the decarbonization of air transport and this project anticipates the future European  regulation 'ReFuel Aviation'.\n\nThe success of this project relies  on  the  commitment of the  partners  to  explore  opportunities  for  industrial cooperation, based on their respective expertise:\n\n- a) for the Holcim group, the capture of biogenic CO2 of its  cement  plant  located  in  Saint-Pierre-La-Cour  in Mayenne, France, in line with its plan to decarbonize its  production sites, integrating programs to capture and recover CO2 emissions to allow the production of green e-fuels for aviation;\n- b) for IFPEN and Axens, the development and integration  of  low-carbon  fuel  synthesis  processes and their experience in SAF production technologies;\n- c) for  the  EDF  Group,  the  development  of  its  CO2neutral electricity production facilities and the knowhow  developed  both  by  its  subsidiary  Hynamics, specialized  in  the  production  of  low-carbon  and renewable hydrogen by water electrolysis, and by its engineering  department  allowing  the  security  of  its major industrial projects.\n\nThe  \"Take  Kair\"  project,  one  of  the  first  industrial  e-SAF production  projects  in  France,  will  avoid  the  emission  of more  than  one  hundred  kilotons  of  CO2  per  year.  It  is therefore in line with the French government's objectives in  terms  of  decarbonizing  air  transport  and  it  will  be  a candidate for public financial support for the emergence of a French e-fuel industry, which is why it was presented at the beginning of 2023 to The French Agency for Ecological Transition ADEME and to the French Ministries in charge of of Energy Transition, of Industry and of Transport.",

This  will  be  an  evolutionary  order,  providing  the Group with flexibility to allocate aircraft within its portfolio of  airlines,  according  to  market  dynamics  and  local regulatory conditions.\n\nAir  France-KLM  CEO Benjamin  Smith stated:  \"This  new order will  be  a  major  step  in  the  renewal  of  the  Group's fleet. The Airbus A350 is a state-of-the-art aircraft with an excellent track record at Air France, where it has rapidly become a favorite among passengers and crew since its entry  into  service  in  2019.  It  is  the  perfect  fit  for  the\n\nnetwork  needs  of  the  Group  and  boasts  outstanding performances: it is a quieter, more fuel efficient and more cost-effective  aircraft  compared  to  previous  generations. It  will  be  instrumental  in  helping  the  Group  reach  our ambitious  sustainability  targets,  including  -30%  CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer by 2030 (2) '.\n\nThese  aircraft  will  replace  previous-generation  aircraft, namely Airbus A330 and older Boeing 777 aircraft.\n\nThis  new  order  will  come  in  addition  to  an  existing Air France-KLM  order  for  41  Airbus  A350-900s  for Air France, of which 22 have been delivered to date.\n\nAir France-KLM will also be among the launch customers of the Airbus A350 Full Freighter version of the aircraft, having ordered 8 aircraft to renew and expand its cargo fleet.\n\nWith  these  combined  orders,  covering  up  to  99  aircraft, Air  France-KLM  would  become  the  world's  largest  A350 family aircraft operator.\n\nThe  Airbus  A350  symbolizes  the  transition  to  a  more sustainable  air  transport  industry.  The  aircraft  consumes 25% less fuel per passenger km than an equivalent-sized, previous-generation  aircraft,  thanks  to  the  use  of  lighter materials:  53%  composites  and  14%  titanium.  Its  noise footprint is also reduced by 40%.\n\nFleet renewal is the Group's primary lever to immediately cut  CO2  and  noise  emissions.  Alongside  the  use  of sustainable aviation fuel and eco-piloting techniques, it is one  of  the  pillars of the Group's  decarbonization trajectory,  which  aims  for  -30%  CO2  emissions  per passenger km by 2030 compared to 2019. Since the 2000s, Air  France-KLM  has  reduced  its  noise  footprint  by  40% and the Group continues to work with all its stakeholders to adapt its operations.\n\nBy  2028,  the  share  of  new  generation  aircraft  in  the Air  France-KLM  fleet  will  reach  64%,  compared  to  5%  in 2019. As of September 25, 2023, Air France-KLM operated a fleet  of  533  aircraft  to  over  300  destinations  worldwide. Once  this  order  is  placed,  the  Group  will  have  over  220 aircraft  on  order,  including  100  Airbus  A320neo  family aircraft, with first deliveries expected by the end of 2023.\n\nThis order remains subject to standard company approvals.",

We are pleased  to  be  part  of  the  winning  bidding  consortium selected  by  the  board  of  SAS.  Air  France-KLM  looks forward to establishing strong commercial ties with SAS. With  its  well-established  position  in  Scandinavia  and strong  brand,  SAS  offers  tremendous  potential  to Air  France-KLM.  This  cooperation  will  allow  Air  FranceKLM to enhance its position in the Nordics and improve connectivity  for  Scandinavian  and  European  travelers. We look forward to being a part of this new chapter in SAS' history and thank the board of SAS for their trust '.\n\nAs previously expressed, Air France-KLM is determined to play  an  active  role  in  the  consolidation  of  European aviation. The envisaged cooperation with SAS is one of the components of the Group's strategic roadmap.\n\nThe  Consortium's  investment  proposal  remains  to  be finalized and  is  subject  to  certain  conditions  and regulatory  approvals  including,  but  not  limited  to, approval  by  the  European  Commission,  the  US  court overseeing the Chapter 11 reorganization and, in respect of SAS AB, the Swedish court.\n\nShould  this  transaction  be  approved  and  all  the  other conditions (including regulatory clearances and cancellation of all  existing  shares  of  stock  of  SAS  AB)  be satisfied, the Consortium, together with the Danish State, would invest USD 1.175 billion of which USD 475 million in common  shares  and  USD  700  million  in  the  form  of secured convertible bonds.\n\nAir  France-KLM's  investment  would  represent  a  total  of USD  144.5  million,  of  which  USD  109.5  million  would  be invested in common shares and USD 35 million would be provided in the form of secured convertible bonds. Upon completion of the transaction, Air France-KLM would own up to a maximum 19.9% non-controlling stake in the share capital of the reorganized SAS AB.\n\nAir  France-KLM's  investment  described  herein  will  not have any impact on the Group's medium-term outlook.\n\nIn parallel to the  transaction,  and  subject  to  the satisfaction  of  certain  conditions  including  SAS  AB's  exit from Star Alliance, Air France-KLM will seek to establish a commercial cooperation between its airlines and SAS AB. In doing so Air France-KLM will strengthen its footprint in Scandinavian  markets,  where  the  SAS  brand  and  loyalty program are well-established. Such commercial cooperation would  benefit Scandinavian customers through extended connectivity and broader access to the worldwide network of Air France-KLM.\n\nAir  France-KLM  would  like  to  thank  SAS  AB's  Board  of Directors for its consideration throughout the competitive bidding process.\n\n## Details of the contemplated transaction\n\nThe  net  proceeds  of  this  investment  would  be  used, among  other  things,  to  repay  post-petition  debtor-inpossession  (DIP)  financing.  General  unsecured  creditors would receive USD 325 million of value in the form of cash and common shares.\n\nDefinitive  agreements  between  the  members  of  the Consortium  would  include  specific  provisions  whereby Air  France-KLM's  stake  may  be  increased  such  that Air  France-KLM  may  become  a  controlling  shareholder, after  a  minimum  of  two  years,  subject  to  among  other things, certain regulatory conditions and financial performance.\n\nAs noted above, the investment by the Consortium (which may  come  to  include  additional  investment  partners)  is subject to approval by the US court and consummation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of SAS AB and certain of its subsidiaries. Such approval will come only after the Chapter 11 plan is submitted to creditors for a vote. SAS AB and  those  subsidiaries  intend  to  undertake  the  process necessary to obtain such approval by the US court in short order. SAS AB may thereafter apply for a Swedish in-court reorganization aimed  at implementing  a  Swedish reorganization plan for SAS AB that results in cancellation of  all  existing  shares  of  stock  of  SAS  AB  pursuant  to Swedish  law.  Following  that,  the  investment  may  be consummated  as  part  of  implementing  the  Chapter  11 plan of reorganization.",

GOL  passengers  also  have  access  to Air  France  and  KLM's  worldwide  networks  beyond  their Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport and Amsterdam Schiphol airport hubs.\n\nDuring  the  winter  23  season,  Air  France  operates 24  weekly  flights  to  Brazil  (14  x  S\u00e3o  Paulo,  7  x  Rio  de Janeiro and 3 x Fortaleza) while KLM operates 14 weekly flights to Brazil (7 x S\u00e3o Paulo, 7 x Rio de Janeiro).\n\n## On November 10, 2023\n\n## Air France-KLM confirms its strategic cooperation with SAF producer DG Fuels by investing in their SAF production facility in the United States.\n\n- a) Air France-KLM has made an investment in DG Fuels to support the completion of the developmental work necessary to reach the Final Investment Decision on DG Fuels' initial Louisiana-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant.\n- b) Air France-KLM acquired an option to purchase up to 25 million gallons / 75 000 tons of SAF annually over a multi-year  period  beginning  in  2029.  This  option comes in addition to the long-term offtake contract announced by Air France-KLM and DG Fuels last year.\n- c) The investment and offtake option represent a further major  step  by  the  Group  towards  achieving  its  10% SAF incorporation target by 2030.\n\nThe Air France-KLM Group is fully committed to reducing its  carbon  footprint  and  aims  to  be  a  frontrunner  in sustainable  aviation.  In  2022,  the  Group  was  the  world's largest user of SAF, representing 17% of the world's total production.  By  comparison,  the  Group  only  accounts  for 3% of the world's consumption of conventional kerosene.\n\nIn  October  2022,  Air  France-KLM  announced  an  offtake agreement for 600,000 tons of SAF from DG Fuels, to be delivered between 2027 and 2036.\n\nToday,  the  Group  announces  a  step  forward  in  its cooperation  with  DG  Fuels,  with  Air  France  investing USD 4.7 million in the SAF producer. This investment - a first for Air France-KLM - represents a key development in the  strengthening  of  the  partnership  between  the Air  France-KLM  Group  and  DG  Fuels.  It  will  support  the completion of the development work necessary to reach\n\nthe  Final  Investment  Decision  (FID)  on  DG  Fuels'  first sustainable  aviation  fuel  plant,  which  will  be  located  in Louisiana. This investment confirms the Group's ambition to  participate  in  the  financing  of  project  studies  that enable  the  development  of  SAF  production  capabilities worldwide,  with  the  aim  of  gradually  establishing  a diversified network able to meet worldwide demand.\n\nIn  addition  to  this  investment,  Air  France-KLM  has acquired a new option to purchase up to 75,000 tons of SAF  per  year  from  DG  Fuels,  with  deliveries  planned  to start as early as 2029.\n\nFully  committed  to  reducing  its  environmental  impact, the  Air  France-KLM  Group  aims  to  reduce  its  CO2 emissions per passenger km by 30% by 2030 compared to 2019. Its decarbonisation trajectory factors in the incorporation  of  a  minimum  of  10%  SAF  by  2030, alongside fleet renewal and eco-piloting.\n\n'Air  France-KLM  welcomes  this  expanded  cooperation with  DG  Fuels.  Supporting  the  scale-up  of  advanced waste-to-aviation  fuel  technology  is  a  crucial  step  to growing the SAF industry. This is the first time Air FranceKLM has made a financial investment in a SAF producer and we look forward to further reinforcing our long-term partnership  with  DG  Fuels.' ,  said  Constance  Thio,  EVP Human Resources and Sustainability, Air France-KLM.\n\n'We  are  very pleased to broaden  our  strategic relationship  with  Air  France-KLM.  This  expansion  of  our existing  relationship  is  very  important  to  both  DG  Fuels and to the aviation industry as we build momentum to successfully implementing our first SAF facility and make major  scale  up  plans  thereafter.  We  look  forward  to working  with  Air  France-KLM  as  we  deploy  our  SAF technology  at  additional  locations  in  the  United  States, Europe  and  Asia.' ,  said  Christopher  Chaput,  President  & CFO of DG Fuels.\n\n## DG Fuels, SAF provider with an efficient, low-cost production process\n\nAs  a  result  of  its  high  efficiency  carbon  conversion process,  DG  Fuels  maximizes  the  amount  of  SAF produced from a fixed amount of biomass. This efficiency, combined with reasonable scale results in attractively low unit  production  costs,  allowing  DG  Fuels  to  achieve sustained profitability while still offering airline and other SAF customers prices that are competitive with conventional jet fuel. SAF produced by DG Fuels does not compete  with  global  food  supplies  in  any  way.  As  a testament to its commitment to using renewable power, DG  Fuels  is  a  major  supporter  of  wind,  solar  and  other forms of zero carbon power.",

This  strategy  is  founded  on  two major pillars: \"people & culture' and 'environment\".\n\nWith regard to the \"people & culture\" pillar, the Air FranceKLM Group is  a  socially  responsible  company  that  cares for  people  and  cultures  by  investing  in  noise  pollution reduction,  creating  a  safe  and  inclusive  workplace,  and supporting local communities.\n\nConcerning the \"environment\" pillar, Air France-KLM has developed a decarbonization strategy that aims to reduce its  emissions  per  passenger/kilometer  by  30%  by  2030  compared to 2019 levels, the reference year. To reach this target, Air France-KLM is activating all the decarbonization levers at its disposal:\n\nFleet  renewal  with  new-generation  aircraft: Airbus A220s, Airbus A350s, Boeing 787s - are more fuel-efficient, producing  up  to  25%  less  CO2  emissions  per  passenger km and with a noise level reduction of 33% on average. By 2028, these aircraft will account for 64% of the Air FranceKLM  Group  fleet,  thanks  to  an  annual  investment  of two billion euros.\n\nIncreased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ,  which reduces  CO2  emissions  by  at  least  75%  on  average  over the fuel's  life  cycle  and  does  not  compete  with  the  food chain. By 2030, the Group aims to incorporate at least 10% SAF on all its flights, and 63% by 2050.\n\nOperational  measures: Ground  operations,  eco-piloting measures  and  other  initiatives  made  possible  by  the actions of Air France-KLM crews and ground staff trained in these practices enable an average reduction of 4 to 5% in CO2 emissions.\n\nTo find out more:\n\nhttps://sustainabilityreport.airfranceklm.com/\n\n## On November 27, 2023\n\n## Air France-KLM and Etihad Airways announce frequent flyer partnership.\n\n- a) Flying  Blue  and  Etihad  Guest  members  flying  on Air France, KLM or Etihad Airways can now earn and redeem Miles on the loyalty program of their choice.\n- b) As  part  of  the  expanded  partnership  announced  in September 2023, Air France-KLM and Etihad Airways customers  now  have  access  to  more  than  60  new routes beyond Abu Dhabi, Paris and Amsterdam.\n\nAir  France-KLM  Group  and  Etihad  Airways,  the  national airline  of  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  today  announced  a new partnership between their respective loyalty programmes following the Memorandum of\n\nUnderstanding  (MoU)  signed  between  the  two  airline Groups in September 2023.\n\nAs part of this new partnership, members of Flying Blue, Air France and KLM's loyalty programme, and members of Etihad  Guest,  the  loyalty  programme  of  Etihad  Airways, will  now  be  able  to  earn  and  redeem  Miles  on  either loyalty  programme  when  flying  on  Air  France,  KLM  or Etihad.

        "page_content": "## About Oltion Carkaxhija\n\nOltion  Carkaxhija  holds  an  MBA  from  Loyola  College Maryland  (United  States).  After  11  years  at  Air  Canada  in the finance and network planning departments, he initially joined the Air France-KLM Group in 2018 as VP Corporate  Planning,  working  on  industrial  relations.  He subsequently  became  SVP  Transformation  and  was  last appointed  Executive  Vice  President  Transformation  in October  2020,  tasked  with  further  strengthening  the Group's competitiveness.\n\n## On December 13, 2023\n\n## Air France-KLM reaffirms its commitment to the decarbonization of aviation through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).\n\nAlready the world's first SAF user, the Group continues to secure the volumes needed to meet its 2030 incorporation targets.\n\n- a) In 2023, the Air France-KLM Group's airlines will have incorporated  around  80,000  metric  tons  of  SAF  nearly  double  the  amount  in  2022  -  making  the Group  the  world's  largest  SAF  user  for  the  second year in a row.\n- b) Throughout the year, the Group continued to secure future SAF supplies to meet its target of a minimum of 10% incorporation of SAF by 2030 by signing offtake agreements  and  MoUs  with  SAF  producers  around the world, and by investing directly in SAF production capabilities.\n- c) These  long-term,  strategic  investments  confirm  the Group's  commitment  to  supporting  the  emergence of a scalable network of SAF production capabilities in Europe and worldwide.\n\nFully  committed  to  the  reduction  of  its  environmental impact,  Air  France-KLM  aims  to  lead  the  way  in  the incorporation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and to support the  development  of  SAF  production  capabilities  around the world. The Group has set itself ambitious targets that exceed  regulatory  requirements,  namely  a  reduction  of CO2  emissions  per  passenger  km  by  30%  by  2030 compared to 2019, and the incorporation of a minimum of 10% of SAF by the same date. The Group plans to achieve these targets via three main levers: fleet renewal, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and operational measures.\n\nIn 2022, Air France-KLM was the world's largest SAF user, accounting for 17% of the world's SAF production, while it consumed  only  3%  of  global  kerosene  production.  In October 2022, Air France-KLM announced having secured one  third  of  its  2030  needs  thanks  to  landmark  offtake agreements with Neste and DG Fuels, covering a total of 1.6 million tons of SAF.\n\nIn 2023, the Group maintained this dynamic by:\n\n- a) increasing  the  volume  of  SAF  incorporated,  making Air  France-KLM  once  again  the  world's  largest  SAF user;\n- b) securing future SAF supplies through offtake agreements and MoUs;\n- c) signing  strategic  partnerships  and  investing  in  SAF production capabilities;\n- d) raising  awareness  around  the  potential  but  also  the challenges associated with SAF;\n- e) engaging its customers - individual and corporate through dedicated SAF programs.\n- 1) Increasing the volume of SAF incorporated\n- In 2023, the Air France-KLM Group's airlines incorporated  around  80,000  metric  tons  of  SAF, almost doubling from 2022 levels. This represents a 1% incorporation  rate  (compared  to  0.6%  in  2022).  With this  amount,  and  based  on  the  data  available  to  this day,  Air  France-KLM  expects  to  be  once  again  the world's largest SAF user, accounting for around 16% of world's SAF production.\n- 2) Securing future SAF supplies through offtake agreements and MoUs\n- In 2023, Air France-KLM signed several memorandums of  understanding (MoUs) with SAF producers around the world to secure the future SAF volumes required to meet its 2030 targets. By partnering with suppliers working on different SAF technologies (HEFA, advanced aviation biofuels  and  e-fuels)  and  based  in different geographical regions, Air France-KLM aims to build a worldwide network of SAF production capable of meeting its own needs and those of the industry in the  long-term.  The  Group's  sourcing  initiatives  are  in line  with  the  goal  of  keeping  flexibility  in  volumes  to match actual demand levels.\n\nMoUs  were  notably  signed  with  Engie  (KerEauzen project, France), EDF (Take Kair project, France), Elyse Energy (BioTfuel project, France), TotalEnergies (France),  OMV  (Austria),  Raven  (USA)  and  Groupe International SAF + (Canada), as well as with other SAF producers  and  energy  providers  based  in  Europe, North and South America.\n\nThese MoUs concern production projects and facilities at different stages of maturity. They stimulate the SAF industry  by  providing  producers  with  visibility  and outlets  for  their  future  production,  helping  them secure financing. The Group is particularly attentive to the  development  of  SAF  production  capacities  in  its home markets, an essential means of addressing one of the main challenges associated with SAF: availability.",

        "page_content": "- 3) Signing  strategic  partnerships  and  investing  in  SAF production capabilities\n- Since  its  first  SAF-powered  flight  back  in  2011,  Air France-KLM has established strong partnerships with energy providers, and has even made direct financial investments. KLM  notably partnered with SAF producer SkyNRG, effectively supporting the establishment  in  2019  of  a  first  production  plant  in Delfzijl (The Netherlands) through a \u20ac6m investment.\n- In  November  2023,  Air  France-KLM  reinforced  its cooperation with DG  Fuels through a $4.7m investment made by Air France into the SAF producer. Along  with  this  investment,  the  Group  acquired  an option  to  purchase  an  additional  75,000  tons  of  SAF from  DG  Fuels  over  a  multi-year  period  beginning in 2029.\n- 4) Raising  awareness  around  the  potential  but  also  the challenges associated with SAF\n- In  April  2023,  KLM  successfully  conducted  tests  that confirm that it is safe to run aircraft engines on 100% SAF. The engine tests were carried out in partnership with engine manufacturer CFM International and fuel producer Neste.\n- In June  2023,  Air  France-KLM  held  a  first  SAF Masterclass, gathering experts and professionals from the  SAF  industry  in  an  event  aimed  at  media  and investors.  On  that  occasion,  the  various  speakers reaffirmed  the  need  to  raise  awareness  among  the general public about the challenges tied to SAF as well as the opportunities it brings in terms of job and value creation  as  well  as  energy  independence.  The  full content presented on that day can be consulted here.\n- In a context of legitimate concern over the environmental impact of aviation, it is essential that all audiences be aware that while SAF is already a reality, the  path  to  a  functioning  and  fully  operational industry will require joint efforts from all stakeholders across the aviation value chain -including government bodies.\n\n## Engaging customers - individual and corporate through dedicated SAF programs\n\nAir  France-KLM  aims  to  provide  all  its  customers  with options  to  contribute  to  the  decarbonization  of  aviation. The  Group  developed  several  industry-leading  programs and initiatives which come on top of the SAF contribution already integrated in each ticket sold since January 2022.\n\n- a) Individual customers can opt for the 'environmental option', when booking tickets, which allows them to purchase  volumes  of  SAF  based  on  the  fuel consumption of their journey.\n- b) Corporate customers can participate in the Corporate SAF Program. Based on the CO2 emissions generated by  their  staff's  travels,  companies  can  determine  an annual  contribution  which  is  then  invested  in  the purchase and use of SAF.

Having  peaked  in  2022, global  inflation  showed  signs  of  slowing  as  supply  chain disruptions  eased  and  commodity  prices  declined,  with different ongoing patterns per country. The effects of the wars  in  Ukraine  and  Gaza  on  the  global  economy remained moderate in 2023.\n\nThe Eurozone showed some significant divergences across the region. The southern European economies\n\noutperformed  the  eurozone  average,  while  Germany recorded a slight economic contraction. Recent developments also  show  tighter  financial  conditions  and weaker  demand.  The  U.S.  economy  benefited  from  a strengthening  labor  market  and  positive  signals  on consumer  spending.  China  benefited  from  only  a  brief Covid reopening surge in early 2023 before facing growing headwinds from weakening consumer confidence due to the real estate crisis and labor market uncertainty (2) .\n\n## OIL PRICE\n\n| Brent  (US$/bbl)       |   2022 Q3 |   2022 Q4 |   2023 Q1 |   2023 Q2 |   2023 Q3 |   2023 Q4 |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Average Brent price    |     100.7 |      88.6 |      81.2 |      78.3 |      86.7 |      83.7 |\n| Average Jet fuel price |     141.1 |     136.8 |     126.2 |      95.2 |     120.4 |     112   |\n\nSource (3)\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, oil prices remained on their downward  trend  initiated in Q3 2022 and were comparable to their pre-Covid level in the middle of 2023. However,  in  Q3  2023,  oil  prices  reversed  direction  and started  to  rise,  peaking  in  September.  In  Q4  2023,  oil prices once again declined to just under US$80 per barrel of Brent at the end of the year.\n\nThe crack spread, i.e. the difference between the price of jet  fuel  and  that  of  crude  oil,  declined  to  reach  its  preCovid level during the first half of 2023. In the second half of  the  year,  it  then  moved  higher  in  a  pattern  similar  to that of crude oil (4) .",

The  euro/U.S.  dollar  exchange  rate  saw some modest fluctuations over the remainder of the year.\n\nCompared  to  2022  and  based  on  average  annual exchange rates, the euro weakened versus the Swiss franc, and strengthened versus the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen (6) .\n\n## 1.1.2 The industry context and competition\n\n## Worldwide capacity\n\nIn  2023,  worldwide  capacity  measured  in  available  seatkilometers ('ASK') reached 95% of its 2019 level, recovering to a high of 99% in December 2023 compared to the same month in 2019 (7) .\n\n- \u25a0 On departure from Europe (8) capacity  reached  93%  of its  2019  level  in  2023  (99%  in  December  2023),  with most of the capacity flows (9) recovering to above 90% or even  100%,  and  only  the  Europe-Asia  flows  (mostly impacted by capacity on China) still lagging at 77% for 2023 (88% in December 2023).\n- \u25a0 On departure from the U.S. capacity further recovered to reach 98% of its 2019 level in 2023 (102% in December 2023) with most capacity flows (10) close to or above their pre-Covid  levels,  while  Asia  continued  to  significantly lag at 70% in 2023 (81% in December 2023).\n- \u25a0 After  the  slow  complete lifting  of  Covid-19  restrictions late in 2022 and the reopening of borders in early 2023, capacity on departure from China experienced a sharp increase with international capacity recovering to 40% of its 2019 level in 2023 (62% in December 2023) (from 6% on average during 2022). Chinese domestic capacity was stable at  around  119%  in  2023  (114%  in  December 2023), boosting total Chinese capacity to approaching 84% of its 2019 level in 2023 (91% in December 2023).\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has had a limited impact on  worldwide  capacity  growth.  However,  as  those countries' airspaces are tightly controlled or even completely closed to European airlines, numerous flights are having to be re-routed, which adds to their distance and flight times. Furthermore, the closure of the Russian and  Belarusian  airspace  to  only  the  European  airlines creates a competitive  disadvantage  for  the  latter, particularly for those with a high number of flights to Asia and geographically located in northern Europe.\n\n## Update on the industry disruption\n\nThe  significant  reduction  in  headcount  during  the Covid-19  period  led  to  enduring  staff  shortages  in  the aviation  industry.  In  particular,  skilled  employees  were hard  to  come  by,  especially  in  the  eurozone  where  the unemployment rate was the lowest since the beginning of this millennium (11) .\n\nAirlines are still being impacted by supply chain issues, and the  current  poor  reliability  of  some  latest  generation aircraft engines. This situation is also being exacerbated by:\n\n- \u25a0 the  lack  of  spare  parts,  e.g.  for  Pratt  &  Whitney's  GTF engines.  In  April  2023,  aircraft  fitted  with  this  engine spent  10,000  days  on  the  ground  compared  to 38,000 days flying (12) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

Thanks  to  the  action undertaken  to  improve  staffing  levels  and  operational resilience,  disruption  at  airports  occurred  less  frequently and was less severe in 2023.\n\nEarly 2023 was marked by air traffic control (ATC) strikes in Europe,  mostly  in  France  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  in Germany (15) .  ATC strikes were more limited in the second half of 2023.\n\n## Sustainable development\n\nOn  October  4 th , 2021,  the  IATA  77 th Annual  General Meeting approved a resolution for the global air transport industry to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (16) . To  this  end,  in  June  2023,  IATA  released  a  series  of strategic  roadmaps (17) .  The  roadmaps (18) provide  step-bystep  detailing  of  the  critical  actions  and  conditions  for aviation  to  achieve  this  goal,  by  addressing  the  required aircraft  technology,  energy  infrastructure,  operations, finance and policy considerations.\n\nAt  the  41 st Assembly  of  the  International  Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO) in October 2022, the Member States had  adopted  the  Long-Term  Aspirational  Goal  (LTAG)  of net  zero  carbon  emissions  for  international  aviation  by 2050.  Success  will  require  the  coordinated  combined efforts of the  entire  industry  (airlines, airports, air navigation  service  providers  and  manufacturers)  and significant government support (19) .\n\nIn  November  2023,  an  interim  ambition  was  set  during the third meeting of the ICAO Conference on Aviation and Alternative  Fuels  in  Dubai,  where  the  ICAO  and  its Member  States  agreed  to  strive  to  achieve  a  collective global  aspirational  vision  to  reduce  CO2  emissions  from global  aviation  by  5%  by  2030  compared  with  a benchmark  without  the  use  of  cleaner  energy  sources, like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) (20) .\n\nThe key elements of the emissions reduction strategy are the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), investment in new  aircraft  technologies,  a  continued  improvement  of infrastructure,  operational  efficiency  and  the  use  of  real offsets.\n\nFurthermore,  a  harmonized  regulation  is  required  to ensure a level playing field. However, different approaches are being adopted on SAF:\n\n- \u25a0 in September 2023, as part of the ReFuelEU Aviation Fit for  55  package,  the  European  Union  adopted  new legislation establishing SAF mandates for fuel suppliers serving  flights  within  and  departing  from  the  EU between  2025  and  2050.  These  mandates  will progressively  increase  from  2%  SAF  in  2025  to  6%  in 2030 and 70% by 2050 (21) ;\n- \u25a0 the United States is focusing on incentives, as part of the SAF Grand Challenge;\n- \u25a0 the  United  Arab  Emirates  have  announced  their National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap, declaring their goal of developing  enough  domestic  SAF production capacity to supply 700 million liters of SAF on an annual basis by 2030 (22) ;\n- \u25a0 the Civil Aviation Administration of China has set a goal to raise SAF consumption to over 20,000 tons in 2025 and  cumulatively  to  50,000  tons  between  2021  and 2025 (23) .",

        "page_content": "To mitigate aviation-generated CO2 emissions, two major carbon offsetting schemes have been put in place:\n\n- \u25a0 CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International  Aviation)  is  a  cooperative  approach established  by  the  ICAO.  Currently,  126  states  have announced  their  intention  to  participate  in  CORSIA's voluntary  first  phase,  which  started  in  January  2024 and  will  last  three  years.  For  the  first  phase,  the calculation to determine an aircraft operator's offsetting  requirements is based on its emissions in a given year (i.e. 2024, 2025 and 2026);\n- \u25a0 the  European  Union  set  up  the  EU  ETS  (Emission Trading  System)  in  2005.  The  EU  ETS  is  now  a  major carbon  market  and  is  currently  in  its  fourth  phase (2021-30),  with  higher  ambitions  than  CORSIA:  the European Union's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  must  be  cut  by  at  least  55% (24) by  2030 compared  to  1990  and  the  EU  Member  States  must become  net  climate  neutral  by  2050.  In  terms  of aviation,  the  scope  of  the  EU  ETS  concerns  flights within  the  European  Economic  Area  and  flights departing to Switzerland and the United Kingdom (25) .\n\n## Cargo\n\nThe air cargo business continued its post-Covid normalization path. Having experienced declines for most months in 2022, global air cargo ton-kilometers (measured in CTK) saw a steady increase as of January 2023, narrowing the gap with the 2019 level by the end of the year.\n\nAir  cargo  capacity  in  2023,  measured  by  Available  Cargo Ton-Kilometers  (ACTKs),  surpassed  both  the  2019  and 2022 levels, which was largely attributable to the return to service  of  air  passenger  belly  capacity,  while  the  global international cargo capacity in full freighters remained at about the same level compared to 2022 (26) .\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe  aeronautics  maintenance  or  MRO  (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) market is mostly driven by the age, flight cycles and flight hours of the global fleet. Trends in this business closely follow those of the commercial airline fleets globally and their utilization.\n\nMRO  revenue  growth  will  be  close  to  3%  per  year worldwide between 2023 and 2033, with high volumes in Europe,  North  America  and  Asia.  This  growth  will  be particularly strong in markets such as India, China and the Middle  East,  with  growth  rates  close  to,  or  even  well above, 5% per year over the same period (27) .\n\nThe MRO market, which is forecast to grow by 31% in 2023 versus 2022, is currently facing multiple challenges, most notably labor shortages and supply chain disruption. As a result,  the  MRO  industry  is  having  to  contend  with production  delays  that  can  sometimes  exceed  one  year, and  with  suppliers  who  are  unable  to  fulfill  orders  and provide products or services in a timely manner (28) .\n\n1",

The overarching ambition of the Air France-KLM\n\ngroup  is  to  become  a  European  aviation  champion  and one of the most powerful in the world, while acting as an industry  leader  in  sustainable  aviation.  As  such,  flight safety is an absolute imperative that the Group owes to its customers and staff, and a daily commitment.\n\n## 1.2.2 Air France-KLM: core assets and unique competitive advantages\n\nAs one of the European leaders for intercontinental traffic on  departure  from  Europe,  Air  France-KLM  is  a  major global  air  transport  player.  Its  main  businesses  are passenger and cargo transportation through its network activities, low-cost transportation and aeronautical maintenance.\n\nThe  Group  takes  action  to  reconcile  growth  with environmental  responsibility, social value and  local development at its hubs and destinations. By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, investing in R&D  and innovation, and partnering with diverse stakeholders, the Group strives to optimize the use of its different forms of capital and resources. This approach gives Air France-KLM a  strong  position  in  the  aviation  industry's  competitive landscape.\n\n## People: 76,000 engaged and professional employees, and a diverse culture\n\nAir France-KLM is committed to the value of its workforce worldwide. Driven by our employees' collective dedication, professionalism and accomplishments, Air  France-KLM is able to provide premium services and caring  airline  experiences,  fostering  lasting  relationships with customers while maintaining the highest standards of safety and efficiency.\n\n## Brands: a portfolio of attractive, strong brands and a common loyalty program\n\nAir France-KLM  has  a  portfolio  of  strong  brands, positioned  in  complementary  markets  with  their  own specific operating models, aligned with customer expectations. The common loyalty program, 'Flying Blue' contributes  to  reinforcing  the  attractiveness  of  the brands.\n\nOn top of the quasi-equity financing secured by some of its assets, Flying Blue will be further leveraged as a margin generator.  The  program  currently  numbers  23  million (1) members.  It  has  an  extensive  and  growing  network  of partners  (airlines,  financial  institutions  and  consumer\n\nbusinesses)  and  contributes  positively  to  the  Group's margin through the sale of Miles, whose revenues prove resilient even during crises.\n\n## An extensive network operated with an optimized fleet\n\nThe Air France-KLM group currently operates one of the most diversified networks between Europe and the rest of the world, organized around its dual hubs of Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam-Schiphol, which are two of the four largest connecting platforms in Western Europe (the other  two  being  London  Heathrow  and  Frankfurt  am Main) (2) .  In  2023,  it  served  more  than  320  routes  in  over 100 countries.\n\nIn  2023,  Transavia  complemented  Air  France-KLM's  full service  offer  with  its  network  of  two  low-cost  carriers, Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands, serving over 130 destinations in 34 countries.\n\nAir France-KLM confirmed its commitment and ambition of  maintaining  a  leading  position  in  terms  of  traffic  and capacity with more than 93 million passengers carried in 2023 (versus 83 million in 2022) between Europe and the rest  of  the  world,  as  well  as  on  intra-European  and domestic routes.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  confirmed  its  strategy  of continuing  to  modernize  its  fleet.  It  has  ordered  newgeneration  narrow-body  and  wide-body  aircraft  that  will deliver a strong contribution to the Group's environmental roadmap  and  generate  substantial  financial  benefits.  By 2025, up to 37% of the Group's fleet should be composed of new-generation aircraft and up to 80% of the fleet should be new-generation aircraft by 2030.\n\nFor its part, Air France has announced plans to operate all its flights on departure from Paris out of Paris-Charles de Gaulle  (CDG)  airport,  with  Transavia  taking  charge  of Air  France-KLM's  activities  at  Paris-Orly  (ORY)  airport  as from 2026.",

Air France-KLM intends to take up to a maximum 19.9% minority stake in the share capital of the reorganized  SAS  AB,  subject  to  the  required  approvals and  conditions.  Via  this  minority  stake,  the  Group's ambition  is  to  enhance  its  footprint  in  Scandinavia through  a  commercial  cooperation  between  its  airlines and  SAS  AB.  The  completion  of  the  transaction  is expected in 2024.\n\n## Capital structure: a shareholding structure with the French and Dutch States, CMA CGM, Delta Air Lines and China Eastern\n\nFinancial  capital  not  only  ensures  Air  France-KLM's financial  sustainability,  it  also  accelerates  its  ability  to transform  while  enabling  value  creation.  Through  the combined  use  of  share  capital,  cash  reserves  and  debt, the  Group  is  able  to  fund  its  infrastructure,  optimize  its fleet, develop its resources, innovate in digital, enforce its supply  chain,  improve  community  relationships  and engage in sector consolidation.\n\nIn  April  2023,  Air  France-KLM  and  Air  France  fully  exited the  French  State  Aid  package  under  the  EU  Covid-19 Temporary Framework. At the same time, KLM ended the credit facility granted by the Dutch State under the same framework.  As  a  result.  Air  France-KLM,  Air  France  and KLM  were  released  from  the  conditions  associated  with State Aid under the EU Covid-19 Temporary Framework.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, the CMA CGM group became a new shareholder in Air France-KLM with 9% of the share capital  and  agreed  to  a  lock-up  effective  until  at  least February 28, 2025 (3) .\n\nIn  December  2023,  Air  France-KLM  issued  5,716,256  new shares  as  part  of  its  \"Partners  for  the  Future\"  employee shareholding program, under preferential terms. The total subscription  amount  related  to  this  share  issuance  was approximately \u20ac46 million. i.e. 2.2% of the share capital. At the end of 2023, employee shareholding plans accounted for 3.2% of Air France-KLM's share capital.\n\nAt the end of 2023, given the issuance of these new shares in  December 2023, the shareholdings of the French and Dutch States had slightly decreased to a respective 28.0% and 9.1%, and the shareholdings of China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines, Inc. were respectively 4.6% and 2.8%.\n\nThe Group's equity position was reinforced by:\n\n- \u25a0 in  July  2023,  the  creation  of  an  ad  hoc  affiliate  of Air France owning a pool of components dedicated to the airline's Engineering and Maintenance activities, in which  funds  and  entities  managed  by  Apollo  Global Management invested \u20ac500 million. Apollo subscribed to  perpetual  bonds  issued  by  the  ad  hoc  operating affiliate, which will be accounted as equity under IFRS;\n- \u25a0 in  November  2023,  the  establishment  of  a  dedicated operating  affiliate  of  Air  France-KLM  holding  the trademark  and  most  of  the  commercial  partners contracts  linked  to  Air  France  and  KLM's  joint  loyalty program ('Flying Blue'), as well as the exclusive right to issue  \"Miles'  for  the  airlines  and  their  partners.  The \u20ac1.5  billion  financing  by  Apollo-managed  and  thirdparty  investment  vehicles  that  support  this  affiliate  is accounted for as equity under IFRS.\n\nIn  addition,  in  early  2023,  Air  France-KLM  successfully placed its first sustainability-linked bonds ('SLB'), raising a nominal  amount  of  \u20ac1.0  billion.  The  offering  was composed of two tranches:\n\n- \u25a0 \u20ac500 million with a 3.3-year maturity and a coupon of 7.250%;\n- \u25a0 \u20ac500 million with a 5.3-year maturity and a coupon of 8.125%.\n\nThese operations, which are a part of a broader strategy to transform  and  streamline  the  Group,  will  allow  it  to rebound  with  a  stronger  balance  sheet  and  increased strategic flexibility.\n\nIn a context of strong demand for travel, Air France-KLM will  continue  to  implement  its  roadmap  focused  on increased profitability and sustainability, while meeting its customers' expectations and fulfilling its CSR commitments.\n\n## Environment: an experienced and knowledgeable industry leader, dedicated to positive change\n\nThe Group continuously innovates so as to be a reference in sustainability. As its ground and flight operations have an impact on the environment, and in particular climate change,  noise,  air  pollution  and  waste,  the  Group permanently strives to optimize all aspects of its activities to reduce its environmental footprint.\n\nAir France-KLM has made a strong commitment towards sustainability, including the ambition to achieve net zero carbon  emissions  in  2050  by  activating,  among  others, levers  on  operations,  fleet  renewal  and  the  use  of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.4 Strategic orientations\n\n## The Air France-KLM group's activity continues to recover and materialize in strong performance and profitability\n\n2023 saw the post-Covid recovery gain momentum, with the Group's total revenue reaching \u20ac30 billion for the first time  in  its  history.  An  agile  approach  to  capacity deployment enabled strong load factors to be maintained throughout the year and improved the operating margin, the latter being higher than in both 2022 and 2019.\n\nIn 2023, the Air France-KLM group's performance was also recognized by the industry with the following awards:\n\n- \u25a0 Air  France was named Best Airline in Western Europe and France at the Skytrax World Airline Awards 2023. It was also recognized as the 7 th Best Airline in the World, continuously  improving  its  position  as  a  worldwide leader versus the previous years. Air France La Premi\u00e8re won  three  first  prizes:  for  its  airline  lounges,  lounge dining and catering (1) .\n- \u25a0 KLM  received  the  2023  APEX  World  Class  Award,  as best  airline  for  passengers  along  with  seven  other airlines  (Singapore  Airlines,  Japan  Airlines,  Emirates, Saudia,  Qatar  Airways,  Xiamen  Airlines  and  Turkish Airlines) (2) .\n- \u25a0 Transavia  was  recognized  as  the  2 nd Best  Low-Cost Airline  in  Europe  in  2023  by  SkyTrax (3) and  Best  Short Haul  Carrier  by  the  Dutch  travel  trade (4) . For  its customer  service,  Transavia  won  an  award  from ESCDA (5) and, for online customer relations, it received the Qualiweb award.\n\n## The Air France-KLM group recovers strong financial metrics\n\nIn  2023,  Air  France-KLM  continued  to  grow  its  capacity and  increased  the  number  of  Available  Seat  Kilometers (ASK) by almost 10% compared to the previous year.\n\nThanks to strong passenger demand, the load factor rose by  3.3  points  to  87.3%  in  2023  while  the  passenger  yield compensated  the  normalization  of  the  Cargo  yield, resulting in a Group unit revenue per ASK increase of 4.5% at constant currency. The Group's net result amounted to \u20ac934  million  driving  a  return  to  positive  equity  of \u20ac0.5 billion. Net debt decreased by \u20ac1.3 billion compared\n\nto  the  end  of  2022  and  resulted  in  a  Net  Debt/EBITDA ratio  of  1.2x  while  the  cash  at  hand  remained  stable  at \u20ac10.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group actively managed the reinforcement  of  its  balance  sheet  by  the  following transactions:\n\n- \u25a0 in  January  2023,  Air  France-KLM  issued  sustainabilitylinked bonds  for  a  total  aggregate  amount  of \u20ac1.0 billion;\n- \u25a0 in March  2023,  the  Group  fully  redeemed  the outstanding \u20ac2.5 billion bank loan guaranteed by the French  State  (PGE)  by  using  the  proceeds  of  the sustainability-linked bonds and \u20ac1.5 billion of liquidity;\n- \u25a0 in  March  and  April  2023,  Air  France-KLM  fully  repaid the remaining \u20ac595 million in hybrid perpetual bonds held by the French State, plus a mandatory compensation  for  the  support  measures  granted  in April  2021.  These  transactions  were  refinanced  with \u20ac727  million  in  newly-issued  hybrid  perpetual  bonds held by the French State, with no restrictions attached;\n- \u25a0 in  April  2023,  Air  France-KLM,  Air  France  and  KLM implemented two new sustainability-linked  Revolving Credit Facilities (RCFs) for a total amount of \u20ac2.2 billion. For  KLM,  this  new  RCF  replaced  the  remaining  direct loan granted to KLM by the Dutch State and the credit facility  guaranteed  by  the  Dutch  State  which  were cancelled by KLM;\n- \u25a0 in July 2023, an ad hoc affiliate of Air France that owns a pool of components issued \u20ac500 million in perpetual bonds;\n- \u25a0 in November 2023, an operating affiliate of Air FranceKLM  that  holds  the  trademark  of  and  most  of  the contracts related to Air France and KLM's joint loyalty program 'Flying  Blue'  issued  \u20ac1.5  billion  of  perpetual bonds.\n\nIn  December  2023,  strong  financial  metrics  enabled  the Air France-KLM group to publish inaugural credit ratings which  are  BBB-/Stable  Outlook  ('Investment  Grade')  at Fitch  Ratings  and  BB+/Stable  Outlook  at  S&P  Global. These  ratings  reflect  the  full  recognition  and  the  strong confidence from the credit agencies in Air France-KLM's credit profile.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

The  transformation  is  accelerating and will  help  restore  competitiveness  with  a  cumulative \u20ac3bn  of  structural  benefits  by  2024  compared  to  2019 through key levers like external spend optimization, labor cost reduction, fleet efficiency, new revenue streams and new initiatives.\n\nThe Air France-KLM group and its airlines are continuing their  efforts  directed  at  reducing  their  environmental footprint  as  a  part  of  a  transparent  and  responsible approach to the challenges surrounding global warming. This  includes  a  commitment  by  Air  France-KLM  to reducing  its  well-to-wake  scope  1  and  3  jet  fuel greenhouse  gas  protocol  emissions  by  30%  per  revenue ton-kilometer  (RTK)  by  2030  compared  to  2019.  In  that context,  the  Air  France-KLM  group,  Air  France  and  KLM submitted  their  CO\u2082  emission  reduction  targets  to  SBTi which were approved in November 2022 by SBTi's Target Validation  Team  confirming  that  they  are  in  line  with  a well-below  2\u00b0C  objective,  as  determined  by  the  Paris Agreement signed in 2015 (6) .  In 2023, SBTi released a new technical  report  outlining  an  interim  1.5\u00b0C  pathway  for aviation  companies (7) , which  the  Group  is  following, alongside  the  Well  Below  2.0\u00b0C  trajectory,  during  the 2023-30 period.\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nThe Air France-KLM group's levers are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an ambitious plan to modernize and renew the fleets of  the  Group's  airlines  with  new-generation  aircraft, emitting  up  to  25%  less  CO\u2082  compared  to  their predecessors. With the objective of having up to 80% of new-generation  aircraft  in  the  Group's  fleet  by  2030, the  Group  is  currently  investing  on  average  over \u20ac2  billion  per  year  in  the  acquisition  of  Airbus  A220s, Airbus  A320neos  and  A321neos,  Airbus  A350s,  Boeing B787s  and  Embraer  195-E2s,  which  are  amongst  the most efficient aircraft in their respective categories;\n- \u25a0 the  use  of  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuels  (SAF),  produced from  industrial  or  domestic  waste  in  a  circular economy.  The  SAF  projects  selected  directly  by Air France-KLM do not compete with the human food chain  or  with  animal  feed.  Air  France  and  KLM  have been  pioneers  in  the  use  of  these  alternative  fuels, which will play a key role in the decarbonization of air transportation, as they can reduce CO\u2082 emissions by up to 80% over their life cycle. Throughout 2023, the Group continued  to  secure  future  SAF  supplies  to  meet  its target  of  a  minimum  of  10%  incorporation  of  SAF  by 2030  by  signing  offtake  agreements  and  MoUs  with SAF  producers  around  the  world,  and  by  investing directly in SAF production capabilities;\n- \u25a0 the improvement of operational efficiency, by favoring clear objectives and applying procedures that limit fuel consumption,  such  as  single-engine  taxiing  and continuous descent.\n\nIn  addition,  Air  France-KLM  is  working  with  the  broader aviation sector to accelerate the development  of innovative solutions for aircraft design and maintenance, engines  and  synthetic  fuels,  which  will  be  required  to achieve net zero carbon emissions in aviation.\n\nSource: https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/newsroom/air-france-klm-co2-emissions-reduction-targets-2030-approved-science-based-\n\ntargets.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 ACTIVITIES IN 2023\n\n## 1.3.1 Network business (passenger and cargo)\n\n## 2023: a year of recovery in demand\n\nThe  Network  business  corresponds  to  passenger  and cargo transportation services on the scheduled flights of the network airlines, Air France and KLM. It is the Group's principal activity, contributing more  than  85%  of Air France-KLM's revenues.\n\nFor Air France, 2023 was marked by a strong recovery in demand  and,  unlike  in  previous  years,  the  year  saw  no impact from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, numerous conflicts and  geopolitical  tensions  weighed  on  the Group's  activity:  the  ongoing  war  between  Russia  and Ukraine, tensions in the Sahel over the summer, then in the Middle East in autumn 2023. The total capacity of the Air  France  network  thus  increased  by  +8pts  in  2023 relative  to  2022  and  stood  at  an  index  of  91%  relative  to 2019.  The  Scheduling  teams  continued  to  react  with agility  and  pro-activeness  to  adjust  capacity  throughout 2023 to respond to developments on a month-by-month basis.  Marked  by  the  impacts  of  strikes  in  France  (in particular, air traffic controllers), Air France capacity stood at  90%  of  its  2019  level  in  the  first  quarter  before increasing to 93% in the last quarter.\n\n## 1.3.1.1 Short and medium-haul operations\n\nOngoing  fleet  renewal  and  announcement  of  the  exit from  Orly  by  Summer  2026,  with  the  exception  of routes to Corsica that will remain operated from Orly by Air  France  and  Air  Corsica,  given  the  public  service contract ( D\u00e9l\u00e9gation de Service Public -  DSP)  granted to Air France on March 2024 further to a tender process.\n\nThe  first  quarter  was  marked  by  a  number  of  air  traffic control  strikes  that  impacted  short  and  medium-haul capacity. Demand was particular high during the second and third quarters.\n\nThe  short  and  medium-haul  fleet  also  continued  to  be renewed  with  the  steady  arrival  of  A220  aircraft  in  this network.\n\nOn  the  French  short-haul  network ,  activity  remained significantly lower relative to 2019 owing  to  the implementation  of  the  restructuring plan for the domestic network which was launched in Summer 2020 to contend with the magnitude of the Covid-19 crisis but also the growing competition from low-cost carriers, high speed rail and the Ouigo offer (dating back several years). Point-to-point  network  activity  was  thus  down  by  67% relative  to  2019.  The  initial  short-haul  restructuring  plan was completed by the summer of 2023 with, notably, the last  route  closures  (Orly-Aurillac,  Orly-Castres  and  LyonLille,  Lyon-Pau).  However,  due  to  the  stronger  structural impact  of  remote  working,  the  growth  in  video-\n\nconferencing  and  intense  competition  from  the  rail network given its priority on short journeys for environmental  reasons,  traffic  on  the  domestic  network remained  sharply  lower.  Faced  with  this  new  structural situation,  in  October  2023,  Air  France  announced  its decision to concentrate all of its short and medium-haul operations  on  departure  from  CDG  airport  as  of  the summer  of  2026, with  the  exception  of  routes  to Corsica,  which  will  remain  served  from  Orly  airport under the public service contract awarded to Air  France  and  Air  Corsica  in  March  2024  further  to  a tender  offer .  Until  the  summer  of  2026,  the  three La Navette shuttle routes (Orly-Nice, Orly-Marseille and OrlyToulouse)  will  continue  to  be  operated  at  Orly  for  each season.\n\nIn 2023,  Air  France's  medium-haul  network saw capacity remain slightly lower than its 2019 level with an average  annual  capacity  index  of  91%  but  regained  its historic seasonal trend with demand and capacity higher in the second and third quarters to reach a capacity index of 94% compared with 2019. Although still marked by the closure  of  the  routes  to  Russia  and  Ukraine,  summer demand  remained  robust  on  the  seasonal  leisure destinations  and  business  traffic  was  up  in  2023  on  the structural network. Compared with 2022, the main growth regions in medium-haul were the Nordic countries, North Africa. Benelux, Italy and Germany.\n\nBuilt  around  the  Paris-CDG  and  Amsterdam-Schiphol hubs,  the  medium-haul  network  was  also  supported  by the recovery in the long-haul network.\n\nIn  KLM's  medium-haul  network,  overall  passenger demand  recovered. However,  the  demand  linked  to business  traffic  was  yet  to  recover  to  its  pre-Covid  level with  an  impact  on  the  financial  results  on  certain destinations.  From  an  operational  perspective,  KLM  also had  to  deal  with  a  shortage  of  manpower  in  various operational  units  like  ground  services,  flight  deck  crew and  maintenance.  Also  shortages  of  security  personnel had a significant impact on KLM's operations, especially in the  summer  months.  This  strongly  affected  operational reliability and the ability to operate the desired production  volumes.  Furthermore,  there  was  also  a significant  impact  on  the  passenger  demand  side  in terms  of  connectivity  and  reliability,  with  an  impact  on revenues and costs.\n\nIn 2023, compared to 2019, KLM's European network was at an index of 93% in ASK and the long-haul network at an index of 85%, with the following breakdown by quarter:\n\n| Q1   | Q2   |     | Q3   | Q4   |\n|------|------|-----|------|------|\n| 85%  | 90%  | 98% |      | 99%  |\n\n1",

Over  the  course  of  the  year,  the  Cargo  performance significantly deteriorated versus 2022, although it was still higher than in 2019 and this business made a substantial contribution to the 2023 Long-haul results.\n\n| Q1   |     | Q2   | Q3   | Q4   |\n|------|-----|------|------|------|\n| 87%  | 87% | 84%  |      | 84%  |\n\n## Air France long-haul operations\n\nAs in 2022, during 2023 Air France pursued its strategy of reintroducing capacity on exit from the Covid crisis. Longhaul  ASK  capacity  thus  stood  at  95%  of  its  2019  level during 2023, with the following breakdown by quarter:\n\n| Q1   |     | Q2   | Q3   | Q4   |\n|------|-----|------|------|------|\n| 96%  | 94% | 96%  |      | 99%  |\n\nDifferent dynamics were however observed depending on the zone.\n\nAfrica: a capacity index of 102% versus 2019. This zone was impacted  by  the  geopolitical  situation  in  the  Sahel  and Air  France  was  forced  to  suspend  its  flights  to  Bamako, Niamey  and  Ouagadougou  over  the  summer  of  2023. Air  France  developed  its  network  in  East  Africa  with  the launch  of  a  service  to  Dar  Es  Salaam  in  Tanzania,  in continuation from Zanzibar. The Nairobi service was also reinforced with a daily direct flight having  been introduced as of the summer. Lastly, Air France improved its product  on  Dakar  and  Johannesburg  with  the allocation of new Boeing 777-300 cabins.\n\nAsia: a  capacity  index  of  60%  versus  2019.  Asia  was  the region that continued to see the lowest capacity in 2023 relative  to  2019  but  was  nonetheless  significantly  higher than in 2022 (during which capacity had been 30% of its 2019  level).  The  highlight  of  the  Asian  region  was  the reopening of China as of the summer of 2023. Air France increased its offering to Beijing and Shanghai with a daily non-stop flight on each of these destinations. Hong Kong was also operated with a daily flight. Lastly, the service to Japan was reinforced with +80% growth in the number of seats  compared  with  2022  (two  daily  flights  to  TokyoHaneda and five flights per week on Osaka).\n\nNorth America: a capacity index of 111% versus 2019. North America was the region with the highest growth relative to  2019.  Amongst  the  highlights  were  the  opening  of Ottawa  in  Canada,  Raleigh  Durham  in  North  Carolina (route  transferred  by  Delta  Airlines)  and  the  ongoing Newark service (following its opening in December 2022). Numerous  destinations  also  saw  their  number  of frequencies  increased  (in  particular  Atlanta,  Houston, Dallas, Chicago and Toronto).\n\nCaribbean/Indian Ocean: a capacity index of 94% versus 2019: Capacity to the Caribbean/Indian Ocean region was down  by  15%  relative  to  2022  due  to  the  reopening  of other long-haul regions. Thus  the  service to the Dominican Republic was suspended and the capacity to the French West Indies was adjusted on departure from Orly.\n\nCentral/South  America: a  capacity  index  of  93%  versus 2019.  Most  of  the  destinations  returned  to  their  level  of frequencies  of  2019.  The  capacity  differential  relative  to 2019 was mainly explained by the suspension of Quito and Caracas.\n\nIndia/Middle  East: a  capacity  index  of  112%  versus  2019. The highlight of the region was the opening of Abu Dhabi in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  as  of  Winter  2023.  This opening was accompanied by a partnership with Etihad which enables Air France to sell its itineraries beyond Abu Dhabi.  Flights  to  Male/Colombo  were  suspended  at  the end  of  the  2023  first  quarter.  The  region  was  also impacted by the crisis in the Middle East and flights to Tel Aviv  were  suspended  as  of  October  2023  before  being reinstated in late January 2024.\n\n## 1.3.1.3 Navigating the digital skies A seamless journey from booking to boarding\n\nThe travel business has undergone numerous changes in recent  years,  with  eCommerce  and  digital  technology shaping the future of the industry. Further accelerated by the  Covid-19  pandemic,  there  is  a  now  unprecedented reliance on digital solutions, driving innovation, enhancing  the  customer  experience  and  reshaping  the operational landscape. Customers are increasingly turning to digital channels to interact with airlines, make their bookings and arrange their trips.\n\nAir France-KLM  is  at  the  forefront  of  this  digital transformation,  with  a  strong  focus  on  improving  the customer  journey  through  seamless  digital  solutions. From the online booking platform to in-flight connectivity, the aim is to create a unified, frictionless and personalized travel experience. What were once considered nice-to-have add-ons are now becoming the norm.\n\nLeveraging the opportunities of digital technology allows Air France-KLM to stay adaptable and resilient in all areas and enhance cost efficiency for the sales and distribution of its offer. In 2023, almost half the tickets were thus sold via  the  websites  and  the  mobile  apps.  Moreover,  digital channels  are  often  the  first  point  of  contact  with customers.  In  this  new  perspective  on  the  digital channels, sales and service work together to optimize the customer experience. It is also key to utilize the potential of Artificial Intelligence to personalize and improve service efficiency.",

Some key figures for the January to December 2023 period:\n\n- a) 17 engaged sessions per second (530 million in total) to  digital  touchpoints  (Air  France  and  KLM  websites and apps, source: Google Analytics);\n- b) 47% of all tickets sold direct online, stable versus 2022 (source: BiPortal);\n- c) 83% Direct Online Interaction Share (1) ,  i.e.  +1  pt versus 2022 (source: Opera);\n- d) 67% self-perceived success rate of self-service (source: Qualtrics).\n\n## Focus of Air France Digital Marketing in 2023 (campaigns, emails and social media)\n\n- \u25a0 More  than  600  cross-channel  campaigns  executed worldwide.\n- \u25a0 270  million  commercial  emails  sent  and  10  million commercial notifications sent.\n- \u25a0 12.6  million  fans  and  followers  worldwide  on  various social media platforms.\n- \u25a0 TikTok account in December 2023: 435,000 followers.\n- \u25a0 Launch  of  Threads  in  June  2023:  130,000  followers  in December.\n\n## Focus of KLM Digital Marketing in 2023 (campaigns, emails and social media)\n\n- \u25a0 More  than  500  cross-channel  campaigns  executed worldwide.\n- \u25a0 292 million commercial emails and 22 million commercial notifications sent.\n- \u25a0 19.2 million fans and subscribers worldwide on various social media platforms.\n- \u25a0 TikTok  launched  in  2023  with  more  than  300,000 followers at the year end.\n- \u25a0 Launch of Threads in December 2023; 130,000 followers at the year end.\n- \u25a0 19 million commercial subscriptions in the database.\n- \u25a0 26 million automated commercial e-mails.\n- \u25a0 On  average  30%  open  rate  commercial  e-mail messaging.\n- \u25a0 4.3% click rate.\n- \u25a0 22 million commercial 'push' mobile notifications.\n\n## Harnessing the power of big data and analytics to effectively serve customer needs\n\nThe digital channels are used for many actions and tasks and, to serve customers effectively, we need to know what interests them. Recognizing and understanding customers  is  therefore  becoming  the  cornerstone  for\n\nboth  commercial  strategies  and  service  excellence. Air France-KLM is gaining insight into customer preferences,  behaviors  and  travel  patterns,  which  serves as a basis for targeted marketing initiatives. This ensures that  the  Group's  efforts  are  not  only  relevant  but  also resonate with the intended audience. In short, the Group wants to offer the right products to the right customer, at the right time and in the right way.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is further improving  the recommendation  engines,  enabling  the  analysis  of  vast datasets  and  the  prediction  of  customer  preferences. From suggesting personalized travel packages to recommending  ancillary  services, AI enhances  the customer  journey  by  delivering  relevant  and  timely suggestions.\n\n## Empowering customers through self-service options\n\nCentral to the Group's efforts in 2023 was the enhancement of self-service functionalities. The Group is committed  to  ensuring  a  streamlined  journey  for  its customers, while enhancing operational efficiencies, and supporting employees in their daily activities.\n\nFollowing  the  implementation  of  the  \"Ready  to  Fly\" service,  which  supported  customers  with  the  required health  documentation  enabling  them  to  travel,  the \"Clearance Checklist\" was introduced in 2023. This service helps customers to submit, in advance, all the mandatory documents  and  information  required  to  obtain  a boarding  pass.  This  checklist  ensures  that  customers arrive  at  the  airport  well-prepared,  thereby  reducing stress and enhancing  the  overall ease of travel. Additionally, it helps to optimize operational processes for airport  staff,  reducing  the  potential  for  bottlenecks  and delays during the check-in and boarding processes.\n\nWithin the context of operational challenges, Air FranceKLM also offers its customers the possibility to request a refund  for  tickets  and  ancillary  services  via  the  direct online  channel,  and  has  improved  the  tracking  of  the refund  status  for  customers.  79%  of  these  requests  are now processed automatically, leading to a cost saving of \u20ac4.8  million.  Lastly,  the  self-service  rebooking  options were also further enriched in 2023, easing the possibilities and guidance for customers in the event of disruption. In 2023, the group thus improved how it connects chatbots to customers. WhatsApp has become a major communication channel for Air France-KLM with 86% of global  chatbot  users  using  it.  Air  France-KLM  also introduced Apple Business Chat as a new way to interact with  its  chatbots  and  extended  this  chatbot  access  to Messenger  Flying  Blue  accounts,  adding  a  self-service function.  The  Group  reviewed  its  Baggage  and  Claim flows  to  improve  performance  based  on  customer feedback,  and  explored  Generative  AI  capabilities  to obtain  more  dynamic and relevant interactions.  Our  key performance indicators show that our bots are handling almost 70% of conversations across different social media platforms,  with  37%  being  assisted  and  30%  fully managed by our bots.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Activities in 2023\n\n## Digital solutions to enhance the travel experience\n\nIn 2023, the Group's commitment to enhancing the travel experience  was  extended  to  the  day  of  travel  with  the global roll-out of new  airport  kiosks.  Focused  on accessibility, these kiosks feature text-to-speech functionality  and  keypad  navigation,  catering  to  the needs of visually-impaired customers. Additionally, some kiosks  are  designed  with  reduced  height,  ensuring accessibility for customers in wheelchairs.\n\nMoreover,  the  Air  France  and  KLM  mobile  apps  now feature  updated  airport  maps,  which  help  customers  to find  their  way  through  the  two  main  hubs.  This  digital enhancement  simplifies  navigation,  contributing  to  a stress-free journey and improving the transfer experience.\n\nTo  support  customers  with  a  transfer  at  Schiphol,  KLM also  launched  the  'Short  Connection  Pass'.  This  digital pass  allows  customers  with  a  short  connection  time  to skip  security  lines,  to  minimize  the  risk  of  missing  their flights.  So-called  'digital  queue  management'  facilities are  now  available  at  all  service  and  transfer  centers  at Schiphol,  making  the  waiting  time  of  customers  more comfortable  by  standing  in  a  virtual  queue  instead  of  a physical  one.  This  also  allows  us  to  highlight  the  selfservice options that are specifically tailored to customers' needs.\n\n## Connecting the skies: onboard connectivity\n\nAir France-KLM is further enhancing its in-flight entertainment options by providing WiFi onboard. All of the aircraft in the Air France fleet and KLM's intercontinental  fleet  are  now  fully  WiFi  equipped,  and the KLM medium-haul fleet is in progress. The Group thus\n\noffers its customers a robust platform for streaming, realtime communication and even remote working. Through satellite  connections  from  various  data  suppliers  and enabled  by  its  in-house-built  connectivity  platform  and onboard portal, the Group can establish a data connection and give customers a consistent experience and a smooth transition to the rest of the digital portfolio for self-service, information and commercial offers.\n\nAir France-KLM thus offers three different WiFi packages on its flights: a Messaging Pass (free of charge), a Surf Pass and  a  Stream  Pass.  Additionally,  for  Air  France La Premiere customers, WiFi is unlimited and free of charge.\n\n## The digital frontier of sustainability\n\nAimed  at  a  more  sustainable  aviation  industry,  digital technology and eCommerce platforms have emerged as essential  drivers  for  change.  2023  witnessed  a  profound shift  towards  sustainable  practices,  with  Air  France-KLM leveraging  digital  solutions  to  engage  customers  on sustainable products and services, not only to reduce the environmental footprint but also to empower customers wishing  to  make  an  active  contribution  to  an  ecofriendlier  future.  One  concrete  example  is  the  seamless handover from airport kiosks to the mobile apps, enabling customers to download a digital boarding pass instead of a printed version.\n\nIn  2023  the  Group  also  expanded  the  pre-order  meal proposition,  allowing  Business  class  customers  to  select their  preferred  dining  options  by  website  and  app, thereby enabling a reduction in catering waste. Additionally, for Flying Blue customers, their contribution to  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel  is  now  rewarded  with  XP points.\n\n## 1.3.1.4  Cargo\n\n|                                 | Fourth Quarter   | Fourth Quarter   | Fourth Quarter                | Full Year   | Full Year   | Full Year                     |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cargo Business                  | 2023             | Change           | Change at  constant  currency | 2023        | Change      | Change at  constant  currency |\n| Tons  (thousands)               | 235              | (0.3%)           |                               | 875         | (6.1%)      |                               |\n| Capacity  (ATK m)               | 3,577            | 5.0%             |                               | 14,076      | 6.2%        |                               |\n| Traffic  (RTK m)                | 1,772            | 0.9%             |                               | 6,550       | (4.9%)      |                               |\n| Load factor                     | 49.5%            | (2.0)pt          |                               | 46.5 %      | (5.4)pt     |                               |\n| TOTAL CARGO REVENUES  (\u20ac m)     | 651              | (22.9%)          | -%                            | 2,488       | (29.0%)     | -%                            |\n| Scheduled Cargo revenues  (\u20ac m) | 510              | (30.4%)          | -%                            | 2,012       | (34.0%)     | -%                            |\n| Unit revenue per RTK  (\u20ac cts)   | 14.23            | (33.8%)          | (31.8%)                       | 14.29       | (37.9%)     | (36.8%)                       |\n\nGlobal air cargo demand declined month over month in the  first  three  quarters  of  2023,  while  global  air  cargo capacity  increased.  Against  this  backdrop,  scheduled  air cargo revenues decreased by 34.0% at constant currency compared  to  last  year.  The  Group's  cargo  capacity increased  by  6.2%  as  a  result  of  the  increased  belly capacity in the passenger fleet.\n\nThe  demand  for  air  cargo  softened  in  2023  due  to  the slower  global  economic  growth  as  a  result  of  the\n\ngeopolitical situation, increased inflation and the decrease in  container  prices  for  sea  freight.  2023  thus  ended  with traffic down (-4.9%) compared to the previous year and a decrease in unit revenues (-36.8%) at constant currency. In 2023,  the  Group's  Cargo  business  carried  875 million kilograms, a figure which was 6.1% lower than in 2022, of which 81% in the bellies of passenger aircraft and 19% in the full freighter fleet.",

        "page_content": "In 2023, the Group's cargo capacity was still 3.6% below its 2019  level.  Total  scheduled  cargo  revenues  were  9.2% higher  than  in  2019  due  to  higher  yields,  while  the  load factor remained below its 2019 level. In the fourth quarter, the decrease in global air cargo demand looked to have bottomed  out  with  demand  then  slowly  ramping  up although  this  quarter  was  still  relatively  weak  given  the economic environment and the geopolitical situation.\n\nIn 2023, Air France-KLM Cargo renewed its strategy with a 2030  vision,  aiming  to  'become  a  leader  in  sustainable airfreight, while passionately delivering best-in-class customer  experiences'.  Customers  thus  benefited  from new digital  services  and  allocation  functionalities  on  the myCargo  platform,  resulting  in  almost  80%  of  initial bookings taking place online and the Group improved the Cargo  product  offering  with  the  introduction  of  a  new PLUS  service  level, specifically intended  for cargo shipments requiring higher priority.\n\nAir  France-KLM Cargo launched its cooperation with the Smart  Freight  Centre  (SFC),  which  enables  air  cargo players to work together to define a clear framework for CO2  emissions.  The  Group  also  added  several  new contracts with customers on sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nThus,  at  Chicago  O'Hare  International  Airport,  the  Group opened  its  newly-configured,  renovated  warehouse,  the largest international cargo airport in North America.\n\nIn  April  2023,  Air  France-KLM  Cargo  also  launched  a commercial partnership with CMA  CGM,  meeting customers'  needs  with  unique  seamless  services  across the  globe.  However,  due  to,  amongst  other  things,  the tight  regulatory  environment  in  certain  large  cargo markets, in January 2024, Air France-KLM Cargo and CMA CGM  announced  that  they  would  withdraw  from  their existing agreements as of March 31, 2024. Air France-KLM and  CMA  CGM  are  currently  in  discussions  on  the  new terms and conditions of a business relationship in which they  would  operate  independently  from  March  31,  2024 onwards.\n\n## 1.3.1.5 Airline partnerships and alliances: expanding the Group's commercial presence to respond to global air transport demand\n\nAir  transport  demand  is  global  and,  to  respond  to  this demand,  Air  France-KLM  is  pursuing  an  ambitious strategy aimed at expanding its commercial presence in every region of the world.\n\nAirline  alliances  and  partnerships  are  an  integral  part  of this  strategy.  They  contribute  to  meeting  customer expectations and thus creating value for both the Group and  its  customers.  They  reinforce  the  Group's  market positioning  thanks  to  an  expanded  and  more  diversified network, which supplements the Group's own offer. They may also enable the generation of operational synergies.\n\n2023  was  marked  by  a  resurgence  in  joint-ventures (particularly financial settlement agreements) and partnership activity in general.\n\n## Strategic partnerships\n\nIn  July  2017,  Air  France-KLM  had  announced  a  further major step in the reinforcement of its strategic partnerships  with,  on  one  hand,  the  creation  of  a  single global  joint-venture  between  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  Air Lines, Inc. and Virgin Atlantic and, on the other hand, the intensification  of  its  partnership  with  China  Eastern Airlines. These two commercial alliances were consolidated by equity links with Delta Air Lines, Inc. and China Eastern Airlines each then acquiring an 8.8% equity interest  in  Air  France-KLM  within  the  framework  of reserved  capital  increases  carried  out  during  2017,  for  a total of \u20ac751 million.\n\nThe  strategic,  commercial  and  capitalistic  reinforcement of  these  partnerships  positions  Air  France-KLM  as  the European pillar of the leading global airline network.\n\n## Transatlantic joint-venture with Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic\n\nOn  January  1,  2020,  following  approval  by  the  US authorities  on  November  21,  2019,  the  Group  launched  a new  transatlantic  joint-venture  with  Delta  and  Virgin Atlantic.  As  a  result,  as  of  December  31,  2019,  a  decade after  its  creation,  the  Group  ended  the  existing  jointventure  between  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and  Alitalia.  As with most joint-ventures in the industry, it did not lead to the  creation  of  a  common  company  but  rather  the signature of a contract defining both the mechanism of a common  income  statement,  and  governance  and organizations  to  manage  all  aspects  of  the  partnership. The existence of an internal common income statement ensures  that  the  partners  implement  all  the  actions contributing  to  an  improved  operating  result  for  the activity,  to  their  mutual  benefit.  Each  company  member of  the  joint-venture  recognizes  the  revenues  and  costs relating  to  the  joint-venture  scope  in  their  respective income statements. If necessary, a settlement mechanism between  joint-venture  members  will  compensate  the imbalances  in  value  creation  based  on  a  mechanism agreed between the parties. This mechanism contributes to  ''metal  neutrality'',  enabling  the  different  members  to jointly  manage  capacity  and  look  for  an  overall  benefit rather  than  the  individual  interests  of  each  airline, ultimately  increasing  value  for  both  the  partners  and customers.\n\nThe  governance  bodies  comprise  a  CEO  Committee,  a monthly  JV  Leadership  Team  meeting  and  multiple working groups.\n\nThe  scope  of  this  joint-venture  is  very  wide,  covering  all the flights between North America (including Canada and Mexico) and Europe through integrated cooperation and all the flights between North America to and from Africa, the Middle East and India together with the flights from Europe to and from Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador through close coordination.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Activities in 2023\n\nThis  joint-venture  is  a  major  player  on  the  transatlantic network, the leading market  for international air transportation.  Prior  to  the  public  health  crisis  it  had revenues exceeding US$13 billion, a market share of 23% and more than 340 daily flights linking the partners' hubs. Pricing and revenue management are centralized within a 60-strong team based in Amsterdam.\n\nThe  coordination  of  the  network  is  reflected  in  the strengthening of the Hub-to-Hub services, the optimization of aircraft types assigned to each route and an increase in the number of destinations served by nonstop flights on both sides of the Atlantic and the English Channel.  The  sales  forces  have  been  regrouped  in  each region.\n\nThis extended scope marks the expansion and strengthening of  one  of  the  most  advanced  partnership models in the airline industry.\n\n## Partnership in China - a consolidated presence in the Chinese market\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  benefit  from  a  historic  presence  in China, bolstered by a strong partnership with one of the three  largest  Chinese  carriers,  through  a  joint-venture agreement concluded ten  years  ago.  In  2012,  Air  France had signed a joint-venture agreement involving the Paris and Shanghai routes with China Eastern Airlines, a major player in Chinese air transportation, which operates a vast domestic and international network mainly out of its base in Shanghai, China's economic lung. This agreement was extended  to  KLM  in  2016,  when  China  Eastern  Airlines inaugurated the Shanghai-Amsterdam  service. The partnership  was  further  reinforced  in  2017  when  China Eastern  Airlines  acquired  an  8.8%  equity  interest  in Air France-KLM  via  a  reserved  capital  increase.  In November  2018,  Air  France-KLM  and  China  Eastern Airlines  signed  an  agreement  extending  their  jointventure to two additional routes, Paris-Wuhan and ParisKunming,  as  of  January  1,  2019,  thereby  offering  their respective  customers  new  routes  under  code  share  and new  connecting  opportunities  between  Europe  and China. In April 2021, China Eastern Airlines participated in the  Air  France-KLM  share  capital  increase.  Within  this context, both airline groups decided to extend the scope of  their  partnership  through  an  intensified  commercial cooperation  and  an  increased  footprint  on  the  Beijing market,  with  the  Paris-Beijing  and  Amsterdam-Beijing routes joining the existing Joint-Venture between Air  France-KLM  and  China  Eastern  Airlines  once  the conditions  had  been  satisfied.  In  addition,  in  May  2022, China  Eastern  Airlines  participated,  through  a  neutral operation, in the rights issue launched by Air France-KLM, taking  its  equity  interest  to  4.6%  of  the  Air  France-KLM share  capital.  Lastly,  in  July  2023,  Air  France-KLM  and China  Eastern  Airlines  reactivated  their  joint-venture agreement which had been suspended during the Covid pandemic.\n\nThanks  to  this  partnership,  Air  France-KLM  can  offer  its customers  access  to  more  than  thirty  destinations  in China.\n\nIn total, the revenues from the routes operated between Europe  and  China  by  airlines  participating  in  this  joint-\n\nventure agreement represented more than \u20ac600 million in  2019  (the  last  full  year  available  given  the  suspension linked to the Covid crisis).\n\n## Strategic partnership with GOL\n\nIn 2014, Air France-KLM  and  GOL  Linhas  A\u00e9reas Inteligentes signed an exclusive five-year strategic partnership,  reinforcing  their  commercial  cooperation between  Brazil  and  Europe.  This  partnership  notably foresees  the  optimization  of  synergies  between  the  two groups and, in particular, connecting opportunities in the major Brazilian cities served by the Group. This partnership has proven to be a great success, with almost 20% of Air France passengers flying to Brazil transferring to GOL flights. Since April 2015, GOL has used its code on Air France-KLM flights between Europe and Brazil, and on European destinations beyond Paris and Amsterdam. The two partners cooperate on promoting sales in their home markets and, since November 2017, Air France has been GOL's GSA for the French market.\n\nIn  October  2019,  Air  France-KLM  and  GOL  had  renewed this  strategic  partnership  agreement  for  a  five-year period.  In  October  2023,  Air  France-KLM  and  GOL  again renewed  this  strategic  partnership  for  an  additional  ten years. Air France-KLM and GOL remain exclusive partners on  the  Europe-Brazil  corridor,  with  some  exceptions granted (2) .\n\n## Other joint-ventures and code shares\n\nAir France-KLM implements various forms of partnership agreements,  the  choice  depending  on  the  balance between value creation for its customers and the Group, and the necessary level of interaction between the offers of the partners, together with the regulatory requirements framing the scope of each agreement.\n\nThe  first  levels  of  interline  cooperation  are  Traffic  and Special  Prorate  Agreements  (SPA)  between  the  partner airlines, enabling the combination of their networks while maintaining their respective IATA codes and setting their own fares.\n\nCooperating  further  within  the  framework  of  a  codesharing agreement, two partner airlines sell tickets on the same flight, each under their own code and setting their own  fares.  The  operating  carrier  has  operational  control over  the  aircraft  while  the  marketing  partner,  for  sales purposes,  uses  its  own  flight  number  on  its  partner's flights. Any such agreement must comply with the safety and regulatory requirements set forth by the competent authorities.\n\nThere are two types of code sharing. In the first, under a block seat agreement, the marketing partner purchases a fixed amount of capacity from the operating carrier. The marketing  partner  has  inventory  control  over  the  seat block.  In  the  second,  known  as  free  flow,  no  division  of capacity is set, the two partners potentially selling all the seats  on  the  relevant  flights  although  inventory  control remains the prerogative of the operating carrier. Access to capacity  on  the  relevant  flights  is  through  negotiated fares for each booking class.",

        "page_content": "## PRESENTATION OF THE AIR FRANCE-KLM GROUP\n\n## Activities in 2023\n\nJoint-ventures  are  the  next  level  in  alliances  and participate  in  the  trend  towards  consolidation  when  the partners are seeking a higher level of joint optimization on a sub-scope of their network without, however, considering a merger.\n\nA  joint-venture  enables  value  creation  for  customers  in the markets where it is implemented and, as a result for the partners who organize coordination of the commercial activities:\n\n- \u25a0 for customers, they enable access to an expanded offer of  flights  and  improved  connectivity,  loyalty  program benefits across a wider perimeter, a harmonized travel experience and integrated commercial propositions;\n- \u25a0 the  partners  thus  improve  their  market  positioning, serving  a  higher  number  of  customers  and  enabling them to capture market growth.\n\nThe  partners  define  the  governance  principles  and financial sharing mechanisms, enabling decision-making and  execution  across  the  whole  value  chain,  thus responding  to  the  commercial  objectives  of  the  jointventure.\n\nThe  final  stages  in  cooperation  -  consolidation  and integration  -  are  mergers  or  equity  interests,  anchoring the  development  of  a  common  strategy  over  the  long term.\n\nJoint-ventures,  equity  interests  and  mergers  must  be approved  in  the  light  of  the  regulations  in  force  in  the jurisdictions  covering  the  scopes  of  the  agreements, particularly with respect to the competition  rules (e.g. Anti-trust Immunity).\n\n## 1.3.1.6 SkyTeam alliance\n\nThe  three  large  alliances,  SkyTeam  (to  which  Air  France and  KLM  belong),  Star  Alliance  and  oneworld,  represent some 55% of worldwide airline traffic. Around two-thirds of the top 50 airline carriers in the world belong to a global alliance.\n\nSince the inception of the global alliances, their capacity in terms of the available seats offered by member airlines has  grown  by  more  than  the  industry  average,  with SkyTeam  now  being  the  second  largest  global  alliance, behind Star Alliance and ahead of oneworld.\n\n## SkyTeam: a global alliance\n\nSkyTeam,  created  in  2000,  is  a  global  alliance  which numbered 20 airline  members as of  December 31,  2023: Aeroflot (suspended), Aerolineas Argentinas, Aeromexico, Air  Europa,  Air  France,  China  Airlines,  China  Eastern Airlines, Czech Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Garuda Indonesia, ITA Airways, Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Middle East Airlines,  Saudi  Arabian Airlines, TAROM, Vietnam Airlines, Virgin  Atlantic  (which  joined  the  alliance  in  2023)  and XiamenAir.\n\nBelonging to SkyTeam enables its members  to strengthen their brand awareness and extend their offer around  the  globe,  thereby  bolstering  their  commercial presence. As members of the SkyTeam alliance, Air France and  KLM  thus  have  access  to  a  global  network  of  more than 10,770 daily flights to 1,050 destinations in more than 166 countries.\n\nIn  2023,  its  437  million  passengers  benefited  from  a seamless  travel  experience  on  the  flights  of  member airlines and had access to more than 750 airport lounges around  the  world.  The  passengers  who  are  members  of frequent flyer programs can earn and burn air miles on all SkyTeam partner flights.\n\nTo become a SkyTeam alliance member, airlines need to fulfil a  series  of  specific  membership  requirements, relating to operations, technologies and products. Members  must  be  linked  by  bilateral  agreements covering code sharing, their loyalty programs and access to airport lounges.\n\nWhile retaining their separate identities  and  brands,  the airlines combine their networks to offer their customers a more extensive range of travel solutions and the related global  services,  more  rapid  earning  of  miles,  access  to numerous  airport  lounges  but  also  a  more  seamless customer  service  during  the  different  stages  of  their journeys  thanks  to  the  SkyPriority  and  SkyTransfer programs.\n\nSkyTeam  also  provides  an  environment  and  tools enabling members to generate operational cost synergies (e.g. co-located facilities, better use of airport lounges and notably the seven SkyTeam lounges, a joint IT platform, etc.).\n\nAirlines  must  also  be  able  to  offer  the  products  and services  exclusive  to  the  SkyTeam  alliance.  SkyTeam  has notably  developed  proprietary  products  such  as  Passes enabling  travel  at  competitive  fares,  global  contracts reserved for large companies or international events, and a product dedicated to Marine and Offshore personnel.\n\nSkyTeam's  main  governance  body  is  the  Alliance  Board, composed  of  the  Chairs  and  Chief  Executive  Officers  of the 20 member airlines. The Alliance Board meets twice a year  to  define  the  strategic  orientations  of  the  Alliance such as the introduction of new members, the definition of  the  customer  experience  and  the  positioning  of  the SkyTeam  brand  along  with  its  related  investment  and operational budget.\n\nThe Executive Board, consisting of senior executives with direct commercial and operational roles, is appointed by the Alliance Board and translates the approved strategic orientations  into  action  plans  in  a  wide  range  of disciplines ranging from marketing, airport synergies, the interface  between  information  systems,  the  transfer product  between  the  member  airlines,  cargo  and advertising of the brand.\n\nIn  parallel  with  their  proprietary  development  projects, the  member  airlines  commit  to  implementing  the SkyTeam action plans by earmarking the required internal resources and respecting the timelines set.\n\n1",

Transavia's  cost  structure  is strictly aligned with the low-cost business  model: optimizing the utilization of aircraft, simple products and fares, a strong focus on ancillary revenues, light organizational  structures  and  the  outsourcing  of  a significant portion of the activities.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia France had celebrated its 15 th anniversary.  It  is  now  the  leading  low-cost  carrier  on departure from Paris (CDG, Orly and Beauvais). Transavia Netherlands  is  the  leading  low-cost  carrier  in  the Netherlands,  operating  from  its  bases  in  Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven, and from Brussels.\n\n## Growth trajectory\n\nIn 2023, Transavia Netherlands surpassed the milestone of \u20ac1 billion in revenues for the first time in its history, while the yield level on tickets increased by 3%. Spain was the strongest market, with more than 40% of overall capacity. Transavia enjoyed high yields and revenues per available seat,  while  bookings  with  Transavia  Holidays,  through\n\nwhich  Transavia  Netherlands  offers  complete  holiday packages, also rose.\n\nThe challenging start to the year was due to restrictions imposed by Schiphol on the number of daily passengers, the inability of lessors to deliver aircraft and supply chain issues  leading  to  a  shortage  of  spare  parts  for  the  fleet. This  resulted  in  up  to  10  aircraft  being  grounded  during the second quarter, forcing Transavia to cancel flights and rebook passengers. While these measures impacted the results,  the  operation  was  stabilized  by  the  end  of  May and the remainder of the year enabled operating income to  come  in  above  its  2022  and  2019  levels.  Transavia realized  an  overall  load  factor  of  91%.  Despite  the challenges,  Transavia  was  able  to  make  progress  on  its strategic  priorities,  including  fleet  renewal,  sustainability initiatives and various digital innovations.\n\nIn  2023,  Transavia  France  accelerated  its  growth  within the framework of the Air France-KLM transformation plan. The airline pursued its growth in its flagship markets with a  substantial  increase  in  its  fleet  from  61  aircraft  in Summer 2022  to  71  in  Summer  2023.  The  company  will have 81 aircraft by the end of 2024.",

        "page_content": "To respond  to  the  demand  and  satisfy  customer expectations,  capacity  was  added  in  Transavia's  main markets  in  the  Mediterranean  basin.  In  total,  Transavia France  launched  35  new  routes  in  2023  to  various destinations  in  Europe  and  beyond,  on  departure  from several  French  airports  (Orly,  Nantes,  Lyon,  Marseille, Montpellier, Rennes, Brest, Bordeaux) to Senegal, Armenia, Morocco, Duba\u00ef, etc.\n\nDuring  Summer  2023,  the  airline  operated  more  than 100  destinations  on  departure  from  Paris-Orly  and 120  from  its  whole  network,  totaling  some  200  routes.  It proved  to  be  a  record  summer  in  terms  of  activity  for Transavia France which operated up to 300 flights a day over  some  weekends.  With  3  million  passengers  carried during  the  summer  peak  (July  and  August),  Transavia France achieved a load factor of 90%.\n\nBack in 2022, Transavia Netherlands had started operating three daily flights  on  departure  from  Brussels. With load factors exceeding their 2022 level, in line with those for The Netherlands, and 80% of passengers being Belgian, the company's operations were expanded to five daily flights to 11 destinations in 2023. In The Netherlands, two new destinations were added (Troms\u00f8 and Bordeaux), increasing the network to a total of 110  destinations  and  159  routes.  Meanwhile,  preparations were made to start operating flights to  Tirana,  Oslo  and Tbilissi  in  2024.  Due  to  the  geopolitical  situation  in  the Middle East, Transavia Netherlands cancelled all its flights to Tel Aviv and Beirut. Transavia Holidays, through which the  airline  offers  package  deals  that  include  hotels  and car  rental,  saw  growth  on  the  back  of  the  surge  in demand for holidays in The Netherlands.\n\nDuring 2023, Transavia worked closely with its partners in the  Air  France-KLM  group.  Together  with  Transavia France,  the  product  portfolio,  IT  systems  and  passenger propositions were further developed. Transavia is exploring  a  shift  towards  a  new  revenue  management system in 2024 and has joined an Air France-KLM group tender for a new crew management system.\n\n## ASK INCREASE OVER THE 2023 YEAR\n\n|                        | Q1   | Q2   | Q3   | Q4   | FY   |\n|------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Transavia              | 38%  | 10%  | 14%  | 3%   | 14%  |\n| Transavia  France      | 47%  | 12%  | 12%  | (1%) | 14%  |\n| Transavia  Netherlands | 28%  | 6%   | 16%  | 9%   | 13%  |\n\n## Renewal of the fleet\n\nAfter flying Boeing aircraft for 58 years, at the end of 2022 the  decision  was  made  to  replace  the  Boeing  737s  with the Airbus 320neo family, an aircraft type more suited to the  changing  playing  field.  The  Airbus  320/321  will  allow Transavia to offer a better product with less CO2 emissions per passenger per kilometer and less noise emissions per aircraft,  increase  its  capacity  and  operate  more  cost efficiently.  A  pivotal  part  of  the  airline's  sustainability\n\nstrategy, the new aircraft aims to reduce CO2 emissions by more  than  15%,  lower  nitrogen  emissions  and  halve  the noise footprint.\n\nTransavia Netherlands thus took delivery of its first Airbus A321 at the end of the year, and plans to phase-in seven more in 2024.\n\nFor  Transavia  France,  fleet  renewal  is  a  totally  unique event  and  a  major  challenge.  The  first  A320neo  for Transavia France arrived in early 2024 and the airline will receive a total of 13 Airbus aircraft by the end of 2024.\n\nThe  Airbus  A320neo  will  be  the  driver  of  Transavia's growth and of its economic (10% reduction in unit costs) and environmental competitiveness (15% reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger km and a 50% reduction in the noise  footprint).  It  will  give  the  company  the  ability  to attain the ambitious targets that have been set for it.\n\n## Adaptation of the domestic network\n\nThe  domestic  network  represents  around  10%  of  the Transavia France flight schedule. The airline is confident in its  ability  to  succeed  in  this  market  as  the  product  is aligned  with  customer  expectations.  Transavia  France  is focusing  on  high-potential  routes  (Orly-Toulon,  OrlyBiarritz, Nantes-Marseille, etc.).\n\nThe company permanently monitors the performance of its routes. Its agility enables the continuous adaptation of its flight capacity to demand.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nWith  some  4,791  employees,  2,531  of  whom  work  for Transavia  France  and  2,260  for  Transavia  Netherlands, service quality, the proximity of crews and innovation are the  center  of  Transavia's  commitments.  This  stance  has led  to  the  company  regularly  winning  awards.  For  the fourth time, Transavia France was thus voted 'Customer Service  of  the  Year  2024'  in  the  Collective  Passenger Transport  (ESCDA)  category.  In  the  Skytrax  -  Best  Low Cost  Airline  2023  ranking,  Transavia  France  was  named the 2 nd Best European low-cost airline, and number six at global level. The company was also awarded the Qualiweb 2023  trophy  for  the  quality  of  its  online  service  in  the Tourism and Transport category.\n\nTransavia  Netherlands  was  awarded  with  the  Dutch Holiday Award for 'Best Short Haul Airline'.\n\nDuring the year, Transavia invested in digital services and innovation.  It  began  to  simplify  its  IT  system  portfolio  in order to facilitate the introduction of new offers and crossselling  between  channels.  It  also  improved  the  airlines' ability  to  personalize  the  offerings  per  passenger,  use dynamic pricing and provide passengers with recognition on board. A pilot was thus run in partnership with cinema operator Path\u00e9  to  offer passengers  flying out of Rotterdam-The Hague Airport the ability to watch movies on their own devices as part of the Path\u00e9 Thuis streaming service offering.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Activities in 2023\n\n## Staff: a move to a new head office and flex office, people and talent management\n\nTo  accompany  its  strong  growth,  Transavia  France  is recruiting  and  offers  a  wide  range  of  opportunities  in various fields: airline operations, engineering & maintenance,  sales,  information  technology,  finance, human  resources,  etc.  The  workforce  should  grow  to 3,000 in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, Transavia France hired new staff to contend with the increase in production, although it was challenging to recruit  technical  staff  in  a  tight  labor  market.  The  airline also  concluded  new  collective  labor  agreements  with pilots, cabin crew and ground staff. Employee engagement rose from 66% in 2022 to just under 70% this year. The Net Promoter Score ended the year at 32, only slightly below target.\n\n## Sustainable development and CSR\n\nAs  a  subsidiary  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group,  Transavia France  has  been  committed  to  reducing  its  carbon footprint for several years. It is now looking to accelerate its environmental transition by activating all the levers at its  disposal  and  fostering  the  emergence  of  innovative solutions.\n\nIn  the  shorter  term,  the  Air  France-KLM group including Transavia has committed to a 30% reduction in its CO2eq emissions  per  revenue  ton-kilometer  (RTK)  by  2030 relative to the 2019 baseline.\n\nIn January 2024, on the occasion of the delivery of its first A320neo,  Transavia  France  operated  its La  Navette shuttle  service  from  Toulouse  to  Orly  powered  by  a  30% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These fuels enable an  average  80%  reduction  in  CO2  emissions  over  the entire life cycle and are destined to play a key role in the decarbonization of air transportation.\n\nAs  part  of  the  KLM  group,  Transavia  Netherlands acknowledges  that  it  can  play  an  important  role  in making aviation more sustainable. Transavia Netherlands has  increased  its  SAF  proportion  to  1.8%,  i.e.  above  the legal  requirement,  on  all  its  flights  departing  from Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Eindhoven and Brussels, and has launched a SAF program for travel agents, which allows them to satisfy the market demand for more sustainable\n\ntravel.  Transavia  Netherlands  is  calling  for  governmental support  to  scale  SAF  production  upwards  through  the redeployment of the ticket tax in the Netherlands.\n\nTransavia  Netherlands  no  longer  uses  non-recyclable plastic on board, with the exception of products that fall under the EU-CAT1 waste regulation which legally cannot be  recycled.  Furthermore,  Transavia  Netherlands  has invested in a Dutch start-up, Fly with Lucy, which aims to be the first electric airline in the Netherlands.\n\nTransavia  France  is  a  pioneer  in  the  implementation  of eco-pilot programs, which is another avenue to reducing its environmental footprint. The pursuit of its partnerships with  start-ups  Safety  Line  (SITA)  and  OpenAirlines  has enabled a 3% to 5% reduction in CO2 emissions per flight.\n\nThe  three  OptiFlight  solutions  (combined)  of  its  partner Safety Line can save more than 80 tons of fuel per aircraft per year, i.e. the equivalent of one aircraft flying neutrally in the Transavia France fleet.\n\nAdditionally,  this  year  Transavia  France  again  reinforced its commitment  to  associations  like Magie  \u00e0  Bord, Personn'ailes,  Les  Hommes  de  l'Air and  the  Carlesimo association, with awareness-raising initiatives for passengers and ground staff.\n\nTransavia  France  has  replaced  single  use  plastics  with renewable materials, introduced sustainable uniforms for crew  and  begun  to  recycle  waste.  KLM  and  Transavia Netherlands have also initiated a process of procurement certification, which will hold suppliers to higher sustainability standards.\n\nIn  2022,  Transavia  Netherlands  took  further  steps  to promote  Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) within the organization.  The  new  D&I  team  was  set  up  and  a company-wide  survey  was  sent  out  to  gauge  feedback. One  key  element  of  this  strategy  is  to  empower colleagues to make a greater social impact, for example through  the  internal  crowd  sourcing  platform  WeCare, through  which  several  social  NGOs  receive  financial support,  and  the  Peter  J.  Legro  Award,  which  earmarks financial support for a good cause.\n\nLastly,  fleet  renewal  constitutes  another  pillar  in  the trajectory  to  achieve  the  Group's  targets.  The  Airbus A320neo emits 15% less CO2 per passenger km than the current Boeing 737-800. It also reduces the noise footprint by 50%.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.3 Maintenance business\n\nAircraft maintenance is the Air France-KLM group's third business  with  third-party  revenues  of  \u20ac1.7  billion.  These revenues generated with external clients thus represented 40.4% of the total revenues in this business. In  2023,  despite  a  turbulent  geopolitical  climate  and significant supply chain challenges in the industry, the AFI KLM E&M order book remained at a high level with a total value of US$8.7 billion.\n\nIn the aircraft maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair and  Overhaul)  market,  Air  France  Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance (AFI KLM E&M) ranks number two globally amongst the multi-product players. AFI KLM E&M's  mission  is  to  supply  competitive  support  for  the Group's fleet, while consolidating its position as a leader in the MRO market.\n\nThe Group  operates  in three major maintenance segments:  airframe  maintenance,  engine  maintenance and component support (electronic, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc.).\n\nAirframe  maintenance  covers  three  sub-segments:  line operations  support  which  aims  to  verify  the  proper  dayto-day  functioning  of  systems  and  the  integrity  of  the aircraft structure, heavy maintenance for in-depth checks involving the disassembly of cabins, equipment and some structural  elements,  and  the  realization  of  modification programs, particularly the retro-fitting of cabins.\n\n## 1.3.3.1 Business environment\n\n## An attractive market despite the growing constraints\n\nThe  aeronautics  maintenance  or  MRO  (Maintenance, Repair,  Overhaul)  market  is  mostly  driven  by  the  age, cycles and flight hours of the worldwide fleet. According to  estimates,  the  global  MRO  market,  which  comprises the  maintenance  and  modification  spending  by  aircraft operators either directly or through sub-contractors, first collapsed in 2020 before recovering in 2021 and 2022.\n\nFor 2023, the MRO market is forecast to amount to $93.9 billion, rising to $125.3 billion in 2033 (1) .\n\nThe  trends  in  this  business  closely  follow  those  of  the commercial  airline  fleets  globally  and  their  utilization. Firstly the recovery following the public health crisis and an increased emphasis on sustainability have accelerated fleet  adjustment decisions for airlines worldwide, to gain efficiency  and  reduce  CO2  emissions.  This  explains  why the maintenance of new-generation aircraft represents an increasingly  significant  part  of  the  market.  This  benefits MRO  providers  like  AFI  KLM  E&M  which  are  well positioned  on  the  new-generation  segments.  Another trend  strongly  apparent  in  the  MRO  business  is  the digitalization of engineering and support services, which are  expected  to  be  increasingly  used  by  airlines  in  an effort  to  optimize  their  ground  time  and  operations. Lastly, high inflation combined with disrupted and heavily\n\npressurized supply chains mean that the availability and cost of spare  parts  are  being  scrutinized.  This  is challenging  performance  levels  world-wide  and  putting upwards pressure on maintenance costs.\n\n## Competitive landscape\n\nCompetition  in  the  MRO  market  is  fierce,  with  several players  competing  over  business  with  airlines  who  are becoming ever-more demanding. Ensuring fair competition in the after-sales market thus means helping airline operators to secure their budgets and performance over the long term.\n\nThe ability to sustain balanced competitive conditions is a priority  objective  for  AFI  KLM  E&M's  commercial  activity, but  also  to  contain  Air  France's  and  KLM's  maintenance costs.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  this  business  is  experiencing  a technological  change  which  is  influencing  the  products, processes, methods  and  competencies  within  the maintenance activities. This is notably the case with newgeneration  aircraft  whose  avionics  dimension  is  playing an increasingly important role relative to the mechanical systems (digital tools, composite structures, connectivity, etc.).  Innovation  is  an  integral  part  of  all  the  business processes.\n\n## Difficulties linked to the supply chain\n\nOne of the main challenges for AFI KLM E&M consists of the  effective  and  efficient  management  of  the  supply chain, within a complex and dynamic market environment.  The  MRO  supply  chain  is  composed  of numerous stakeholders, in particular aircraft manufacturers,  Original  Equipment  Manufacturers,  tier two  suppliers,  customers,  regulatory  authorities,  etc. Furthermore, the supply chain is subject to a number of uncertainties (demand fluctuations, interruptions, quality control  issues,  delivery  periods,  etc.)  which  are  currently having a considerable impact on availability, reliability and the cost of services.\n\nTo contend with these difficulties, AFI KLM E&M relies on a combination of strategies like:\n\n- \u25a0 developing  strategic  partnerships  with  OEMs  and suppliers, to guarantee access to spare parts, technical support and innovation;\n- \u25a0 adopting  a  flexible  and  agile  approach  to  meet  the changing  needs  of  customers  and  the  market conditions;\n- \u25a0 the use of digital technologies (like Big Data, artificial intelligence,  blockchain,  etc.)  to  optimize  inventory management, forecasting, planning and the decisionmaking process;\n- \u25a0 implementing  continuous  improvement  initiatives  to increase the quality, efficiency and sustainability of the processes linked to the supply chain.\n\n1",

It  also  optimizes  overall aircraft  fuel  consumption  by  monitoring  the  status  of equipment more precisely.\n\n## Key figures\n\n|                                                | Year   | Year    | Year                          |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| Maintenance                                    | 2023   | Change  | Change at  constant  currency |\n| TOTAL REVENUES  (in \u20acm)                        | 4,242  | 18.3%   |                               |\n| Third-party revenues  (in \u20acm)                  | 1,712  | 23.3%   | 25.6%                         |\n| Income/(loss) from current operations  (in \u20acm) | 150    | (8.0%)  | (3.2%)                        |\n| Operating margin  (%)                          | 3.5%   | -1.1 pt | -0.9 pt                       |\n\nDuring  2023,  external  revenues  strongly  increased  by 23.3% despite the supply chain disruption which explained the decrease in the operating margin. These supply chain disruptions  impacted,  in  particular,  the  GE90  engines support  among  other  activities  and  involved  significant additional  costs  (component  costs,  engine  lease  costs,\n\ninventory and pool increase). The maintenance order book was evaluated at US$8.7 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Air France-KLM Group's maintenance activity is well positioned  on  new-generation  aircraft  maintenance  and foresees solid opportunities in the future.",

After celebrating 90 years of  elegance  in  the  heart  of  Paris,  its  first  destination, Air  France  continues  to  celebrate  this  exceptional  event world-wide  in  2024,  thus  promoting  France  in  its international stations.\n\nAir France  continues  to  invest  substantial  sums  in improving  the  quality  and  level  of  its  products  and services. The company is pursuing its strategy of a move up-market  to  prepare  for  the  future  and  offer  its customers a unique travel experience -cabin refurbishment with a new standard of on-board comfort on  its  long-haul  flights,  new  culinary  signatures  to showcase French gastronomy, renovation of its  lounges, the  deployment of  on-board  connectivity  -  and  working\n\ntowards  more  responsible  travel.  By  2030,  the  Airbus A220s and A350s, new-generation aircraft which are more fuel-efficient  and  respectful  of  the  environment,  will represent  70%  of  the  Air  France  fleet  thanks  to  an ambitious  investment  plan  amounting  to  an  annual \u20ac1 billion.\n\nKLM continued to  create  memorable  experiences  for  its customers  through,  for  example,  the  introduction  of  a new Premium Comfort class and the re-envisioned World Business  class.  KLM  is  committed  to  investing  several billion  euros  in  renewing  its  fleet  and,  in  2024,  will welcome the new A321neos and A320neos. Furthermore, as of 2026, the Airbus 350 will be introduced in KLM's fleet. KLM is heavily investing in a state-of-the-art fleet, offering its  customers  more  comfort  in  terms  of  seats,  space,  air quality and lighting.\n\n## 1.5.1 Air France and KLM are maintaining their investment for customers\n\n## 32 Airbus A220-300s in the Air France fleet\n\nAir  France  currently  numbers  32  Airbus  A220-330s  in  its fleet. In 2023, the company took delivery of 16 A220s of the 60  A220-300  aircraft,  ordered  in  2019  to  progressively replace its A318 and A319 aircraft, as well as several A320s. A high-performance aircraft at the economic and financial level, the Airbus A220-300  is perfectly suited to Air  France's  short  and  medium-haul  network.  It  offers  a 10%  per-seat  cost  saving  compared  with  the  A318s  and A319s and stands out for its energy efficiency. It consumes 20%  less  fuel  per  passenger  km  than  the  aircraft  it replaces while its CO2 emissions are also reduced by 20% per  passenger  km.  Its  noise  footprint  is  also  34%  lower. These characteristics will play a decisive role in reducing Air France's environmental footprint and the achievement of its sustainable development objectives.\n\nThe Air France Airbus A220-300 offers the highest level of in-flight comfort. It has 148 seats in a 3-2 seat configuration  (i.e.  five  seats  per  row)  enabling  80%  of customers  to  benefit  from  a  window  or  aisle  seat.  It proposes  two  travel  cabins,  Business  and  Economy,  and access to the airline's in-flight WiFi service. The seat is the widest on the market (48 cm), reclines to 118 degrees and has  an  adjustable  headrest,  leather  upholstery  and  an ergonomic seat cushion for enhanced comfort. The seat back features a symmetrical stitching pattern accentuated  in  the  center  with  gray  embroidery  thread, creating an upholstered effect for optimum comfort. The accent,  the  company's  brand  symbol,  adorns  the  front and rear cabin walls of the aircraft. It is also embroidered on  each  seat,  highlighting  the  company's  identity.  The cabin,  which  is  the  brightest  and  most  spacious  in  its category, is decorated in the Air France signature colors: shades of blue, a strong presence of white providing light and contrast, and a hint of red to symbolize the airline's excellence and  know-how.  The  carpet  revisits  the\n\ntraditional  ornamental  herringbone  pattern,  symbolizing the  emblematic  Haussmann-inspired  world  of  Parisian apartments.  It  also  plays  an  important  role  in  the  cabin signage,  welcoming  customers  and  giving  them  an overall  perspective.  Large  panoramic  windows  provide natural  light  throughout  the  flight.  From  boarding  to landing,  eight  specially-adapted  cabin  mood  lighting settings create bright, dynamic lighting for the welcome and disembarkation phases and softer lighting for a more relaxed, serene  atmosphere  during  the  flight.  The spacious  baggage  racks  are  easy  to  access,  and  the central  aisle  is  particularly  wide,  facilitating  movement around the cabin.\n\n## 27 Airbus A350s in the Air France fleet\n\nAt the end of 2023, Air France numbered 27 Airbus A350s in its fleet of the 41 on order. The latest-generation A350 is Air  France's  long-haul  flagship.  With  a  25%  reduction  in CO2  emissions  per  passenger  km  compared  with previous-generation aircraft, it constitutes a major lever in reducing  the  airline's  environmental  footprint.  Its  noise footprint is also reduced by 40%.\n\nOn  board,  in  its  first  version,  the  324  seats  are  divided between  three  travel  cabins  -  34  in  Business,  24  in Premium  Economy  and  266  in  Economy  -  where customers discover a spacious and quiet cabin, windows some  30%  larger,  an  optimized  air  pressure  system providing  a  more  comfortable  cabin  atmosphere  with regularly-renewed cabin air and ambient lighting adapted  to  the  different  flight  phases.  In  the  Business cabin,  the  seat  turns  into  a  real  two-meter-long  lie-flat bed,  guaranteeing  restful  sleep.  In  Premium  Economy, the new 'Recliner'-style seat is 48 cm wide and reclines to 124\u00b0. In Economy, the seat has been redesigned for even more comfort, with a reinforced ergonomic seat cushion, a  118\u00b0  seat  recline  and  79-cm  of  leg  room.  Every  cabin offers large individual High-Definition touch screens.\n\n1",

The airline is now equipping with this version the new A350s that will join its long-haul fleet by 2025.

With this  new  phase  in  its  move  up-market,  Air  France  is continuing to roll out its most advanced travel standards in  terms  of  in-flight  comfort  which  are  currently  being retrofitted on its 12 Boeing B777-300ERs.\n\nWith  the  highest  standards  in  the  industry  in  terms  of comfort  and  embarked  technology,  the  new  Business seat  developed  exclusively  for  Air  France  has  a  sliding door enabling passengers to create a totally private space and transforms into a near-two-meter-long fully-flat bed. To  create  a  greater  sense  of  privacy  for  two  passengers travelling together, the seats located in the middle of the cabin have a central panel that can be lowered, opening up a vast, convivial space. This Business seat on the Airbus A350 has the same standards as those being deployed on the 12 Boeing B777-300ERs. The 48 seats are based on the 'three  Fs'  concept:  Full  Flat,  meaning  that  the  seat transforms  into  a  real  53-cm-wide  bed  that  is  almost 2  meters  long;  Full  Access  providing  all  passengers  with direct  aisle  access;  and  Full  Privacy,  ensuring  optimal seclusion.  A  sliding  door  enables  passengers  to  create  a totally  enclosed  space,  out  of  sight  of  the  rest  of  the passengers in the cabin. The seats situated in the middle now have a central panel that can be lowered to create a a  vast,  convivial  space.  The  cabin's  large  windows  are equipped  with  automatic  window  blinds,  enabling passengers  to  choose  their  own  lighting  ambience.  The airline has  prioritized  high-quality,  soft  and  natural materials  to  create  its  seats.  The  upholstery  fabric provides a soft feel for enhanced comfort. Each seat is also embroidered with the company's trademark red accent. A personal  storage  unit  comes  equipped  with  a  noisecancelling  headset,  a  vanity  mirror  and  space  to  stow customers'  belongings.  A  second  stowage  area  located under  the  seat  can  accommodate  a  small  travel accessory. The Business cabin's front row seats also offer additional  space  in  front  for  increased  comfort.  For  the first  time,  each  front  row  seat  features  a  personal  closet with  a  vanity  mirror  and  extra  storage  space.  Every  seat has  a  large  20-inch  4K  Ultra  High-Definition  anti-glare screen  -  the  widest  in  any  Business  cabin  across  the entire Air France fleet - allowing customers to enjoy over 1,500  hours  of  entertainment  on  a  latest-generation graphic interface. A Bluetooth connection allows customers  to  use  their  personal  headsets.  A  new touchpad  screen  also  allows  passengers  to  browse  the various programs and easily control their entire environment from adjusting the position of their seat to adapting the lighting intensity. A 'Do not disturb' feature is also included on this screen to inform the crew that the customer  wishes  to  rest.  This  fully-connected  seat features USB-A and USB-C ports and a wireless induction charger. A new feature allows customers to connect their personal  devices  directly  to  the  screen  and  use  it  as  a remote control. Passengers can also browse the in-flight entertainment catalog and view the interactive map while their selected content is displayed on the main screen.\n\nThe  Premium  Economy  cabin  features  32  seats  with  a brand-new  recliner  seat  model  like  those  offered  on  its first Airbus A350s and on the 12 Boeing B777-300ERs that are currently being retrofitted. Each seat offers 94 cm of legroom  and  a  48  cm  wide  seat  pan.  The  seat  back reclines  up  to  121  degrees  and  has  been  widened  to provide  greater  privacy  and  comfort.  The  seat  cushions have been redesigned and now extend up to the shoulder level for an  even  softer  experience.  The  seats  are upholstered with a navy-blue herringbone pattern fabric featuring a refined finish. The four-position headrest can be  adjusted  to  suit  all  preferences.  To  complete  the package,  these  seats  also  come  with  a  noise-cancelling audio  headset,  plenty  of  storage  space,  an  individual reading light and USB-A and USB-C ports.\n\nIn  the  Economy  cabin,  the  seat  features  a  46  cm-wide seat pan, a 119 degree recline and 79 cm of legroom. The seat  has  a  backrest  that  is  ergonomically  designed  with cushions  offering  reinforced  lateral  support.  The  seat introduces  two  new  features:  a  personal  smartphone  or tablet  holder  integrated  into  the  backrest  and  a  USB-C port, in addition to the USB-A port.\n\nThe seats in these two cabins are equipped with a wide 13.3-inch  4K  Ultra  High-Definition  anti-glare  screen  with Bluetooth connection, ideal for enjoying the on-demand in-flight entertainment with personal headphones. A new feature  also  allows  customers  to  also  connect  their personal device directly to the in-seat screen and use it as a  remote  control,  or  to  browse  the  available  programs while the selected content is simultaneously displayed on the main screen.\n\n## Air France's new long-haul cabins take to the skies\n\nOn  January  20,  2023,  the  first  Boeing  B777-300  ER equipped with Air France's latest long-haul travel cabins took off. In 2023, 10 Boeing B777-300s were equipped with the remaining two to follow in 2024.\n\nThe  company  is  pursuing  the  deployment  of  its  most advanced  travel  standard  in  terms  of  in-flight  comfort which  is  currently  being  retrofitted  on  its  Boeing B777-300 ERs.\n\nIn  the  Business  cabin,  customers  discover  a  new  seat transforming  into  a  real  two-meter  long  full-flat  bed.  For two  travelers  traveling  together,  the  seats  are  equipped with  a  sliding  panel  that  can  be  lowered  by  pressing  it down, enabling passengers to create a totally private space out of sight of the rest of the cabin. There is also a 'Do not disturb'  functionality.  Each  seat  also  features  a  wide 17.3 -inch 4K High-Definition anti-glare screen with a noisereducing headset. With this new major phase in the move up-market, all  Air  France  Business  seats  will  benefit  from full-flat  seats  by  summer  2024.  In  Premium  Economy, customers continue to benefit from an exclusive cabin at the front of the aircraft with only 48 seats. These 'Recliner' seat  backs  recline  to  124  degrees  and  are  wider  for  more privacy. The seat cushions have been redesigned and the navy  blue  herringbone  fabric  adds  further  softness.  The Economy cabin has 273 latest-generation seats manufactured  in  Europe.  These  seats,  with  amongst  the highest standards of comfort in the market, recline to 119 degrees and have a backrest that has been ergonomically designed,  offering  reinforced  lateral  support.  Each  seat  is also equipped with a 13.3-inch 4K screen.",

The  roll-out  of  the  Premium Comfort  class  was  continued  and  new  World  Business class  seats  with  direct-aisle  access  were  introduced.  The lounges in Toronto and Houston, which are key to KLM's strategic transatlantic routes, were refurbished, while the decision was made to renew KLM's Crown Lounge 25 at Schiphol Airport.\n\nOther  improvements  were  also  made.  KLM  offered  its customers  more  choice  and  control  through  digital services. The airline started offering light fares in Premium Comfort and World Business class, allowing customers to experience  key  elements  of  these  premium  products  at an  introductory  price.  KLM  improved  the  availability  of WiFi on board and introduced a new hand luggage policy that guarantees most premium customers space for their hand  luggage.  Also,  KLM  created  a  digital  Short Connection  Pass,  allowing  customers  to  expedite  their passage  through  security  lanes  in  the  event  of  a  short connection time at Schiphol Airport.\n\nThese  improvements  contributed  towards  KLM  being awarded the APEX World Class Award for the third year in a  row.  This  award,  which  is  based  on  professional  audits and passenger reviews, recognises performance in areas like safety and customer well-being.\n\n## Roll-out of KLM's Premium Comfort class\n\nDuring  the  course  of  2023,  KLM  further  rolled  out  the Premium  Comfort  class,  that  was  first  unveiled  in  2022. The new Premium Comfort class is an intermediate cabin offering more space, luxury, service options, comfort and privacy than in Economy class but at lower prices than in World Business. The Premium Comfort class allows KLM to more closely meet the needs and wishes of leisure and business travelers.\n\nPremium  Comfort  offers  a  new  seat  type  as  well  as distinctive  service  and  catering  concepts.  Depending  on the aircraft  type,  the  capacity  of  Premium  Comfort class varies from 21 to 28 seats which are wider than standard seats  and  offer  more  legroom,  a  larger  screen  and  a footrest.  Premium Comfort seats can also recline further than Economy class seats.\n\nApart from their elegant design and comfort features, the seats in Premium Comfort class are also lighter than the previous designs. Similar care was taken in selecting the catering materials for Premium Comfort. They are either reusable  (special  cutlery,  bowls  and  plates  made  of lightweight  polypropylene)  and  those  that  are  not reusable are made of recycled PEF.\n\n## New World Business class\n\nIn  June  2023,  new  World  Business  class  seats  were introduced  on  the  Boeing  B777  fleet.  These  wider  seats have a sliding door ensuring greater comfort and privacy. Thanks to various innovations, the seats and their fittings are  10-15%  lighter  than  other  Business  class  seats  in  this market segment.\n\nKLM's  new  World  Business  class  (WBC)  seats  were designed on the basis of extensive customer research and offer passengers more space and comfort:\n\n- \u25a0 all  World  Business  class  passengers  will  have  direct access to the aisle. Every seat has a lightweight sliding door  that  can  be  easily  opened  and  closed,  enabling the  seat  to  be  closed  off  for  more  privacy  when working, relaxing and/or sleeping;\n- \u25a0 more  personal  adjustment  options  and  user-friendly functionality, including an adjustable lower-back support and a relax setting with a subtle back-massage feature;\n- \u25a0 the  seat  can  recline  into  a  fully  flat.  comfortable, 198 cm-long bed;\n- \u25a0 there  are  multiple  charging  sockets  that  are  easily accessible and clearly visible, and passengers also have a wireless charging option;\n- \u25a0 passengers  can  stow  their  belongings  in  a  lockable compartment, which also has a built-in mirror. The seat features a recessed bottle holder enabling passengers to  safely  leave  a  water  bottle  on  their  tabletop,  even during turbulence.\n\nThe  other  World  Business  class  services,  including  the catering concept and SkyPriority, remain unchanged.\n\nFor  its  new  World  Business  class,  KLM  opted  to  install Jamco  Venture  seats  in  a  1-2-1  configuration,  giving  all WBC passengers direct access to the aisle. These Jamco Venture  seats  were  previously  installed  in  the  World Business class aboard KLM's Boeing B787 fleet. Following extensive  customer  research,  KLM  teamed  up  with  the manufacturer to further improve the seat. The full JAMCO design,  conceived  in  collaboration  with  KLM,  particularly the  personal  cabin  layout,  is  lighter  than  the  previous setup, without detracting from quality.\n\nKLM's entire Boeing B777-300 and 200 fleet will be fitted with  the  new  World  Business  class  seats.  This  fleet  will also be fitted with the latest Premium Comfort cabin. The full  revamp  will  be  completed  over  the  course  of  the coming year.\n\n## New KLM Crown Lounges at Toronto and Houston airports\n\nWith the renovation to transform the lounges in Toronto and  Houston  into  KLM  Crown  Lounges,  KLM  wants  to offer  its  customers  the  most  attractive  lounges  in  the world, by emphasizing comfort and convenience, all in a recognizable and trusted KLM environment.\n\n1",

The lounges are recognizable thanks to the KLM blue and the use of warm, natural colors. Additionally, as is also the case\n\nin  the  lounges  at  Schiphol,  KLM's  Delftware  miniature houses  are  on  display.  Several  seating  areas  have  been created  for  customers  in  the  lounges  where  they  can choose to work quietly in a more secluded work area or opt for more activity elsewhere in the lounge. Customers can  also  enjoy  the  buffet,  with  customized  options depending on the time of day.\n\n## 1.5.2 Air France and KLM pursue their move up -market\n\n## Air Fran ce La Premi\u00e8re\n\n## A bespoke travel experience and an exceptional journey\n\nWith La Premi\u00e8re, Air France offers a unique and bespoke travel experience for customers attentive to the smallest details.  On  their  arrival  at  Paris-Charles  de  Gaulle, La Premi\u00e8re customers  are welcomed  to  an  exclusive lounge.  In  this  confidential  space,  Alain  Ducasse,  the world's most Michelin-starred chef, and his teams create exceptional dishes and a bespoke wine and champagne list.  The  menu at this prestigious restaurant includes the chef's famous ham and black truffle coquillettes, and the rum or cognac baba as in Monte Carlo. Designed by the architect Didier Lefort, since late February this lounge has benefited from a Sisley treatment space, a real moment of well-being  celebrating  the  art  of  travel  with  a  French touch. On board 19 Boeing B777-300s, each of the four La Premi\u00e8re private  suites  offers  a  spacious  seat  which transforms into a full-flat bed more than two-meters long. There are Michelin-starred menus prepared by top chefs like Anne-Sophie Pic, Michel Roth and R\u00e9gis Marcon, but also 'guest'  chefs  like  Emmanuel  Renault,  Arnaud Lallement  and  Maurao  Colagreco,  and  Angelo  Musa  for signature pastries. There is also a rigorously-selected list of wines and champagnes, a wide choice of entertainment on high-definition screens, attentive service: every journey in  absolute  comfort.  In  2024,  on  departure  from  ParisCharles  de  Gaulle,  Air  France La  Premi\u00e8re flies  to  New York-JFK, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, WashingtonDC  (United  States),  Abidjan  (Ivory  Coast),  Dubai  (United Arab Emirates), Sao Paulo (Brazil),  Singapore  and  TokyoHaneda (Japan).\n\n## The future La Premi\u00e8re suite, taking excellence to new heights\n\nIn May 2022, Air France announced that it was working on the design of a completely-new La Premi\u00e8re travel cabin. The airline thus confirmed its commitment to continuing to  offer  its  most  exclusive  and  elegant  service,  which regularly  wins  awards  for  its  quality  and  excellence.  This new concept will be unveiled in Winter 2024. The future cabin will be the longest on the market and will offer up to three  modular  configurations  that  can  be  fully privatized for an even more exceptional journey: a seat, a sofa and a fully flat bed. The cabin will equip more aircraft than  at  present.  This  large-scale  project  is  part  of Air France's  strategy  to  move  up-market,  with  the ambition of offering in the La Premi\u00e8re cabin the highest level of French excellence.\n\n## Update on the Air France lounges\n\n## Exceptional spaces\n\nThe  Air  France  lounges  above  all  express  the  brand identity  but  are  also  places  where  customers  can  relax and  rest,  and  enjoy  a  moment  of  comfort  during  their journeys. In the Air France lounges, we cultivate the \"art de  vivre  \u00e0  la  fran\u00e7aise \"  around  the  Air  France  values: Excellence,  Elegance,  Pleasure,  Respect.  Before  a  trip  or between  connecting flights, Air France offers its Business (1) and Flying Blue Elite Plus customers dedicated spaces at the airports it serves. These bubbles of serenity enable them to relax, rest or work in complete tranquility. The lounges showcase French gastronomy thanks to an offer that changes throughout the day. Savory and sweet dishes,  as  well  as  healthy  meals  and  vegetarian  options, invite customers  to  discover the seasonal flavors, accompanied  by  a  range  of  alcoholic  and  non-alcoholic beverages.  In  its  lounges  at  Paris-Charles  de  Gaulle  and Paris-Orly  airports,  Air  France  also  offers  gastronomic delights devised by renowned chefs.\n\n## New culinary signatures in the Air France lounges at Paris-Charles de Gaulle\n\nThe Ducasse Paris teams also prepare dishes for tasting in the  long-haul  lounges  at  Terminal  2E  (halls  K,  L  and  M). Customers  can  notably  sample  the  \"Burgal\"  signed  by Ducasse Paris, a fully veggie and healthy alternative to the traditional hamburger  made  from  locally-produced French cereals and vegetables. In the short and mediumhaul lounge in Terminal 2F, the chef Fran\u00e7ois Adamski has surrounded  himself  with  a  succession  of  talented  chefs who come and go throughout the year. In 2023, Fran\u00e7ois Adamski  was  accompanied  by  the  chefs  Chlo\u00e9  Charles, specialized in responsible cooking and Amandine Chaignot,  a  winner  of  the  Bocuse  d'Or  who  devised  the vegetarian offer with revisited hot seasonal dishes served for  lunch  and  dinner.  At  Paris-Orly,  in  the  international lounge  located  in  Orly  3,  the  Savoyard  chef  Guy  Martin now signs a regularly renewed seasonal dish as part of the culinary proposition, starting with pork confit served with orange  and  carrots.  In  the  short-haul  lounge  at  Orly  2, customers,  at  certain  times  of  the  day,  customers  can enjoy  MOF  (Meilleur  Ouvrier  de  France)  pastry  chef Philippe  Urraca's  famous  choux  pastry  assortments  in  a wide range of flavors. A wine and champagne list signed by Paolo Basso, Best Sommelier in the World 2013, is also proposed in the CDG and Orly 3 lounges.",

Now some 90m2 larger, this lounge spans a total surface area of 565m2, can seat 117 and offers new spaces and  more  services  so  customers  can  recharge  their batteries,  work  or  eat  prior  to  their  journey  or  between connecting  flights.  It  is  exclusively  for La  Premi\u00e8re, Business  and  Flying  Blue  Elite  Plus  customers  of Air France, KLM and the Skyteam partner airlines. Having been  completely  replanned  by  the  Air  France  teams  in collaboration  with  the  SGK  Brandimage  agency,  this lounge celebrates the art of travel with the French touch as of the arrival at the airport. Through the choice of highquality  materials  such  as  wood  and  leather,  and  the Air  France  colors  -  cameos  of  blue,  luminous  whites, touches of red - it offers a clean, chic design. The furniture features creations by French designers such as Little Tulip chairs  by  Pierre  Paulin,  Ester  bar  stools  by  Patrick  Jouin and Softshell chairs by the Bouroullec brothers.\n\n## Air France fine dining: 19 partner chefs in 2023\n\nAs the ambassador for French gastronomy and know-how around the world, Air France has always been committed to making every moment of a trip varied and rewarding. From its  airport  lounges  to  its  travel  cabins,  in  2023  the airline  collaborated  with  19  talented  chefs  like  Thierry Marx, Mauro Colagreco and Anne-Sophie Pic, sublimating French  haute  cuisine  and  sharing  their  region's terroir , history  and  emotions.  The  company  also  wants  to introduce  its  customers  to  the  richness  and  diversity  of the French gastronomic heritage. By constantly renewing its  offer,  Air  France  also  seeks  to  showcase  the  best culinary  talents  who  are  developing  delicious  menus exclusively  for  the  airline  on  departure  from  Paris  and certain  international  stations.  Air  France  thus  proposes varied gourmet menus for all its customers thanks to the expertise of its partner Servair, the world leader in airline catering and its Culinary Studio. With this top-notch offer the company brings the art of French travel to life, for a tasting before boarding or a delicious meal at an altitude of 10,000 meters.\n\n## New products for young travelers\n\nEvery year, Air France carries some 2.5 million children. In February 2023, the company renewed its family offer and the in-flight service for very young travelers. In all its longhaul  cabins,  a  toy  box  is  offered  to  all  young  children during  the  meal  service.  It  unfolds  to  create  a  playful setting, like a bakery, in which the child can move a pretty wooden figurine  in  the  form  of  a  little  dog  dressed  in  a sailor  suit  in  the  company's  colors,  with  its  suitcase.  The play set also includes an airplane on wheels, a puzzle takeoff runway, an activity book and colored pencils. As part of an  eco-responsible  approach,  this  box  contains  no plastics, each  piece  being  made  from  FSC  wood (sustainably  managed  forests)  or  recycled  paper  and cardboard.\n\nThe  children's  menu  is  automatically  proposed  to  all children  aged  from  two  to  six  years.  It  is  composed exclusively  of  products  originating  from  organic  farming on departure from Paris. For children over six years of age, parents  can  reserve  this  menu  free  of  charge  up  to 24 hours before departure. Air France also proposes new services for families traveling with a baby (0 to 2 years). In all the long-haul cabins, customers receive a pretty box in brown paper containing a soft toy in the form of a small dog made of soft, recyclable and reusable materials. In the La Premi\u00e8re, Business and Premium Economy cabins, this kit comes complete with a pretty pouch in the Air France colors,  Cast\u00e9ra  organic  thermal  spring  water  made  in France and cotton squares. Subject to booking, until 24h prior  to  departure,  an  entirely  organic  baby  menu, composed of sweet and savory pots, a daily product and a biscuit  is  offered  to  the  youngest  travelers.  Children  can benefit  from  dedicated  entertainment  programs  on  the screens  in  the  long-haul  cabins:  music,  cartoons  and meditation  initiations.  An  offer  of  16  magazines  and comics  for  children  can  also  be  downloaded  from  the Air France Play application. Air France welcomes children traveling  alone  between  the  ages  of  4  and  17  years  on board  its  aircraft.  With  the  Kids  Solo  service,  they  are accompanied  by  Air  France  staff  who  look  after  their safety.  Thanks  to  the  Air  France  application,  parents  can follow every phase of their journey, from handover at the airport until landing and arrival at their destination.\n\n## Improvements in Premium Economy\n\nThe move up-market for the Premium Economy cabin is under  way,  focusing  on  three  dimensions:  the  seat,  the cabin identity and the in-flight service. In terms of seats, the switch to the \"Recliner\" standard, highly appreciated by  our  customers,  offers  better  sleeping  comfort  than fixed-shell models  (the  satisfaction  surveys  show  a 20 -point difference between 'recline' and 'fixed shell').\n\nAhead of the retrofitting of the Boeing B772s (28 Business class seats) planned for 2024, this seat is available on the A350 and Boeing B773 (48 Business class seats) fleets. On board,  the  blue  horizon  dominates  (plaids,  comfort  kit, pillow accent, etc.), creating a genuine visual identity and cabin harmony that stands out from the Economy class. Since  November  1,  2023,  the  focus  has  been  on  the catering  offer,  with  a  hot  main  course  now  signed  by  a Michelin-starred chef, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simonin, on flights departing  from  Paris.  The  desserts  on  departure  from Paris  and  the  wines  are  identical  to  those  served  on medium-haul Business flights.\n\n## Ongoing roll-out of the WiFi offer\n\nAt the end of 2023, 100% of the Air France fleet had been equipped with on board WiFi and the connectivity portal deployed  on  all  our  aircraft. To connect  from  a smartphone,  tablet  or  computer,  three  passes  are available: a Free Message Pass to communicate on instant messaging  applications  (WhatsApp,  iMessage,  WeChat, etc.); a Surf Pass to surf the Internet and check e-mails, for one hour or the entire duration of the flight; and a Stream Pass to surf the Internet, watch movies or favorite series while  benefiting  from  higher  bandwidth.  Air  France equips its aircraft with the help of four suppliers.\n\n1",

Games  are  making  a  big comeback  and  Air  France  has  selected  ten  of  the  most popular programs of the moment. An interactive map and an on-board camera allow you to follow the trajectory of your  flight,  in  real  time,  and  enjoy  take-off  and  landing from any seat.\n\nOn  board  the  most-recent  long-haul  Business  cabins, every  customer  has  a  vast  high-definition,  anti-glare  4K screen  and  a  Bluetooth  connection  for  their  personal headset.\n\n## Air France Shopping\n\n2023 was marked by the 90 th anniversary of Air France. To mark  the  occasion,  Air  France  Shopping  launched  a collection of items sporting the '90 years Air France' logo, and  some  heritage  items  were  reissued  as  part  of  the Legend  collection.  The  company  also  teamed  up  with leading French brands such as Vanessa Bruno, Bernardaud, Le Parapluie de Cherbourg and Maison Brun de  Vian  Tiran.  These  items,  which  are  on  sale  at www.airfranceshopping.com, the official Air France branded objects boutique, and at Galeries Lafayette ParisHaussmann,  which  hosted  the  90  years  of  Air  France\n\nexhibition,  have  contributed  to  the  reputation  of  the  Air France brand. Other collections have also seen the light of day,  with  particular  attention  paid  to  the  company's sustainable development priorities: the \"tricolore\" collection made  in  Europe,  Delsey  shopping  bags designed from the material of retired  Air  France  aircraft toboggans, and Air Art objects, with the transition to the industrial mode of this intrapreneurial project which gives a  second  life  to  aircraft  parts,  transforming  them  into design objects. Finally, the new \"Allure\" range of suitcases, created  in  collaboration  with  Delsey,  has  proved  a  great success owing to its elegance and reliability.\n\n## Air France signs a partnership with Alltheway to offer a baggage drop-off service in Paris and the Paris region\n\nIn  June  2023,  Air  France  signed  a  partnership  with Alltheway, an innovative start-up specialized in travel and mobility, to offer a baggage drop off service in Paris and the Paris region. Six Accor hotels located in the city center enable this service: Novotel Tour Eiffel, Mercure Tour Eiffel, Novotel  Les  Halles,  Mercure  Montparnasse,  Pullman  La D\u00e9fense and Pullman Bercy. The baggage drop-off service is  also  available  at  the  main  exhibition  sites  for  major trade  fairs  like  Paris  Expo  Porte  de  Versailles,  Parc  des Expositions  Villepinte  and  le  Palais  des  Congr\u00e8s.  More baggage drop-off points will shortly be available in Paris. The service enables Air France customers to drop off and check in their baggage prior to their arrival at the airport. Alltheway  thus  takes  responsibility  for  collecting  the baggage from customers and delivering it to the airport. At the end of 2023, this optional service was expanded to the  homes  of  customers  in  Paris  (post  codes  with  the 75 prefix) and the Paris region. Passengers can thus travel light  with  greater  peace  of  mind  without  needing  to worry  about  their  bags  which  they  collect  on  arrival  at their destination. The  baggage  undergoes  rigorous security checks before being loaded onto the customer's flight. From the Alltheway customer area, customers can track their baggage through to the airport and then on to their destination, using the baggage tracking tool in the Air France application. This service is now available on all Air  France-operated  flights  (except  Tel  Aviv)  departing from Paris-Charles de Gaulle (see conditions). The airline also intends to develop this offer for flights departing from Paris-Orly.  It  is  also  working  on  a  delivery  service  for baggage on arrival, in Paris and the Paris region.\n\n## EnVols, the Air France editorial offering\n\nEnVols,  the  travel-related  media  platform,  is  available  in print and digital versions. Both inspirational and practical, Air France's editorial offering concentrates a wide variety of content  (articles, photographs,  videos,  podcasts) around the art of living and escapism, including culture, fashion  and  gastronomy.  Travel  guides  to  more  than 120  destinations  reveal  cutting-edge  addresses  selected by  the  editorial  team.  The  company's  news  and  vast heritage are also highlighted. EnVols is enriched on a daily basis,  with  contributions  from  well-known  French  and international  authors,  photographers  and  artists,  in  the tradition of the travel writer. All the content is available in French and English.",

        "page_content": "Customer experience division\n\nIn 2023,  Air  France's  editorial  offering  reached  its objectives:  six  numbers  and  two  supplements  of  the EnVols magazine were edited in 150,000 examples. Sold in press  kiosks,  this  bi-monthly  is  also  available  in  the Air France boarding piers and lounges at Orly and ParisCDG. A digital  version  is  also  available  free  of  charge  on the  Air  France  Play  application,  enabling  a  reduction  in the weight carried on board the aircraft and contributing to the mitigation of CO2 emissions in line with Air France's overall commitment  to  reducing  its  environmental footprint.  On  the  digital  side,  the  en-vols.com  website totaled  more  than  14  million  sessions,  104  million  pages viewed  and  11  million  unique  visitors.  The  newsletter numbered  144,642  subscribers  at  the  end  of  December and the EnVols social media some 60,000.\n\nTo  develop  EnVols,  Air  France  drew  on  the  expertise  of Reworld  Media,  notably  in  terms  of  technological innovation,  digital,  magazine  and  brand  developments, and the marketing of advertising space, as well as on that of Michelin Editions for its travel and destinations content .\n\n## Air France Play, a fully-digital press offering\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  Air  France  stopped  distributing  the printed  press  to  its  customers  in  its  airport  lounges,  at boarding  gates  and  on  board.  The  entire  offer  is  now available in digital form via the Air France Play application, from which customers can download for free their favorite newspapers  and  magazines  up  to  30  hours  prior  to  the departure  of  their  flights  by  identifying  themselves  with their  booking  references  or  Flying  Blue  membership numbers.  Available  in  eleven  languages,  Air  France  Play offers  access  to  more  than  130  French  (newspapers  and magazines)  and  60  international  titles  (newspapers  and magazines).  Once  downloaded,  the  publications  are available  at  any  time:  before,  during  and  after  the  flight and  including  off  line.  Some  4.5  million  titles  were downloaded in 2023.\n\n## Air France, the only Official Airline Partner for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024 (2)\n\nOn July 20, 2023, Air France announced that is had signed a partnership agreement with the Olympic and Paralympic  Games  Paris  2024  Organising  Committee (OCOG) (2) ,  thereby  becoming  the  official  partner  of  the 33 rd Olympics  of  the  modern  era.  The  airline  thus\n\nreiterated  its  support  for  this  global  event  it  has  been supporting  since  becoming  the  official  partner  of  the Paris 2024 bid in 2016. To mark the occasion no fewer than 10  of  the  company's  aircraft  were  decorated  and,  for several  years,  sported  the  logo  featuring  a  stylized  Eiffel Tower with the number 24.\n\nA  dedicated  athlete  check-in  facility  will  be  available  in the Olympic Village. It will enable athletes to check in and drop off their luggage and sports equipment directly on site  before  their  return  flights.  They  can  then  take  a dedicated route to the airport.\n\nOver  15  million  visitors  are  expected  during  this  period, and the Air France teams in Paris and around the world are  mobilizing  to  prepare  for  the  arrival  of  the  athletes, supporters  and  media  in  France,  and  to  ensure  the transportation  of  the  sports  equipment  needed  for  the various  Olympic  and  Paralympic  disciplines:  javelins, poles, kayaks, bicycles, wheelchairs and even surf boards for the events on the Teahupo'o wave in Tahiti. Particular attention  will  be  paid  to  travelers  with  reduced  mobility and disabilities, who will be able to call on the company's Saphir service for any assistance they may require.\n\n## 'One day, one chef': Air France at the Taste of Paris festival\n\nHaving  unveiled  all  its  culinary  collaborations  at  the Bocuses d'Or awards in Lyon in January 2023, Air France partnered the 8 th edition of the Taste of Paris festival, held in  May  at  the  Grand  Palais  Eph\u00e9m\u00e8re  in  Paris.  The company  presented  its  high-flying  catering  to  festival goers through a special \"One day, one chef\" event at its stand. Every  day,  a  renowned  chef  working  with Air  France  offered  visitors  the  chance  to  discover  the dishes they had created exclusively for the menus in the airline's  long-haul La Premi\u00e8re and  Business cabins, and in  the  Air  France  airport  lounges.  Amandine  Chaignot, Fran\u00e7ois  Adamski,  R\u00e9gis  Marcon,  Thierry  Marx,  Michel Roth and Angelo Musa, took turns to delight visitors with their  dishes.  At  special  sessions  at  lunch  or  dinner  time, the  chefs  let  participants  taste  their  latest  culinary delights  specially  designed  for  the  airline's  customers. They  were  able  to  find  out  all  the  secrets  involved  in preparing  a  dish  to  be  served  at  35,000  feet.  And  to enhance this unique gastronomic experience, the dishes were  served  in  the  Air  France  tableware  made  by  the greatest French designers. For the duration of the festival, festival  goers  were  able  to  enjoy  appetizers  created  by Servair corporate chef Fran\u00e7ois Adamski.\n\n1",

On  this occasion, the company showcased its best product offer to the movie festival crowd in Cannes and offered festivalgoers  the  chance  to  win  air  tickets.  During  the  festival, inside  the  mythical  Cannes  H\u00f4tel  Martinez  (France), Air  France  occupied  two  suites  where  it  focused  the spotlight on  the  'designer'  travel  experience  that Air  France  offers  its La Premi\u00e8re guests.  In  a  nod  to  the La  Premi\u00e8re suites  available  on  board  a  selection  of Boeing  B777-300s,  these  specially  designed  spaces  in Cannes  reinterpreted  the  multiple  qualities  of  the company's  exceptional  offer.  A  first  suite  emphasized comfort  and  pleasure,  with  specially-created  tasting events  around  the  art  of  mixology  and  gastronomy, evoking  the  refinement  of  the  Michelin-starred  menus, and  the  wine  and  Champagne  list  available  during  the trip. A second adjoining suite was dedicated to beauty, an essential component of the Air France travel experience. In partnership with the Sisley beauty Institute, the French pioneering phyto-cosmetology beauty company, Air France offered a moment of well-being and relaxation to  guests  in  between  glimpses  of  their  favorite  stars  on the  red  carpet.  Our  guests  received  special  attentions from the Sisley beauty experts who were on hand to offer beauty treatments and personalized advice, as they do at the  Sisley  beauty  institute  available  in  the La  Premi\u00e8re lounge  at  Paris-Charles  de  Gaulle.  This  year,  all  festivalgoers were also invited to enter an Air France competition to try to win two air tickets in the Business cabin to fly off to Los Angeles. At the heart of the Croisette, the company installed a giant, immersive bubble with all the attributes of  its  long-haul  Business  cabin.  Everyone  was  invited  to take  selfies  inside  this  fun  space  and  answer  a  few questions to have a chance of flying to Hollywood.\n\n## New baggage racks on the Airbus A320 EURO\n\nOn  its  medium-haul  network,  Air  France  continues  to improve its customers' travel experience by offering them more  space  to  stow  their  cabin  baggage.  On  board  the Airbus A320 EUROs, new ECOS shelf bins - Efficient Cabin Open Space - are being retrofitted. They offer up to 60% more  storage  capacity  than  the  current  baggage  racks and  have  a  lower  shelf  height  to  facilitate  loading  and content  visibility.  Boarding  is  thus  more  fluid  and passenger satisfaction is improved. Air France is the first airline  in  the  world  to  have  chosen  the  new  ECOS baggage stowage system from Safran Cabin to equip its medium-haul  Airbus  A320s.  In  January  2024,  18  Airbus A320  EUROs  of  the  24  in  revenue  service  had  been equipped, with the end of the deployment scheduled by May 2024.\n\n## KLM's improvements are highly valued by customers\n\nWith  demand for  flying  still  high  and  KLM  experiencing operational  issues,  the  NPS  score  reflected  the  fact  that KLM did not always manage to fully deliver its product as customers expected. This resulted in KLM taking several mitigation  steps,  of  which  the  most  important  were interventions in the network. Furthermore, KLM implemented digital tooling that empowers customers to easily rebook flights or quickly process refunds. These are services that are highly valued by customers. In 2024, KLM will  improve  its  digital  tooling  around  lost  luggage  and missed connections.\n\n## KLM's Net Promoter Score\n\nKLM's Net Promoter Score (NPS), a measure of customer appreciation,  ended  the  year  at  39,  an  improvement compared  to  2022.  Customers  who  do  not  perceive  a service disruption, however, score an NPS of 70, indicating that  they  highly  appreciate  the  quality  of  the  KLM product. This reflects the investment KLM has made over the years in its product, as well as the ability of its crews to give customers a memorable experience.\n\n## KLM: a front-runner in digitization of the customer journey\n\nKLM  has  long  been  a  front-runner  in  the  digitization  of the customer  journey. In close co-operation with Air  France and in line with the strategic goal of creating technological  advances,  outdated  e-commerce  systems have  been  replaced  with  a  modern  infrastructure.  This allows  for  the  rapid  development  of  digital  services.  In recent years, data have become a focal point, for example to train chatbots and personalize customer offerings.\n\nKLM's  approach  to  digitization  is  relatively  mature compared  to  the  rest  of  the  industry.  This  year,  KLM received  two  million  customer  service  requests  via  its digital channels, some 30%-35% of which were handled by bots.  Some  84%  of  KLM  customers  had  some  form  of digital interaction, including online check-in and booking, and a record number of tickets were sold through direct online  channels.  It  goes  without  saying  that  digital interaction  does  not  come  at  the  expense  of  personal contact with customers. Services that can be provided via the  digital  platforms  allow  frontline  staff  time  to  tailor their  personal  contact  with  passengers  to  their  specific needs.\n\nIn  2023,  KLM  saw  an  increasing  number  of  sales  agents and  travel  agencies  join  its  New  Distribution  Channel, which extends KLM's offering beyond its digital channels.\n\n## Empowering customers at KLM\n\nDuring  2023,  KLM  continued  to  roll  out  apps  that  help customers  to  take  control  over  their  journeys.  These include  a  digital  queue  at  Schiphol  Airport's  transfer centre, as well as a new service that allows customers to increase their privacy and space by buying an empty seat next  to  them,  and  a  tool  enabling  World  Business  class customers  to  pre-order  their  meals  online.  A  new customer  clearance  checklist  is  now  online  to  help customers to prepare their travel documents at home.",

        "page_content": "Customer experience division\n\n## 1.5.3 Air France and KLM participate in more responsible travel\n\nAfter flight safety and reassurance on health, the number three expectation of our customers covers the commitments to sustainability. Air France's environmental  footprint  is  mainly  linked  to  the  CO2 emissions generated by its flight operations. Our priority is to  reduce  these  emissions  as  much  and  as  rapidly  as possible  through  fleet  renewal,  eco-piloting,  the  use  of sustainable  aviation  fuels  and  the  development  of intermodality.  These  are  the  four  founding  principles  of the Air France Act program. Air France is also working on building a more  responsible  travel  experience  for customers with, notably:\n\n## a) more responsible catering\n\nOn all our flights on departure from Paris, with Servair, we  propose  meals  prepared  in  France  using  meat, poultry, dairy products and eggs of French origin, and all  our  fish  are  from  sustainable  fisheries,  in  all  our travel  cabins  and  Paris  airport  lounges.  A  vegetarian option is systematically offered to our customers in all travel classes. The infant and baby menus available on board our long-haul flights are 100% organic;\n\n## b) reducing food waste\n\nTo fine-tune consumption and thus reduce food waste, customers in the long-haul Business cabins are able to preselect  their  hot  dishes  up  to  24  hours  prior  to departure. This initiative also guarantees the availability of  their  choice  on  board.  In  2023,  this  service  avoided the  need  to  load  more  than  52,000  hot  meals  (i.e. 11 tons of food waste avoided);\n\n## c) elimination of single-use plastics\n\nIn  2023,  Air  France  eliminated  90%  of  the  single-use plastics  on  board  its  flights,  i.e.  2,233  tons  of  plastics avoided. After the introduction of wooden cutlery and cardboard  cups,  the  airline  is  deploying  containers  in bio-sourced  materials,  like  wood  cellulose  trays  and small baking dishes made of bagasse;\n\n## d) sorting and recycling of packaging\n\nThe sorting and recycling of packaging is progressively being rolled out on board. In 2023, Air France recycled 30 tons of plastic bottles, cartons and cans (20 tons in 2022) and 585 tons of glass bottles (530 tons in 2022);\n\n## e) products and services\n\nThe  comfort  kits  in  the La  Premi\u00e8re , Business  and Premium  Economy  cabins  are  made  from  recycled materials, the contents are bio-sourced and packaging has  been  eliminated.  For  babies,  soft  toys  are  made from recycled velvet and packaged in a 100% Kraft FSC box. On departure from Paris, water bottles are made of recycled and recyclable PET ( La Premi\u00e8re ,  Business and  Premium  Economy).  As  of  December  1,  2023,  Air France has been recycling all the paper menus in the La Premi\u00e8re and  Business cabins on all flights bound for Paris.\n\nAir France regularly informs its customers on its action to reduce  its  environmental,  footprint  and  raise  their awareness  of  the  ways  in  which  we  can  act  together: easier access to combined rail and air travel, support for our  investment  in  sustainable  aviation  fuels,  lighter  onboard baggage, etc.\n\n## Air France as a member and player in the 'FAIRe' program, a voluntary focus on more responsible communication\n\nIn  February  2021  Air  France  became  a  member  of  the Brand  Union's  FAIRe  program  to  continue  to  factor environmental and societal issues into its communication. As  a  member  of  the  program,  Air  France  adheres  to  a progress-based approach covering 15 commitments and now  includes  three  elements  of  self-regulation  in  its advertising which  relate to content, the diffusion environment and limiting the environmental impact of its advertising.  As  part  of  this  approach,  Air  France  is constantly implementing actions like:\n\n- a) eliminating  gender,  sexual  and  ethnical  stereotyping, incentivizing  the  avoidance  of  excessive  consumption and promoting alternative transportation (Train + Air);\n- b) the  eco-socio-design  of  communication materials has enabled  the  airline  to  gain  certification  (e.g.  Ecovadis Gold) to mitigate carbon emissions via the management of film projects using smaller crews over shorter durations, recycling elements of the d\u00e9cor and/ or  donating  the  design  elements  to  associations  and, lastly,  selecting  digital  partners  who  are  themselves committed to environmental responsibility.\n\nA  first  evaluation  of  progress  on  the  15  criteria  was published in February 2022 and an audit to measure this progress  was  carried  out  at  the  end  of  2023.  Air  France includes the awareness-raising message 'Let's take action for a more responsible journey' into all its communication with  customers  (all  markets)  whenever  the  size  of  the broadcast media allows. Its aim is to provide consumers with  clear,  educational  information  on  its  commitments (more  sustainable  aviation  fuels,  new,  less-polluting aircraft,  eco-piloting,  etc.).  All  these  commitments  are available at airfranceact.airfrance.com.\n\n## KLM and multi-modalities\n\nKLM promotes air-rail  projects.  This  allows  customers  to substitute their Amsterdam to Brussels flights by offering a  seat  on  the  high-speed  Eurostar  trains.  Behind-thescenes  in  2023,  improvements  were  made  to  the  IT systems. These enable a joint train and aircraft boarding pass and better signage at Schiphol Airport. In the future KLM  wishes  to  expand  the  Air-Rail  network  to  more European destinations, although it is a crucial prerequisite that  the  link  between  train  and  flight  connections  at Schiphol Airport first be improved. KLM is also in favor of expanding  the  North-South  metro  line  to  Schiphol Airport, to increase the capacity for international trains.\n\n1",

In  2024,  the  Group  will  be  able  to indicate the CO2 impact of each journey and offer a SAF bundle, a variation of the branded fares already offered.\n\n## Improvements on board\n\nKLM  is  constantly  working  on  improvements  for  the future and small changes can also contribute to achieving this goal.\n\nKLM  is  thus  making  small  changes  to  its  onboard experience,  like  reducing  the  weight  of  onboard  items, making conscious meal choices and recycling as much as possible.  The  airline  is  also  reducing  its  emissions  by decreasing  the  weight  of  seats,  trolleys  and  other  items loaded on board.\n\n## KLM: becoming a more inclusive airline\n\nKLM believes  in  the  power  of  diversity  and  inclusion.  Its customers  come  from  all  corners  of  the  earth  and  from diverse  cultural  backgrounds,  giving  them  different perspectives  and  requirements.  It  is  very  important  to KLM that each and every customer feels personally valued and respected.\n\nDigital services also help KLM to become a more inclusive airline. The booking flow is now more easily accessible to people with visual or auditory impairments. Several kiosks at Schiphol Airport have also been lowered for people in wheelchairs and customers can now request assistance at the airport online. In conjunction with Air France, KLM has begun  to  add  gender  neutral  language  to  its  booking flow, in a bid to be more inclusive for its customers.\n\n## 1.5.4 Air France celebrates 90 years of elegance\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Air France celebrated its 90 th anniversary.  90  years  of  elegance,  90  years  of technology, innovation and comfort on board its aircraft. 90 years of  travel,  fine  dining,  design,  haute  couture,  art and architecture. Since its creation on October 7, 1933 at Le  Bourget  airport,  the  company  has  been  celebrating French  excellence,  a 'je-ne-sais-quoi ' that  the  world recognizes  in  France,  thanks  to  an  exceptional  travel experience  that  takes  elegance  to  new  heights.  Since then, Air France has continued to build its legend around the  art  of  French-style  travel  across  the  world,  with thousands of men and women in all our professions, who have  succeeded  one  another  in  building  the  Air  France story. The company celebrated this anniversary everywhere in the world, with customers and the general public  alike,  through  events  and  exclusive  content created for the occasion.\n\nA  360\u00b0  communication  strategy  based  on  an  original creative concept, a brand campaign and a communication  plan  including  commercial  and  eventsbased  operations:  historical  exhibitions,  event  flights, vintage fashion shows, customer meetings, creation of a visual  identity  with  the  Air  France  90 th anniversary  logo and content promoting the Air France brand, Les Rendezvous  Air  France ,  gifts  and  competitions  for  customers, production  of  an  anniversary  book,  etc.  Air  France,  the emblematic airline that has been serving travelers for nine decades,  celebrated  its  anniversary  in  style,  benefiting from international resonance and strong media coverage that had a positive impact on its image. With exhibitions\n\nof  its  heritage  in  iconic  locations,  parades  of  uniforms from  the  past  to  the  present,  Air  France  continues  to unveil  itself  from  Rome  to  Delhi,  Accra  to  Washington, and Shanghai to Buenos Aires. The celebrations continue throughout 2024, with stops in Madrid, Montreal, Abidjan and Tokyo.\n\n## Air France exhibition at the Galeries Lafayette Paris-Haussmann\n\nIn  the  heart  of  Paris,  Air  France  showcased  its  heritage through a powerful, innovative approach, accessible easily and free of charge to all French and international visitors. In  September 2023, Air France unveiled a preview of the twelve  window  displays  with  its  signature  at  Galeries Lafayette  Paris-Haussmann  to  celebrate  90  years  of elegance  -  from  September  28  to  October  10,  2023.  To embody and bring to life 90 years of elegance, Air France presented a collection of five iconic dresses designed by Xavier  Ronze,  French  designer  and  head  of  costume workshops  for  the  Paris  Opera  ballet.  Each  dress interprets  the  airline's  different  strengths:  aircraft  and technology;  uniforms  and  fashion;  emblematic  posters promoting  its  vast  network;  gastronomy  and  tableware; design and architecture. These dresses were surrounded by the finest pieces of Air France heritage and the best of the present-day airline, to highlight 90 years of mythical aircraft,  on-board  comfort,  designer  uniforms,  on-board gastronomy and design.",

The video features models wearing the collection of designer dresses created by Xavier Ronze in a spectacular setting, in behind-the-scenes locations at Air France. From the airline's huge aircraft hangars to the wings  of  an  Airbus  A220,  the  jewel  of  its  medium-haul fleet, the dresses took centre stage amongst the modernday  and  vintage  Air  France  heritage  items  that  inspired them. This original video showcases Air France's legendary heritage and the best of its current offer, in a singularly elegant approach. The video was screened from September  28  in  the  windows  of  the  Galeries  Lafayette Paris  Haussmann,  online  and  at  various  Air  France locations, and will also be visible to the airline's customers in its airport lounges and on board its aircraft.\n\n## A digital showcase\n\nTo ensure maximum access to the company's exhibition for everyone, wherever they are in the world, the company created  a  new  immersive  website  (90ans.airfrance.com), available  in  French  and  English,  enabling  visitors  to explore and learn more about the themes of the window displays. A unique opportunity to look back at the history and assets of Air France and its legacy.\n\n## A special collectors' edition of EnVols\n\nEnVols, Air France's escape platform, offered its readers a special edition dedicated to Air France's 90 th anniversary. This special bilingual issue in French and English offered a new way to explore the airline's history and go behind the scenes  of  the  unique  dresses  designed  by  Xavier  Ronze. This  special  supplement  could  be  found  at  Galeries Lafayette  Paris  Haussmann  and  inside  the  October/ November  issue  of  EnVols  magazine,  in  the  Air  France lounges at Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly, and in the boarding lounges.\n\n## The Air France legend\n\nDuring the Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann exhibition, the  company  opened  pop-up  stores  offering  a  range  of items  specially  created  or  reissued  for  this  anniversary: models of old and new aircraft, a special 90 th anniversary collection  as  well  as  new  collaborations  with  top  French brands.  Throughout  this  anniversary  period,  Air  France offered visitors the chance to attend fashion shows in the heart  of  Paris,  retracing  90  years  of  French  elegance, together  with  Galeries  Lafayette.  Models  dressed  in  the uniforms of pilots, cabin crew, airport staff and mechanics were on show in a dedicated area of the department store to  retrace  the  company's  legendary  uniform  heritage, past and present.\n\n## 1.5.5 Air France and KLM recognised and rewarded\n\n## Air France still no.1 for customer relations\n\nOn March 14, 2023, Air France was awarded first prize at the  Customer  Relations  Awards \u00ae in the  'Transport' category for the 8 th year running. Organized  by BearingPoint and Kantar, this ranking (1) truly  reflects  the voice  of  French  customers.  Since  2003,  the  Customer Relations Awards \u00ae have recognized large brands which, in their day-to-day  activities, stand  out  for  customer relations.  Eleven  business  sectors  -  including  transport  are evaluated on common performance criteria. For each company, the customers surveyed are invited to give their opinion  on  15  criteria  that  structure  customer  relations. These criteria are examined from three angles: execution, connection  and  emotion.  Air  France  thus  continues  to make  a  difference  and  to  stand  out  mainly  from  the emotional  and  connection  point  of  view.  Like  in  2022, 89% of  customers  considered  that  staff  take  pleasure  in serving therm, 13 points higher than the average score in the 'Transport' category. Furthermore, 88% of customers reported  that  their  travel  experience  was  in  line  with  or even  better  than  their  expectation,  11  points  above  the average score for the sector.\n\n## Skytrax World Airline Awards\n\nOn June 20, 2023, at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget in France, the Skytrax World Airline Awards 2023 ceremony saw Air France receive several awards. For the third year running,  Air  France  was  voted  best  airline  in  Western Europe.

The  airline  also  took  first  place  in  three  categories linked  to  its La Premi\u00e8re service:  Best  First  Class  Airport Lounge, Best First Class Airline Lounge Catering and Best First Class Onboard Catering.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

This  decision  followed  Mr.  Jean-Marc  Janaillac stepping  down  as  Chair  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Air France-KLM, and the implementation of a transitional governance to, notably, enable the Chair of the Board of Directors,  Ms.  Anne-Marie  Couderc,  to  focus  on  the effective  functioning  of  the  Board  and  on  the  search  for candidates  for  the  position  of  Air  France-KLM's  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn August 16, 2018, the Board of Directors confirmed the separation  of  the  functions  of  Chair  of  the  Board  of Directors and Chief Executive Officer within the framework  of  the  implementation  of  the  long-term governance with the appointment of Mr. Benjamin Smith as the new Chief Executive Officer of Air France-KLM. The Board  of  Directors  considered  that  this  was  the  best governance  option  for  the  Company  at  this  stage  in  its development  in  that  it  enables  the  Company  to  benefit\n\nfrom a new dynamic with a Chair of the Board of Directors who  is  dedicated  to  governance  matters  and  a  Chief Executive  Officer  with  recognized  expertise  in  the  air transport  industry,  who  is  focused  on  the  Group's operations.  The  complementarity  of  their  profiles  and roles  optimizes  the  Group's  governance  and  ensures  a balanced  and  respectful  division  of  their  respective missions. It also enables the effective coordination of the Board of Directors thanks to the presence of a Chair of the Board  of  Directors  who  is  exclusively  devoted  to  its functioning,  and  guarantees  a  more  effective  separation between the control and management functions.\n\nOn March 30, 2022, as recommended by the Appointments and  Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors decided  on  the  early  renewal  of  Mr.  Benjamin  Smith's mandate as Chief Executive Officer for a further five-year term of office, effective from the Shareholders' Meeting of May 24, 2022, and expiring at the end of the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending December 31, 2026.\n\nof the Chief Executive Officer, these Internal Rules specify the modalities for the organization and functioning of the Board  of  Directors,  and  establish  the  prerogatives  and duties of Board directors as regards the rules on reporting, disclosure,  confidentiality  and  conflicts  of  interest.  They also  determine  the  powers  of  each  of  the  advisory Committees established within the Board.\n\nThe last update of the internal regulations took place on February 28, 2024. It concerns (i) aligning the missions of the  Board  of  Directors  with  the  recommendation  of  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code  concerning  the  Board's  missions  in terms of corporate social and environmental responsibility, (ii) the adjustment of the Audit Committee's missions and operations  with  regard  to  sustainability,  in  accordance with the new  legal  provisions  resulting from  the transposition of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of December 14, 2022  (CSRD),  and  (iii)  the  adjustment  of  the  minimum number  of  Air  France-KLM  shares  that  Directors  are recommended  to  hold,  following  the  reverse  share  split transaction carried out on August 31, 2023.\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors are available on the Air France-KLM website at http://www.airfranceklm.com (Governance section).",

The  Board  also  stipulated  that  it  is  committed  to promoting an adapted and diverse representation in terms of the experience, age and nationality of its members.\n\n## Selection criteria for Board directors\n\nIn the context of the appointment and re-appointment of Board  directors,  and  to  preserve  the  balance  of  its composition,  the  Board  of  Directors  gives  preference  to the following selection criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 openness  to  the  world,  international  professional experience and the diversity of nationalities: Air FranceKLM  was  created  through  the  merger  of  two companies of different  nationalities  with  global  reach leading to numerous international challenges;\n- \u25a0 general  management  experience  acquired  within major French and international companies; the Group numbers around 76,000 employees across three main types  of  activity:  the  Passenger  business,  the  Cargo business  and  the  Maintenance  business  operating  in 117 countries;\n- \u25a0 knowledge  and  experience  of  the  transportation  and airline  sectors,  as  well  as  of  tourism:  these  are  the businesses in which the Group is primarily active; and\n- \u25a0 the Board of Directors also ensures that expertise related to  the  Group's  strategic  priorities  is  represented  within the  Board,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  brand  strategy, digital  and  customer  relations,  human  resources,  and social and environmental responsibility (CSR).\n\n## Implementation of the diversity policy\n\nWith  the  implementation  of  this  diversity  policy,  the Board has set itself clear objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 maintain the balance between the Company's various stakeholders and the balanced representation of men and women;\n\n- \u25a0 seek a diverse and appropriate representation in terms of experience, age and nationality;\n- \u25a0 prioritize  the  independence  of  spirit  of  the  Board directors;\n- \u25a0 promote  adherence  to  the  Group's  fundamental values; and\n- \u25a0 ensure the availability of the Board directors.\n\n## Changes in the composition of the Board of Directors during the 2023 financial year\n\nThe changes in the composition of the Board during the financial year ended December 31, 2023 were an integral part of the ongoing implementation of this diversity policy of  the  Board  of  Directors,  notably  by  reinforcing  the Board's  international  outlook,  representation  of  skills  in the transportation, airline, digital, customer relations, and CSR and climate-related domains.\n\n## Balance of nationalities and international openness\n\nDuring the 2023 Shareholders' Meeting, the re -appointment of Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive Officer and a Board director  of  the  Company,  who  holds  Canadian  nationality, and the re-appointment of Mr. Cees't Hart, President of the KLM  Supervisory  Board  and  a  Board  director,  who  holds Dutch  citizenship,  enabled  the  Board  to  maintain  the diversity of its nationalities.\n\nFive Board directors, namely Ms. Boeren and Mssrs Tilgenkamp, 't Hart, Wynaendts and Van den Berg, are Dutch  nationals. Mr. Wang,  a  Board  director appointed  as  proposed  by  China  Eastern  Airlines,  is  a Chinese national. Lastly, Mr. Smith, Chief Executive Officer and  a  Board  director  of  the  Company,  holds  Canadian citizenship  while  the  US  company  Delta  Air  Lines,  Inc.  is represented  by  Mr.  Bellemare  who  holds  dual  Canadian and US citizenship.\n\nFive  different  nationalities  are  thus  represented  on  the Board of Directors which, in addition to French nationals, numbered eight non-French Board directors (a Canadian Board director, five Dutch Board directors, one CanadianUS  Board  director  and  one  Chinese  Board  director)  at December  31,  2023.  These  Board  directors  bring  to  the Board  of  Directors  an  in-depth  knowledge  of  their respective markets.",

        "page_content": "## An adapted and varied representation in terms of gender parity, age and experience\n\nBy  applying  criteria  like  the  balanced  representation  of men  and women, professional qualifications and experience,  age  and  nationality,  the  Board  of  Directors ensures  that  there  is  a  balance  conducive  to  the fulfillment of the tasks of the Board and of the individual Committees.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  the  composition  of  the  Board  of Directors is balanced in terms of age, the Board directors being  between  41  and  74  years  of  age,  with  an  average age of 58 and only three Board directors aged more than 70 years (1) .\n\nThe representation of men and women is also balanced at December 31, 2023, with seven of the 16 Board directors (2) being  women,  i.e.  a  percentage  of  44%.  Furthermore, three of the four advisory Committees within the Board of Directors are chaired by women.\n\nThe appointment of Ms. Florence Parly, Mr. Yann Leriche, the  co-optation  of  Mr.  Pascal  Bouchiat  and  the  reappointment  as  Board  directors  of  Mr.  Benjamin  Smith and  Mr.  Cees  't  Hart,  reinforced  the  Board  in  terms  of general  management  experience  acquired  within  large French and international companies.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nOrganization and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\n## Balance of competencies within the Board of Directors at December 31, 2023\n\nThe  following  table  shows,  for  each  Board  director,  the areas  of  expertise  that  are  essential  to  ensuring  the effective functioning of the Board of Directors in relation to  the  issues  it  addresses.  The  review  of  these  areas  of expertise  was  the  subject  of  a  specific  point  during  the evaluation of the Board of Directors which was carried out by an independent service provider as part of the analysis of  the  contributions  of  the  individual  Board  directors  to the work of the Board.\n\nFurthermore,  the  re-appointment  as  a  Board  director  of Mr.  Benjamin  Smith,  the  appointments  of  Ms.  Florence Parly,  Ms.  C\u00e9line  Fornaro,  Mr.  Yann  Leriche,  Mr.  Didier Dague  and  Mr.  Nicolas  Foretz,  together  with  the co -optation  of  the  company  CMA-CGM,  represented  by Mr. Ramon Fernandez, reinforced the Board's knowledge and experience of the transport and airline industries. In addition, the appointments and re-appointments having taken  place  in  2023  strengthened  the  representation  of skills  in  terms  of  social  and  environmental  responsibility and  the  risks  linked  to  climate  change,  digital  and cybersecurity, and in customer relations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ms.  Boeren  and  Mr.  Wynaendts  have  no special  interest  (significant  shareholder,  employee, other)  in  the  Company  or  its  Group.  Ms.  Boeren  and Mr.  Wynaendts  have  been  independent  directors  of Air  France-KLM  since,  respectively,  May  2017  (first appointed  as  a  Board  director)  and  May  2020 (re -appointment date following a first appointment as a Board director in May 2016);\n- \u25a0 the other non-independent Board directors are:\n- \u00b7 a  representative  of  the  French  State  appointed  by ministerial decree: Ms. Fornaro,\n- \u00b7 Board  directors  appointed  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State: Mr. Leriche and Mr. Bouchiat,\n- \u00b7 a  Board  director  appointed  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State: Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg (2) ,\n- \u00b7 Delta Air Lines, Inc (3) , whose permanent representative is Mr. Bellemare,\n- \u00b7 CMA CGM (5) whose co-optation was proposed to the Shareholders'  Meeting  (permanent  representative Mr. Fernandez),\n- \u00b7 representatives of the employee shareholders: Mr. Delli-Zotti and Mr. Foretz,\n- \u00b7 representatives  of  the  employees:  Mr.  Dague  and Mr. Tilgenkamp, and\n- \u00b7 executive  officers  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group: Mr. Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Air France-KLM and  a  Board  director  of  Air  France,  and  Mr.  't  Hart, Chair of the KLM Supervisory Board.\n\nGiven the above, and in application of the provision of the AFEP-MEDEF Code by which Board directors representing employee shareholders and Board directors representing the  employees  are  not  counted  in  the  calculation  of  the percentages  of  independent  shareholders  within  the Board of Directors and its Committees (\u00a710.3 and 16.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF  Code),  the  percentages  of  independent directors as of December 31, 2023 are:\n\n- \u25a0 44% in the Board of Directors;\n- \u25a0 75% in the Audit Committee (chaired by an independent director);\n- \u25a0 67% in the Appointments and Governance Committee (chaired by an independent director);\n- \u25a0 60%  in  the  Remuneration  Committee  (chaired  by  an independent director); and\n- \u25a0 40% in the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee (chaired by an independent director).\n\nThe proportion of independent directors at December 31, 2023 (44%) is thus below the 50% threshold recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code for non-controlled companies.\n\nThis divergence has emerged following the latest capital transactions.\n\nIn  effect,  on  March  25,  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  of Air  France-KLM  considered,  based  on  a  report  from  the Appointments and Governance Committee, that in view of the  Dutch  State's  acquisition  of  a  shareholding  in Air  France-KLM  on  February  26,  2019,  the  Board  director appointed as proposed by the Dutch State, could no longer qualify as an independent director as of that same date.\n\nFurthermore, on May 22, 2022, the company entered into a subscription  agreement  within  the  framework  of  the conclusion of a long-term strategic partnership in air cargo wherein  CMA  CGM,  whose  permanent  representative  is Mr.  Fernandez,  was  appointed  as  a  Board  director  of Air France-KLM.\n\n- \u00b7 a  Board  director  whose  candidature  was  proposed by China Eastern Airlines: Mr. Wang (4) ,",

They represent the interests of the French State in its capacity  as  a  shareholder  (Article  6  III  of  the aforementioned decree).\n\nIn  that  it  is  aware  of  the  interest  of  having  a  significant proportion  of  independent  Board  directors,  Air  FranceKLM is steadily increasing the proportion of independent directors within its Board of Directors.\n\nFurthermore,  since  Air  France-KLM  and  CMA  CGM  have agreed  that  CMA  CGM  would  stand  down  as  a  Board director  of  Air  France-KLM  effective  March  31,  2024,  the proportion of  independent directors within the Board of Directors has risen to 47%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  example,  visits took  place  following  the  appointment  of  new  Board directors in 2023, notably to the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Hub  Control  Center,  to  the  operational  platform  and  to the  Operations  Control  Center.  On  their  appointment, they  are  also  sent  a  dossier  including,  notably,  the Air  France-KLM  Articles  of  Incorporation,  the  Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, the Universal Registration Document,  the  latest  press  releases  issued  by  the Company and a reminder of the stock market compliance rules.\n\nPursuant to Article 4 of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, on their appointment and during their terms of office, every Board director (including the Board directors representing the employees and the employee shareholders)  can  benefit  from  the  training  that  they deem  necessary  for  the  exercise  of  their  mandate.  This training is proposed and organized by the Company.\n\nThis training, which is paid for by the Company, is mostly carried  out  via  a  program  designed  by  a  professional body, supplemented by in-house training offered by the Company, and is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the functioning of the Board of Directors and their roles as Board directors. Accounting and financing modules are also  proposed  to  enable  them  to  improve  their  financial know-how.  A  portion  of  this  training  time  is  carried  out within the Company.  Pursuant  to  the  applicable regulation,  during  its  meetings  of  April  19,  2023  and February  28,  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to terminate and update the training program in French and English  offered  to  the  Board  directors  representing  the employee  shareholders  and  the  employees.  Specific modules related to climate issues or, in connection with the deployment of the anti-bribery plan, are also offered to the Board directors.\n\nFurthermore,  during  the  2024  first  half,  a  workshop dedicated to the impacts of climate change, the principle of  double  materiality  and  the  implementation  of  the CSRD within the Group will be organized for the members of the Audit Committee  and  of  the  Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee.\n\n## 2.2.5 Other rules applicable to Board directors\n\n## Situation of conflict of interests\n\nPursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code and Article 11 of  the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of Directors  (as  amended  by  a  decision  of  the  Board  of directors of February 28, 2024), Board directors are bound to  report  to  the  Board  of  Directors  any  situation  of  a conflict of interests, whether actual or potential, owing to positions  they  hold  in  another  company,  and  must abstain from taking part in the deliberation and voting on the related resolution. Every year, the Company sends the Board  directors  a  questionnaire  enabling  confirmation that there are no conflicts of interest and the Company to be informed of any potential conflicts.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  Ms.  Florence  Parly  who  has declared that she is a member of the board of the French international  solidarity  organization  Acting  for  Life,  of which Air France is one of the main financial partners, to the  Company's  knowledge  none  of  the  Board  directors are related and there are no conflicts of interest between the  duties  of  the  Board  directors  with  regard  to  the Company and their private interests and other duties.\n\nWith the exception of the agreements listed below, there are  no  arrangements  or  agreements  between  the  main shareholders,  customers,  suppliers  or  other  parties,  in accordance  with  which  a  member  of  the  Board  of Directors has been selected:\n\n- (i) the agreements signed on October 16, 2003 between Air France, KLM and the Dutch government pursuant to  which  four  Board  directors  are  appointed  to  the Board of Directors as proposed by KLM and the Dutch government  (see  section  2.1  'Composition  of  the Board of Directors');\n- (ii) the agreements signed on July 27, 2017 between, firstly, Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines, Inc. and, secondly, between  Air  France-KLM  and  China  Eastern  Airlines pursuant to which Delta Air Lines, Inc. and Mr. Wang were  appointed  to  the  Board  of  Directors  (see section 2.7.4 'Partnerships with Air France-KLM'; and\n- (iii) the subscription agreement entered into on May 22, 2022  between  Air  France-KLM  and  CMA  CGM pursuant  to  which  CMA  CGM  was  appointed  as  a Board  director  and  the  commercial  cooperation agreement in air freight entered into on December 9, 2022  between  Air  France-KLM,  Air  France,  KLM, CMA CGM and CMA CGM Air Cargo.\n\nOn January 16,  2024,  Air  France-KLM  and  CMA  CGM announced the termination of the existing agreements effective March 31, 2024 and the opening of discussions on the new terms and conditions of a business  relationship  in  which  each  party  would operate  independently.  As  the  parties  have  also agreed on CMA CGM's resignation from the Board of Directors  (see  section  2.7.4  \"Partnerships  with  Air France-KLM\"), CMA CGM ceased to have a permanent representative as of March 31, 2024.",

These repurchases were carried out subject to the  subscription  by  the  French  State  of  new  Deeply Subordinated  Notes  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac320,400,000  on March 17, 2023 (the 'Subordinated Notes March 2023') and \u20ac407,400,000 on April 19, 2023 ('the 'Subordinated Notes April  2023'  and,  together  with  the  Subordinated  Notes March  2023,  the  'Subordinated  Notes  2023')  (it  being specified  that  the  Subordinated  Notes  April  2023  will  be assimilated  to  the  Subordinated  Notes  March  2023  from March 17, 2024).\n\nAs  part  of  the  repurchase  of  these  Undated  Deeply Subordinated  Notes  and  the  issue  of  the  Subordinated Notes  2023,  the  Company  entered  into  the  following agreements  with  the  French  State,  which  held  28.6%  of the Company's share capital at the date of conclusion of these agreements:\n\n- \u25a0 on  March  17,  2023,  the  repurchase  offer  by  the Company  for  3,000  NR6  Deeply  Subordinated  Notes and  the  corresponding  interest  for  an  amount  of \u20ac320,404,110  and  (ii)  the  subscription  agreement  for the issue of 3,204 Subordinated Notes March 2023 for an  amount  of  \u20ac320,400,000  by  the  Company  and subscribed in full by the French State; and\n- \u25a0 on  April  19,  2023,  (i)  the  repurchase  offer  by  the Company  for  2,950  NR6  Deeply  Subordinated  Notes and  the  corresponding  interest  for  an  amount  of \u20ac317,064,377.50, together with the payment of a sum of \u20ac90,354,401.01  relating  to  the  application  of  Article 64ter of the Temporary Framework, as set out below, to remunerate  the  French  Republic  following  the  aid granted  within  the  framework  of  its  purchase  of  an equity interest during the capital increase of April 2021 (the 'Exit Amount') and (ii) the subscription agreement for the issue of 4,074 Subordinated Notes April 2023 in the  amount  of  \u20ac407,400,000  by  the  Company  and subscribed in full by the French State (the 'Regulated Agreements').\n\nOn March 17 and April 19, 2023, the Company committed to repurchasing the balance of the NR6  Deeply Subordinated Notes for an amount of around \u20ac727,800,000, subject to the subscription by the French State  of  the  Subordinated  Notes  2023  on,  respectively, March 17, 2023 and April 19, 2023.\n\nIt is specified that the Repurchase carried on April 19, 2023 was  realized  for  a  price  corresponding  to  the  nominal value and accrued interest, as well as a sum corresponding to the Exit Amount.\n\nWith a view to repaying the Recapitalization aid and given that the French State announced to the Air France-KLM Board of Directors that it did not intend to sell the State Shares 2021, the French State gave its consent to benefit from  the  provisions  of  point  64ter  of  the  Temporary Framework. Under these provisions, the exit of the French State from the Recapitalization may take the form of the retention by the French State of the shares subscribed as part of the Recapitalization, after the expiry of a two-year\n\nperiod from the Recapitalization, subject to the granting to  the  French  State  of  the  required  remuneration  and, where applicable, compensation due for a loss of value of the  shares  subscribed  by  the  French  State,  under  the conditions  set  out  in  point  64bis  of  the  Temporary Framework and agreed with the European Commission. As  the  aforementioned  two-year  period  expired  on April 19, 2023, Air France-KLM intended to implement the mechanism  referred  to  in  point  64ter  of  the  Temporary Framework by making a payment to the French State of the  exit  amount  (the  'Exit  Amount')  to  enable  the complete lifting of the 'bans' imposed on Air France-KLM due to the granting of the Recapitalization, as explained in greater detail by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 16, 2023.\n\nAs  part  of  the  repurchases,  the  Company  undertook  to cancel  the  repurchased  Deeply  Subordinated  Notes  and not to reissue or resell them.\n\nIn parallel, the Company issued the Deeply Subordinated Notes  2023  in  two  stages  and  subscribed  in  full  by  the French  State  in  cash,  representing  the  amount  of  the balance of the NR6 Deeply Subordinated Notes increased by the Exit Amount. In this context, the Company and the French State  entered  into  two  subscription  agreements, respectively on March 17, 2023 and April 19, 2023.\n\nMr.  Pascal  Bouchiat  and  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Comolli, Board directors  appointed  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting as proposed by the French State, could be considered to be indirectly interested in the conclusion of the agreements relating to the subscription and repurchases due  to  the  fact  that  the  French  State  held  28.6%  of  the Company's share capital at the date of conclusion of the Repurchases.\n\nMs. May Gicquel, a Board director representing the French State  appointed  by  a  ministerial  decree  dated  March  15, 2023, replacing Ms. St\u00e9phanie Besnier, is considered to be indirectly interested in the conclusion of the agreements relating  to  the  subscription  and  repurchases  due  to  the fact  that  the  French  State  held  28.6%  of  the  Company's share capital  at  the  date  of  conclusion  of  the  Regulated Agreements.\n\nPursuant to Article L.  225-38  of  the Code  de  Commerce , the Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the conclusion of the subscription and repurchase offers at its meeting  of  February  16,  2023.  Mr.  Pascal  Bouchiat, Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Comolli  and  Ms.  St\u00e9phanie  Besnier did  not  take  part  in  the  deliberations  or  vote  on  the Repurchases.\n\nWithin  the  context  of  the  recovery  in  airline  industry activity, at levels close to those of prior to the Covid crisis, the Company considered that it was now vital to proceed with the effective and full redemption of the Recapitalization aid.\n\nThe  repurchases  were  therefore  concluded  to  allow  the Company  to  redeem  in  full  the  Undated  Deeply Subordinated Notes issued by the Company on April 20, 2021, for a total amount of \u20ac3 billion and fully subscribed by  the  French  State  by  way  of  set-off  on  claims  held  by the  French  State  against  the  Company  pursuant  to  the shareholder's  current  account  agreement  dated  May  6, 2020,  entered  into  between  the  French  State  and  the Company.  The  repurchase  offer  concluded  on  April  19, 2023 was further increased by the Exit Amount due by the Company  to  the  French  State  in  accordance  with  the rules  provided  for  in  the  Temporary  Framework  and  the decision to grant Covid aid (Decision SA.59913).",

This subscription was carried out following approval  by  the  European  Commission,  on  February  16, 2023,  of  a  compensation  aid  from  the  French  State without  any  bans  for  the  benefit  of  Air  France-KLM  and Air France.\n\nNo  Undated  Deeply  Subordinated  Notes  have  been outstanding since April 19, 2023.\n\nIn  agreement  with  the  French  State  Shareholdings Agency ( Agence des Participations de l'\u00c9tat APE), it was decided  to  fix  the  repurchase  price  of  the  notes  as  the sum of the nominal value and the value of the coupons accrued,  plus  the  Exit  Amount,  at  the  dates  of  the Repurchases.

Mr. Rodolphe Saad\u00e9 did not take  part  in  the  deliberation  or  the  vote  on  the amendment to the Subscription Agreement.\n\nThe objective of the conclusion of the amendment to the Subscription Agreement was to ensure the continuity of the cooperation between Air France-KLM and CMA CGM by ensuring  the  possibility for CMA  CGM  to  be represented within the Company's Board of Directors by a natural or a legal person.\n\nApart  from  the  impact  on  the  composition  of  the Company's  Board  of  Directors,  this  amendment  has  no other  impact  on  the  Company's  business  and  the  longterm strategic partnership in air freight with the company CMA CGM.\n\n## Termination of the financial settlement waiver agreement relating to the joint-venture agreement with China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd.\n\nOn  December  4,  2020,  the  Air  France-KLM  Board  of Directors  authorized  the  suspension  of  the  financial mechanism  relating to the 'settlement' (financial mechanism designed to distribute the income generated by  the  joint-venture)  set  forth  in  the  joint-venture agreement  entered  into  with  China  Eastern  Airlines  Co. Ltd. on November 26, 2018 (the 'JV Agreement'), effective February 1, 2020.\n\nWith the reopening of the Chinese borders in early 2023, the  company  initiated  discussions  with  China  Eastern Airlines  Co.

Ltd, could be considered to be directly interested in the signature of the Agreement due to,  in  particular  (i)  his  position  as  a  member  of  the Company's  Board  of  Directors  and  (ii)  his  position  as Corporate Secretary of China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd.\n\nPursuant to Article L.  225-38  of  the Code de Commerce , the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  authorized  the conclusion  of  the  Agreement  at  its  meeting  of  July  27, 2023. Mr. Jian Wang did not take part in the deliberation or the vote with respect to the Agreement.\n\nThe signature of the Agreement will enable the financial mechanism  provided  for  in  the  initial  JV  Agreement  to again be applied, thereby enabling the renewed coordination and cooperation with China Eastern Airlines Co.

KLM also undertook to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until such time as these two loans had been repaid in full.\n\nDuring  the  2022  first  half,  KLM  repaid  amounts  made available  with  the  framework  of  the  revolving  credit  line (\u20ac665  million)  and  the  subordinated  loan  (\u20ac277  million), without however terminating the framework agreement.\n\nKLM also cancelled the revolving credit facility guaranteed  by  the  Dutch  State  and  the  direct  loan granted by the Dutch State.\n\nFollowing  this  cancellation,  the  conditions  attached  to this aid were no longer applicable.\n\nThe  framework  agreement  remains  however  applicable mostly  as  concerns  the  stipulations  relating  to  the assurances  given  to  the  Dutch  State  which  provide,  in particular,  for  the  extension  from  nine  months  to  five years of the notice period to terminate these assurances (see section 6.3.2 'Agreements with the Dutch State').\n\nAdjustment to the financial conditions of the joint-ventures entered into with firstly (i) Delta Air Lines, Inc. and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.

The  Board  will  assess  the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\nFor more information, see section 2.5.2 'Compensation of the company officers in 2022'.\n\nThere  were  no  other  agreements  or  commitments authorized  and  signed  over  the  course  of  previous financial years whose execution continued during the last financial year.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nOrganization and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\n## Procedure for the qualification and regular evaluation of the current agreements signed in normal conditions\n\nDuring its meeting of December 11, 2019, as recommended  by  the  Audit  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors established a procedure enabling the qualification  and  regular  evaluation  of  the  agreements relating to current operations entered into under normal terms and conditions pursuant to the provisions of Article L.  22-10-12  of  the Code  de  Commerce .  The  current  and normal nature of an agreement is evaluated on a case-bycase basis  during  the  signature,  renewal  or  amendment of  the  said  agreement,  on  the  basis  of  objective  criteria defined in the procedure.\n\nWithin the framework of this annual evaluation procedure, the Company:\n\n- \u25a0 compiles an inventory of all the agreements referred to in Article L. 22-10-12 of the Code de Commerce ;\n- \u25a0 reviews  all  the  elements  and  documents  having enabled the qualification of the agreements; and\n- \u25a0 as necessary, reviews the qualification of any agreements with interested parties (regulated agreement or free agreement, depending on the case).\n\nPersons  with  an  interest  in  one  of  these  agreements, entered into either directly or through an intermediary, do not participate in their evaluation.\n\nA  presentation  on  the  result  of  the  inventory  of  the agreements referred to in Article L. 22-10-12 of the Code de Commerce , in respect  of  the  financial  year  ended December 31, 2023, was made to the Audit Committee on February  27,  2024  and  was  reviewed  by  the  Board  of Directors within the framework  of the corporate governance report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To inform this discussion,  a  formalized  evaluation  is  conducted  via  a questionnaire. This evaluation is steered by the Appointments and Governance Committee. Furthermore, a formal  evaluation  with  the  help  of  an  external consultant is realized every three years.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  2023  financial  year,  the  evaluation  was carried  out  by  an  independent  external  consultant,  Eric Salmon, in the form of a questionnaire sent to each Board director,  followed  by  confidential  individual  interviews. The  following  topics  were  addressed  through  the evaluation questionnaire:\n\n- \u25a0 the composition, organization, functioning and dynamic of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- \u25a0 the  relationship  between  the  Board  of  Directors  and the General Management;\n- \u25a0 the  effectiveness  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its Committees;\n- \u25a0 the  individual  contributions  of  the  Board  directors  to the  work  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  areas  of expertise to be developed within the Board;\n- \u25a0 the  integration  of  the  new  Board  directors  and  the proposed training;\n- \u25a0 the main changes and areas requiring improvement.\n\nThe results of the evaluation were handled under the seal of  anonymity  and  gave  rise  to  a  presentation  and discussion  during  the  Board  of  Directors  meeting  of February 28, 2024.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  was  again  very  active (10 meetings of which two were extraordinary). It focused notably  on  the  early  repayment  of  the  State  Aid,  the operations  to  restore  the  Group's  equity,  the  strategic goals  and  the  Group's  financial  trajectory  and  CSR priorities for the years to come.\n\nAs a general rule, the Board directors considered that the functioning of the Board of Directors had improved over the  course  of  2023  since  the  last  evaluation.  The evaluation revealed the following positive points:\n\n- \u25a0 good  performance  level  of  the  Board  in  terms  of  its functioning and organization, fostering quality exchanges between the Board directors;\n- \u25a0 the  composition  of  the  Board  and  its  committees meets  the  needs  of  the  Board,  with  a  good complementarity  in  terms  of  the  skills  profiles  of  the Board  directors  and  the  high  quality  of  the  new members;\n- \u25a0 the directors' skills  are  recognized,  and  there  is  a  free and constructive debate enabling the development of positions;\n- \u25a0 the quality of the relationship between the Board and the Chair whose involvement is widely recognized, and with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  whose  actions  are widely acclaimed;\n- \u25a0 the General Management is open when responding to requests  for  information  and  to  questions,  and  the Chair  leads  discussions  in  an  open  manner  without trying to influence the Board directors.\n\nThe results of the 2023 evaluation enabled the pinpointing of  a  number  of  areas  for  improvement  to  be  monitored during 2024, notably:\n\n- \u25a0 try to reduce the number of meetings by continuing to plan ahead in order to avoid exceptional meetings;\n- \u25a0 circulate information earlier so that directors have time to  assimilate  it,  thus  allowing  only  a  summary  to  be presented  at  the  meeting,  leaving  more  time  for discussion;\n- \u25a0 produce more concise minutes of the meetings of the specialized committees;\n- \u25a0 allocate more time to discussing the Group's strategy and  the  strategy  related  to  sustainable  development and risk management; and\n- \u25a0 expand  the  Board's  portfolio  of  competencies  in  the digital  areas  as  well  as  its  expertise  in  the  customer journey, particularly in the luxury goods sector, and its expertise in air transportation.",

Boeren,  Mr.  Michel  Delli-Zotti, Mr. Nicolas Foretz and Ms. C\u00e9line Fornaro.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Audit  Committee  benefit  from financial and accounting competencies enabling them to exercise their functions.\n\nAt its meeting of November 9, 2011, the Board of Directors adopted the position whereby, pursuant to the provisions of  Article  L.  823-19  of  the Code  de  Commerce , the Company's  Audit  Committee  includes  at  least  one independent member  with  specific financing and accounting  skills.  On  July  1,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors decided  to  appoint  Ms.  Bouillot  as  Chair  of  the  Audit Committee,  in  that  she  has  the  academic  background and professional experience to fulfill this requirement for specific financial competence, and she has no relationships with the company, its Group or management that are such as to color her judgment. The six other Committee members also have financial and/or accounting skills.\n\nThe principal executives responsible for accounting, legal affairs,  finance,  internal  control  and  internal  audit  of Air  France-KLM  also  attend  meetings  in  an  advisory capacity.\n\nThe  Statutory  Auditors  attended  all  the  meetings  of  the Audit  Committee.  At  the  request  of  the  Chair  of  the Committee  and  pursuant  to  Article  17.3  of  the  AFEPMEDEF Code, they were able to consult with Committee members  outside  the  presence  of  the  Group's  senior executives  on  the  occasion  of  the  review  of  the  annual financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Missions\n\nThe  Audit  Committee's  principal  missions  are  to  review the interim and annual consolidated financial statements to inform the Board of Directors of their content, ensure that  they  are  reliable  and  exhaustive,  and  that  the information  they  contain,  including  the  forward-looking information  provided  to  shareholders  and  the  market, meets  high  standards  of  quality.  The  Committee  also oversees the auditing of the annual financial statements. In particular, the Audit Committee review:\n\n- \u25a0 the consolidation scope;\n- \u25a0 relevance and consistency of the accounting methods used to draw up the financial statements;\n- \u25a0 principal estimates made by the General Management of Air France-KLM;\n- \u25a0 principal financial risks with the General Management of  Air  France-KLM  and  the  material  off-balance-sheet commitments;\n- \u25a0 comments  and  recommendations  made  by  the Statutory  Auditors  and,  if  applicable,  any  significant adjustments resulting from audits.\n\nAs necessary, the Audit Committee formulates recommendations  to  guarantee  the  integrity  of  the process to establish the financial information.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  monitors  the  effectiveness  of  the Internal Control and risk management procedures and, as necessary,  Internal  Audit,  in  terms  of  the  processes relating  to  the  establishment  and  treatment  of  the accounting and financial information, with no compromise  to  its  independence.  In  this  capacity,  it reviews in particular the program and results of Internal Audit  to  ensure,  notably,  that,  in  the  event  of  any malfunctioning, the appropriate action plans and followup monitoring have been implemented. The Committee discusses  with  the  Statutory  Auditors  and  reviews  their conclusions on  the  half-year and  annual  financial statements.  It  also  pays  particular  attention  to  the  audit points  identified  by  the  Statutory  Auditors  and  ensures compliance  with  the  legal  and  regulatory  requirements for financial and accounting information.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  steering  the procedure  to  select  the  Statutory  Auditors.  It  submits  a recommendation  to  the  Board  of  Directors  when  their appointment  or  re-appointment  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting is envisaged pursuant to Article L. 823-3-1 of the Code de Commerce .  It  proposes the selection procedure to the Board of Directors and, in particular, whether a call to tender is appropriate. It verifies the independence and quality  of  the  Statutory  Auditors'  work,  examines  issues relating  to  their  amount  of  fees  for  the  execution  of statutory  audit  assignments,  reviews  and  approves  the fees  submitted  by  each  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  on  an annual  basis  and  ascertains  that  the  joint  system  of Statutory Auditors is effective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  duration  of  the meetings averaged three hours and thirty minutes.\n\nThe following matters were notably reviewed by the Audit Committee during the 2023 financial year:\n\n## \u25a0 Review of the financial statements\n\nThe  Committee  reviewed  the  quarterly,  half-year  and annual  financial  statements,  and  the  budget,  prior  to their presentation  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  It conducted  a  detailed  examination  of  the  Statutory Auditors' summary reports on the half-year and annual financial  statements  as  well  as  the  significant  points noted in audits. The main accounting options adopted were  the  subject  of  a  special  presentation  every quarter.\n\nThe  review  of  the  financial  statements  by  the  Audit Committee  usually  takes  place  a  day  or  two  before their review by the Board of Directors.\n\n## \u25a0 Review and monitoring of the budget\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the budget prior to its presentation to the Board of Directors and oversaw its tracking  on  a  quarterly  basis.  This  year  the  Audit Committee  examined  the  major  points  in  the  2023 budget prior to the review of the detailed budget.\n\n## \u25a0 Internal control, risk management and internal audit\n\nDuring the Audit Committee meetings, Internal Audit gave a presentation on its half-year activity report.\n\nThe  Company  applies  high  standards  of  financial disclosure and corporate governance, and maintains a rigorous level of internal control across the Group.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the summary sheet of the  main  operational  and/or  strategic  risks  on  a  halfyearly  basis.  The  Audit  Committee  also  reviewed  the financial risks (fuel, currency exchange rates, financing, transformation  plan).  The  ESG  certified  extra-financial risks were  submitted  by  internal  audit  to  the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee, and to the Audit Committee for review.\n\n## \u25a0 Statutory Auditors\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  approved  the  budget  for  the Statutory  Auditors'  fees  prior  to  the  opening  of  the financial year together with their final amount as of the closing date.\n\n## \u25a0 Approval of non-audit services\n\nTo  execute  this  mission,  the  Audit  Committee  relies on  an  internal  procedure  deployed  within  the  Group in 2004  and  updated  in  2016,  pursuant  to  the provisions of Ordinance No. 2016-315 of March 17, 2016 relating  to  Statutory  Auditors,  which  came  into  force on June 17, 2016.\n\nAs  foreseen  by  its  annual  work  schedule,  the  Audit Committee also reviewed the following matters in 2023:\n\n- \u25a0 tracking of the cash and financing situation;\n- \u25a0 review of the financing and capex plan;\n- \u25a0 review  of  the  principal  litigation,  fiscal  risks  and financial risks;",

Following the report from the Appointments and Governance Committee, on March 25, 2019 the Air France-KLM Board of Directors considered that, in view of the Dutch State's acquisition of a shareholding in Air France-KLM on February 26, 2019, the Board director appointed as proposed by the Dutch State, could no longer be considered an independent Board director as of that same date.\n\nFurthermore, on May 22, 2022, the Company entered into a subscription agreement within the framework of the conclusion of a long-term strategic partnership in air freight under which CMA CGM, whose permanent representative is Ramon Fernandez, was appointed as a Board director of Air France-KLM.\n\nThis divergence is thus due to the specificity of Air France-KLM's shareholder structure, the latter  numbering  the  French  (28%)  and  Dutch  States  (9.1%)  amongst  its  shareholders, along  with  three  major  commercial  partners,  namely  CMA  CGM  (8.8%),  China  Eastern Airlines (4.6%) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (2.8%). Collectively these shareholders represented 53.3%  of  Air  France-KLM's  share  capital  at  December  31,  2023.  The  Board  directors appointed as proposed by these shareholders may not be considered to be independent.\n\nIn addition, the 28% shareholding held by the French State enables the latter, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No.2014-948 of August 20, 2014, to benefit from a seat on the Board  reserved  for  a  Board  director  representing  the  French  State,  appointed  by ministerial  decree,  and  to  propose  Board  directors  to  the  Shareholders'  Meeting.  Two Board directors have been proposed by the French State and represent the interests of the  French  State  in  its  capacity  as  a  shareholder  (Article  6  III  of  the  aforementioned Ordinance).\n\nIn that it is aware of the interest of having a significant proportion of independent Board directors, Air France-KLM is steadily increasing the proportion of independent members within its Board of Directors.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, Air France-KLM and CMA CGM announced that they were terminating their existing agreements effective March 31, 2024 and the opening of discussions on the new  terms  and  conditions  of  a  commercial  relationship.  The  parties.also  agreed  that CMA CGM would step down as a Board director, effective March 31, 2024 (see section 2.7.4 'Partnerships  with  Air  France-KLM'.  The  proportion  of  independent  directors  within  the Air France-KLM Board of Directors has thus risen to 47%.\n\nThe current practice is that the main matters concerning the executive officers (such as their  appointment,  performance  and  compensation)  are  discussed  by  the  Board  of Directors outside the presence of the interested parties, after consulting the opinion of, as required, the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  or  the  Remuneration Committee.",

The  Company's  Board  of Directors  thus  establishes  a  compensation  policy  which complies  with  the  Company's  corporate  interest  ( int\u00e9r\u00eat social ), is aligned with its commercial strategy and which contributes  to  its  long-term  sustainability.  It  outlines  all the components of the fixed and variable compensation for  the  company  officers,  and  explains  the  decisionmaking  process  followed  for  its  establishment,  revision and  implementation.  This  compensation  policy  is  the subject of a draft resolution submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting, under the conditions provided for in  Article  L.  22-10-32  of  the Code  de  Commerce ,  on  an annual  basis  and  on  any  significant  amendment  to  the compensation policy.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Articles  L.  22-10-9  and L.  22-10-34  of  the Code de Commerce ,  the  Shareholders' Meeting must also approve on an annual basis, firstly, the information referred to in Article L. 22-10-9 of the Code de Commerce , including notably the total compensation and benefits  of  any  kind  paid  to  all  the  company  officers  in respect  of  their  mandates  during  the  previous  financial year or granted in respect of their mandates for the same financial year and, secondly, the total compensation and benefits  of  any  kind  paid  during  the  previous  financial year  or  granted  in  respect  of  the  same  financial  year  to each executive officer.\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  5,  2024  is  thus convened to approve:\n\n- \u25a0 the information relating to the compensation for each of the company officers, pursuant to Articles L. 22-10-9 and  L.  22-10-34  of  the Code  de  Commerce . This information  is  presented  hereinafter  in  section  2.5.2 ('Compensation of the company officers in 2023');\n- \u25a0 the  fixed  and  variable  elements  composing  the  total compensation and benefits of any kind paid during the 2023 financial year or granted in respect of this financial year to Ms. Anne-Marie Couderc, Chair of the Board of Directors  and  to  Mr.  Benjamin  Smith,  Chief  Executive Officer,  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-34  of  the Code de Commerce . This information is presented hereinafter in section  2.5.2.2  ('Elements  of  compensation  paid  or granted during the 2023 financial year to the executive officers and submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of June 5, 2024'); and\n- \u25a0 the  compensation  policy  for  the  company  officers  in respect of 2024, i.e. the Board Directors, the Chair of the Board  of  Directors  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of the Company, as established by the Board of Directors, pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-8  of  the Code  de Commerce . This  policy  is  set  forth  hereinafter  in section  2.5.3  ('Compensation  policy  for  the  company officers in respect of 2024').\n\nIt  is  specified  that,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article L.  22-10-8 of the Code de Commerce ,  to  avoid  becoming null  and  void,  no  element  of  compensation,  of  any  kind whatsoever,  may  be  established,  granted  or  paid  by  the Company, nor any commitment made corresponding to elements of compensation, indemnities or benefits due or potentially due on taking up, stepping down or by reason of  a  change  in  their  duties  or  following  their  exercise, unless it complies with the approved compensation policy or, in its absence, with past compensation or practices.\n\nFurthermore, if the Shareholders' Meeting of June 5, 2024 does not approve the draft resolution referred to in Article L.  22-10-34,  I  of  the Code  de  Commerce ,  the  Board  of Directors  must  submit  a  revised  compensation  policy, taking into account the shareholders' vote, for approval by the  next  Shareholders'  Meeting.  In  such  a  situation,  the payment of the sum allocated to the Board directors for the 2024 financial year shall be suspended until approval of  the  revised  compensation  policy.  Once  reinstated,  it shall include the arrears incurred since the Shareholders' Meeting of June 5, 2024.\n\nIn  addition,  the  elements  of  variable  or  extraordinary compensation  granted  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  in respect of the 2024 financial year will only be able to be paid  after  approval,  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of June  5,  2024,  of  these  elements  of  compensation  under the conditions provided for in the first paragraph of Article L. 22-10-34, II of the Code de Commerce .\n\nNote  that  the  repayment  of  75%  of  the  State  Aid  took place  on  March  17,  2023.  As  a  result,  the  restrictions  in respect of the European Commission's decision of April 5, 2021 on case No. SA.59913 relating to the recapitalization of Air France  and  Air  France-KLM  concerning  the elements of compensation for the Chair of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Air France-KLM Board of Directors no longer apply. In particular, since March 17, 2023, the variable compensation  granted  and  acquired  by  the  Chief Executive Officer of Air France-KLM may again be paid.",

The allocation and granting modalities for this additional compensation are set by the Board  of  Directors,  as  proposed  by  the  Remuneration Committee.  An  additional  amount  of  compensation  is also granted  to  non-resident  Board  directors.  The information on the number of meetings of the Board of Directors  and  its  advisory  Committees  held  during  the 2023  financial  year  and  the  attendance  record  for  each Board  director  at  the  aforementioned  meetings  is  set forth in section 2.3.\n\nThe allocation rules are outlined in section 2.5.3.1.\n\n## Audit Committee:\n\n- \u25a0 the Chair receives a flat-rate amount of compensation of \u20ac4,500, with additional compensation amounting to a maximum  of  \u20ac7,500  based  on  attendance  at Committee meetings; and\n- \u25a0 the  members  each  receive  a  flat-rate  amount  of compensation of \u20ac3,000, with additional compensation for the individual Committee members amounting  to  a  maximum  of  \u20ac5,000  based  on  their attendance records at Committee meetings.\n\n## Other Committees:\n\n- \u25a0 the Chair receives a flat-rate amount of compensation of \u20ac3,000, with additional compensation amounting to a  maximum  of  \u20ac4,500  based  on  their  attendance  at Committee meetings; and\n- \u25a0 the  members  each  receive  a  flat-rate  amount  of compensation of \u20ac2,000, with additional compensation for the individual Committee members amounting  to  a  maximum  of  \u20ac3,000  based  on  their attendance records at Committee meetings.\n\n- 2.5.2.2  Elements of compensation paid or granted during the 2023 financial year to the executive officers and submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of June 5, 2024\n- a) Compensation of the Chair of the Board of Directors, for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023\n\n## Presentation of the 2023 compensation structure for the Chair of the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant to the Board of Directors' resolution of February 16, 2023, the fixed compensation of the Chair of the Board of Directors is \u20ac200,000. By way of reminder, the amount of this annual fixed compensation for the Chair of the Board of Directors had been increased by the Board of Directors on  February  19,  2022  to  \u20ac220,000  but  the  Chair  of  the Board of Directors waived this increase in respect of the 2020  and  2021  financial  years,  and  it  was  not  applied  in respect  of  the  2022  financial  year  pursuant  to  the European Commission's decision of April 5, 2021 on case No. SA.59913 relating to the recapitalization of Air France and Air France-KLM which provided that the compensation of the Chair of the Board of Directors could not  exceed  the  fixed  portion  of  her  compensation  at December 31, 2019.\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, the Board of Directors decided, as  requested  by  the  Chair,  to  maintain  her  level  of compensation at \u20ac200,000, without applying the increase decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  19,  2020. This  annual  fixed  compensation  has  thus  remained unchanged since 2019.\n\nThis  compensation  includes  neither  compensation  in respect of her Board director mandate (formerly directors' fees) nor variable compensation.\n\nThe 2023 compensation policy for the Chair of the Board of  Directors  was  approved  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting of June, 7, 2023.\n\nFor more details on the compensation policy for the Chair of  the  Board of Directors in respect of the 2023 financial year, see section 2.5.3.2 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.",

It  stipulates  that  the compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  shall  be composed of the following three elements:\n\n- 1) a fixed amount of annual compensation;\n- 2) an annual variable amount of compensation linked to the  performance  during  the  previous  financial  year potentially reaching 122% of the fixed compensation at targets achieved and up to 150% in the event that the targets are exceeded; and\n- 3) a variable amount of long-term compensation.\n\nThis  compensation  structure  has  remained  unchanged since 2018  as  regards  both  the  amount  of  fixed compensation and the amounts of annual and long-term compensation  at  targets  achieved  and  the  maximum amounts  in  the  event  that  these  targets  are  exceeded. Within  the  framework  of  this  policy,  the  Chief  Executive Officer  receives  benefits  in  kind  whose  scope  has remained unchanged since 2018.\n\nThe compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2023 financial year was set pursuant to the framework for the policy set in 2018 and was approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023. Note that the European Commission's decision of April 5, 2021 on case No.SA.59913  relating  to  the  recapitalization  of  Air  France and Air France-KLM provided that no variable compensation could be paid to the Chief Executive Officer until  such  time  as  at  least  75%  of  the  recapitalization measures  had  been  repaid.  As  a  result,  no  variable compensation was paid to Mr. Benjamin Smith between April 2021 and March 2023. The repayment of 75% of the State Aid took place on March 17, 2023.\n\nFor more details on the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2023 financial year, see section 2.5.3.2 of the 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\nA summary of the elements of compensation for the Chief Executive Officer since 2018 is presented in section 2.5.2.6 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Elements of compensation paid during or granted in respect of the 2023 financial year\n\nThe  elements  of  compensation  paid  during  the  2023 financial year or granted in respect of this financial year to the  Chief  Executive  Officer  were  set  by  the  Board  of Directors  at  its  meeting  on  February  16,  2023  as recommended  by  the  Remuneration  Committee.  In particular, in view of the European Commission's decision of  April  5,  2021  on  case  No.SA.59913  relating  to  the recapitalization of Air France and Air France-KLM, during its meeting of February 16, 2023 the Board stipulated that variable  compensation  would  be  granted  to  the  Chief Executive Officer of Air France-KLM in respect of the 2023 financial  year  subject  to  the  repayment  of  75%  of  the recapitalization measures. Since the repayment of 75% of the State Aid took place on March 17, 2023, the restrictions in  respect  of  the  European  Commission's  decision  of April 5, 2021 on case No.SA.59913 are no longer applicable and the condition precedent of the repayment of 75% of the  State  Aid  foreseen  for  the  granting  of  the  variable compensation to the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2023 financial year has been satisfied. As a result, the elements  of  compensation  granted  in  respect  of  the preceding financial years were able to be paid during the 2023  financial  year,  namely  the  2021  and  2022  annual variable  compensation  and  the  2020-22  Specific  LongTerm Incentive Plan.",

In  respect  of  the  2022 and 2023 financial years, performance units were granted to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  within  the  framework  of  a Specific Long-Term Incentive Plan, payable in shares.\n\nIt  is  stipulated  that,  during  its  meeting  of  October  27, 2022, the Board of Directors decided, as proposed by the Remuneration  Committee,  to  adjust  these  long-term compensation  plans  (all  the  plans  granted  but  not  yet exercised on the date of the decision) following the capital increase with maintained preferential subscription rights for shareholders realized on June 16, 2022 and, as a result, to  multiply  by  2.5  the  number  of  performance  units granted in respect of these plans.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the regulations  governing  long-term  incentive  plans  and  in application  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  decision  of August  31,  2023  to  proceed  with  a  reverse  split  in Air France-KLM's shares, the 2018-20/2019-21/ 2020-22/2021-23  'Phantom  Shares'  Long-Term  Incentive Plans,  the  2019-21/2021-23  Specific  Long-Term  Incentive Plans  and  the  2022-24  and  2023-25  Performance  Shares Long-Term  Incentive  Plans  were  adjusted  to  take  into account the reverse share split in the shares composing the share capital on the basis of 10 old shares for one new share, effective since August 31, 2023, by dividing by 10 the number  of  shares  to  which  the  aforementioned  plans confer  entitlement  (NB:  the  2020-22  Specific  Long-Term Incentive Plan having been converted into shares in June 2023 prior to the reverse share split is not concerned by this decision).\n\nFor  more  detail  on  the  elements  of  long-term  variable compensation in respect of the preceding financial years, see  section  2.5.2.2  of  the  2022  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nIt is also stipulated that:\n\n- \u25a0 concerning the Long-Term Incentive Plan ('phantom shares') ,  in  respect  of  the  2021-23  period, 119,313  performance  units  were  granted  to  the  Chief Executive Officer valued at \u20ac1,000,000, payable in cash in  2024  subject  to  the  realization  of  the  performance conditions and  a  three-year  presence  condition, excepting exercise by the Chief Executive Officer of his right to defer payment for a maximum of three years.\n\nIt  is  stipulated  that,  in  application  of  the  Board  of Directors' resolution of October 27, 2022, the number of performance  units  granted  in  2021  was  multiplied  by 2.5.  In  application  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's decision  of  August  31,  2023  to  proceed  with  a  reverse split in Air France-KLM  shares,  the  number  of performance  units  granted  in  2021  was  subsequently divided by 10. As a result, the number of performance\n\nunits  acquired  in  respect  of  the  2021  financial  year  is: 48,828.\n\nDuring its meeting of February 28, 2024, the Board of Directors  decided,  as  proposed  by  the  Remuneration Committee,  to  set  the  level  of  achievement  of  the performance conditions of the plan at an overall 52.8%, this overall figure including the achievement at:\n\n- \u00b7 116.67%  of  the  condition  linked  to  the  Net  debt/ EBITDA ratio (35%) compared with the budget at the end of a three-year period (2023),\n- \u00b7 33% of the condition linked to the EBITDA relative to the EBITDA of companies in the sector, and\n- \u00b7 0%  of  the  condition  linked  to  the  Dow  Jones Sustainability Index for airlines.\n\nAs  a  result, as proposed  by  the  Remuneration Committee,  during  its  meeting  on  February  28,  2024 the Board of Directors set the number of performance units acquired by the Chief Executive Officer in respect of this plan for the 2021 financial year at 25,795 units.\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-34  of  the Code  de Commerce ,  the  payment of these 25,795 performance units is subject to the prior approval of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIt  is  specified that, in 2024, the Chief Executive Officer will  be  able  to  exercise  his  right  to  payment  of  these performance units within a maximum period of three years.  The  amount  to  be  paid  in  respect  of  these performance units will be calculated with reference to the  share  price  following  the  announcement  of  the results  for  the  financial  year  preceding  the  year  in which  the  payment  must  in  principle  take  place  in application of the applicable plan.\n\n- \u25a0 concerning the Specific Long-Term Incentive Plan: in respect of the 2021-23 period: 195,313 performance units were granted to the Chief Executive Officer valued at \u20ac1,000,000,  payable  in  shares  in  2024  subject  to  the attainment of the performance conditions and a threeyear presence condition.\n\nIt  is  stipulated  that,  in  application  of  the  Board  of Directors' resolution of October 27, 2022, the number of performance  units  granted  in  2021  was  multiplied  by 2.5.  In  application  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's decision  of  August  31,  2023  to  proceed  with  a  reverse split in Air France-KLM's  shares,  the  number  of performance  units  granted  in  2021  was  subsequently divided by 10. As a result, the number of performance units  acquired  in  respect  of  the  2021  financial  year  is: 48,828.\n\nAs proposed by the Remuneration Committee, during its meeting of February 28, 2024 the Board of Directors noted  the  level  of  achievement  of  the  performance conditions  of  the  plan  which  stood  at  an  overall  48% this overall figure including the achievement at:\n\n- \u00b7 36%  of  the  condition  linked  to  the  relative  COI  of Air France-KLM, and\n- \u00b7 78% of the condition linked to the CSR targets.\n\nAs  a  result, as proposed  by  the  Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors set the number of performance  units  payable  in  shares  to  the  Chief Executive Officer at 23,437 units.\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-34  of  the Code  de Commerce ,  the payment of these 23,437 performance units is  subject  to  prior  approval  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting.",

It  sets  forth,  for  the  Company's  last  five financial years, the ratios between the level of compensation  for  the  executive  officers  and,  firstly,  the average compensation on a full-time equivalent base for employees  of  the  Company  other  than  the  company officers and, secondly, the median compensation on a fulltime equivalent base for employees of the Company other than the company officers.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nCompensation of the Company officers\n\nThe  following  ratios  have  been  calculated  based  on  the annualized fixed and variable compensation paid during the relevant financial years.\n\nSince  the  Company  Air  France-KLM  does  not  include  a representative number of employees during the relevant period (fewer than 20% of the staff in France), a broader scope  has  been  used  ('relevant  scope')  consisting  of Air  France  employees  on  permanent  contracts  (except expatriate and seconded staff) in France, present and paid throughout  the  year  on  a  full-time  basis,  representing more than 80% of the headcount in France.\n\n|                                                                                                                         | 2019  Financial  Year   | 2020  Financial  Year (1)   | 2021  Financial  Year   | 2022  Financial  Year   | 2023  Financial  Year   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Ratio with average employee compensation  in the relevant scope                                                         | 3.39                    | 3.22                        | 3.68                    | 3.36                    | 2.99                    |\n| Ratio with median employee compensation  in the relevant scope                                                          | 4.42                    | 4.18                        | 4.72                    | 4.35                    | 3.95                    |\n| CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (BENJAMIN SMITH)  Gross data                                                                    |                         |                             |                         |                         |                         |\n| Ratio with average employee compensation  in the relevant scope                                                         | 38.78                   | 30.61                       | 20.24                   | 18.31                   | 56.12                   |\n| Ratio with median employee compensation  in the relevant scope                                                          | 50.57                   | 39.63                       | 25.96                   | 23.69                   | 74.23                   |\n| CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (BENJAMIN SMITH) Data restated for the deferred annual variable compensation in respect of 2021 |                         |                             |                         |                         |                         |\n| Ratio with average employee compensation  in the relevant scope                                                         | 38.78                   | 30.61                       | 20.24                   | 18.31                   | 41.05                   |\n| Ratio with median employee compensation  in the relevant scope                                                          | 50.57                   | 39.63                       | 25.96                   | 23.69                   | 54.3                    |\n\nThe ratios with the average and median compensation of employees in  the  relevant  scope  are  significantly  higher with respect of the 2023 financial year as the lifting of the restrictions  linked  to  the  repayment  of  State  Aid  on March 17, 2023 enabled the payment of the compensation granted  in  respect  of  the  preceding  financial  years  (see section 2.5.2.2 of this Universal Registration Document).\n\nDetail  on  the  elements  used  to  calculate  the  ratios presented above:\n\n- \u25a0 2019 Financial Year:\n- \u00b7 the  annual  variable  compensation  of  the  Chief Executive Officer paid in 2019 in respect of 2018 has been  annualized  based  on  Mr.  Benjamin  Smith's compensation  in  his  capacity  as  Chief  Executive Officer for the period  from  September  17  to December 31, 2018;\n- \u25a0 2020 Financial Year:\n- \u00b7 note that, on March 19, 2020, the Chair of the Board of  Directors  waived  the  application  in  the  2020 financial  year  of  the  increase  to  her  annual  fixed\n\ncompensation  set  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on February 19, 2020. Her annual gross fixed compensation was thus \u20ac200,000 in respect of her functions for 2020. Furthermore, the Chair submitted her  fixed  compensation  paid  during  the  2020 financial year to the same wage modalities as those applied to all the Air France and Air France-KLM SA employees  (notably  its  reduction  pro  rata  temporis for  the  periods  of  partial  activity  applied  to  all  the employees),\n\n- \u00b7 note  that,  on  March  19,  2020,  the  Chief  Executive Officer informed the Board of Directors of his decision to  submit  his  fixed  compensation,  paid  during  the 2020 financial year, to the same wage modalities as those  applied  to  all  the  Air  France  and  Air  FranceKLM  SA  employees  (notably  the  reduction  of  the payment pro rata temporis for the periods of partial activity  applied  to  all  the  employees  for  2020).  In practice, his annual fixed compensation was reduced by 25% between March 23 and December 31, 2020;\n\n<!-- image -->",

As requested by  the  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  this  amount does not take into account the increase in her annual\n\n- gross fixed compensation (from \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac220,000) which had been decided by the Board of Directors on February 16, 2020,\n- \u00b7 note  that,  pursuant  to  the  European  Commission's decision of April 5, 2021 on case No.SA.59913 relating to  the  recapitalization  of  Air  France  and  Air  FranceKLM, no variable compensation could be paid to the Chief Executive Officer until such time as at least 75% of  the  recapitalization  measures  had  been  repaid. Since 75% of the State Aid was repaid on March 17, 2023, the annual variable compensation for the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2021 financial year and the long-term variable compensation in respect of  the  2020  financial  year  for  the  2020-22  Specific Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  was  paid  to  the  Chief Executive Officer during the 2023 financial year.\n\n## 2.5.2.4  Change in the compensation policy\n\nThis  section  has  been  established  pursuant  to  the provisions of Article L. 22-10-9, I, paragraph 7 of the Code de  Commerce and  to  the  AFEP  guidelines  updated  in February 2021.

amount of compensation linked to the  performance  during  the  previous  financial  year potentially reaching 122% of the fixed compensation at targets achieved and up to 150% in the event that the

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nCompensation of the Company officers\n\n## 2.5.3 Compensation policy for the Company officers in respect of 2024\n\nThis  section  has  been  established  pursuant  to  Articles L.  22-10-8 and R. 22-10-14 of the Code de Commerce and outlines  the  elements  composing  the  compensation policy for the company officers in respect of 2024.\n\nAs  recommended by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors has taken into account the vote of the Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023 on the compensation for the executive officers in respect of the 2022 financial year to determine the 2024 compensation policy for the company officers.\n\nEstablished  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  as  recommended by the Remuneration Committee and consistent with the provisions  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the  compensation policy  for  the  company  officers  of  Air  France-KLM  in respect of the 2024 financial year:\n\n- \u25a0 complies  with  the  Company's  corporate  interests ( int\u00e9r\u00eat  socia l)  in  that  it  enables  qualified  company officers  to  be  attracted  and  retained  while  being adapted  to  the  responsibilities  of  the  beneficiary  and consistent with the practices in comparable companies;\n- \u25a0 is  aligned  with  its  commercial  strategy  in  that  it  is composed  of  a  long-term  variable  portion  giving  the executive directors an interest in the Company's results and  adapted  as  a  function  of  the  strategic  priorities; and\n- \u25a0 contributes to the Company's long-term sustainability in  that  it  is  always  aligned  with  the  interests  of shareholders.\n\nThis  policy  is  subject  to  an  annual  review  by  the Remuneration Committee. The work of the Remuneration Committee  takes  into  account  the  examination  of benchmarking  studies  carried  out  with  the  help  of external  consultants  to  compare  this  policy  with  the practices in comparable companies. The Committee also ensures that the compensation policy is aligned with the Company's  strategy.  On  the  basis  of  this  work,  the Committee  formulates  recommendations  for  the  Board which  then  sets  the  compensation  policy  on  an  annual basis.\n\nAs  recommended  by  the  Remuneration  Committee, during the establishment of the compensation policy for company  officers,  the  Board  of  Directors  takes  into account the remuneration and employment conditions of Air  France-KLM's  employees.  As  for  all  the  employees  of Air  France-KLM,  the  Board  of  Directors  ensures  the implementation of a simple, understandable and consistent  compensation  policy  in  a  fair  manner  for  the company officers. The Board of Directors takes particular care that,  at  their  individual  level,  all  the  employees  and company officers have the material resources required for the fulfillment of their respective duties.\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors stipulate that any  Board  director  in  a  situation  of  conflict  of  interests, even  potential,  must  inform  the  Board  of  Directors  and\n\nabstain from attending the debate or participating in the vote  for  the  corresponding  deliberation.  The  executive officers thus are not present during the discussions of the Board  of  Directors  and  the  Remuneration  Committee regarding their own compensation.\n\nShould  a  new  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  a  new Chief  Executive  Officer  be  appointed,  the  elements  of compensation  foreseen  in  the  compensation  policy  for company  officers would also apply to them. As recommended  by  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the Board  of  Directors  will  then  determine,  while  adapting them to the situation of the interested parties, the targets, levels of performance, parameters, structure and maximum  percentages  relative  to  their  annual  fixed compensation  which  may  not  be  higher  than  those approved by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe  2024  compensation  policy  for  the  company  officers outlines all the components of the fixed and, as necessary, variable compensation for Board directors (section  2.5.3.1  hereinafter);  the  Chair  of  the  Board  of Directors  (section  2.5.3.2  a.  hereinafter);  and  the  Chief Executive  Officer  (section  2.5.3.2  b.  hereinafter),  and explains the decision-making process for its establishment, review and implementation.\n\nThis  2024  compensation  policy  for  the  company  officers will  be  the  subject  of  a  draft  resolution  submitted  for approval  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  5,  2024 under the conditions provided for in Article  L.  22-10-8  of the Code de Commerce and on any material amendment to the compensation policy.\n\n## 2.5.3.1  Compensation for the Board directors in respect of 2024\n\nSubject to approval of the 2024 compensation policy for the  company  officers  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of June  5,  2024,  the  Board  directors  of  Air  France-KLM  will receive,  in  respect  of  their  Board  directors'  mandates, compensation  (formerly  directors'  fees)  amounting  to  a maximum  amount  which  was  set  at  \u20ac950,000  for  the entire Board of Directors.\n\nThe compensation for Board directors shall be composed of a flat-rate amount of compensation, with an additional portion  calculated  as  a  function  of  their  respective attendance records, whose modalities for distribution and granting are set by the Board of Directors, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThese allocation rules are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 \u20ac15,000 in flat-rate compensation;\n- \u25a0 \u20ac25,000  of  compensation  based  on  their  individual attendance  records  at  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors and at Shareholders' Meetings; and\n- \u25a0 a  sum  of  additional  compensation  is  also  granted  to non-resident Board directors (\u20ac7,000).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  additional amount will be calculated pro rata temporis based on the attendance  records  of  the  individual  Board  directors  at these extraordinary meetings.\n\nThe Board directors (non-executive company officers) will not be able to benefit from:\n\n- \u25a0 a  long-term  incentive  plan  or  specific  long-term incentive plan;\n- \u25a0 benefits in kind which are not linked to their duties;\n- \u25a0 an employment contract;\n- \u25a0 a non-compete indemnity;\n- \u25a0 an award of stock-options or free shares.\n\n## Modalities for the granting and payment of the compensation (formerly directors' fees) to representatives of the State and Board directors appointed as proposed by the French State\n\nThe allocation  rules  for  compensation  paid  to  the  Board directors  outlined  above  are  applicable  to  the  State representatives  and  to  the  Board  directors  appointed  as proposed by the French State.\n\nPursuant  to  Ordinance  No.  2014-948  of  August  20,  2014 and  Article  1  of  the  ministerial  decree  of  December  18, 2014, as amended by the ministerial decree of January 5, 2018, the following rules apply:\n\n- \u25a0 for  Board  directors  appointed  directly  by  the  French State, 100% of the compensation is paid to the French State (Article 5 of the Ordinance);\n- \u25a0 for  Board  directors  appointed  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State (Article 6 of the Ordinance), there are two separate cases:\n- \u00b7 for  public  officials  of  the  French  State,  100%  of  the compensation is paid to the State,\n- \u00b7 for those not acting in the capacity of public officials, the  payment  of  the  compensation  is  shared  as follows:\n- -15% paid to the State, and\n- -85%  paid  directly  to  the  relevant  Board  director (with  the  application  of  the  social  and  tax charges).\n\n## 2.5.3.2  Compensation of the executive officers in respect of 2024\n\nBased  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration Committee,  the  compensation  packages  of  the  Chair  of the Board of Directors and of the Chief Executive Officer are  set  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nPursuant to the Internal Rules,  as  recommended by the Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  also approves  the  compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive Officers of the principal subsidiaries (Air France and KLM). Furthermore, the Remuneration  Committee  makes recommendations to the Chief Executive Officer regarding  the  compensation  of  the  Group's  Chief Financial  Officer  and  reviews  the  compensation  of  the members of the KLM Managing Board.\n\nThese compensation policies establish the principles and criteria for determining, allocating and granting the fixed, variable  and  extraordinary  components  of  the  total compensation and benefits of any kind awarded, firstly, to the Chair of the Board of Directors and, secondly, to the Chief Executive Officer, as well as their relative scale. All of these  elements  are  detailed  in  this  section  in  point  a) relating  to  the  mandate  of  the  Chair  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  b)  relating  to  the  mandate  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Articles L. 22-10-8 and R. 22-10-14 of the Code de Commerce .",

Her Board  director  mandate  was  renewed  during  the Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  26,  2020  for  a  four-year term  of  office,  i.e.  until  the  end  of  the  Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending December 31, 2023. The renewal of  her  Board  director  mandate  for  a  one-year  term  of office,  i.e.  until  the  end  of  the  Shareholders'  Meeting convened  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the financial year ending  December  31,  2024,  will  be submitted  to  the  shareholder  vote  at  the  Shareholders' Meeting  of  June  5,  2024.  Ms.  Anne-Marie  Couderc  was appointed  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors  from  May  15, 2018 and until June 5, 2024. Her mandate as Chair of the Board of Directors was renewed for one additional year by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors during its meeting of December 7, 2023, subject to approval by the shareholders during the Shareholders' Meeting of June 5, 2024  of  the  amendment  to  Article  26  of  the  Company's Articles  of  Incorporation  stipulating  that,  when  the  age limit  for  the  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors  is  reached during the course of his or  her  Board  director  mandate, the  latter  will  continue  to  exercise  his  or  her  duties  as Chair of the Board of Directors until the end of his or her Board  director  mandate.  The  Chair  of  the  Board  of Directors may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors.  Ms.  Anne-Marie  Couderc  has  no  employment contract  binding  her  to  the  Company  or  another company within the Group.\n\nDuring  its  meeting  of  February  28,  2024,  the  Board  of Directors  defined,  as  proposed  by  the  Remuneration Committee,  the  structure  of  the  compensation  to  be granted  to  the  Chair  of  the  Air  France-KLM  Board  of Directors in respect of the 2024 financial year.\n\n## Annual compensation (fixed and variable)\n\n## Description of the annual fixed and variable elements\n\nFollowing an analysis of remuneration practices in a panel of  comparable CAC 40 and Next 20 companies in which the French State is a minority shareholder, which showed that the current remuneration of the Chair of the Board of Directors  is  well  below  market  practice,  the  Board  of Directors decided at its meeting on February 28, 2024, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, to increase the gross annual fixed remuneration to \u20ac350,000. It should be noted that on March 28, 2024, the Chair of the Board, while acknowledging the need to set this  level  of  remuneration  for  the  position,  informed  the Board of her position, consisting, for her last year in office, of remaining at the level of fixed remuneration of recent years.  Accordingly,  her  gross  fixed  annual  remuneration will be \u20ac200,000 for the year 2024.\n\nNote that a revised amount of annual fixed compensation for  the  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors  had  been  set  at \u20ac220,000 by the Board of Directors on February 19, 2020 but  the  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors  had  waived  this increase  in  respect  of  the  2020  and  2021  financial  years and this increase was not applied in respect of the 2022 financial year in compliance with the European Commission's decision of April 5, 2021 on case No.  SA59913 relating to the recapitalization of Air  France and Air-France-KLM which stipulates that the\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nCompensation of the Company officers\n\ncompensation of the Chair of the Board of Directors may not  exceed  the  fixed  portion  of  her  compensation  at December 31, 2019. For the 2023 financial year, the Board of  Directors  decided,  as  requested  by  the  Chair  of  the Board  of  Directors,  to  set  her  level  of  compensation  at \u20ac200,000 without  applying  the  increase  decided  by  the Board of Directors on February 19, 2020.

His  Board  director  mandate  was renewed during the Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023 for  a  four-year  term  of  office,  i.e.  until  the  end  of  the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements  for  the  financial  year  ending  December  31, 2026. The term of his mandate as Chief Executive Officer is five years. It was renewed early on March 30, 2022, i.e. until the  end  of  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  convened  to approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  financial  year ending  December  31,  2026.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer may, however, be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors.  Mr.  Benjamin  Smith  has  no  employment contract with the Company or any other company within the Group.\n\nNote  that,  given  the  adoption  of  the  Group's  new governance  during  2018,  and  in  view  of  the  profile  and international  experience  of  Mr.  Benjamin  Smith,  Chief Executive  Officer  of  Air  France-KLM  as  of  September  17, 2018, the Air France-KLM  Board  of  Directors  had considered  it  necessary  to  modify  the  structure  of  the compensation  of  the  Group's  Chief  Executive  Officer which had been approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May  15,  2018  and  which  had  de  facto  become inapplicable.\n\n- It is specified  that,  to  determine  the  elements  of compensation  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the Air France-KLM Board of Directors referred to a sample of compensation  in  place  in  comparable  international groups.\n\nThe compensation structure set by the Board of Directors in August 2018 remained unchanged for the 2019 to 2023 financial  years.  It  is  however  stipulated  that,  in  2022,  the two long-term incentive plans  (one  payable  in  cash  and the  other  payable  in  shares)  were  replaced  by  a  single long-term  incentive  plan  (payable  in  shares)  without changing the overall amount of the long-term compensation  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.  This adaptation  was  aimed  at  simplifying  the  plans  in  place and making them consistent with the market practices, and  reinforcing  the  link  with  shareholders'  interests around the Group's strategic goals.\n\nAs  recommended  by  the  Remuneration  Committee,  for the 2024 financial year, the Board of Directors decided to change the structure  of  the  compensation  for  the  Chief Executive  Officer.  This  new  compensation  structure  will apply until the end of the Chief Executive Officer's current mandate.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  took  a  number  of  factors  into consideration, and in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 the  profile,  experience  and  expertise  of  Mr.  Benjamin Smith: Mr.  Benjamin  Smith  is  an  internationallyrecognized leader in the air transport industry, having spent 20 years with Air Canada. Since his arrival in 2018, he has put his expertise at the Group's service with the help of his strategic vision of the market and his ability to anticipate the exit from the health crisis.\n\n- Mr.  Benjamin  Smith  has  also  played  a  key  role  in maintaining  the  Group's  social  stability.  Mr.  Benjamin Smith  has  also  distinguished  himself  by  placing  the deployment of sustainable development at the heart of his strategy;\n- \u25a0 the  analysis  of  the  compensation  practices  in comparable  companies: the  study  carried  out  by  an independent external consultant (Heidrick & Struggles) on the compensation practices for similar functions in a  sample of CAC 40 and Next 20 companies with the French  State  as  a  minority  shareholder,  as  well  as  in Air  France-KLM's  main  European  and  international competitors,  showed  that  Mr  Benjamin  Smith's  total target and maximum compensation is lower than the market  practices  and  is  positioned  as  follows:  compa ratio  (Mr.  Benjamin  Smith's  compensation  compared with  the  median  compensation  of  the  relevant benchmark) of 56% in total target compensation (fixed, annual variable and long-term variable) and a compa ratio  of  49%  in  total  maximum  compensation  relative to  the  CEOs  of  the  main  European  and  international competitors  (including  Lufthansa  and  IAG).  The  study also highlighted that the compensation of CAC40 and Next  20  CEOs  has  increased  by  an  annual  average  of more than 3% between 2018 and the present day;\n- \u25a0 the change in the Group's profile and its transformation  generating  operating  performance and  value  creation: since  joining  the  Group  in  2018, Mr. Benjamin Smith has made a major contribution to the  Group's  transformation  based  on  an  ambitious strategy,  bringing  Air  France-KLM's  profitability  closer into line with that of its competitors.\n\nDespite  the  global  pandemic  having  had  a  severe impact for three years running, the Group succeeded in  achieving  the  highest  sales  figures  in  its  history  by 2023. The Group's transformation has also enabled it to position its  unit  costs  below  those  of  the  competition while  maintaining  a  similar  level  of  unit  revenues despite an inflationary context;\n\n- \u25a0 average increase of 16% in the compensation (based only on the general increases applied) of Air France Group employees between 2019 and 2024 recorded based on the geographies where Air France operates and  the  annual  negotiations  with  the  unions: it  is specified  that  the  compensation  for  Air  France  Group employees increased by 13.5% on average between 2019 and 2023, followed by 2.5% in 2024.\n\nIn the light of these various factors, as recommended by the  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors decided to change certain components of the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 increase the annual fixed compensation to \u20ac1,044,000, i.e. an increase of 16%;\n- \u25a0 increase the target annual variable compensation from 122% to 150% of the annual fixed compensation;\n- \u25a0 increase the maximum annual variable compensation from 150% to 180% of the annual fixed compensation;\n- \u25a0 the long-term variable compensation remains unchanged.",

This  compensation  structure  is  composed of  an  amount  of  fixed  compensation  representing  22.6% of  Mr.  Benjamin  Smith's  total  compensation,  annual variable  compensation  representing  34%  of  his  total compensation  and  long-term  variable  compensation representing 43.4% of his total compensation. More than 75% of Mr.  Benjamin Smith's total  annual  compensation thus depends  on  the  achievement  of  demanding performance conditions.\n\nThe performance criteria linked to the variable compensation  within  the  framework  of  the  2024 compensation  and  the  levels  of  performance  and achievement  percentages  of  these  criteria  were  set pursuant to the Board resolutions of February 28, 2024, as recommended by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## STRUCTURE OF THE COMPENSATION FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF AIR FRANCE-KLM IN RESPECT OF THE 2024 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) 150% of the fixed compensation on achievement of the targets potentially rising to 180% should the targets be exceeded.\n- (2) A long-term incentive plan conferring the right to the granting of performance units corresponding to an amount of \u20ac2,000,000.\n- (3) Amount of \u20ac1,044,000.\n\n## Annual compensation (fixed and variable)\n\n## Description of the annual fixed and variable elements\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer will benefit from annual gross fixed  compensation  of  \u20ac1,044,000,  representing  a  16% increase relative to his previous level set in 2018 and from annual gross variable compensation varying between 0% and  150%  of  the  annual  gross  fixed  compensation  at targets  partially  achieved  (calculated  on  a  linear  basis), and potentially reaching a maximum of 180% in the event the targets are exceeded (calculated on a linear basis).\n\nThe performance criteria which were set by the Board of Directors during its meeting of February 28, 2024, are 60% linked  to  performance  and  the  Group's  financial  targets, and  40%  are  criteria  linked  to  non-financial  targets,  of which half are quantitative.

Accordingly, a new long-term incentive plan applicable to the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  to  a  number  of  the Group's  other  executives  and  employees  has  been established pursuant to the Board of Directors resolution of  February 28, 2024. During its meeting of February 28, 2024, the Board of Directors decided to establish a longterm  incentive  plan  applicable  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer  with  the  same  main  characteristics  as  the  longterm  incentive  plan  established  in  2022.  This  decision  is aimed at the stability of the conditions applicable to the compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer and consistency  with  market  practices.  However,  during  its meeting  of  February  28,  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors decided to modify and simplify the performance criteria while  increasing  the  proportion  of  CSR  criteria,  in particular those relating to climate change, and providing for more quantitative criteria.\n\nIn respect of this plan, the Chief Executive Officer is thus granted performance units on an annual basis corresponding  to  an  amount  of  \u20ac2  million,  payable  in shares at the end of a three-year vesting period following the grant, subject to the attainment of specific\n\nperformance conditions, evaluated over the whole of this period, and with a maximum of 100% over three years. The payment  of  the  performance  units  is  also  subject  to  a three-year  presence  condition,  except  in  the  event  of death  or  disability  (without  performance  conditions),  or retirement  departure  or  in  some  cases  of  forced termination (the performance  conditions  remaining applicable). It  is  specified  that  one  performance  unit  will confer the right to one Air France-KLM share.\n\nThe  number  of  performance  units  granted  each  year  is calculated with reference to the Air France-KLM opening share  price  on  April  1  of  the  grant  year.  The  payment  of these  performance  units  (subject  to  performance  and presence  conditions)  is  made  in  Air  France-KLM  shares (one performance unit conferring the right to one share). The Board of Directors reserves the option, instead of the granting  of  units,  to  grant  an  equivalent  number  of performance  shares  with  the  same  performance  and presence conditions.\n\nAt its meeting of February 28, 2024, the Board of Directors thus  set  demanding  performance  conditions  for  the evaluation,  as  necessary,  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's long-term performance for the eventual granting of this long-term variable compensation as described below, and the levels of performance and the achievement percentages for these criteria.\n\n## Vesting of a % of the grant with a maximum of 100% over 3 years\n\n|                                                                                                     | Performance                   |                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 1.

It  is  specified  that  the  instance  of forced  termination  enabling  the  implementation  of  this severance pay excludes any situation of serious misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEPMEDEF  Code,  the  basis  of  the  severance  payment  is equivalent  to  two  years  of  his  annual  fixed  and  variable compensation  (based  on  specific  calculation  methods referring, as applicable, to the target variable in the event of a termination during the first 24 months).\n\nA  coefficient  (between  0  and  100%  inclusive)  will  be applied to the basis of the severance payment based on the performance of the interested party with reference to the level of the achievement of the performance criteria relating to the  annual  variable  component  of  his compensation  over  the  two  last  financial  years  of  his mandate  (or  since  his  appointment,  in  the  event  of termination  during  the  first  24  months).  The  Board  of Air  France-KLM  will  be  responsible  for  evaluating  the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer will also benefit from the usual benefits in kind (chauffeur-driven company car, supplementary  pension  scheme  applicable  to  all  the managerial-level  employees  in  France,  a  supplementary health insurance and disability scheme, provision of free airline  tickets,  Group  CEO  civil  liability  insurance  -  D&O) and benefits consistent with the policy applied within the Group for senior executive expatriation and mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  specified  that,  since  he  assumed  his functions  within  the  Group  in  2018,  the  Chief  Executive Officer has benefited only from a mandatory pension plan.\n\nAfter analyzing the compensation practices of comparable  companies  in  terms  of  pension  plans,  the 2024  compensation  policy,  approved  by  the  Board  of Directors  on  February  28,  2024,  provides  that  the  Chief Executive  Officer  will  benefit  from  a  supplementary pension plan comprising a mandatory definedcontribution pension plan in accordance with Article 83 of the  French  General  Tax  Code  ( Plan  \u00c9pargne  Retraite Obligatoire - PERO) and an optional defined-contribution pension plan in accordance with Article 82 of the French General Tax Code, set up as of January 1, 2024.\n\n## \u25a0 Mandatory defined-contribution pension plan - PERO\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  will  benefit  from  the defined-contribution  pension  plan  (Article  83  of  the French General Tax Code) set up as of January 1, 2024 to  the  benefit  of  the  executive  officers  and  the members of the Group Executive Committee.\n\nThe components will represent:\n\n- \u00b7 an annual component as outlined hereinafter:\n- 5% of annual gross compensation up to a maximum of  8  times  the  annual  social  security  ceilings,  100% paid by the Company,\n- The Chief Executive Officer will benefit from this plan under  the  same  conditions  as  the  other  executive officers and  members  of  the  Group  Executive Committee,\n- \u00b7 an extraordinary component to take into account the seniority of the Chief Executive Officer, who has been with  the  Group  since  2018  and  has  not  benefited from  a  supplementary  pension  plan  to  date.  The amount  of  this  specific  net  contribution  would  be \u20ac22,000. It is calculated according to the same rules as  those  outlined  for  the  annual  component  of  the plan and based on the compensation received by the Chief Executive  Officer  since  he  assumed  his functions. Since this extraordinary element  of compensation constitutes an element of extraordinary compensation, it will only be able to be paid  in  the  event  of  approval  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting of the elements of compensation granted in respect  of  the  2024  financial  year  (ex-post  vote) pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-34  of  the Code  de Commerce;\n\n## \u25a0 Optional defined-contribution pension plan\n\n- The  Chief  Executive  Officer  will  benefit  from  the optional  defined-contribution  pension  plan  (Article  82 of the French General Tax Code) set up as of January 1, 2024  to  the  benefit  of  the  executive  officers  and  the members of the Group Executive Committee.\n\nThis plan will provide for the payment by the Company to  a  third-party  body  of  one  third  of  a  contribution equal to 10.5% of the annual gross compensation (fixed and variable) effectively received.\n\nThe  contributions  paid  in  this  regard  will  not  benefit from  any  preferential  social  or  tax  arrangements.  For this  reason,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  will  receive  a flat-rate allowance  equal  to  the  amount  of  the contribution  paid  on  his  behalf  to  the  insurer.  This indemnity  will  be  paid  at  the  same  time  as  the contribution to the insurer.\n\nThe  amounts  of  the  contributions  and  the  flat-rate allowance will depend on the company's performance, insofar as the calculation base will include the variable portion  of  compensation,  which  will  be  linked  to  the Group's results.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer will benefit from this plan under  the  same  conditions  as  the  other  members  of the Group Executive Committee with French employment contracts.\n\n## g) Adjustment clause in the event of exceptional circumstances\n\nIn  the  event  of  exceptional  circumstances  such  as  a change in accounting standards, a significant change in the consolidation scope, the realization of a transformational  transaction,  a  substantial  change  in market  conditions,  or  an  unforeseen  change  in  the competitive environment with material consequences for the  Group  that  were  unforeseeable  at  the  time  this compensation  policy  was  approved  by  the  Board  of Directors  for  presentation  to  the  Shareholders'  Meeting, the  Board  of  Directors  reserves  the  right  to  exercise  its discretionary power to adjust, either upwards  or downwards, one or more of the parameters attached to the  performance  criteria  (weighting,  trigger  thresholds, objectives,  targets,  etc.)  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's annual or long-term variable compensation. The purpose of  this  adjustment clause is to ensure that the results of the application of the aforementioned criteria reflect the performance of both the Chief Executive Officer and the Group.\n\nThese  adjustments  will  be  decided  by  the  Board  of Directors, as recommended  by  its Remuneration Committee,  and  will  then  be  made  public  on  the Company's website.\n\nNote that this option differs from the one provided for in Article  L22-10-8  III  paragraph  2  of  the  French Code  de Commerce.\n\nThere is no provision for the Board of Directors to depart from  the  present  compensation  policy  in  the  event  of exceptional events other than those mentioned above.\n\n## h) Others\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  will  not  benefit  from  an employment contract, nor from a top-up pension scheme, non-compete indemnity, stock options or free shares.",

Until  April  2, 2016,  each  share  had  one  voting  right  attached.  In application of the Florange Act (1) as  from  April  3,  2016,  in\n\nthe  absence  of  a  provision  to  the  contrary  in  the Air  France-KLM Articles of Incorporation, all fully paid-up shares held in registered form in the name of the same shareholder  for  at  least  two  years  automatically  benefit from  a  double  voting  right.  There  are  no  other  specific rights attached to the shares.\n\n## Changes in the share capital over the last three financial years\n\nThe change in the share capital over the last three financial years is as follows:\n\n| Financial year ended   | Amount of capital  (in \u20ac)   |     | Number of shares   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----|--------------------|\n| December 31, 2021      | 642,634,034                 |     | 642,634,034        |\n| December 31, 2022      | 2,570,536,136               | (1) | 2,570,536,136      |\n| December 31, 2023      | 262,769,869                 | (2) | 262,769,869        |\n\n## Capital increase during the financial year ended December 31, 2021\n\nOn April 6, 2021, the Air France-KLM group announced a series  of  capital-strengthening  measures,  in  the  amount of  \u20ac4  billion,  composed  of  (i)  a  capital  increase  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders by way of a public offering and with a priority subscription period for shareholders  and  (ii)  an  issue  of  deeply  subordinated notes in several tranches, fully subscribed by way of debt compensation by the French State. These measures were authorized by the European Commission on April 5, 2021, as State Aid.\n\nIn this context,  on  April  13,  2021,  Air  France-KLM announced  the  launch  of  a  capital  increase  without shareholders' preferential subscription rights by way of a public offering and with a priority subscription period for shareholders, for a gross amount  (including  issue premium) of \u20ac900,660,867.04 which could, in the event of the exercise in full of the increase option, be increased to a  maximum gross amount (including issue premium) of \u20ac1,035,759,995.16. The capital increase, decided in accordance  with  the  nineteenth  resolution  of  the Company's  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  26,  2020,  was the subject of a prospectus approved by the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers  on  April  13,  2021  under  number 21-0270.  The  subscription  period  for  the  capital  increase closed on April 16, 2021.\n\nOn  April  19,  2021,  Air  France-KLM  announced  the  final results  of  the  capital  increase,  namely  213,999,999  new\n\nshares issued at a unit price of \u20ac4.84, i.e. a total of around \u20ac1,036  million  (after  the  exercise  in  full  of  the  increase option).  The  settlement-delivery  of  the  newly-issued shares took place on April 22, 2021.\n\n## Capital increase during the financial year ended December 31, 2022\n\nSubsequently, on May 24, 2022, Air France-KLM announced  the  launch  of  a  capital  increase  with maintained  preferential  subscription  rights  ('DFS')  to raise  a  gross  amount  of  \u20ac2.256  billion  through  the issuance of 1,928 million new Air France-KLM shares. This transaction,  aimed  at  reinforcing  the  Company's  equity and  balance  sheet,  followed  the  announcement  of  new recapitalization  measures  on  February  17,  2022.  The capital  increase,  decided  pursuant  to  the  Combined Ordinary  and  Extraordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  of May 26, 2021 was the subject of a prospectus filed with the AMF under number D. 22-0236-A01 on May 23, 2022. The trading  period  for  the  preferential  subscription  rights (DFS) was between May 25, 2022 and June 7, 2022 and the subscription  period  for  the  capital  increase  closed  on June 9, 2022.\n\nOn  June  14,  2022,  Air  France-KLM  announced  the  final results  of  the  capital  increase,  namely  1,928  million  new shares  at  a  unit  subscription  price  of  \u20ac1,17,  representing \u20ac2.256  billion.  The  capital  increase  attracted  strong demand  from  both  the  existing  shareholders  and  new investors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nShare capital and shareholder structure\n\nOn June 9, 2022, at the end of the subscription period, the total demand stood at approaching \u20ac2.240 million shares, i.e. close  to  \u20ac2.261  billion.  The  transaction  was  thus oversubscribed with a subscription rate of around 116%:\n\n- \u25a0 1,831,278,510 new  shares  were  subscribed  on  an irreducible  basis  ( \u00e0  titre  irr\u00e9ductible ), representing approximately 95% of the new shares to be issued;\n- \u25a0 orders submitted  on  a  reducible  basis  ( \u00e0 titre r\u00e9ductible )  represented  409,004,428  new  shares  and were therefore only partially allocated for a number of 96,623,592 new shares.\n\nThe gross proceeds of the capital increase, including the issue  premium,  amounted  to  \u20ac2,256  million  (of  which \u20ac1,611  million  subscribed  in  cash)  corresponding  to  the issuance of 1,928 million new shares (the 'New Shares') at a unit subscription price of \u20ac1.17 per share.\n\n## Impact of the capital increase on the breakdown of the share capital\n\nFollowing  the  settlement  and  delivery  for  the  capital increase,  Air  France-KLM's  share  capital  amounted  to 2,570,536,136  shares,  each  with  a  nominal  value  of  one euro.\n\n## Rationale for the capital increase\n\nThis  transaction  concerned  the  implementation  of  new recapitalization  measures,  following  the  capital  increase realized in 2021.\n\n- \u25a0 To free itself from the conditions set by the European Commission's  Covid-19  temporary  framework,  the Company  allocated  around  \u20ac1.7  billion  from  the  net proceeds of the issue to the repayment of the \"Covid-19 recapitalization  aid\"  granted  in  the  form  of  undated deeply subordinated notes to the benefit of the French State (the \"TSS \u00c9tat\") issued in April 2021, through offset and  repayment.  The  remainder  (about  \u20ac0.6  billion) enabled a reduction in net debt.\n- \u25a0 This  operation  marked  a  significant  step  in  the execution  of  the  equity  and  quasi-equity  issuance program  for  a  maximum  of  \u20ac4  billion  destined  to strengthen the balance sheet.\n\n## Subscription by the main shareholders and partners\n\nThe  French  State,  Air  France-KLM's  largest  shareholder, participated on an irreducible basis to the full extent of its DPS rights, corresponding to a subscription to 551,404,728 New Shares. Its shareholding after the completion of the capital  increase  remained  unchanged.  This  subscription was  carried  out  by  way  of  offsetting  a  portion  of  the deeply subordinated notes (TSS Etat) issued in April 2021.\n\nThe  Dutch  State  participated  on  an  irreducible  basis  to the  full  extent  of  its  DPS  rights,  corresponding  to  a subscription to 180,000,000 New Shares. Its shareholding after  the  completion  of  the  capital  increase  remained unchanged.\n\nCMA  CGM,  had  also  participated  in  the  context  of  the implementation  of  the  business  cooperation  for  cargo, with  a  total  shareholding  amounting  to  231,348,252  New Shares, subscribed on an irreducible basis (via the exercise of  the  preferential  subscription  rights  acquired  from China Eastern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and the FCPE employee  mutual  funds  as  well  as  in  the  market)  and corresponding  to  9.0%  of  the  Company's  share  capital after the rights Issue.\n\nChina Eastern Airlines (2) and Delta Air Lines participated in the  capital  increase  on  a  cash-neutral  basis,  for  an aggregate  amount  of  approximately  \u20ac110.7  million  by subscribing to a respective 58,763,343 and 35,873,772 New Shares by using the net proceeds from selling a portion of their  preferential  subscription  rights  to  CMA  CGM.  Their respective  shareholdings  thus  stood  at  4.7%  and  2.9%  of the Company's share capital after the capital increase.\n\nThe  FCPEs  (' Fond  Commun  de  Placement  Entreprise ') participated in the capital increase on a cash-neutral basis through  the  sale  of  a  portion  of  their  preferential subscription  rights  to  the  benefit  of  CMA  CGM,  in  a proportion allowing them to partially finance the exercise of  the  balance  of  their  DPS  rights  by  using  the  net proceeds of this sale.\n\nThe  SPAAK  ( Stichting  Piloten  Aandelen Air France-KLM) participated in the capital increase on a cash-neutral basis by subscribing to new shares through the sale of a portion of its DPS rights.\n\n## Lock-up commitments\n\nCMA  CGM  agreed  with  the  Company  a  lock-up undertaking  as  from  the  settlement-delivery  of  the  new shares until the expiry of a three-year period following this date,  it  being  specified  that  CMA  CGM  could  then  sell  a maximum  of  50%  of  the  shares  acquired  within  the context of the capital increase during an additional threeyear  period.  This  lock-up  commitment  will  automatically end  in  the  event  that  the  commercial  cooperation agreement  is  terminated. In January 2024, these undertakings were modified in the context of the change in the commercial partnership with CMA CGM to provide that  the  initial  lock-up  period  will  end  on  February  28, 2025 with no additional lock-up period.\n\nIn  addition,  CMA  CGM  committed  to  a  10-year  period during which it will not acquire or subscribe to any shares issued by the Company, unless such an acquisition does not lead to an increase of its equity interest in the share capital of the Company, subject to certain exceptions. The undertaking specifies that, at the end of a period of five years as of the settlement-delivery of the new shares, the Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  may  modify  this undertaking  in  order  to  allow  CMA  CGM  to  increase  its shareholding in the Company.",

        "page_content": "## Change in the share capital during the financial year ended December 31, 2023\n\n## Reverse share split and simultaneous reduction in the share capital\n\nOn August 31, 2023, the Air France-KLM group announced the  realization  of  the  reverse  split  in  all  the  outstanding shares  in  the  Company  and  the  simultaneous  capital reduction by decreasing the nominal value of each share, as  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  at  its  meeting  on July  4,  2023  and  pursuant  to  the  extraordinary  36 th and 37 th resolutions of the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023. The realization of these operations was reflected in:\n\n- \u25a0 the  exchange  of  10  ordinary  shares  in  the  Company each  with  a  nominal  value  of  one  euro  for  one  new share  with  a  nominal  value  of  one  euro  (taking  into account  the  simultaneous  capital  reduction  reducing the nominal value of each new share from 10 euros to one euro, i.e. a reduction of 9 euros per share allocated to the 'share premium' account);\n- \u25a0 the  Company's  new  share  capital  of  \u20ac257,053,613 divided into 257,053,613 shares (ISIN Code FR001400J770) each with a nominal value of one euro.\n\nShareholders  who  did  not  hold  a  number  of  shares making  a  multiple  of  ten  were  compensated  for  their remaining fractional shares by their financial intermediaries  within  a  maximum  30-day  period,  i.e. before October 2, 2023.\n\nFollowing the reverse share split,  and  as  decided  by  the Chief Executive Officer on August 31, 2023, the conversion ratios (i) for the undated deeply subordinated unsecured bonds convertible  into  new  shares  and/or  exchangeable for existing shares in a nominal amount of \u20ac305.3 million by  way  of  a  placement  with  qualified  investors  on November 16, 2022 (the \"Hybrid Convertible Bonds\") and (ii)  the  bonds  convertible  into  and/or  exchangeable  for new or existing shares (OCEANEs) issued in the amount of \u20ac500  million  in  March  2019  and  maturing  in  2026  (the \"Oc\u00e9anes  2026\"),  were  adjusted  in  accordance  with  the following  terms,  which  were  set  out  in  a  notice  of adjustment  published  in  the Bulletin  des  Annonces L\u00e9gales Obligatoire s:\n\n- \u25a0 adjustment  in  the  conversion  ratio  for  the  Hybrid Convertible Bonds:  the  new  conversion  ratio  is 6,549.6463 new shares per Hybrid Convertible Bond;\n- \u25a0 adjustment in the exercise parity for the Oc\u00e9anes 2026: the new ratio is 0.178 new shares for each Oc\u00e9ane 2026.\n\n## Capital increase reserved to the Group's employees\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nShare capital and shareholder structure\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  this  transaction,  around  17,000 employees from 19 countries, representing nearly 22% of the  relevant  employees,  subscribed  to  the  'Partners  for the  Future'  offer,  enabling  them  to  invest  in  Air  FranceKLM shares under preferential conditions.\n\nThe  total  amount  subscribed  stood  at  \u20ac46,073,029, corresponding  to  the  issuance  of  5,716,256  new  shares each  with  a  nominal  value  of  one  euro.  The  Company's share  capital  was  thus  de  facto  increased  by  \u20ac5,716,256 from \u20ac257,053,613 to \u20ac262,769,869.\n\nAt the end of this issue, the employee shareholding in the Air  France-KLM  share  capital  within  the  meaning  of Article  L.  225-102  of  the  French Code  de  Commerce amounted  to  3.22%.  Employee  shareholding  is  a  strong sign  of  employee  confidence  in  the  Group's  future  and strategy.  By  becoming  a  shareholder,  employees  benefit from  a  unique  status:  they  are  both  contributors  and beneficiaries of the Company's value creation.\n\n## Authorizations granted to the Board of Directors to increase the share capital\n\nTo give the Air France-KLM group the flexibility and agility required  for  the  Group's  financial  management  while taking  into  account  the  diversity  of  interests  and expectations of Air France-KLM's shareholders, a number of  financial  resolutions  were  adopted  by  the  Annual Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  7,  2023  (resolutions  19 to 35).\n\nTwo  other  authorizations  aimed  at  restructuring  the Air France-KLM share capital through a reverse share split (resolution 36) and a simultaneous reduction in the capital (resolution 37) so as to return to a situation more in line with  that  of  its  stock  market  peers,  in  terms  of  the number of shares in circulation and the ratio between the share price in the stock market and the nominal value of the  shares,  were  also  adopted  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023 and implemented by the Board of Directors. These operations came into effect on August 31, 2023. As a result of the definitive realization of the capital reduction,  the  nominal  cap  amounts  in  resolutions  19  to 22, 25, 26 to 29 and 32 were divided by a factor of 10.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  within  the  framework  of  its 'Partners  for  the  Future'  employee  shareholder  offer which  was  successfully  on  December  21,  2023,  the Company  had  used  (i)  the  authorization  for  a  capital increase  reserved  for  members  of  a  company  or  Group savings scheme (resolution 34) and the authorization for a capital  increase  reserved  to  employees  not  resident  in France (resolution 35).\n\nThe other authorizations had not been used.\n\nOn December 12, 2023, the Air France-KLM group finalized the 'Partners for the Future' share offer, a capital increase reserved  to  around  75,000  eligible  employees  of  the Group (3) , launched in November 2023.",

Air  France-KLM  issued  bonds  convertible and/or exchangeable  into  new  or  existing shares (OCEANEs),  maturing  in  2026,  for  an  amount  of \u20ac500  million,  initially  representing  27,901,785  underlying shares. The initial conversion ratio was one share for one OCEANE. However, pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions, the conversion ratio was adjusted to 1.783 Air France-KLM shares for one OCEANE following the realization of the  capital  increase  with  maintained preferential  subscription  rights  of  June  14,  2022  (see edition  No.72  of  the Bulletin  des  Annonces  L\u00e9gales Obligatoires dated  June  17,  2022).  Following  the  reverse stock-split on August 31, 2023, the conversion ratio for the OCEANE bonds was also adjusted to 0.178 shares for one OCEANE  2026  as  from  August  31,  2023  (see  the  notice published in the Bulletin des annonces l\u00e9gales obligatoires no. 107 of September 6, 2023).\n\nThe nominal unit value of the bonds is \u20ac17.92. The bonds bear a coupon of 0.125%, payable annually on March 25.\n\nThe conversation period runs from May 4, 2019 until the seventh  business  day  preceding  the  early  redemption date or the maturity date.\n\nRedemption  at  par,  plus  the  corresponding  accrued interest  may  be  requested  by  the  bond  holders  on March 25, 2024.\n\nThe bonds may be the subject of early redemption at the Company's  discretion,  subject  to  certain  conditions,  and at the discretion of the bond holders, in particular in the event  of  a  change  of  control  for  the  Company  (as  this expression is defined in the terms and conditions for the bonds).\n\nAir  France-KLM  has  had  the  option  to  impose  the  early redemption in cash of these securities since April 15, 2022 if the arithmetic average, calculated over any period of ten consecutive trading days chosen by the Company falling within the 20 day period preceding the publication of the early  redemption  notice,  of  the  daily  products  of  the average weighted Air France-KLM share prices recorded on  Euronext  Paris  on  each  trading  day  and  the conversion/exchange  ratio  in  effect  on  this  same  day exceeds 130% of the nominal value of the bonds.\n\n## Issue of undated deeply subordinated unsecured bonds convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares in the nominal amount of \u20ac305.3 million\n\nOn  November  16,  2022,  the  Company  issued  undated deeply  subordinated  unsecured  bonds  convertible  into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares (the 'Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds'),  for  a  nominal  amount  of \u20ac305.3 million representing around 200 million underlying  shares  by  way  of  a  placement  limited  to qualified investors (the 'Offering').\n\nThe net proceeds of the Offering were allocated in full to the redemption of the deeply subordinated bonds held by the  French  State  (see  above),  issued  in  April  2021.  The Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds  will  be  accounted  as  quasiequity under IFRS.\n\nThe  Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds  were  issued  at  par  and have  a  nominal  value  per  Hybrid  Convertible  Bond  of \u20ac100,000 with a conversion/exchange premium of 22.5% over  the  Company's  reference  share  price,  i.e.  \u20ac1.2464 (corresponding  to  the  Company's  average  volumeweighted  share  price  on  the  Euronext  Paris  regulated market ('Euronext Paris') on November 16, 2022).\n\nFrom the issue date until November 23, 2025 (exclusive), the  Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds  will  bear  interest  at  a nominal annual rate of 6.5% payable quarterly in arrears on  November 23,  February  23,  May  23  and  August  23  of each year (or the next business day if any of these dates are not business days) (each, an \"Interest Payment Date\"), and for the first time on February 23, 2023, subject to any interest payment suspension by the Company.\n\nFrom November 23, 2025,  the  Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds will  bear  interest  at  a  rate  equal  to  1,300  basis  points above the applicable 3 year-Mid-Swap Rate in Euro as a reference rate. The reference rate will be subject to a reset every  three  years  thereafter.  Interest  will  be  payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and, as the case may be, for the first time on February 23, 2026, subject to any interest payment suspension.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, the annual rate for the fixed  coupon  or  the  reset  reference  rate  coupon,  as  the case may be, will be increased by 500 basis points.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

All  interest  in  respect  of  the  Hybrid  Convertible Bonds  that  is  not  paid  at  an  optional  Interest  Payment Date  will  constitute  \"Deferred  Interest\".  Any  amount  of Deferred  Interest  will  bear  interest  (to  the  full  extent permitted by law) from the interest payment suspension date  for  any  period  exceeding  12  months  at  the  interest rate applicable to the Hybrid Convertible Bonds over the relevant  period.  The  amount  of  accrued  interest  (the \"Additional  Interest\")  in  respect  of  Deferred  Interest  will become  due  and  payable  in  the  same  manner  as Deferred  Interest.  Deferred  Interest  (as  well  as  the corresponding  amount  of  Additional  Interest)  may  be paid  in  full  or  in  part  at  any  time  at  the  Company's discretion,  but  all  Deferred  Interest  (as  well  as  the corresponding  amount  of  Additional  Interest)  in  respect of  all  the  Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds will become payable in full in specific cases, notably if the Company decides to pay  a  dividend  or  an  interim  dividend  or  on  the repurchase of any equity securities or upon redemption of all the outstanding Bonds.\n\nThe  Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds  are  undated,  subject  to cases  of  early  redemption  at  the  Company's  option  and will only be repayable in the event of the liquidation of the Company or upon the expiry of the term indicated in the Company's  Articles  of  Incorporation  (unless  extended  in accordance with the applicable legislation).\n\nThe  Company  may,  at  its  discretion,  proceed  with  the early  redemption  of  all,  but  not  a  portion,  of  the  Hybrid Convertible Bonds at par plus accrued interest, Deferred Interest and, as the case may be, Additional Interest (the 'Early Redemption Price':\n\n- a) for the first time on November 23, 2025, then on each Interest Payment Date;\n- b) in the event of a change of control;\n- c) from  December  14,  2024  until  November  23,  2025 (exclusive),  if  the  arithmetic  average,  calculated  over any  period  of  ten  consecutive  trading  days  falling within  any  period  of  20  consecutive  trading  days preceding  the  publication  of  the  early  redemption notice, of the daily products of the Company's closing share  price  on  Euronext  Paris  and  the  conversion/ exchange  ratio  in  effect  on  each  trading  day  during such  period  exceeds  130%  of  the  principal  amount  of the Bonds; and\n- d) if  the  total  number  of  the  Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds outstanding  is  less  than  15%  of  the  number  of  Bonds originally issued.\n\n## Conversion/Exchange rights\n\nHolders  of  the  Hybrid  Convertible  Bonds  may  exercise their conversion/exchange  rights  at  any  time  from 40 calendar days after the issue date (inclusive) until the 10 th business  day  (exclusive)  preceding  the  earlier  of  the two  following  dates:  November  23,  2025,  or,  as  the  case may be, the date set for any early redemption.\n\nThe  conversion/exchange  ratio  was  initially  set  at  the principal amount  divided  by  the  prevailing  initial conversion/exchange  price,  i.e.  65,496.4632  Shares  per Hybrid Convertible Bond, subject to subsequent adjustments. Following the reverse stock-split on August 31, 2023, the conversion and/or exchange ratio has been  adjusted  to  6,549.6463  shares  for  one  Hybrid Convertible Bond.\n\n## 2.7.3 Authorization to buy back Air France-KLM's own shares\n\nEvery year, the Air France-KLM Board of Directors asks the Shareholders'  Meeting  for  the  authorization  to  buy  back the company's own shares in the stock market, subject to a number of conditions, except in 2021 and 2022, in view of the prohibitions imposed  under  the  European Commission's  Temporary  Framework  on  State  Aid  (see section  3.1.2.6  \"Commitments  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  European Commission\").  This  authorization  was  again  proposed  at the  2023  Shareholders'  Meeting,  following  the  full  exit from  the  French  government's  recapitalization  aid granted during the Covid-19 crisis as of April 19, 2023, and the lifting of the constraints associated with this aid.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Company  initiated  a  share  buyback program during the 2023 financial year, making use of the 18 th resolution  adopted  at  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of June 7, 2023.\n\nPursuant to Article 241-2 of the General Regulations of the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (AMF), the description of the Air France-KLM share buyback program, published on June  19,  2023  on  the  Group's  website,  presented  the objectives as well as the terms and conditions of the share buyback program authorized by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023, and contained the following information:\n\n- \u25a0 securities concerned : ordinary shares issued by Air France-KLM;\n- \u25a0 maximum amount  of  the  share  capital  that  may  be acquired by the Company : 5%;\n- \u25a0 maximum number of shares that may be acquired by the  Company,  based  on  the  number  of  shares composing  the  share  capital  as  of  May  31,  2023 : 128,526,806, but taking into account the 29,956 treasury shares, only 128,496,850 shares may be purchased;",

Ltd.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, Air France-KLM continued to execute its strategic partnerships entered into in 2017, firstly,  Delta  Air  Lines,  Inc.  (Delta)  and  Virgin  Atlantic Airways Ltd. (Virgin Atlantic) and, secondly, China Eastern Airlines (CEA).\n\nBy way of reminder, on July 27, 2017, Air France-KLM had announced, firstly, the planned creation of a joint-venture between  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and  Virgin  Atlantic  and, secondly,  the  intensification  of  its  partnership  with  CEA. These  two  commercial  alliances  were  consolidated,  in 2017,  by  equity  links:  on  October  3,  2017,  Delta  and  CEA each  acquired  equity  interests  in  Air  France-KLM  within the framework of reserved capital increases authorized by the  Combined  Ordinary  and  Extraordinary  Shareholders' Meeting of September 4, 2017 for a total of \u20ac751 million.\n\nWithin  this  framework,  on  July  27,  2017,  Air  France-KLM and  CEA  on  one  hand,  and  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and Virgin Atlantic on the other, signed partnership agreements  aimed  at  defining  the  principles  of  their closer cooperation:\n\n- \u25a0 on  July  27,  2017,  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and  Virgin Atlantic  signed  Memoranda  of  Understanding  laying the foundations for a future integration of the existing joint-ventures  between  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and Alitalia, and between Delta and Virgin Atlantic, within a single joint-venture. These agreements foresaw specific conditions intended to protect the interests of Air France-KLM in the event of any deterioration in the joint-venture's  operating  conditions  linked  to  the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union);\n- \u25a0 Air France-KLM  and  CEA  also  stepped  up  their commercial cooperation and reinforced their partnership within the framework of the existing jointventure,  through  the  signature  on  July  27,  2017,  of  a Marketing Agreement aimed at defining the principles of their closer cooperation.  A  new  joint-venture agreement (the CEA Joint-Venture Agreement) incorporating  these  principles,  was  concluded  on November 26, 2018 between Air France-KLM and CEA.\n\nFurthermore,  to  proceed  with  the  reserved  capital increases,  on  July  27,  2017  CEA  and  Delta  signed  two Subscription  Agreements  with  Air  France-KLM,  wherein both investors agreed to subscribe to the reserved capital increases.  These  subscription  agreements  include  an approval  clause  under  which  CEA  and  Delta  undertake,\n\nfor the term of the subscription agreement, to obtain the formal  approval  of  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  if they  wish  to  sell  their  Air  France-KLM  shares  to  another airline  company.  These  subscription  agreements  initially included,  for  CEA  and  Delta,  lock-up  undertakings  each covering  37,527  Air  France-KLM  shares  (as  adjusted  for any stock splits or reverse stock splits), as well as standstill commitments, which however expired on October 3, 2022. In the event of the sale of Air France-KLM shares over the counter to a third party, CEA and Delta have undertaken to offer Air France-KLM priority to acquire these shares, at the same price conditions.\n\nOn October 3, 2017, Eastern Airlines Industry Investment (Luxembourg) Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary  of  CEA  Global  Holdings  (Hong  Kong)  Limited, and Delta subscribed in cash to capital increases without shareholders'  preferential  subscription  rights,  each  for  a total  (including  issue  premium)  of  \u20ac375,274,100,  at  a subscription  price  of  \u20ac10  per  share  (including  issue premium).  The  acquisition  of  these  shareholdings  was accompanied by the appointment of two Board directors to  the  Air  France-KLM  Board  of  Directors  designated, firstly, by CEA and, secondly, by Delta.\n\nOn March 14 and May 15, 2018, within the framework of the implementation of the future single joint-venture between  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and  Virgin  Atlantic,  and following  authorization  by  the  Air  France-KLM  Board  of Directors  (see  section  2.3.1  'Activities  and  functioning  of the  Board  of  Directors'),  several  agreements  had  been signed:\n\n- \u25a0 agreements  aimed  at  enabling  Air  France-KLM  to acquire 31% of Virgin Atlantic);\n- \u25a0 a  joint-venture  agreement  (Blue  Skies  Joint-Venture Agreement)  aimed  at  the  implementation  of  a commercial  joint-venture  between  Air  France-KLM, Delta,  Virgin,  Air  France  and  KLM  together  with  the related  bilateral  Transition  Agreement  signed  with Delta; and\n- \u25a0 an  Implementation  Agreement  between  Air  FranceKLM,  Air  France-KLM  Finance  SAS,  Air  France,  KLM, Delta,  Virgin  Atlantic  Limited,  Virgin  Atlantic  and Sir  Richard  Branson,  concerning the realization of the transaction.\n\nOn November 21, 2019, the US Department of Transportation  granted  Antitrust  Immunity  (ATI)  within the framework of the extension of the transatlantic jointventure  between  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and  Virgin Atlantic. This regulatory step enabled the airlines to move forward with their transatlantic partnership.",

        "page_content": "In  parallel,  the  partners  finalized  the  governance  of  the commercial joint-venture between Air France-KLM, Delta and  Virgin  Atlantic,  agreeing  on  simplified  decisionmaking processes enabling the joint-venture to deliver its full  synergy  potential.  As  a  result,  Air  France-KLM  and Virgin Atlantic finally considered that the acquisition of a 31%  equity  interest  in  Virgin  Atlantic  as  initially  foreseen (Delta  already  holding  49%  since  2013  and  the  historic shareholder  Sir  Richard  Branson  retaining  20%)  was  no longer necessary and negotiated an agreement wherein Air  France-KLM  would  not  acquire  an  equity  interest  in Virgin  Atlantic  with  no  impact  on  Air  France-KLM's position  in  the  commercial  joint-venture  between  Delta, Virgin  Atlantic  and  Air  France-KLM.  As  a  result,  the agreements  concluded  between  March  14  and  May  15, 2018 were amended and, following the mandate given to the  Air  France-KLM  management  by  the  Board  of Directors on October 30, 2019, an agreement was signed between  Air  France-KLM,  Delta  and  Virgin  Group (concluded and entering into force on January 30, 2020), giving  Air  France-KLM,  subject  to  certain  conditions,  the right to acquire Virgin Atlantic Limited shares in the event of a sale by Virgin Group of Virgin Atlantic Limited shares to  a  third  party.  This  partnership  is  considered  key  to reinforcing  the  Group's  leadership  position  between Europe  and  North  America  and  will  offer  customers  a seamless travel experience across the Atlantic.\n\nThe overall joint-venture between Air France, KLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic was launched in early February 2020, offering  customers  a  wider  choice  of  routes  and  loyalty options  for  travel  between  Europe,  the  United  Kingdom and North America.\n\nWithin  the  context  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  restrictive border  regulations  and  health  measures  led  to  a  drastic reduction  in  airline  capacity  and  created  a  highly uncertain  environment  regarding  the  management  of networks  by  the  joint-venture  partners.  In  view  of  the impact  on  the  implementation  of  the  Air  France-KLM group's  existing  joint-ventures,  in  December  2020  the partners  reviewed  the  financial  conditions  of  their agreements and amended the provisions relating to the financial 'settlement' mechanisms  provided  in  the Group's  joint-venture  agreements  signed,  on  one  hand, with Delta and Virgin Atlantic and, on the other, with CEA.\n\nOn  December  4,  2020,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of Article L. 225-38  of  the Code  de  Commerce , the Air  France-KLM  Board  of  Directors  thus  authorized  the adjustment  of  the  provisions  concerning  the  financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues and costs generated  by  the  joint-venture)  in  the  Blue  Skies  JointVenture  Agreement  for  the  2020  calendar  year.  In  this respect,  the  parties  waived  all  rights  they  may  have  had with respect to the amounts due to them under the jointventure  agreement  for  the  2020  calendar  year,  and agreed to waive them permanently. This waiver avoided uncertain  and  potentially  material  financial  exposure  for all  the  partners  given  the  context  linked  to  the  public health crisis. The duration of this waiver was extended to\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nShare capital and shareholder structure\n\nthe 2021 and 2022 financial years by mutual agreement of the  parties  due  to  the  duration  of  the  impacts  of  the Covid-19  pandemic  on  the  Blue  Skies  joint-venture operations.  On  December  31,  2023,  an  agreement  was reached between the parties providing for new 'settlement' caps applicable solely in respect of the 2023 calendar year.\n\nOn  December  4,  2020,  the  Air  France-KLM  Board  of Directors also authorized the suspension of the provisions concerning the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues generated by the joint-venture) foreseen in the  CEA  Joint-Venture  Agreement.  In  this  respect,  the parties waived all payments under the CEA Joint-Venture Agreement as of February 1, 2020 for a period that was to be  mutually  agreed  between  the  parties  depending  on the  duration  of  the  effects  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  on the  joint-venture.  This  waiver  avoided  uncertain  and potentially  material  financial  exposure  for  both  parties linked  to  the  impacts  of  the  public  health  crisis  on  the joint-venture.  The  other  provisions  of  the  CEA  JointVenture  Agreement  remained  unchanged.  The  parties entered  into  a  new  agreement,  effective  July  1,  2023, terminating the waiving by the parties of all payments in respect  of  the  CEA  Joint-Venture  (decided  in  2020)  and providing for a new transitional settlement cap, applicable solely for the period from July 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023.  In  December  2023,  the  parties  extended  the  term (initially  due  to  expire  on  December 31, 2023) of the CEA Joint-Venture  Agreement  until  March  31,  to  enable  the parties  to  continue  their  cooperation  while  actively negotiating the terms of a new joint-venture agreement in 2024.\n\nLastly, within the framework of the Group's recapitalization  plan  announced  on  April  6,  2021,  on June 23, 2021, Air France-KLM entered into an agreement with  CEA  aimed  at  accelerating  their  efforts  to  deepen and  expand  the  existing  and  future  cooperation,  and further  reinforce  their  partnership  for  air  transport services  between  China  and  Europe.  This  agreement enables the Group to reinforce its commercial cooperation  with  CEA  and  its  position  in  the  Chinese market (see section 2.3.1 'Activities and functioning of the Board  of  Directors';  'Agreements  referred  to  in  Article L. 225-38 of the Code de Commerc e'). CEA also subscribed to the Company's capital increase realized on April 19, 2021 and,  following  this  participation,  held  9.6%  of  the Company's share capital.\n\nCEA  and  Delta.  also  participated  in  the  capital  increase with  maintained  preferential  subscription  rights  realized on June 14, 2022 on a cash-neutral basis, for an aggregate amount of approximately \u20ac110.7 million, by subscribing to a  respective  58,763,343  and  35,873,772  new  shares  by using  the  net  proceeds  from  selling  part  of  their  DPS Rights  to  CMA  CGM  (see  hereinafter).  This  took  their respective  shareholdings  to  4.7%  and  2.9%  of  the Company's share capital.",

The Standstill Commitment stipulates that, at the end of a five-year period as of the settlement-delivery  of  the  new  shares  issued  by Air France-KLM, the Air France-KLM Board of Directors can modify this Standstill Commitment to enable CMA AGM to increase its shareholding in Air France-KLM.\n\nFurthermore,  within  the  framework  of  the  issue  of undated subordinated unsecured bonds convertible into new and/or exchangeable into existing shares realized on November  16,  2022  by  the  Company  for  the  nominal amount  of  \u20ac305.3  million  through  a  placing  limited  to qualified  investors  (representing  around  200  million\n\nunderlying  shares),  CMA  CGM,  which  holds  9.0%  of Air France-KLM, subscribed in proportion to its holding in the Company's share capital, corresponding to a nominal amount of around \u20ac27 million.\n\nOn  December  9,  2022,  the  Company  entered  into  a commercial cooperation agreement in air freight on the basis  of  the  principal  terms  set  in  May  2022  with Air France, KLM, CMA CGM Air Cargo and CMA CGM (the 'Cooperation  Agreement').  The  initial  aim  of  the  parties was to be able to launch business cooperation in the 2023 second  quarter,  subject  to  obtaining  the  required authorizations  from  the  relevant  legal  and  regulatory authorities.\n\nIn  February  2023,  Mr.  Rodolphe  Saad\u00e9  announced  his intention  to  be  replaced  as  a  Board  director  by  the company  CMA  CGM.  As  the  Subscription  Agreement signed  on  March  22,  2022  between  the  Company  and CMA  CGM  had  initially  stipulated  that  the  person proposed  by  CMA  AGM  for  appointment  as  a  Board director  of  the  Company  should  be  a  natural  person,  it was  decided  to  amend  the  Subscription  Agreement  to enable  the  nomination  of  a  legal  person.  As  a  result,  on April  19,  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the signature  by  the  Company  of  an  amendment  to  the Subscription  Agreement  enabling  the  nomination  by CMA CGM of a legal person. The other stipulations of the Subscription Agreement remained unchanged.\n\nHowever,  owing  to  the  tight  regulatory  environment  in certain important markets, the cooperation was unable to function optimally.\n\nAs  a  result,  in  a  press  release  dated  January  16,  2024, Air France-KLM and CMA CGM announced their decision to  terminate the existing agreements effective March 31, 2024. Air France-KLM and CMA CGM opened discussions covering the new terms and conditions of a commercial relationship in which each group would operate independently as of March 31, 2024.\n\nWithin this framework, on January 16, 2024, the Company entered into a term sheet agreement (the 'Term Sheet') with  Air  France,  KLM,  CMA  CGM,  CMA  CGM  Air  Cargo ('CCAC')  and  CMA  CGM  Air  Cargo  9  ('CCAC  9')  and, together with the Company, Air France, KLM, CMA CGM and  CCAC  (the  'Parties'),  providing  for  the  terms  and conditions of the termination of the commercial cooperation  between  the  entities  of  the  Air  France-KLM group and the entities of the CMA CGM Group concerning their  air  freight  activities,  effective  March  30,  2024.  The Term  Sheet  provides  notably  for  the  termination  of  the commercial cooperation agreement between the parties and the ancillary agreements relating to their cooperation in the air freight sector.\n\nThe two Groups remain determined to work together so that  air  freight  customers  can  continue  to  benefit  from their respective networks.\n\nCMA CGM remains a reference shareholder in Air FranceKLM.",

The company Delta Air Lines, Inc. controls DAL Foreign Holdings C.V. and, as general partner of DAL Foreign Holdings C.V. is the legal owner of the Air France-KLM shares.\n\nSince April 3, 2016, in application of French law, shareholders holding their shares in registered form for more than two years have benefited from a double voting right.\n\n## Shareholder analysis\n\nPursuant to the obligation for air transport companies to monitor  and  control  their  shareholders,  Air  France-KLM has implemented a procedure for their identification on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe  TPI  (identifiable  bearer  shares)  analysis  was  carried out  on  December  31,  2023.  Based  on  the  responses obtained  under  the  SRD  II  regime,  as  of  December  31, 2023,  Air  France-KLM  is  more  than  81.7%  owned  by nationals of Member States of the European Union or of States party to the Agreement  on  the  European Economic Area.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Air France-KLM group keeps the market informed  on  its  activity  through  monthly  traffic  figures and  quarterly  updates  on  the  trend  in  its  results  and strategic  orientations.  All  its  regulated  information  is available on the www.airfranceklm.com website in French and English. As a global player in the airline industry, the Group  assumes  its  role  as  a  pioneer  in  sustainable aviation.  Its  commitment  and  performance  in  terms  of Corporate Social Responsibility have been recognized by the extra-financial rating agencies for many years.\n\n## Relations with investors\n\nThe Investor Relations department maintains a dialogue with  financial  analysts  and  institutional  investors.  In addition  to  conference  calls  and  information  meetings scheduled  to  coincide  with  results  announcements,  the Group's  management  regularly  meets  with  financial analysts  and  institutional  investors  during  road-shows and conferences in Europe, the United States and Asia.\n\n## Relations with individual shareholders\n\nThe  Individual  Shareholder  Relations  Department  has  a pro-active policy on engaging with individual shareholders. The website dedicated to the Shareholders' Club was redesigned in January 2023 and the shareholders'  newsletter,  with  updates  on  the  Group's business activity and objectives, is circulated by email and is available on the website in French and English.\n\nThe Shareholder Relations department, ready to listen to shareholders,  can  be  reached  by  e-mail  at  the  address mail.actionnairer@airfranceklm.com.\n\nLastly, since 2000, the Individual Shareholders' Consultative  Committee,  has  constituted  a  forum  for work,  discussion  and  suggestions  on  Air  France-KLM's communication aimed at individual shareholders. Composed  of  twelve  members,  the  Committee  meets several  times  a  year  including  one  meeting  devoted  to planning the Shareholders' Meeting. It also participates in major  company  events.  Its  members  were  renewed  in March 2023.\n\n## 2.7.7 Legal and statutory investment thresholds\n\nPursuant to the option provided in Article L. 233-7 of the Code de Commerce (French Code of Commerce), Article 13 of the  Air  France-KLM  Articles  of  Incorporation stipulates  that  any  private  individual  or  corporate  body, acting alone or in concert, acquiring directly or indirectly at least 0.5% of Air France-KLM's capital or voting rights or any  multiple  thereof,  must  notify  Air  France-KLM  by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt no later than  four  stock  market  trading  days  as  of  the  date  on which  this  threshold  is  crossed.  The  declaration  must include  all  the  information  required  to  be  submitted  to the  French  Financial  Market  Authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des March\u00e9s Financier s) in the event of the crossing of a legal threshold,  as  well  the  information  referred  to  in  Article 10 of the Air France-KLM Articles of Incorporation.\n\nNotice  must  again  be  given  under  the  same  conditions each  time  a  further  0.5%  of  the  capital  or  voting  rights threshold is crossed, up to 50%.\n\nThese declarations are made in the event of the crossing of  the  thresholds  mentioned  above,  involving  either  an increase or a reduction in the shareholding.\n\nTo  determine  these  thresholds,  the  shares  and  voting rights  defined by the provisions of Article L. 233-9 of the Code  de  Commerce and  those  of  the  relevant  AMF General  Regulation  are  assimilated  in  the  share  capital and voting rights.\n\nIn  the  event  of  failure  to  comply  with  this  notification obligation and at the request of one or more shareholders holding  at  least  0.5%  of  the  Air  France-KLM  capital  or voting rights, the shares exceeding  the  reporting thresholds  will  be  stripped  of  their  voting  rights  at  all Shareholders' Meetings for a period of two years following compliance with the notification procedures.\n\nFurthermore, any shareholder, whether acting alone or in concert,  acquiring  more  than  5%  of  Air  France-KLM's share capital or voting rights is required to transfer these securities  to  registered  form  within  the  legal  limit  of  no more than four stock market trading days as of the date on  which  the  threshold  is  crossed  (Article  9.2  of  the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nThe above requirements under the Articles of Incorporation  do  not  prejudice  the  legal  obligation  to inform  Air  France-KLM  and  the  AMF  within  four  stock market  trading  days  following  the  crossing  of  the  legal thresholds  of  5%,  10%,  15%,  20%,  25%,  33 1/3 %,  50%,  66 2/3 %, 90% and 95% of the share capital or voting rights.\n\nFurthermore,  if  the  10%,  15%,  20%  and  25%  thresholds  of the  share  capital  or  voting  rights  are  exceeded  by  a person, the shareholder must notify Air France-KLM and the  AMF  within  five  stock  market  trading  days  of  the crossing of the capital and voting right thresholds of their intentions for the next six months. Any failure to comply with this declaration requirement will incur the sanctions set forth in Article L. 233-14 of the Code de Commerce .\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  is  because,  over  time,  changes  in  the shareholder structure of an air transport company whose shares are listed for trading on a regulated market could jeopardize  its  operating  license  as  an  EU  air  transport carrier,  the  retention  thereof  being  conditional  on  EU interests holding a majority of the shares and maintaining effective control, or the traffic rights held by the Company as  a  French  air  transport  company,  pursuant  to  bilateral international agreements concluded between France and other States outside the European Union.\n\n## Identification and monitoring of shareholders\n\nArticles 9 and following of the Air France-KLM Articles of Incorporation set the conditions under which the Board of Directors  can  or  must  decide  either  to  reduce  the  5% threshold above which shares must be held in registered form  to  10,000  shares,  or  to  require  all  shares  in Air France-KLM to be held in registered form. Thus, when the 40% share capital or voting right threshold has been passed  by  non-French  shareholders,  the  Board  of Directors  can  decide  to  reduce  this  5%  threshold  to 10,000 shares.\n\nAir France-KLM  publishes  a  notice  informing  the shareholders and the public that non-French shareholders  as  defined  by  Article  14  of  the  Articles  of Incorporation own, directly or indirectly, 45% of Air FranceKLM's share capital or voting rights. If it appears that nonFrench shareholders as defined by Article 14 of the Articles\n\nof  Incorporation  represent,  directly  or  indirectly,  more than 45% of Air France-KLM's capital or voting rights on a long-term  basis,  the  Board  of  Directors  must  decide  to make  it  mandatory  for  all  Air  France-KLM  shares  to  be held in registered form. Following an amendment to the Articles  of  Incorporation  in  2014,  within  the  meaning  of Article  14  of  Air  France-KLM's  Articles  of  Incorporation, citizens of the European Union Member States and States party  to  the  European  Economic  Area  Agreement  are considered to be French nationals.\n\nArticle  10  of  the  Air  France-KLM  Articles  of  Incorporation specifies  the  information  that  must  be  provided  to Air France-KLM by shareholders, whether they are private individuals or corporate bodies, subject to the obligation to  hold  their  shares  in  registered  form.  This  information includes the nationality of the shareholder. Article 11 of the Articles  of  Incorporation  specifies  the  conditions  under which  the  Board  of  Directors  may  exercise  its  right  to approve new shareholders.\n\n## Formal notice to sell and mandatory sale of shares\n\nArticle  14  of  the  Air  France-KLM  Articles  of  Incorporation stipulates  the  information  that  Air  France-KLM  must publish and circulate to inform the public that over 45% of the  capital  or  voting  rights  is  held  by  shareholders  who are  not  of  French  nationality.  Based  on  this  threshold, Air  France-KLM  will  be  entitled  to  launch  procedures requiring  the  sale  of  shares  in  order  to  safeguard  its nationality. Articles 15 and 16 of the Articles of Incorporation, respectively, concern formal notices to sell and  the  mandatory  sale  of  shares  held  in  breach  of regulations  pursuant  to  the Code  de  l'Aviation  Civile (French Civil Aviation Code) and the Code des Transports (French  Transport  Code).  The  terms  for  setting  the  sale price  (market  price)  are  foreseen  by  the Code  des Transports .",

Operations may need to be  ceased  or  modified  as  a  result  of  rapidly-changing rules and conditions.\n\nIn  some  areas,  this  risk  has  materialized:  the  Russian airspace  is  closed  to  carriers  from  the  European  Union, forcing  them  to  fly  longer  routes  to  Asian  destinations. Instability in Africa and the Middle East is also impacting operations.\n\nSuch closures and ad hoc changes could create additional complexity for operations and processes so as to ensure safe  operations,  leading  to  higher  operating  costs,  a reduction  in  purchasing  power  and  demand  for  travel, and  a  risk  concerning  the  overall  perception  and  brand image.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nCapacity and network adjustments; internal coordination working group; crisis management; resources reallocation;  lobbying  for  international  (industry-wide) policies,  standards  and  regulations;  securing  minimum service levels; securing internal processes and procedures for cash management (capex, costs: internal and external) in response  to  liquidity issues; internal tools and procedures, informing, securing and protecting employees in the event of an emergency. The Group has no  coverage  in  place  for  air  transportation  operating losses  but  Air  France  and  KLM  are  insured  for  the consequences  of  an  attack  on  aircraft  and  have subscribed to war and assimilated risks insurance.\n\n## 3.1.1.2 Economic uncertainty*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nSeveral factors are weighing on global economic activity: monetary  policy  aimed  at  controlling  increased  inflation and  public  debt,  volatility  compounded  by  the  different market  dynamics  in  the  key  economic  regions  (North America,  Europe,  Asia)  and  the  international  tensions described in the preceding risk.\n\nThe growth forecasts are highly variable and could impact the airline industry.\n\nThis  risk  could  reduce  international  trade  with  a  high probability of lower disposable income for airline industry customers.\n\n## Impact\n\nOne direct impact could be lower government spending and  higher  taxation,  putting  company  profitability  and household budgets under pressure and, as a consequence,  reducing  demand  for  air  transportation, both for leisure and business purposes.\n\nInternal  procurement  could  be  faced  with  increasing pressure from  external stakeholders and  suppliers, resulting in the renegotiation of contracts and rates.\n\nThese  factors  could  lead  to  higher  operational  and infrastructure  costs,  coupled  with  lower  revenue  and profitability for air transportation and air freight.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe  agility  to  adapt  our  capacity,  fleet,  network  and resources allocation; reviewing our prices and marketing offer; strengthening procurement policies.\n\n## 3.1.1.3 Risks relating to changes in oil and fuel prices*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe  fuel  bill  is  one  of  the  largest  cost  items  for  airlines, making  oil  price  volatility  a  significant  risk  for  the  air transportation industry:\n\n- \u25a0 a  sharp  increase  in  the  oil  price  can  have  a  very material negative impact on the profitability of airlines, particularly  if  the  economic  environment  does  not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies;\n- \u25a0 similarly,  a  sharp  decline  in  fuel  prices  is  generally favorable for airline profitability. However, the ability of airlines to pass on a sharp fall in the fuel price in their fares is a factor of significant uncertainty.",

        "page_content": "The  adoption  of  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel  (SAF)  is  a  key solution in the aviation sector's decarbonization road map and  SAF  mandates  are  gradually  being  introduced throughout Europe. SAF availability will become a critical risk in the coming years as it affects the ability to reduce carbon emissions and meet sustainability goals.\n\n## Impact\n\nFor the financial year ended December 31, 2023, the fuel bill  amounted  to  \u20ac7,133  million,  representing  a  slight decrease of (0.7)% compared to the previous year due, in particular, to:\n\n- \u25a0 the  decline  in  fuel  prices  throughout  2023,  following the significant increase recorded in 2022;\n- \u25a0 and despite the growth in traffic observed in 2023.\n\nThe Air France-KLM group has hedged its exposure to fuel price  risk.  As  of  February  2,  2024,  the  Air  France-KLM group's  fuel  price  exposure  for  2024  amounted  to US$7,517  million,  based  on  futures  prices  at  February  2, 2024 (US$76 a barrel for 2024).\n\nBased on the forward curve at February 2, 2024:\n\n- \u25a0 an increase of US$10 per barrel over 2024 would give an average price of US$85 per barrel and would lead to a US$553 million increase in the fuel bill after hedging, i.e. a  total  fuel  bill  of  US$8,070  million  for  the Air France-KLM group in 2024;\n- \u25a0 symmetrically,  a  fall  of  US$10  per  barrel  over  2024 would give  an  average  price  of  US$67  per  barrel  and would lead to a US$544 million reduction in the fuel bill after hedging, i.e. a total expense of US$6,973 million in 2024.\n\nA  potential  lack  of  widespread  SAF  production  and distribution  between  2025  and  2030,  and  competition with  other  sectors  working  on  their  energy  transitions, could result in higher costs. In addition, a shortage of SAF can  impact  an  airline's  reputation,  undermine  customer confidence  in  its  commitment  to  sustainability  and threaten  the  realization  of  the  sustainability  ambitions. The availability of SAF is therefore key to supporting the growth of the aviation industry while reducing its impact on the environment.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nInsofar as possible, the Group seeks to protect itself from any  further  increases  in  oil  prices,  whilst  remaining protected  against  downwards  risks,  and  adapts  its  fares when necessary to reduce the impact of rising fuel prices.\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors\n\nIn addition to fare adjustments and permanent efforts to reduce fuel consumption, the Group has implemented a policy of systematically hedging the fuel price risk defined by  the  Risk  Management  Committee  (the  'RMC'), presented  to  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  Board  of Directors of the Company.\n\n## The hedging strategy:\n\n- \u25a0 sets the time span of the hedges;\n- \u25a0 sets  the  target  hedging  ratios  to  be  reached  for  the coming quarters;\n- \u25a0 defines  the  instruments  (swaps,  forwards  or  option based), eligible for hedging pursuant to the accounting standards in force.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  application  of  IFRS  9,  hedging  by component has been applied since January 1, 2018. Since the Group's fuel procurement is strongly correlated to the Jet  Kerosene  Cargoes  CIF  NWE  Index,  components specific to this fuel risk are used (Brent ICE, Gasoil ICE, Jet CIF  NWE) to  align  the  fuel  hedging  accounting  and  the Group's risk management policy more effectively. Within the  framework  of  a  dynamic  risk  monitoring  approach, the Group tracks the following indicators:\n\n- \u25a0 maximum loss:  capping  the  potential  maximum  loss; and\n- \u25a0 maximum  gain:  value  of  the  portfolio  prompting  its restructuring;\n- \u25a0 Value at Risk: enabling the measurement  and monitoring of extreme risk scenarios. The level of this indicator is calculated and regularly analyzed, and may also trigger a restructuring of the portfolio.\n\nIn  order  to  better  cover  the  risk  associated  with  the decoupling between indices reflecting the price of crude oil  (Brent  ICE)  and  indices  reflecting  the  price  of  refined products  (Gasoil  ICE  and  Jet  CIF  NWE),  the  Air  FranceKLM  group  has  incorporated  new  hedging  instruments on crack spreads.\n\nThe fuel hedging policy, in force since February 2021, has been  updated  and  became  effective  during  the  first quarter  of  2024.  The  hedging  strategy,  previously  based on a rolling 12-month period, has been extended to cover 18  months.  The  hedging  portfolio  will  represent  68%  of annual  consumption.  This  extension  in  the  portfolio's maturity  will  give  the  Air  France-KLM  group  greater visibility on the trend in its fuel bill.\n\n| (in US$ million)                 | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross expenditure before hedging | 7,695  | 7,497  | 7,461  |\n| Hedge percentage                 | 71%    | 55%    | 7%     |\n| Gain/(loss) on hedging           | (17)   | (20)   | (6)    |\n| Net expenditure after hedging    | 7,712  | 7,517  | 7,467  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group manages a portfolio  of  consortia,  projects  and  initiatives,  leading  to long-term  offtake  agreements  with  various  optional conditions to secure the volumes of SAF to meet its 2030 ambition for a minimum of 10% of SAF, while contending with the uncertainties that still prevail in this domain.\n\nAir  France-KLM  works  with  governments  and  industry organizations  to  increase  the  availability  and  stability  of the SAF supply chain. It was a founding member of ACT, the Aviation Climate Taskforce, which aims to accelerate the  development  of  synthetic  fuel  and,  at  the  European level,  Air  France-KLM  has  joined  the  Renewable  Low Carbon Fuels Alliance, bringing together the aviation and sea transportation sectors to jointly boost the production and supply of renewable and low-carbon fuels.\n\nFinally, the Group supports the development of industrywide  standards  and  certification  processes  for  SAF  to increase  confidence  and  reduce  uncertainty  to  help  this new industry to emerge. To ensure that the SAF projects selected directly have a minimal  impact  on  the environment,  Air  France-KLM  maintains  a  strict  due diligence  on  the  sustainability  of  SAF  sources  and  that SAF is RSB or ISCC certified.\n\nTo  manage  the  accessibility  to  SAF,  in  2023  the  Group continued to secure future SAF supplies to work towards meeting its target of a minimum of 10% incorporation of SAF  by  2030  by  signing  offtake  agreements  and  MoUs with  SAF  producers  around  the  world,  and  by  investing directly  in  SAF  production  capabilities.  These  long-term, strategic  investments  confirm  the  Group's  commitment to supporting the emergence of a scalable network of SAF production capabilities in Europe and worldwide.\n\n## 3.1.1.4  Competition and trends in the aeronautics maintenance market\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nCompetition and trends in the aeronautics maintenance market (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul also MRO):\n\n- \u25a0 airframers, engine manufacturers and aircraft component manufacturers (OEMs) are rapidly expanding  their  after-sales  services  based  on  a  longterm  strategy,  leveraging  intellectual  property  and licensing mechanisms;\n\n- \u25a0 more  aggressive  competition  and  pressure  on  the revenues of the maintenance business.\n\nOn the cost side:\n\n- \u25a0 OEMs are leading an aggressive price escalation policy;\n- \u25a0 the  maintenance  industry  is  facing  a  labor  scarcity, leading  to  the  risk  of  a  shortage  of  manpower  and wage inflation;\n- \u25a0 the supply chain is still, and will remain for the coming period,  under  significant  pressure  due  to  the  lack  of raw materials, spare parts and the poor performance of OEMs.\n\nThis  trend  is  accelerating,  especially  with  the  arrival  of new  aircraft  (A220,  A350,  B787,  E2-195  etc.),  for  which OEMs  often  require  significant  license  costs  to  support these platforms. Ultimately, if it were to result in reduced competition in the aeronautics maintenance market, this trend  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  airline maintenance costs.\n\n## Impact\n\nRevenues in the maintenance business represented 6% of the  Group's  revenues  for  the  financial  year  ended December 31, 2023 versus 5% in 2022.\n\nThe margin in the maintenance business was 3.5% for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 versus 4.6% in 2022.\n\n## Currently:\n\n- \u25a0 the MRO market is showing healthy growth, forecast at an annual 2.9% (1) over the next decade;\n- \u25a0 India  and  the  Middle  East  are  the  fastest-developing markets with annual growth forecast at 10.4% and 6% respectively.  AFI  KLM  E&M  has  significant  activity  in these  markets  with  strong  customer  portfolios  and regional industrial footprints;\n- \u25a0 several  airlines  which  are  also  customers  of  the Air France-KLM group for MRO services have incurred losses due to the crisis or are under embargo. Although the  risk  of  bankruptcy  and  the  associated  loss  of business  is  now  mostly  behind  us,  the  Group  is  still exposed  to  the  risk  of  delayed  payment  of  its receivables.",

For example:\n\n- \u25a0 possible mergers and acquisitions could result in larger airline  companies  that  can  optimize  networks  and achieve economies of scale;\n\n## 3.1.2 Risks relating to the air transportation activity\n\n## 3.1.2.1 Risks related to airline safety*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAccident  risk,  with  the  possibility  of  damage  to  people and  property,  is  inherent  to  air  transportation  which  is why airline activities -passenger and cargo transportation, aircraft maintenance - are regulated by a series of European regulatory provisions that are directly applicable  or  for  some  of  them  transposed  into  French and  Dutch  law.  Compliance  with  these  regulations  is governed by whether an airline is awarded the AOC (Air Operator Certificate).\n\nThe national Civil Aviation Authority carries out a series of checks on the proper application of these rules covering notably the:\n\n- \u25a0 designation  of  a  senior  executive  and  managers responsible for the principal operational functions;\n- \u25a0 appropriate  organization  of  the  flight,  ground,  cargo and maintenance operations;\n- \u25a0 deployment of a Safety Management System (SMS); and\n- \u25a0 implementation of a quality assurance system.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe  materialization  of  this  risk  could  have  a  significant negative  impact  on  the  Group's  reputation  and  legal  or financial consequences.\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors\n\n- \u25a0 low-cost  long-haul  services  complement  the  more prevalent  full-service  long-haul  flights  operated  with wide-body aircraft;\n- \u25a0 technology companies could further establish themselves  as  intermediaries  between  airlines  and customers;\n- \u25a0 the  aviation  sector  may  be  incentivized  in  certain countries  or  subject  to  different  laws  and  regulations between jurisdictions, causing an uneven playing field;\n- \u25a0 air  transportation  as  a  whole  competes  with  digital meeting  platforms  as  an  alternative  to  meetings  in person.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe  direct  impact  could  include  shifts  in  customer demand,  needs  and  behavior  (changes  in  travel,  buying and transportation habits), and the company's inability to respond  to  changing  market  needs.  A  brand  and  its products could also become outdated and commoditized, leading to a loss of business value, a decrease in market share and the marginalization of a company.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir  France-KLM  addresses  this  risk  by  ensuring  that  its services  continue  to  correspond  to  the  market  needs. Activities  in  this  regard  include  R&D  and  innovation initiatives, commercial  and  competitive  partnerships, membership  of  professional  airline  organizations  and consolidation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

Safety  is  fundamental  to  maintaining the confidence of customers and staff, and is a day-to-day imperative which determines the Group's activity and the long-term future of the air transportation industry.\n\nAll  of  the  Group's  businesses  are  subject  to  numerous checks  and  certifications,  and  meet  extremely  strict standards  and  the  highest  level  of  regulations  in  the industry,  both  at  European  level  with  the  European Aviation  Safety  Agency  (EASA),  and  globally  with  the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose IOSA Operational  Safety  Audit  is  a  benchmark  within  the industry and leads to certification which must be renewed every two years.\n\nThe  Air  France  and  KLM  IOSA  audits  were  carried  out between  November  and  December  2022  and  the  IOSA renewal audits will take place at the end of 2024.\n\nTo reach the highest possible level of Flight Safety, each airline  updates  and  reinforces  its  SMS  which  defines  in concrete terms the conditions for the implementation of its  risk  management  system.  Through  the  SMS  the  risks related to operations  are  constantly  monitored  by learning  from  occurrences,  watching  for  trends  and thorough predictive risk analyses of proposed changes to the operations. The SMS, which is an integral part of the organization, procedures and corporate culture, is supported by a commitment made at the highest level of management,  and  by  training  and  awareness-raising programs for all staff (see section 4.4.1 'Operational safety for stakeholders').\n\nThis risk is covered by the aviation insurance policies.\n\n## 3.1.2.2  Climate-related risks*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAir  France-KLM  is  aware  of  the  physical  and  transitional risks associated with climate change and considers them to be a significant concern. Failure to anticipate and adapt to these risks voluntarily could have negative consequences  on  the  company's  financial  performance and reputation.\n\nIn 2023, the Group conducted a climate scenario analysis to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  climate  risk landscape.  The  analysis  focused  on  identifying  and assessing the physical and climate-transition-related risks facing  the  company  across  different  timeframes.  The physical  risk  component  of  this  assessment  focused  on the  company's  top  50  sites,  exploring  geographical regions  around  the  world  in  which  it  operates  that  are projected  to  experience  greater  impacts.  The  effects  of potential  changes  in  policy,  technologies  and  markets were also examined.\n\nThe  Group  implemented  the  Task  Force  on  Climaterelated  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  recommendations and  used  the  IPCC's  Representative  Concentration Pathways  (RCP)  scenarios  to  analyze  the  physical  risks and the IPCC's Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP) to analyze the transition risks.\n\nThe Climate Scenarios analyzed included:\n\n| Climate Scenario   | RCP              | SSP                  |\n|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Orderly            | RCP 2.6 - 1.5 \u00b0C | SSP 1 Sustainability |\n|                    | RCP 4.5 -        | SSP 2 Middle of the  |\n| Disorderly         | 2 to 2.5 \u00b0C      | Road                 |\n| Hot-House World    | 3.6 to 4.4 \u00b0C    | Development          |",

The Group has had its CO2 emission  reduction  target  by  2030  validated  by  the independent reference organization SBTi, ensuring that it is  in  line  with  the  Paris  Agreement's  'Well  below  2\u00b0C' scenario.  This  is  in  addition  to  its  ambition  for  net  zero emissions by 2050. Air France-KLM's Climate Action Plan stipulates  the  Group's  priorities  in  terms  of  reducing  its environmental impacts, like fleet modernization to reduce fuel consumption,  improved  fuel  management  and optimized  operational  procedures  such  as  eco-piloting, and the accelerated introduction of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).\n\nAir  France-KLM  is  also  playing  a  front-runner  role  in  the airline  industry,  mobilizing  the  sector  to  accelerate  its decarbonization ambition.

Additionally,  the  Group  is lobbying the ICAO to increase the ambitions of CORSIA.\n\nThe  Group  is  investing  in  research  and  development  to promote  advances  in  low-carbon  technologies,  like Sustainable  Aviation  Fuels  (SAF)  and  electric  flying.  For more  detail,  see  the  sub  section  on  SAF  in  section  4.3.1 and section 3.1.1.3.\n\nTo  adapt  to  the  already-visible  consequences  of  climate change, such as more frequent extreme weather events, Air  France-KLM  has  a  policy  in  place  to  ensure  safe operational  and  passenger  handling  conditions,  and regularly conducts  comprehensive  risk  analyses  to optimize these arrangements.

In  the event of climatic events, the Group's various partnerships enable the rapid deployment of commercial measures so that  passengers  can  postpone  their  journeys  or  change their destinations if they so wish.\n\n## 3.1.2.3  Noise management*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nNoise management has become a regulatory topic in the ESRS  standards  falling  under  the  CSRD.  The  ESRS Standard 2 on Pollution now considers noise a pollutant, which  can  be  harmful  to  human  health  and  the environment.\n\nIn Europe, there are calls to implement  activity restrictions at airports in response to increasing sensitivity to  airport  noise  nuisance.  Campaigns  for  a  cap  on  the number  of  flights  and  regulatory  restrictions,  including curfews, have been launched by residents' associations at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, as well as at Orly and Roissy CDG airports in the Paris region.\n\nTo  address  these  concerns,  the  Dutch  and  French governments have launched impact assessment procedures  using  a  balanced  approach  developed  by ICAO.  This  approach  involves  a  scientific  assessment  of the  noise  pollution  levels  at  airports,  followed  by  an analysis of various reduction measures that can be taken, prioritizing the best combination of cost-effective measures  before  introducing  any  restrictions  on  aircraft operations as a last resort. The balanced approach is the only regulatory means of introducing operating restrictions on the grounds of noise pollution.\n\nThe Dutch government has also been considering a noise ceiling to restrict flight movements. Such legislation could lead to competitive distortions between airlines, especially if only applied to specific geographic areas.\n\n## Impact\n\nFlight limitations present a significant risk to the Group's operations  and  revenue.  Any  changes  to  noise-related LTO (Landing Take-Off) charges could increase operational  costs.  Additionally,  offering  fewer  flights  can negatively impact the relationship with our customers.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir France-KLM actively collaborates with Member States and  stakeholders  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  EU's Balanced  Approach  regulation,  which  aims  to  improve the  noise  environment  around  EU  airports  and  promote greater  compatibility  between  aviation  activities  and residential areas.\n\nIn June 2023, in The Netherlands, KLM submitted a plan, calculated  by  the  Netherlands  Aerospace  Centre  (NLR), which offers a greater reduction in noise pollution at night (18%) and exceeding the Dutch Minister's target of 15% in 2024. The KLM plan aims to reduce noise pollution by 18% at  night  and  28%  by  2026,  while  also  reducing  noise pollution more effectively in the long term. KLM (and the Air  France-KLM  group)  also  brought  together  a  broad group of Dutch airlines, knowledge institutes, manufacturing  industry,  industry  associations  and  trade unions  (31  parties  in  total)  and  has  presented  its  vision: \"Future-proof aviation for the Netherlands\" with 10 concrete commitments for the coming years, including commitments on noise.\n\nThanks  to  its  fleet  renewal  policy,  Air  France-KLM  is  not only  reducing  CO2  emissions  but  also  reducing  noise pollution.  In  2023,  100%  of  its  fleet  was  eligible  for certification  under  the  stringent  noise  level  criteria  of ICAO  chapters  4  and  14.  In  terms  of  noise  reduction capacity, new aircraft types are estimated to reduce noise by  the  following:  A350-900:  40%  less  noisy,  Airbus A320neo:  50%  less  noisy,  and  Embraer  195-E2:  63%  less noisy compared to the aircraft they replace.\n\nThe Group's airlines optimize flight routes and implement continuous descent procedures, which significantly reduce noise  pollution.  The  Group  is  committed  to  supporting governments  and  air  traffic  control  organizations  in  the rapid  and  widespread  implementation  of  continuous descent procedures at all airports.\n\nThe Group contributes to airport noise taxes and levies in France  and  The  Netherlands,  which  fund  soundproofing for homes located around airports and compensation for the loss of property value around the airport.\n\nNoise restrictions apply to Paris-Orly and Paris-Charles de Gaulle airports, with curfews, slot caps at Paris-Orly, and a noise  cap  on  night-time  slots  at  Paris-Charles  de  Gaulle, managed under the Balanced Approach.\n\nFor each of these procedures, the Group's experts are in constant  dialogue  with  residents,  airport  community representatives  and  the  authorities  as  part  of  dedicated working groups. In each case, the Group's approach aims to implement  efficient solutions, which are both sustainable  for  the  Group's  airlines  and  satisfactory  for residents.\n\n## 3.1.2.4  Air pollution*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAir  pollution  is  a  growing  health  and  environmental concern,  related  to  the  emissions  of  NOx,  SOx,  and Particulate  Matter  (PM).  In  The  Netherlands,  Schiphol Airport has secured a temporary nitrogen permit until 2025. The  Dutch  government  has  set  a  target  of  reducing nitrogen emissions by 50% by 2035, while Schiphol is aiming to be an emissions-free airport by 2030, including NOx.",

        "page_content": "## Impact\n\nAir France-KLM may face increased airport charges based on its nitrogen emissions, not just in The Netherlands, as other airports may follow.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  monitors  its  atmospheric emissions for both flight and ground operations, including low-altitude  emissions  that  impact  air  quality  around airports.  The  indicators  cover  emissions  of  SO2  and  NOx with  most  of  these  emissions  coming  from  aircraft movements.\n\nThe Group is accelerating the development of SAF, which reduces particulate matter, NOX and SOX emissions. For its ground  operations,  the  Group  uses  electric  and  more efficient  vehicles  equipment  powered  by  cleaner  fuels and  optimize  its  operational  procedures  for  ground operations,  including  minimizing  taxiing  time,  taxiing with only one engine and replacing APUs with electrical GPUs.  As  of  2023,  64%  of  Air  France-KLM  ground equipment  at  CDG,  ORY  and  SPL  was  electricallypowered.\n\nMoreover, Air France-KLM is actively involved in research on pollutants. Together with Schiphol, KLM is conducting an exploratory study into exposure to Ultrafine Particulates (UFPs) to gain more insight into the exposure of employees, and the sources of this exposure.\n\n## 3.1.2.5  Loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe  service  of  major  airports,  given  their  saturation,  is subject to obtaining slots which are allocated under the conditions  defined  by  EU  Regulation  No.  95/93.  In application  of  this  text  and  by  virtue  of  a  historical precedence, the series of slots held by an aircraft operator is reserved for it from one season to the next if the latter operates at least 80% of the relevant slots over the period in question. Below this threshold, unused slots are lost by the carrier and placed in a pool. Each year, the coordinator in  charge  of  slot  management  is  assigned  the  task  of allocating  the  released  slots  to  operators  who  request them.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe loss of slots or the non-access to slots due to volume limitations  or  saturation  could  have  an  impact  on  the companies' results or their development. As a slot lost to a competitor  is  inherently  difficult  to  recover,  the  lack  of anticipation and adaptation could lead to a reduction in market share over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe Group takes care to implement the provisions of the European  Regulation  on  the  allocation  of  slots,  which guarantees that a carrier will be able to retain the use of these  slots  from  one  season  to  the  next  once  they  have been  used  80%  of  the  time,  except  in  exceptional circumstances.  To  this  end,  a  special  effort  is  made  to monitor  changes  in  demand  and  to  anticipate  new customer expectations. The Group is thus able to adapt its offer  flexibly  to  the  variables  specific  to  each  airport, thanks  to  the  diversity  of  the  brands  in  its  portfolio.  In addition, all airlines work with their national authorities to ensure that the capacity they need for growth is regularly available at their main hubs.\n\n## 3.1.2.6  Carbon credit risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs  an  air  transport  operator,  the  Air  France-KLM  group emits  carbon  dioxide.  As  such,  it  fully  complies  with  the regulatory  measures  to  reduce  carbon  emissions  (see section  4.3.1  -  CO2  emissions).  These  include  the  EU Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (EU  ETS),  which  has  been  in force  at  European  level  since  2012  for  aviation.  In December  2022,  the  European  institutions  defined  the modalities  for  the  reform  of  the  EU-ETS  through  the revision of Directive 2003/87/EC. They confirmed the intraEuropean scope of the EU-ETS, thus reinforcing CORSIA's future role in defining clearing solutions for international flights. They  also  programmed  the  gradual  end  of allowances allocated free of charge to air operators. From 2026  onwards,  this  new  measure  will  require  the Air France-KLM  Group  to  purchase  emission  rights (credits) for all its flights to and from the European Union (intra-European flights). The clarification of the reduction trajectory for the allocation of free allowances nevertheless  makes  it  possible  to  anticipate  and  control the risk associated with this regulatory change.\n\n## Impact\n\nFor  the  year  ending  December  31,  2023,  the  Air  FranceKLM  group's  CO2  emissions  reached  24.8  million  tons (14.8  million  tons  for  Air  France  and  9.9  million  tons  for KLM),  of  which  5.53  million  tons  were  subject  to  the  EU ETS requirement (2.83m for Air France and 2.7m for KLM).\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nTo minimize the consequences  of the necessary strengthening  of  the  European  carbon  market  and  to protect  itself  against  a  potential  increase  in  the  price  of credits,  Air  France-KLM  has  implemented  two  types  of measures.\n\nOn  the  one  hand,  the  Group  is  responding  through  a proactive financial policy based on the purchase of forward credits.  This  carbon  risk  hedging  measure  is  subject  to regular  review  and  validation  by  the  Risk  Management Committee.  In  this  respect  and  considering  the  quotas allocated  in  recent  years,  Air  France  acquired  EU-ETS credits  in  2023  for  a  volume  corresponding  to  1.4  million tons  of  CO2  (Air  France  and  its  subsidiaries  only).  For  its part, in 2023 the KLM Group acquired EU ETS credits for a volume corresponding to 1.6 million tons of CO2.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In view of these developments,  the  Group  would  also  like  to  draw attention  to  the  need  to  design  a  mechanism  to  adjust carbon  emissions  at  the  European  Union's  borders.  This essential  measure  should  make  it  possible  to  avoid counter-productive phenomena such as \"carbon leakage\" that neutralize or even aggravate environmental impacts. It would  also guarantee the preservation of fair competition  rules  between  the  different  air  transport players.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Group  had  a  stock  of 10.2 million carbon credits (EU-ETS, CH-ETS, UK-ETS) on its balance-sheet, for a book value of \u20ac357.5 million.\n\n## 3.1.2.7  Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe European Union implements a Community regulation (Regulation 261/2004) on passenger protection in  the  event  of  flight  cancellations,  delays  and  denied boarding; it applies to all flights departing from an airport located within its territory, regardless of the nationality of the  airline  operating  the  flight.  It  also  applies  to  flights arriving in its territory, only when they are operated by an airline from one of its Member States. At the end of 2023 the  European  Commission  issued  a  series  of  proposals aiming  at  improving  the  experience  of  passengers  by strengthening their rights. Airlines could thus face rising costs  of  compliance  and  additional  costs  pertaining  to passenger rights and accessibility requirements. Numerous rulings by the European Court of Justice have been  handed  down  since  2004,  including  reducing  the possibilities for air carriers to invoke  \"extraordinary circumstances\"  to  exempt  themselves  from  paying  the compensation provided for in Regulation 261/2004.\n\n## Impact\n\nPassenger  rights  requirements  help  shape  the  Group's operational and  commercial  policy. Increasing the number  of  rules  for  compensation  could  have  a significant  impact  on  its  costs.  The  increase  in  costs  will then add to the already-existing distortions of competition  with  companies  from  third-party  countries, most  of  whose  activities  are  not  subject  to  the  same obligations  in  their  markets.  In  addition,  the  use  of specialized companies to collect passenger compensation has become almost systematic, making the processing of claims  more  complex  and  time-consuming,  while  they take  a  significant  share  of  the  amount  paid  out  by  the airline if the claim is justified.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe  Group  has  adapted  its  organization  and  procedures to improve its ability to handle passenger complaints. The aim is to prevent disputes and be able to comply with the regulatory deadlines in all circumstances, including in the event  of  major  disruption.  This  overhaul  of  operational processes  has  ensured  optimized  decision-making.  This has  resulted  in  more  intensive  communication  and priority  processing  of  requests  to  the  benefit  of  our customers  and  partners.  In  terms  of  regulations,  the Group has opted for a pro-active approach to the collation and use of information. Access to databases updated by IATA enables the Group to take into account the constant changes  in  regulations  worldwide  and  to  adopt  the compliance measures it deems necessary.\n\n## Specific case of major crises: feedback on the Covid crisis\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis highlighted the fact that the regulations  were  not  adapted  to  major  disruption.  The Group  supports  the  revision  of  European  regulation 261/2004,  in  particular  with  regard  to  defining  the extraordinary circumstances that would  make  the obligations of airlines more reasonable. In this respect, it participates  in  the  consultations  and  studies  regularly carried out by the authorities.\n\n## 3.1.2.8  Regulatory authorities' inquiry into the commercial cooperation agreements between carriers\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAlliance  operations  and  commercial  cooperation  are required to comply with the competition laws in force. In certain jurisdictions, the implementation of such agreements  is  subject  to  prior  review  and  clearance  by the competition authorities. In other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, airlines are required to ensure that their operations  are  compliant  with  the  applicable competition rules. At any time, the European Commission has  the  right  to  open  investigations  into  any  cases  of cooperation  it  considers  of  interest  to  the  European Community (following a complaint or self-referrals).\n\n## Impact\n\nAny  infringement  of  competition  law  could  have  a negative effect on the Group's results, business, reputation, financial position and outlook.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAlliance and commercial cooperation projects are reviewed by in-house competition counsels to assess their feasibility  and  the  potential  remedies  required  for  their implementation.",

        "page_content": "For  example,  in  May  2015,  the  Directorate  General  for Competition (DG COMP) issued a positive decision based on  Article  101  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the European Union on the former transatlantic joint-venture (between Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Alitalia).\n\nThe Commission accepted the final undertakings offered by the Parties and closed the case. This joint-venture has since  been  terminated  with  the  launch  of  the  current joint-venture  between  Air  France-KLM,  Air  France,  KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic.\n\nThe  US  and  other  worldwide  authorities  had  already published their  conclusions,  acknowledging  the  benefits for  consumers  generated  by  the  cooperation.  In  this regard, every joint-venture between Air France, KLM, Delta Air  Lines  and  their  transatlantic  partners  has  benefited from  anti-trust  immunity  (ATI)  on  departure  from  the United States since 2008.\n\n## 3.1.2.9  Commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the European Commission\n\n## Description of the risk\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nIn  2004,  a  number  of  commitments  were  made  by Air  France  and  KLM  to  ensure  compliance  with  the European  Commission's  decision  to  authorize  the merger of Air France and KLM, notably with regard to the  possibility  of  making  landing  and  takeoff  slots available to competitors at certain airports.\n\n## b) State Aid\n\nIn  2020,  the  implementation  of  the  measures  to reinforce  the  Group's  liquidity  (a  loan  guaranteed  by the  French  State  (PGE)  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac4  billion and a \u20ac3 billion loan from the French State, together with a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4 billion guaranteed by the Dutch State and a \u20ac1 billion loan from  the  Dutch  State),  were  approved  by  the European  Commission  under  the  Covid-19  State  Aid rules (decisions of May 4, 2020, annulled on December 20, 2023 by the General Court of the European Union see below under Impact, and July 13, 2020 annulled on May  19,  2021  by  the  General  Court  of  the  European Union  for  failure  to  state  reasons  and  replaced  by another positive Commission decision of July 16, 2021 correcting this failure).\n\nOn April 6, 2021, the Group announced the first part of its  overall  recapitalization  plan.  Certain  measures  in this  plan  contained  State  Aid  (so-called  'Covid-19 recapitalization\"  program)  which  were  accordingly notified  by  the  French  authorities  to  the  European Commission, the latter approving them in its decision of April 5, 2021 (annulled on December 20, 2023 by the General  Court  of  the  European  Union  -  see  below under Impact). This decision made the approval of the measures  subject  to  a  number  of  commitments undertaken  by  the  French  State  (see  section  1.2.5 above)  and  leading  notably  to  the  allocation  by Air France  of  landing  and  take-off  slots  to  a designated  third-party  carrier  at  Orly  airport.  Other\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Risk factors\n\nundertakings by the French State were also imposed on the Group companies (with the exception of KLM and  its  subsidiaries)  within  the  framework  of  the European  Commission's  Temporary  Framework  for State  Aid  (such  as  restrictions  on  acquisitions,  share buybacks and dividend payments) and could have an impact on the Group's activities. All these constraints have  disappeared  since  the  full  repayment  of  this recapitalization  aid  on  April  19,  2023  (see  \"Mitigation plan\"  below).  Only  the  provision  concerning  slots  at Orly  is  still  being  implemented  in  accordance  with the Commission's decision.\n\nLike  most  of  the  decisions  with  respect  to  airlines receiving  State  Aid  in  the  context  of  the  Covid-19 crisis, the European Commission's decisions granting support measures to Air France and KLM have been subject to annulment  proceedings  brought  by Ryanair. On December 20, 2023 and February 7, 2024, the  General  Court  of  the  European  Union  annulled the decisions of the European Commission which had approved  the  support  measures  mentioned  above, respectively in the amount of (i) \u20ac7 billion of liquidity measures granted by the French State to Air France in  May  2020  and  \u20ac3.6  billion  of  recapitalization measures granted by the French State to Air France and Air France-KLM S. A. in 2021, and (ii) \u20ac0.9 billion of liquidity measures granted to KLM by the Dutch State in 2020.\n\n## Impact\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  merger  control  or  antitrust commitments  entails  financial,  reputational  and structural risk for the Group.\n\n## b) State Aid\n\nUncertainty  remains  as  to  the  legal  and  financial consequences  of  cancelling  the  decisions  to  grant State  Aid  until  a  final  decision  or  judgment  is obtained.  However,  all  the  aid  granted  has  already been  repaid  in  full  compliance  with  the  associated constraints (commitments, behavioral measures, application of interest) to the applicable  legal framework.\n\nPotential indirect consequences of the cancellation of the  above-mentioned  state  aid  could  include  the demand for illegality interest.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  ascertained  that  the eventual  consequences  of  slot  availability  under  the 2004 remedies remain admissible and do not affect the  economics  of  the  lines  in  question.  Air  FranceKLM  also  regularly  contacts  the  Commission  to discuss  the  need  to  maintain  these  commitments adopted more than sixteen years ago. In this respect, on  February  24,  2023,  the  European  Commission lifted the commitments made by Air France and KLM in 2004 on the Paris- Amsterdam route.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Pursuant  to  the  European  Commission's decision  of  April  5,  2021,  the  Monitoring  Trustee appointed to monitor the respect of the commitments  undertaken  by  the  French  State  and the  Group  has  completed  its  mission  with  the  full repayment  of  the  recapitalization  aid  as  outlined below.  Nevertheless,  it  remains  responsible  for  the continued  implementation  of  the  above-mentioned provision of slots at Orly.\n\nA State Agent has also been appointed by the Dutch State, responsible for verifying the application of the measures  set  forth  into  the  agreement  concerning State  Aid  entered  into  with  the  Dutch  State.  On April 17, 2023, KLM concluded a new revolving credit facility linked to ESG KPIs with a pool of international financial institutions, for an amount of \u20ac1 billion. This facility  replaced  both  the  remaining  direct  loan granted  to  KLM  by  the  Dutch  State  and  the  credit facility guaranteed by the Dutch State, both of which were cancelled by KLM. Pursuant to this cancellation, the  conditions  attached  to  this  aid  no  longer  apply and, consequently, the mission of the State Agent has ended.\n\nNote also that, over the course of 2022 and 2023, the Group  repaid  the  loans  guaranteed  by  the  French\n\nState (PGE) made available to strengthen its cash and liquidity position. During the same period, the Group had already partially repaid the Covid-19 recapitalization  aid  granted  in  the  form  of  quasiequity  in  April  2021  following  the  conversion  of  the French State's direct loan of \u20ac3 billion.\n\nFinally, on March 17, 2023 and again on April 19, 2023, the  Group  repaid  and  refinanced  the  full  balance  of the  April  2021  Covid-19  recapitalization  aid  that  was subject  to  the  aforementioned  commitments  and constraints.  As  a  result,  the  Air  France-KLM  holding company and Air France are no longer liable for any Covid-19  recapitalization  aid  and  are  therefore  fully released from the aforementioned undertakings and constraints  which  had  been  linked  to  this  Covid-19 recapitalization aid.\n\nOn  March  8,  2024,  Air  France-KLM  and  Air  France lodged two appeals for annulment with the Court of Justice  of  the  European  Union  against  the  two judgments of the General Court annulling the abovementioned  decisions  handed  down  in  December 2023.  The  European  Commission  also  lodged  two appeals  on  March  1,  2024  against  these  two judgments. However, as it has done in similar cases, the  European  Commission  may  also  decide,  if necessary, to initiate a formal examination procedure, during  which  the  Group  will  defend  its  interests  to the best of its ability.\n\n## 3.1.3 Risks relating to the Group's processes\n\n## 3.1.3.1 Operational performance and customer risks*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nFor customers, operational performance is a cornerstone of the product. Growing congestion in airports, increasingly complex regulations (e.g. security and safety), potential social unrest or staff shortages within the airline industry, but also externally (air traffic control and ground handler  strikes),  fleet  unavailability  (due  to  e.g.  delays  in deliveries,  technical  quality  issues)  and  weather-related disturbance  incur  a  risk  of  sub-optimal  operational performance or a lower standard of customer service.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis  risk  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  operational performance costs and a reduction in levels of customer satisfaction,  which  could  result  in  a  negative  impact  on the Group's reputation.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nFor  both  Air  France  and  KLM,  the  Operations  Control Center is at the heart of operations and any disruption is managed  in  an  integrated  manner.  Numerous  action plans  are  deployed  on  operational  excellence,  service disruption  management  and  recovery,  security,  network\n\nagility,  fleet  management,  the  compensation  procedure (EU 261), crew management and other critical internal and external resources, and coordination with key stakeholders like the authorities and airports. The goal is to reduce the number  of  service  disruptions,  reduce  the  impact  on customers, improve customer satisfaction and reduce the costs  of  sub-optimal  performance  notably  with  the projects aimed at continuous improvements at the Hubs.\n\nIn  the  case  of  a  major  event,  a  crisis  or  emergency response organization can also be activated to handle the emergency.\n\n## 3.1.3.2  Failure of a critical IT system, IT risks and cyber-criminality\n\n## Cyber-criminality*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs  with  any  business  making  extensive  use  of  modern communication  and  IT  data  processing  technologies, including  revenue  management  systems  and  booking systems,  the  Group  is  exposed  to  threats  of  cybercriminality.\n\nTheir  heavy  dependence  on  IT  and  communication technologies makes airlines vulnerable to cyber-criminality.",

The  IT  staff dedicated to security were increased by 20% to adapt our organization to the new threats. New processes and tools were  deployed  to  detect,  protect  and  fix  any  potential deviations spotted or system vulnerabilities more rapidly. The  IT  staff  dedicated  to  cybersecurity  are  constantly trained  to  adapt  to  the  new  threats.  The  Executive Committee monitors the level of cyber awareness of the staff and takes the appropriate measures if needed.\n\n## Data security\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs airline companies, Air France and KLM collect personal data from their customers and employees. Management of the Group's assets is supported by rigorous management  of  the  required  data,  whose  consistency and  integrity  presents  a  permanent  challenge  for  IT projects, and in the operation of digital services. Frequent changes  to  both  applications  and  processes  call  for  the ongoing  adaptation  of  IT  management  tools  and methods,  in  coordination  with  the  businesses  and  third parties to include our regulatory and  operational requirements.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf the Group fails to implement such frequent changes or to  protect  data  of  a  personal  nature  pursuant  to  the relevant  laws  and  regulation,  this  could  have  a  negative impact on:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's activity;\n- \u25a0 reputation;\n- \u25a0 revenues and costs;\n- \u25a0 and thus its results.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe Group's IT division implements security rules aimed at reducing the risks related to new technologies, particularly mobile data terminals. The access controls to\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors\n\nIT  applications  and  to  the  computer  files  at  each  work station  together  with  control  over  the  data  exchanged outside  the  Company  all  comply  with  rules  pursuant  to national, European and international standards. Campaigns  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all  staff  on  the potential  threats  and  encourage  best  practices  are regularly carried out. Specialized companies and Internal Audit regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the solutions in place.\n\n## Business continuity and regulatory compliance\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe  IT  systems,  including  the  revenue  management systems and booking systems used by the Group, and the information  they  contain,  may  be  exposed  to  risks concerning  continuity  of  functioning,  data  security  and regulatory  compliance.  These  risks  have  diverse  origins both inside and outside the Group.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe  materialization  of  one  of  these  risks  could  have  an impact on the Group's activity, reputation, revenues and costs, and thus its results.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir France-KLM monitors the secure functioning of the IT systems  on  a  permanent  basis.  Dedicated  help  centers and  redundant  networks  guarantee  the  availability  and accessibility  of  data  and  IT  processing  in  the  event  of major incidents.\n\nThe infrastructures of the back-up operating centers and business continuity plans are tested regularly. The access controls  to  the  IT  systems  and  to  the  data  exchanged within the company are governed by rules which comply with international laws and standards.\n\nCompanies specializing in  IT  security,  Internal  Audit  and Internal  Control  all  regularly  evaluate  the  relevance  and effectiveness of the solutions in place.\n\nThe  risk  of  damage  to  the  IT  facilities  is  covered  by insurance policies.\n\n## 3.1.3.3  Working conditions and human capital development\n\nSocial stability and employee engagement\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe  airline  industry  has  seen  a  surge  in  air  traffic  as  of mid-2022  and,  since  then,  Air  France,  KLM  and  their subsidiaries  have  had  to  contend  with  a  high  level  of activity.  Tight  labor  conditions  in  operations  and  the pursuit of the company's transformation plans within an inflationary economic context could challenge employee engagement,  motivation  and  commitment  at  work, resulting  in  some  categories  of  staff  feeling  uncertain about the financial recognition of their efforts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regarding the inflationary context, since 2022 the Group has  maintained  its  openness  and  transparency  with  the unions, with negotiations based on relationships of trust.\n\nGiven  its  reduced  workforce,  the  Group  is  focused  on optimizing  and  transforming  its  ways  of  working,  by reviewing organizational structures and workloads. At the Group  level,  coordination  takes  place  between  the different entities, specifically for transverse topics concerning  categories  of  staff  across  several  entities. Significant changes to the HR policies and collective labor agreements  are  approved  at  the  highest  level  of management within the airlines and the Group.\n\nNarrowing the divide between the management and staff is  key  to  understanding the needs and concerns of staff, tackling  any  issues  in  a  proactive  manner  and  avoiding any  escalation.  Specific  attention  is  paid  to  remote working  that  can  result  in  reduced  contact  with colleagues and management.\n\n## Key competencies and attractivity\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nEmployees  are  at  the  heart  of  Air  France-KLM  strength and, within a context of digitalization, the use of artificial intelligence,  adaptation,  the  acquisition  of  new  and specific  skill  sets,  maintaining  internal  employability  by accelerating talent development and fostering attractivity are major priorities for the Group.\n\nMainly amongst the young generation and staff working in the airports, Air France-KLM  is  witnessing  the emergence  of  new  motivations  like  meaningful  work, flexibility  at  work  and work life balance. Given its goal of differentiating itself from the competition and reaching a high  level  of  performance,  Air  France-KLM  is  having  to contend with tight labor markets and, in some areas, skills shortages.\n\n## Impact\n\nLack of availability  of  skills  in  areas  like  Engineering  and Maintenance  or  IT  could  slow  down  the  transformation plans  or  increase  their  costs  of  transformation  while,  for operational  staff,  tight  labor  conditions  could  create workforce  planning-related  issues  given  our  plans  to increase the volume of activity.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir France-KLM has developed an ambitious HR policy to reinforce  its  attractivity  and  employer  brand,  while continuing  to  develop  its  talents  and  the  competencies and  skills  required  to  meet  its  strategic  and  operational needs. To ensure the recruitment and retention of specific profiles,  the  Group  is  supported  by  its  employer  values including Diversity and Inclusion, while high-level management  teams  are  involved  in  the  reinforced identification of talent and succession planning.\n\nThe Group continues to invest in training and employee development thanks to dedicated interviews and individual  development  plans  aiming  at  supporting  and opening up career path opportunities.\n\nThe Group's entities have invested in predictive models to support  improved  workforce  planning,  specifically  for critical categories of staff.\n\nThe Air France-KLM group has reinforced its partnerships with third-party education players and external companies, to be able to support the development of new professions and outsource some services when required.\n\n3.1.3.4  Non-compliance with regulations, including competition, data protection, trade compliance and export control, anti-corruption and duty of vigilance laws\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nMultiple  and  increasingly-complex  laws  and  regulations are  applicable  to  our  operations  as  the  Air  France-KLM group operates worldwide.\n\nSome laws require specific programs to be designed with mandatory measures to be implemented and monitored such  as  the  French  Duty  of  Vigilance  Act  or  the  French Anti-Corruption Act of December 9, 2016 (so called 'Sapin 2 Law'). The existence and efficacy of the anti-corruption programs  are  subject  to  monitoring  by  the  regulatory authorities.\n\nAt the EU level, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (so called 'CSDDD') will soon be adopted since the Parliament and  the  Council  reached  political agreement on the text on December 14, 2023.\n\nThere  is  increasing  scrutiny  by  local  authorities  of  the organizations required to comply with these regulations.\n\nSince  Air  France-KLM  is  a  listed  company,  it  is  also required  to  comply  with  the  rules  imposing  mandatory notifications  and  registrations  to  prevent  insider  trading and market manipulation.",

This documentation is regularly reviewed and updated.\n\n## 3.1.4 Legal risks related to litigation\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nDuring  their  ordinary  course  of  business,  the  Group's companies  may  be  involved  in  legal,  administrative, criminal, or arbitration proceedings, especially concerning civil liability, competition, compliance (ethics, data privacy, export  control),  industrial,  fiscal,  social  or  intellectual property  claims,  or  claims  relating  to  the  environment and  discrimination.  In  some  of  these  proceedings, significant  monetary  claims  have  been  made  or  may  be made against one or more Group companies. The relevant provisions, if any, that the Group may have to record in its financial  statements  may  not  be  sufficient,  which  could have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  its  business,  financial position, results and outlook. As of December 31, 2023, the Group's  total  provisions  for  litigation  amounted  to \u20ac516  million  (see  Note  30  in  section  5.3  \"Notes  to  the consolidated financial statements\"). With the exception of the proceedings and litigation outlined in Notes 30.1 and 30.2  in  section  5.3  \"Notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements\",  there  are  no  other  administrative,  legal  or arbitration proceedings (including, to the Group's knowledge,  any  proceedings  under  way  or  threats  of proceedings)  that  could  have  or  have  recently  had  a material  effect  on  the  Group's  financial  position  or profitability in the past twelve months.\n\nNew  proceedings,  stemming  from  existing  proceedings or  otherwise,  related  to  risks  already  identified  by  the Group or to new risks, could be initiated against a Group entity.\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nIt  also  launches  e-learning  campaigns  covering  each domain of compliance for a wide range of employees and specific  training  set  up  for  categories  of  staff  with  highrisk exposure.\n\nA  team  of  experts  provides  advice  and  guidance  on contracts and projects.\n\nThe Air France-KLM group has also implemented tools for the  screening  of  contracting  partners  with  respect  to (i)  ethics,  (ii)  trade  sanctions  and  (iii)  the  monitoring  of transactions involving sensitive materials (military, dual use).\n\nAn  internal  tool  compiles  insider  lists,  publishes  any  ad hoc  announcements  relating  to  privileged  information and  black-out  periods,  and  shares  information  on  the relevant policies and  projects, and  the  applicable processes,  via  information  letters  relating  to  corporate matters.\n\n## Impact\n\nShould  these  proceedings  result  in  an  unfavorable outcome, there could be a significant adverse reputational effect on the Group's business, and also on its financial position, results and outlook.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nTraining  and  guidelines  are  provided  by  the  legal department  for  the  relevant  teams  to  enable  them  to anticipate any risks of litigation based on experience and changes  in  legislation.  The  ongoing  procedures  are regularly monitored and analyzed by the legal department,  with  the  support  of  external  legal  counsel where necessary.\n\nIf  necessary,  provisions  may  be  recorded  in  the  Group's financial  statements  in  respect  of  these  disputes.  The Group's  estimate  of  its  financial  exposure  to  pending proceedings is regularly reassessed in the light of changes in such proceedings, and the amount of the corresponding  provisions  is  adjusted  accordingly  to  the best  of  the  Group's  knowledge.  These  amounts  are  also reviewed and validated by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nCertain risks relating to these procedures are also covered, under certain conditions, by the insurance policies taken out by the Companies and outlined in section 3.2.1.\n\nSee  also  'Highlights  of  the  beginning  of  the  2023 financial year'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However,  equity (\u20ac500 million at the end of 2023) remains lower than its 2019 level.\n\n## Impact\n\nAs  a  consequence,  in  the  context  of  a  potential  severe crisis  that  would  incur  material  losses,  Air  France-KLM's equity  could  be  negatively  impacted,  leading  to  a deterioration  in  its  balance  sheet  and  credit  profile,  and limiting  its  access  to  the  capital  markets  at  an  optimal financing cost.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nIn  recent  years  and  following  the  Covid  crisis,  the Air France-KLM  group  has  implemented  a  major recapitalization plan in several stages, including a capital increase, a rights issue and hybrid issuances to, combined with strong net results, fully restore its equity. The latest equity-building  operation  was  the  issue  by  the  Group's new  subsidiary, Flying Blue Miles, amounting  to \u20ac1,500 million of perpetual notes, which qualify as equity.\n\nIn addition, the Group reported a robust liquidity position of  \u20ac10.5  billion  of  available  cash  at  the  end  of  2023 (including \u20ac2.3 billion of undrawn and unsecured RCFs at Air  France-KLM,  Air  France  and  KLM),  and  a  net  debt/ EBITDA ratio reduced to 1.2x at the end of 2023.\n\nIn December 2023, these strong financial metrics enabled the  Air  France-KLM  group  to  publish  inaugural  credit ratings  which  are  BBB-  /Stable  Outlook  ('Investment Grade')  at  FitchRatings  and  BB+/Stable  Outlook  at  S&P Global.  These  ratings  reflect  the  full  recognition  and  the strong confidence from the credit agencies in Air France-\n\nKLM's credit profile. This tool will also support diversified access to the financial markets.\n\nTo  further  strengthen  its  balance  sheet,  the  Air  FranceKLM  group  is  pursuing  its  operational  transformation launched in  2019  to  further  improve  its  profitability.  This profitability  turnaround  will  enable  the  Group  to  see  its equity grow significantly in the coming years.\n\n## 3.1.5.2  Currency risks\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nMost of Air France-KLM's revenues are generated in euros. However,  owing  to  its  international  activities,  the  Group incurs currency exchange risks:\n\n- \u25a0 the  Group's  main  exposure  relates  to  the  US  dollar. Since  expenditures  on  items  such  as  fuel  and maintenance exceed the amount of overall revenues in US  dollars,  the  Group  is  a  net  buyer  of  US  dollars, representing a residual structural risk;\n- \u25a0 the Group is a net seller of other currencies. The level of its  revenues  in  currencies  other  than  the  US  dollar exceeds  its  expenditures  in  the  same  currencies.  This exposure  is,  however,  much  lower  than  with  the  US dollar.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe currency exchange volatility implies volatility  on  the Group's financial results:\n\n- \u25a0 any significant appreciation in the US dollar against the euro could result in a negative impact on the Group's financial results;\n- \u25a0 a significant decline in the other currencies against the euro could also have a negative effect on the Group's financial results.\n\n## Operational exposure ('Transaction risk')\n\n| (in millions of currencies at December 31, 2023)   | US Dollar   | GB Sterling   | Yen      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|\n| Net position before hedging                        | (2,403)     | 753           | 45,644   |\n| Currency hedge                                     | 1,570       | (349)         | (19,000) |\n| Net position after hedging                         | (833)       | 404           | 26,644   |\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe  currency  risk  management  for  the  Group's  airline subsidiaries  is  centralized  within  each  airline  company while  the  currency  risks  incurred  in  investments  by  the Group's  holding  company  are  managed  at  the  holding company level.\n\nThe  risk  management  of  the  Group's  overall  currency exposure  is  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  a  forecast  net\n\nexposure for each currency. Currencies highly correlated to the US dollar are usually aggregated with the US dollar exposure.\n\nFor each currency hedged, the time span of the hedging is  a  rolling  12  to  24-month  period,  the  first  four  quarters being relatively more hedged than the following four. The RMC sets  hedging  targets  for  the  US  dollar,  UK  sterling and the Japanese yen on a quarterly basis.",

        "page_content": "## 3.1.5.3  Liquidity investment risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe cash resources of Air France-KLM, Air France and KLM are  invested so as to maximize the return for a very low level  of  risk.  They  are  invested  mainly  in  money  market mutual funds but also, secondarily, in debt securities and term deposits with highly-rated banks.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe  investment  risk  is  considered  to  be  low  in  that  the investments  in  debt  securities  and  term  deposits  are managed within the framework of the overall counterparty management (see paragraph 3.1.5.7).\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir France-KLM only invests in money market funds which are  managed  by  reputable  asset  managers,  which  have been selected according to strict criteria. With respect to investments in debt securities or term deposits, the latter have  to  be  issued  by  highly-rated  banks.  The  eligible banks are monitored on a quarterly basis by the RMC.\n\n## 3.1.5.4  Foreign exchange risk on debt valuation\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nA  portion  of  Air  France-KLM's  debt  is  denominated  in foreign currencies, mainly as a result of the recognition of aircraft operating leases, most of which are denominated in USD, in the Group's debt (IFRS 16 lease debt). The book value of this foreign currency debt is sensitive to changes in exchange rates.\n\n## Impact\n\nSignificant changes  in  exchange  rates  could  have material  impact  on  the  book  value  of  Air  France-KLM's debt.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAt  the  accounting  level,  the  US  dollar  lease  debt  is recognized as a natural hedge of a fraction of the Group's US dollar revenues.\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors\n\nFor  airlines  in  the  Group  not  generating  US  dollar revenues,  US  dollar-denominated  assets  and  currency hedges are in place to mitigate the exchange risk rate.\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  on  the  debt  is  limited  due  to the fact  that,  at  December  31,  2023,  aside  from  the  debt relating to the operating leases, the debt denominated in currencies  other  than  the  euro  mostly  concerns  the  yen (7%), the US dollar (6%) and the Swiss franc (4%).\n\nNote  that  the  natural  hedging  relationship,  which  was temporarily  suspended  due  to  the  Covid-19  crisis,  was reinstated during the 2022 financial year.\n\nTo reduce the currency risk on the debt, a portion of KLM's liquid assets is invested in bonds in foreign currencies.\n\n## 3.1.5.5  Interest rate risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nA  portion  of  the  overall  gross  debt  is  raised  at  floating rates (aircraft financing notably).\n\n## Impact\n\nInterest rate variations could  generate  volatility  in financial expenses.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe Group uses interest rate swaps or options to convert a portion  of  this  floating-rate  debt  into  fixed  rate  debt  on the different tenors.\n\nAfter  hedging,  the  exposure  to  floating  rates  represents 16%  of  the  Group's  consolidated  debt  (excluding  lease debt) at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  interest  rate  on  the  Group's  gross  debt  (excluding lease  debt)  after  swaps  stood  at  3.63%  at  December  31, 2023  (versus  2.97%  at  December  31,  2022)  excluding guarantee fees (if any).\n\nThis risk is treated with a cost of carry approach, netting the financial products earned on the cash invested.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  assess  the  financial  situation  of  its counterparties, the Group relies on information shared by the counterparties and on any available public information  on  these  counterparties  and  meaningful  to inform the analysis.\n\nMonitoring & Reporting: a maximum commitment scale is applied  by  counterparty  based  on  the  quality  of  their financial  situation.  The  total  exposure  (overall  hedging portfolios  added  to  investments  consolidated  for  the whole of the Air France-KLM group) must remain below the prescribed limit. The  RMC  also  monitors  the percentages each counterparty represents in the portfolios to ensure permanently appropriate balances.\n\nThe Group monthly report is established and circulated to the members of the General Management.\n\nIn  the  event  of  any  financial  risks  incurred  relating  to counterparties, it is supplemented by real time information.\n\nNote that investments in mutual funds incur risk that is deemed  to  be  negligible thanks to their broad diversification and the regulatory provisions applicable to such investments.",

It thus aims to create and preserve value, and to safeguard the Group's assets and reputation.\n\nEach  Group  entity  is  responsible  for  managing  its  risks and for producing regular reports.\n\nThe  overall  risk  management  process  also  serves  as  a basis for the Universal Registration Document and makes a  major  contribution  to  establishing  the  annual  audit program.\n\nAs a facilitator of risk management, Group Internal Audit regularly  evaluates  the  risk  management  process.  Its conclusions are the subject of presentations to the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee, and for extra-financial risks to the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee. The conclusions of the Sustainable  Development  and  Compliance  Committee are taken into account by Group Internal Audit in the risk presentations made to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee monitors the management of financial market risks that could have an impact  on  the  financial  statements  (fuel  price,  currency exposure, interest rate risks.) on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe risk management process complies with international regulatory  standards  including  the  European  Union 8 th Directive.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  usual  insurance  policies  covering  the industrial  sites,  the  real  estate  assets  and  the  ancillary activities,  the  Group's  subsidiaries  subscribe  to  specific airline insurance policies covering accidental or incidental damage  to  aircraft  and  the  resulting  costs,  liability  in relation  to  their  passengers  and  general  liability  to  third parties in connection with their activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  risk  management  procedures  are outlined  for  each  risk,  together  with  the  residual  risk which  is  likely  to  result  after  taking  the  implemented internal control measures into account.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nGroup Internal  Audit  produces  a  biannual  report  for  the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee on the Group's operational risks. The Audit Committee may decide  to  draw  specific  points  to  the  attention  of  the Board of Directors. Reporting on strategic risks is part of the Strategic process.\n\nThe operational risk  reporting  process  follows  a  bottomup  process  starting  in  the  different  Air  France  and  KLM divisions and the principal subsidiaries. Every half year the Enterprise Risk Coordinators, who have been designated by  the  different  businesses,  entities  and  subsidiaries, establish the risk sheets and send them to Group Internal Audit, the latter being responsible for their consolidation at airline and Group level.\n\nThe  risk  sheets  indicate  and  describe  the  inherent material risks and the action plans implemented for their mitigation  or  neutralization,  together  with  an  evaluation of  their  probability  of  occurrence  and  the  resulting impact.  The  risk  owners  and  those  responsible  for  the procedures  to  control  risks  are  specifically  named.  To\n\nensure  the  reliability  of  the  process,  the  risk  sheets  for each  entity  are  systematically  reviewed  during  regular meetings between Group Internal Audit and the relevant Executive Vice-Presidents.\n\nThe  Group's  operational  risk  sheets  (summarizing  the operational  risks  of  the  entities),  which  detail  any  new risks or those which have been withdrawn, and the main changes, are approved by the Group Executive Committee prior to their presentation and review by the Audit Committee.\n\nTo  be  able  to  complete  the  Extra-Financial  Performance Statement (see section 4.1.3 'Business responsibility at the heart of the strategy'), the main environmental, social and societal  risks,  linked  to  the  Group's  activities  across  the entire  value  chain,  are  reviewed  and  assessed  annually.

This division submits to the Group Executive Committee  and  the  Board  the  Group's  overall  financial policy  and  orientations  (the  latter  being  applied  at  the level of the Group's two principal companies, which each have their own financial functions) and tracks the Group's financial performance.\n\nIn  addition,  some  operations  relating  to  the  Air  FranceKLM holding company are entrusted to Air France, via a management mandate (notably treasury management).\n\n## Insurance functions\n\nThe insurance functions are responsible for identifying atrisk sectors  of  the  Group  that  might  impact  the operations  and  financial  results,  so  as  to  reduce  their potential  impact  or  transfer  them  either  to  insurers through  insurance  policies,  particularly  aviation  policies, or to third parties under contractual mechanisms.\n\nThey  also  manage  the  claims  and  advise  the  Group's entities on reducing and controlling their risks.\n\nThere  is  an  aviation  insurance  policy  in  place  for  the Air France Group and the KLM Group to cover civil liability, damage to aircraft and risks of war, which constitute the major financial and legal risks of any airline.\n\n## Legal functions\n\nThe legal departments of Air France-KLM, Air France and KLM perform a consulting mission for their management and  decentralized  organizations,  notably  in  the  areas  of corporate  law,  competition  law,  transportation  law, contract  law  and  insurance  law.  They  cooperate  to establish the Group's legal policy.\n\nLegal  Affairs  draws  up  a  systematic  inventory  of  the disputes  in  process,  to  be  able  to  assess  the  risks  and constitute the corresponding  provisions  booked  as liabilities.\n\n## Compliance functions\n\nThe Air France-KLM group has deployed an organization dedicated to compliance.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  Compliance  department,  which reports to the Air France-KLM Corporate Secretary's office, and is headed by the VP Group Compliance Officer, is in charge  of  anti-corruption  and  business  ethics,  personal data  protection  and  trade  compliance.  In  coordination with the airlines' and subsidiaries' compliance teams, the Air France-KLM  Compliance  department  is  notably responsible for defining the compliance programs for the Air France-KLM  group,  assisting  the  businesses  in deploying  them  and  monitoring  their  effectiveness  as part of a continuous improvement process.\n\nAir  France-KLM  provides  training  on  the  anti-corruption Code  of  Conduct  through  e-learning  campaigns  on  a regular  basis  and  annual  in-class  training  sessions  on business  ethics  issues  and  the  operating  guidelines  for the day-to-day activities.\n\nAir  France-KLM  conducts  risk  assessment  on  human rights/sustainable  issues  internally,  and  on  its  suppliers and  service  providers  as  part  of  its  vigilance  plan (including evaluation and corrective measures).\n\nAll business ethics incidents raised through the reporting lines  are  investigated  by  the  dedicated  teams  and corrective actions are then implemented in response.\n\nThe  compliance  teams  are  supported  by  a  network  of compliance  coordinators  appointed  in  the  activities  or departments and subsidiaries.

The  conclusions  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and Compliance  Committee  on  the  review  of  the  extrafinancial  risks  are  then  taken  into  account  by  Internal Audit in the risk presentations made to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nTo  execute  its  mission,  Internal  Audit,  which  operates within  the  framework  of  the  internal  Audit  Charter established  by  the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Air  FranceKLM group, either acts on its own initiative or intervenes at  the  request  of  the  Group  Executive  Committee,  the Audit  Committee,  the  Sustainable  Development  and Compliance Committee or the Board of Directors.\n\nAn annual audit program is established and submitted for approval  to  the  Group  Executive  Committee  and  to  the Audit Committee of Air France-KLM.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  function  performs  the  following activities:\n\n- 1. assurance engagements:\n- \u00b7 operational Audit: to review the effectiveness, efficiency and general control over processes,\n- \u00b7 information  and  Communication  Technologies  or Electronic Data Processing (EDP) Audit: to assess the effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  internal  controls related to information and communication systems,\n- \u00b7 compliance  Audit:  to  check  compliance  with  laws and regulations and/or standards, procedures and/or policies issued by the Group, and\n- \u00b7 Post audit: to check follow-up on findings in previous assurance engagements;\n- 2. consulting  engagements: advisory services performed at  the  specific  request  of  the  business  management. When performing advisory services, the Group Internal Audit  function  must  maintain  its  objectivity  and  not take management responsibility;\n- 3. other activities:\n- \u00b7 fraud investigations: to prevent, detect and investigate significant suspected internal or external fraudulent activities,\n- \u00b7 Enterprise Risk Management:  to  facilitate  and improve the process of risk management,\n- \u00b7 other activities related to audit work.\n\nOnce  completed,  the  conclusions  of  the  assurance engagements  are  summarized  in  a  report  highlighting the findings, the risks and the corresponding recommendations. For consulting engagements or other activities, a report is issued in which  the  main recommendations and/or observations are included.\n\nThe  audited  entities  are  required  to  establish  remedial action  plans.  Internal  Audit  provides  follow-up  on  the implementation  of  the  action  plans  by  the  action holder(s).\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Organization and functioning of internal control\n\nIn  2023,  the  Internal  Audit  department  successfully concluded its recertification which was performed by the IFACI Certification Team. This external quality assessment concluded that Air France-KLM's Internal Audit Generally Conformed  with  all  the  10  Core  Principles  for  the Professional Practices of Internal Auditing.\n\n## Organization of responsibilities\n\nThe  organization  of  the  individual  companies  has  been defined  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  principles  of secure  and  effective  operations.  It  specifically  takes  into account  the  regulatory  requirements  governing  air transportation, notably with regard to air operations (see section  3.2.2  'Identification  and  evaluation  of  the  risks'), ground operations and engineering and maintenance, as well as airline catering and security.\n\nThe managers of the relevant entities and subsidiaries are required  to  apply  these  principles  and  organization  at their  level,  and  to  ensure  that  the  organizational  charts, job  descriptions  and  procedures  defined  by  business process  are  up  to  date.  They  must  ensure  their consistency and adequacy, verify that they are taken into account in the main information systems and appropriately integrated within the organization.\n\n## Internal Control tools\n\n## Charters and manuals\n\nAir  France,  KLM  and  their  respective  subsidiaries  have  a Social Rights and Ethics Charter entitled the 'Air FranceKLM Principles' that enshrines their individual commitments  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  by orienting  their  corporate  and  ethical  policy  towards respect  for  individuals  at  the  professional,  social  and citizenship levels.\n\nThe Air France Group deploys a Charter for the prevention of  harassment  in  the  workplace,  which  complies  with French  legislation  and  is  part  of  a  contractual  approach through agreements signed for the benefit of employees. The  legal  purpose  of  this  Charter  is  to  set  forth  the principles of prevention, define the actions, stress everyone's  individual  legal  and  human  responsibilities, and establish internal prevention procedures.\n\nFor  its  part,  the  KLM  Group  has  published  a  Code  of Conduct  addressing  the  following  principal  matters: compliance  with  laws  and  regulations,  conflicts  of interest, confidentiality, the safeguarding  of  assets, environmental protection, Corporate Social Responsibility and intellectual property.\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  have  a  Code  of  Ethics  intended principally for employees in the finance function (see also section 4.5.3 'Business ethics').\n\n## Other activities related to audit work\n\nOnce  carried  out,  the  conclusions  of  the  assurance missions  are  summarized  in  a  report  highlighting  the findings,  risks  and  corresponding  recommendations.  For consulting  missions  or  other  activities,  a  report  is  drawn up in which the main recommendations  and/or observations are included.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This external quality assessment concluded that Air France-KLM's Internal Audit generally complies  with  the  10  fundamental  principles  governing professional internal audit practices.\n\n## Manuals to prevent non-compliance\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  employees  have  access  to  a series of manuals and policies on the intranet sites. With regard to the prevention of corruption, the anti-corruption Code  of  Conduct  and  its  associated  policies  affirm  the Air  France-KLM  group's  commitment  to  conducting business with loyalty, fairness, transparency, honesty and integrity, and in the strict respect of anti-corruption laws wherever the Group or its subsidiaries are registered and exercise  their  activities.  The  anti-corruption  Code  of Conduct  establishes the guidelines for preventing corruption,  and  for  identifying  and  handling  at-risk situations  in  the  light  of  the  anti-corruption  legislation with  examples  derived  from  risk  mapping  or  reported dilemmas.  These  documents  are  subject  to  regular reviews for updates and improvements  whenever needed.\n\nThe  Competition  Law  Compliance  Manual  emphasizes the objectives of integrity and transparency, and contains instructions on the prevention of anti-competitive agreements  and  the  abuse  of  market  power.  For  more detail, see section 4.5.2 'Organization and key elements of the ethics and compliance programs'.\n\n## Internal Audit Charter\n\nIn 2023, the Air France-KLM group's Internal Audit Charter was  signed  by  the  Group's  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the Chair of the Group Audit Committee and the Head of the Group Internal Audit function.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Charter  defines  the  mission  of  the Group  Internal Audit function and  guarantees  its independence as well as the conditions under which the function operates.\n\nIn accordance with the International Professional Practices  Framework  (IPPF),  issued  by  the  Institute  of Internal Auditors (IIA), the Charter formalizes the position of audit within the company and defines its mandates.\n\n## Internal Control Charter\n\nThe Internal Control Charter defines the commitments of the three top executives of Air France-KLM, Air France and KLM,  and  stipulates  the  main  components  of  internal control  within  the  Group:  governance  and  the  most important  tools  enabling  its  exercise,  an  outline  of  the\n\noverall Internal Control process and the different Internal Control activities (verification of the entity's environment, transactional controls (process) and overall IT control).\n\n## Procurement Manual\n\nThe  organization  of  the  Procurement  function  common to  Air  France  and  KLM  is  outlined  in  the  Procurement Manual.\n\nThe Procurement function regularly updates the Quality reference  system.  This  reference  system  comprises, notably,  the  purchasing  Code  of  Ethics  for  Employees, which stipulates the rules of conduct for Air France-KLM buyers  when dealing with suppliers  or  service  providers, and informs all those involved in the process of the limits that must not be exceeded.\n\n## Quality reference system\n\nThe Air France and KLM quality management systems are based  on  the  following  principal  external  and  internal standards:\n\n## \u25a0 External standards\n\nOperations:  European  regulations  and  the  applicable general laws, international standards (ICAO, IATA, etc.) or  those  that  are  specific  to  aeronautics  maintenance (Part 145, etc.).\n\nPassenger  service:  European  and  US  regulations (Special  Care  Passengers),  service  commitments  of those involved in air transportation (airports).\n\nManagement,  the  environment,  documentation,  food safety,  health  and  safety  in  the  workplace:  ISO  series 9001, 14001, 15489, 22000 and ISO 45001.\n\n## \u25a0 Internal standards\n\nThese  represent  the  application  of  the  external standards, adapted to the processes of each company.\n\nRegulatory  level:  operating,  maintenance  and  safety manuals,  etc.,  and  the  related  general  procedures, which  are  mostly  subject  to  formal  approval  by  the administrative  authorities  issuing  the  authorizations (DGAC, IVW-DL, FAA, etc.).\n\nManagement  systems:  the  Air  France  Integrated Management System/IMS Manual and the KLM Safety Management  System/Manual,  together with the related  general  procedures  like  the  Quality-SafetyEnvironment  manuals  of  the  entities,  the  manual  on health  and  safety  in  the  workplace,  Flight  Safety management, environmental management, management of the Company's food hygiene, together with the related general procedures.\n\nPassenger  service:  standards,  services  signatures,  the five  attitudes,  the  PAMs  (Passenger  Airport  Manuals), the  general  sale  and  after-sales  conditions,  together with  the  other  procedures  associated  with  customer service common to Air France and KLM.",

The certification is valid until February 4, 2025,\n- \u00b7 Air  France  global  IMS  certification  based  on  the ISO 14001 (environment) and ISO 22000 (food safety) renewal audit in April 2023. The certification is valid until September 2026;\n- \u25a0 for KLM:\n- \u00b7 the  ISO  14001/Environment  and  ISO  50001/Energy certifications were renewed in 2021,\n- \u00b7 IOSA  certification  (IATA  Operational  Safety  Audit): The  audit  was  performed  in  November  2022  and  is valid until March 2025; it will be renewed in 2024.\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nControl over the operational processes is based primarily on three monitoring methods:\n\n- a) internal  monitoring  is  carried  out  by  the  quality assurance departments articulated around:\n- \u00b7 an  audit  and  inspection  program  (covering,  in particular,  organization  and  management,  flight operations,  in-flight  service,  flight  planning,  ground handling and freight, hazardous merchandise, engineering and maintenance),\n- \u00b7 regular  monitoring  of  operations  with  incident analysis and routine use of debriefing,\n- \u00b7 proactive prevention processes;\n- b) external monitoring is carried out by the Civil Aviation Authorities  (IVW-DL,  DGAC,  FAA,  etc.)  and  specialized certification bodies, and takes the form of audits of the operating  principles  and  of  the  Group's  proprietary internal  monitoring  system.  Air  France  and  KLM  are also regularly audited by their customers and partners.\n\n## Monitoring of partners\n\nControl over sub-contractors and suppliers is undertaken within  the  framework  of  the  regulatory  monitoring program approved by the Civil Aviation Authorities.\n\nCode  share  partnerships  are  subject  to  an  additional requirement  to  comply  with  IOSA  standards  that  are recognized by the profession as the ultimate reference in Flight  Safety  and  Security.  The  general  rule  is  that partners  are  IOSA  certified  except  in  the  specific  case when, for example, the size of aircraft excludes the airline from the IOSA scope. In this case, the partner airline is not IOSA  certified,  Air  France  and  KLM  implement  a  special technical  monitoring  process  aimed  at  providing  a reasonable assurance of an equivalent level.\n\nIn  terms  of  control  over  the  monitoring  process,  the supervision of the effective implementation of preventive/ remedial actions resulting from this overall monitoring is ensured by the quality assurance departments, coordinated within each airline.\n\nMore  generally,  the  sub-contractor  control  procedure addresses  all  the  areas  of  risk.  It  is  reflected  in  the realization of monitoring activities like audits, inspections and checks, sometimes carried out by the sub-contractors themselves. Monitoring is ensured on a quarterly basis. An expanded  transverse  action  plan  is  in  place,  taking  into consideration the new legislation on the duty of vigilance. More globally an action plan covering the monitoring of sub-contractor  activity  is  deployed  in  the  different Air France-KLM entities and coordinated at the corporate transverse level in dedicated steering committees.\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe  control  procedures  cover  the  information  and telecommunication systems.\n\nThese procedures aim to ensure the:\n\n- \u25a0 reliability of the IT and telecommunications systems;\n- \u25a0 integrity of the data through the appropriate resources, infrastructure and checks;\n- \u25a0 continuity of IT services and the availability of data at the  production  sites  through  a  local  contingency strategy,  secure  architecture  and  a  security  system covering external access points;\n- \u25a0 confidentiality of information within the framework of national  laws  and  the  security  of  IT  infrastructures through  the  establishment  of  secure,  monitored  and effective accesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

Air France-KLM has adopted  an  'Agile'  development  process  based  on  the SCRUM and DEVOPS methodologies. The main aims are to  generate  business  line  added  value  more  rapidly, accelerate  'Time  to  Market',  align  IT  and  business  line objectives by prioritizing value, avoiding the development of  rarely-used  functionalities,  reducing  the  risks  at  the earliest-possible opportunity, streamlining the development and maintenance processes and increasing the effectiveness of the teams.\n\nThe work carried out in connection with Internal Control projects and the ongoing project to gradually establish a coordinated and optimized organization is leading to the launch  of  action  plans  designed  to  strengthen  Internal Control,  particularly  with  regard  to  risks  like  business continuity and personal data protection.\n\nThe Group's Information Technology division defines the policies  establishing  the  framework  for  the  functioning, security  and  consistency  of  the  information  systems deployed  and  has  published  a  Security  Information Manual  (ISM  -  ISO  27001  standard),  establishing  a common security policy for information systems.\n\n## Procurement\n\nThe  common Air France-KLM Procurement organization has  been  operational  since  September  1,  2008,  and  is headed by a Group Chief Procurement Officer from KLM, seconded  by  an  Air  France  Senior  Vice-President, Procurement. It is structured around seven procurement teams. These procurement teams act in a transverse and coordinated  manner  for  each  of  the  Air  France-KLM group, Air France and KLM as well as for, when required, a number of the Group's airline subsidiaries.\n\nThe activity  of  the  Procurement  function  aims  to  supply the  entities  with  suitable  products  and  services  at  the required time, at the best possible cost of ownership and at the lowest possible risks.\n\nThis is achieved by applying a procurement policy focused on the expertise of the buyers, with separate responsibilities (buyer, prescriber and  supplier), the establishment  of  contracts  and  the  use  of  various (electronic) tools.\n\nThe CPO Board, comprising the Group Chief Procurement Officer  from  KLM and Air France's Senior Vice-President, Procurement, coordinates the Procurement teams through regular meetings and presents the procurement performance  and  developments  to  the  CFOs  on  a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Heads of Procurement meet on a regular basis in the different  structures  (e.g.  the  Quarterly  Air  France-KLM\n\nDPO  Meeting,  a  Quarterly  Performance  Meeting,  direct meetings between Heads, etc.) to develop joint programs and share best practices.\n\nTo assess the risks related to sustainability (environmental,  ethics,  procurement,  social)  vendors  are analyzed and  evaluated by EcoVadis, a company mandated by Air France-KLM, with the emphasis on highrisk  segments  such  as  production  in  low-cost  countries, and  with  a  minimum  score  requirement.  In  addition,  all procurement-managed  vendors  are  required  to  commit to a Code  of  Conduct,  reflecting  Air  France-KLM's sustainability  requirements.  In  addition,  high-emitting suppliers  are  required  to  conduct  a  CDP  (Carbon Disclosure Project) Assessment resulting in a clear insight into the environmental impact of these suppliers.\n\nAll new vendors are assessed on their level of financial risk on  the  basis  of  the  Dun  &  Bradstreet  evaluation.  Risk reduction strategies are required for vendors with a high level of financial risk.\n\nNew  and  existing  vendors  are  also  screened  on  any possible trade regulation-related risks through a dedicated application known as 'Accuity'.\n\nAeronautical suppliers in the Engineering & Maintenance area are required to re-register and re-qualify every three years.  During  the  registration  and  qualification  process they  are  required  to  share  extensive  documentation (including  certificates  as  proof  of  their  compliance  with external  regulations)  to  secure  full  qualifications  as  a vendor for Air France-KLM.\n\nAdditionally, to reduce the risks at Air France-KLM level, all contracts  with  vendors  include  clauses  on  anti-bribery, personal data handling and other relevant risk areas.\n\nLastly,  in  2022,  Air  France-KLM  Procurement  Strategy  & Services  (PSS)  established  a  holistic  Risk  Management Framework  to  describe  all  the  risks  related  to  the procurement  activities along with their mitigation processes & supporting tools.\n\n## Prevention of ticketing fraud\n\nA fraud prevention  organization  is  responsible  for preventing, insofar as possible, the risks relating to the:\n\n- \u25a0 fraudulent  use  of  illegally-purchased  tickets  (credit cards and other means of payment);\n- \u25a0 protection of loyalty programs (individual and corporate clients) in terms of both earn and burn;\n- \u25a0 internal fraud.\n\nA  fraud  prevention  activity  report  was  submitted  to  the Audit Committee in October 2023.\n\nBoth Air France and KLM have put in place whistle-blower procedures and an e-learning anti-fraud training module aimed mainly at the sales teams.",

Both  Air  France  and  KLM carry out an annual Fraud Risk Assessment.\n\n## RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOrganization and functioning of internal control\n\n## Evaluation and monitoring of Internal Control\n\nWhen establishing its internal control framework and risk management  process,  Air  France-KLM  chose  the  COSO 2013  (Committee  Of  Sponsoring  Organisation  of  the Treadway  Commission)  standard  and  the  COBIT  5 (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology) as its starting point.\n\n## 3.3.3 Internal control relating to the establishment and processing of financial and accounting information\n\nBased  on  an  analysis  of  the  significant  entries  in  the consolidated  financial  statements  and  an  assessment  of the risks, the airlines have identified the most significant divisions and subsidiaries and, within these divisions, the processes  that  make  a  predominant  contribution  to  the establishment of the financial statements.\n\nThe  Group's  major  divisions  and  subsidiaries  had  thus evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  their  Internal  Control relating to financial information as at December 31, 2023.\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  823-19  of  the Code  de  Commerce , the  Audit  Committee  oversees  the  process  to  establish the financial information and, when necessary, formulates recommendations  to  guarantee  the  integrity  of  the process  to  establish  the  financial information, the effectiveness of the Internal Control and risk management  procedures  and,  as  necessary,  of  Internal Audit, as regards the procedures required to establish and process the accounting and financial information, with no compromise  to  its  independence.  It  also  ensures  the realization by the Statutory Auditors of their mission and respect  by  the  Statutory  Auditors  of  the  conditions  for their independence.\n\n## Financial procedures and processes and the accounting year end\n\n## Finance process\n\nInvestments are managed at the level of each company and  the  decision-making  process  is  coordinated  by  the Group  Investment  Committee  (GIC)  through  decisionmaking platforms (above \u20ac0.5 million) bringing together all  the  stakeholders  (business  line  and  management controllers  at  company  and  Group  level).  This  Group Investment Committee is composed of Air France-KLM's Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Financial Officers of Air France and KLM.\n\nAll  investments  of  more  than  \u20ac5  million,  together  with operations  relating  to  the  fleet,  and  shareholding  and divestment  transactions,  are  submitted  for  approval  to the  Group  Executive  Committee  by  the  Group's  Chief Financial Officer. In addition, all investments, acquisitions or disposals of assets (in particular the fleet or shareholdings  in  any  company)  or  the  conclusion  of operating  leases  representing  a  total  amount  of  more than  \u20ac150  million,  carried  out  at  the  level  of  Air  FranceKLM, Air France or KLM, must be authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of Air France-KLM.\n\nThe  management  of  Air  France-KLM's  financial  market risks  is  overseen  by  the  Risk  Management  Committee (RMC),  which  meets  at  least  each  quarter  to  define  the risk management  strategy  of  the  Group  and,  after examining the various Group risk reports, determines the hedges  to  be  set  up  during  the  coming  quarters,  with notably,  the  hedging  ratios  to  be  achieved,  the  time period  to  respect  these  targets  and,  potentially,  the preferred type of hedging instrument.\n\nThese decisions are then implemented in each company by  the  respective  Treasury  Management  departments, pursuant to the procedures for the delegation of powers.\n\nRegular  meetings  are  organized  between  the  Treasury Management  departments  of  the  two  companies,  to optimize the coordination of recommendations made to the  RMC  and  subsequent  decision  implementation (hedging instruments, the strategies planned and counterparties).\n\nThe fuel hedges are covered in a weekly report forwarded to  the  General  Managements  of  the  Air  France-KLM group,  Air  France  and  KLM.  A  summary  of  the  cash positions  of  Air  France,  KLM  and  Air  France-KLM  is communicated  weekly  to  the  Air  France-KLM  group's General Management.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM,  Air  France  and  KLM  cash  positions are  the  subject  of  monthly  reports  to  the  Finance departments. These reports include the interest rate and currency positions, the portfolio of hedging operations, a summary of investments and financing by currency and a tracking statement of the risk exposure by counterparty. The  Risk  Management  Committee  sets  the  minimum thresholds in terms of the financial quality of counterparties,  determines the maximum amount to be allocated  to  a  single  counterparty  and  is  responsible  for monitoring the quarterly positions.\n\nThe  hedge  strategies  aim  to  reduce  the  exposure  of Air  France-KLM  and  therefore  to  preserve  budgeted margins.  The  instruments  used  are  futures,  swaps  and options. The  internal  risk management  procedures prohibit instruments characterized as trading instruments  unless  expressly  authorized  by  the  Chief Financial  Officer  of  Air  France-KLM.  All  the  instruments used  must  qualify  as  hedging  instruments  pursuant  to the  IAS/IFRS  accounting  rules.  Generally  speaking,  no trading or speculation is authorized.\n\nAny  substantive  change  in  the  hedging  strategy  is  the subject  of  a  systematic  presentation  to  the  Group  Audit Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, Air France and KLM have established a procedure known as the 'progressive daily revenue'  process  making  it  possible  to  know  the estimated amount of passenger revenues for the previous day.\n\nIn  addition,  departments  of  the  Group,  Air  France  and KLM  analyze  the  results  by  market  and  by  route  (unit revenues per revenue passenger-kilometer, per available seat-kilometer, per revenue ton-kilometer etc.) at the level of the passenger and cargo businesses.\n\nA  monthly  presentation  on  the  level  of  transportation revenues (passenger and cargo) is also made to the Group Executive  Committee  by  the  senior  managers  of  these entities.\n\nThe Shared Services Center (SSC) in Toulouse is in charge of  commercial  Passenger  revenues  for  the  companies Air France and KLM, while the Shared Services Center at Amsterdam-Schiphol is responsible for commercial Cargo revenues for the Group (Air France, KLM and Martinair).\n\nFor  these  two  activities,  service  level  agreements  have been  signed  between  Air  France,  KLM  and  Air  FranceKLM.\n\n## Management Control reporting process\n\nThe Group Corporate Control department coordinates the reporting  process  with  the  Corporate  Controllers  of Air France and KLM.\n\nIn liaison with  the  Group's  principal  divisions  and subsidiaries, these three teams of controllers then analyze the past month's financial results and estimate the results for  the  coming  months  (forecast  adjustment  process) through to the end of the current financial year.\n\nOnce  the  accounting  result  for  the  month  is  known, Group Corporate Control produces a monthly document (known as the Group management  report) that summarizes the monthly key business, employee-related and  financial  data,  both  actual  and  for  the  coming months, in order to determine the forecasted outcome for the current financial year for the Group, Air France, KLM and each business line. The same applies to the figures on cash-flow, and the cash and debt positions.\n\nThis  monthly  Group  management  report  is  distributed and presented to the Group Executive Committee by the Group Corporate controller.\n\nIn addition, management review meetings take place on at  least  a  quarterly  basis  between  the  CEOs,  CFOs  and Executive Vice-Presidents of the Passenger,  Cargo, Engineering & Maintenance and Transavia businesses.",

The  reporting  scope  covers  the  Air  France-KLM group. When the information relates to a different scope, the scope of application is specified in the text.\n\n## 4.1 CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n## 4.1.1 The Group's business model\n\nThe Group's business brings together people, economies, and  cultures,  and  drives  economic  growth  and  social progress. The overarching ambition of the Air France-KLM group is to become an aviation champion in Europe, and aims to be a front-runner in sustainable aviation.\n\nThe  value  creation  model  (see  section  1.2.3)  shows  the impact areas where the Air France-KLM group adds value and  which,  thanks  to  its  fundamental  strengths  and unique  competitive  advantages,  enables  a  response  to societal and environmental challenges. As part of its dayto-day activities, the Group  interacts with all its stakeholders (employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers,  authorities,  local  communities,  and  players  in civil  society  like  NGOs,  etc.),  while  its  activities  and operations have multiple impacts on the wider society.\n\nThe  main  impacts,  both  quantitative  and  qualitative,  are summarized  in  the  'Reporting  of  the  Group's  extrafinancial risks' paragraph in section 4.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities for building long-term relationships'. The policies implemented are outlined in sections 4.2 to 4.6.\n\n## Principles of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nThe  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) was set up by the G20 in December 2015 during the United Nations COP21 conference to draft\n\nrecommendations for  use  by  financial  and  non-financial companies  in  their  public  disclosure  of  the  impacts  of climate-related risks and opportunities. These recommendations, which are applicable across all sectors and can be included in existing financial reports,  aim  to increase  the  transparency  between  companies  and investors, thereby reducing investment risks and reconciling short-term financial decisions with the longerterm consequences of climate change.\n\nIn  2019,  the  Group  realized  the  TCFD  Climate  Maturity Assessment  developed  by  KPMG,  to  evaluate  the concordance  of  its  environmental  reporting  with  the principles  of  the  TCFD.  The  actions  implemented  by  the Group are presented in the table below. Air France-KLM acknowledges  the  update  to  the  recommendations published  in  2021  and  is  currently  working  on  projects internally  concerning  the  recommendations,  including  a climate risk and opportunities assessment to quantify the financial impacts and create our Group 2050 decarbonization  trajectory.  Since  2021  we  have  also worked on setting up internal project working groups for our Scope 3 emissions measurement.\n\nAs a result, Air France-KLM decided to actively support the TCFD  principles  with  the  ambition  of  continuing  to improve its knowledge and reporting.",

Climate  change  may challenge the future of the aviation sector, depending on current  and  future  regulations  and  SAF  costs,  and requires a clear focus on the energy transition. Operational  safety  and  passenger  safety  also  have  highimpact materiality, while noise management is a specific topic that is expected to continue to grow in the future. Customer  engagement  is  also  of  significant  materiality, and  Air  France-KLM  is  committed  to  providing  its customers with an enjoyable travel experience. Additionally,  social  dialogue  and  diversity,  equality  & inclusion are also of significant materiality and are being actively  managed.  The  impacts  concerning  water  and ecosystems (incl. biodiversity) are limited.\n\nOverall, this analysis will allow us to focus Air France-KLM's efforts on the most material topics and continue to drive sustainable  value  creation  for  all  stakeholders,  including our  customers.  The  following  pages  summarize  the Group's priorities following the Materiality Matrix determined under the double materiality principles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2023,  the  operational  risks  sheet  was updated to align it with the topics from the key priorities identified  in  the  Double  Materiality  Matrix.  They  are  also an integral part of the Group's Sustainable Development strategy  and  are  the  subject  of  measures,  monitoring procedures and action plans.\n\nThe  Group  reviews  its  main  extra-financial  risks  twice  a year.  The  ESG  risks  are  presented  annually  to  the  Group Sustainable Development Committee (SDC) (see chapter 4.1.3 'Business responsibility at the heart of the strategy'). The main environmental, social and societal risks resulting from  its  activities  across  the  entire  value  chain  are evaluated to establish a matrix of the extra-financial risks. The  results  are  reconciled  with  those  of  the  materiality matrix  which  illustrates  the  differing  perceptions  of  the internal and external stakeholders.\n\nWithin  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  main  extra-financial risks  are  discussed  and  reviewed  each  year  by  the Sustainable  Development  and  Compliance  Committee, then  validated  by  the  Audit  Committee.  These  risks  and the policies implemented are outlined in chapter 3 'Risks and risk management' and in sections 4.2 to 4.6.\n\n## Reporting of the Group's extra-financial risks\n\nThe  following  pages  summarize  the  Group's  priorities following  the  updated  Double  Materiality  Matrix,  the related  risks  and  opportunities,  the  policies  in  force  to reduce their impacts, and the Group's contribution to the United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs). The  priorities  are  classified  by  section  (environmental, social  and  governance)  and,  wherever  possible,  key performance indicators have been added.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nCreating long-term value for all our stakeholders\n\n## 4.1.4 Eligibility for the European Taxonomy\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\nThe EU taxonomy is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities, as defined  by  European  Union  Regulation  2020/852  on taxonomy  and  the  delegated  acts  adopted  for  its implementation. It defines criteria for economic activities that are aligned with the European Green Deal objectives and trajectory towards net zero emission by 2050. The EU taxonomy provides companies, investors and policymakers with appropriate definitions  and  criteria  to be met by economic activities in order to be considered environmentally sustainable.\n\nCompanies  subject  to  this  EU  regulation  must  disclose the  extent  of  their  economic  activities  that  are  eligible and  aligned  with  the  Taxonomy.  The  reporting  includes the eligible and aligned proportion of their total turnover, capital  expenditure  (CapEx)  and  operating  expenditure (OpEx).\n\nAn economic activity is deemed eligible if it is included in the list of activities established by the European Commission's delegated acts under one or several of the following environmental objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 climate change mitigation ('CCM');\n- \u25a0 climate change adaptation ('CCA') (1) ;\n- \u25a0 sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine resources ('WTR');\n- \u25a0 transition to a circular economy ('CE');\n- \u25a0 pollution prevention and control ('PPC');\n- \u25a0 protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems ('BIO').\n\nTo  be  aligned,  an  activity  needs  to  comply  with  three cumulative criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 adhere  to  the  minimum  technical  thresholds  for environmental  performance  (criterion  of  substantial contribution);\n- \u25a0 not  cause  harm  to  the  five  other  remaining  criteria, known as the 'DNSH' criterion (for 'Do No Significant Harm');\n- \u25a0 the  activity  must  be  carried  out  respecting  the minimum safeguards (criterion 'Minimum Safeguards' or  'MS')  regarding  human  rights,  corruption,  taxation and competition law.\n\nFor  2023,  eligibility  and  alignment  are  reported  for  the CCM and CCA objectives, while only eligibility is reported for the remaining four environmental objectives. Alignment  will  be  reported  for  the  four  remaining objectives  from  2024  onwards.  Notably,  the  gradual\n\nimplementation  of  the  Regulation  meant  that  only  the climate-related objectives (CCM and CCA) applied for the 2021 and  2022  financial  years,  under  the  Climate Delegated Act.  The  European  Commission  subsequently published the Environmental Delegated Act over the four other  environmental  objectives,  as  well  as  amendments to  the  Climate  Delegated  Act  and  the  Complementary Climate Delegated Act, which were in force for the 2023 financial year. The amendments to the climate delegated acts have been taken into account in this reporting year only for reporting on eligibility.\n\n## Assessment of EU Taxonomy eligibility\n\n## Core business activities\n\nFor 2023, the European Commission further expanded the activities  within the Taxonomy scope, to include aviation activities within  the  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation.  This includes 3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft, 6.19 Passenger and freight  air  transport  and  6.20  Air  transport  ground handling operations, which directly relate to the Group's core businesses. In this reporting year, we will focus solely on  evaluating  their  eligibility,  through  leveraging  the activity  descriptions  and  NACE  codes  specified  in  the delegated  acts.  Beginning  in  2024,  reporting  on  the alignment of these new activities will be mandatory. We are  actively  evaluating  the  alignment  criteria  of  these activities against our operations and are awaiting further clarification  from  the  European  Commission  to  finalize our alignment disclosure. This includes additional insights on sustainable aviation fuels, emissions reduction technologies and sustainable airport operations.\n\n## Individual measures\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Group's  Core  Business  activities,  the regulation allows for the valuation of expenditures aimed at reducing  GHG  emissions.  Aligned  activities  were evaluated against the specific Technical Screening Criteria outlined  in  the  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation,  ensuring  that these  activities  contributed  substantially  to  the  CCM  or CCA objectives, and significant harm to other environmental objectives was avoided. Financial information across the Group was assessed for potential eligibility under the CCM and CCA objectives, whereby all eligible  OpEx  and  CapEx  were  analyzed  against  the technical  criteria  for  the  substantial  contribution  and DNSH to determine their alignment.\n\nFor  more  details  on  the  core  business  activities  and individual  measures,  please  refer  to  the  'EU  Taxonomy Results Over FY 2023' section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have followed the recommendations  outlined  in  the  PSF  (Platform  on Sustainable Finance) Final Report on Minimum Safeguards on Member State recommendations. This also extends  to  compliance  with  the  Duty  of  Vigilance  for upholding  Human  Rights.  The  Group  has  not  faced  any legal condemnations related to Human Rights violations, corruption, competition law breaches, or fiscal misconduct.  This  includes  the  protection  of  Human Rights and combating all forms of child and forced labor, the  fight  against  corruption,  tax  fraud  and  tax  evasion, which  is  demonstrated  by  conducting  due  diligence  on these  four  themes,  as  required  by  the  PSF  final  report mentioned above.\n\n## Calculation of key alignment indicators and Methodology\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  disclosures  of  the  key  indicators turnover, CapEx and OpEx are based on the consolidated financial  information  of  the  Group,  as  outlined  in  the consolidated financial statements and prepared based on the guidelines outlined in 'Note 4: Accounting Policies' in the 'notes to the consolidated financial statements'. The calculation  methodology  for  turnover,  CapEx  and  OpEx remain  consistent  with  the  previous  reporting  period. However, there has been a notable adjustment made to the scope of eligible activities under the EU Taxonomy to include  aviation  activities  from  the  FY  2023  reporting period onwards. The addition of activities 3.21 Manufacturing  of  aircraft,  6.19  Passenger  and  freight  air transport and  6.20  Air transport ground  handling operations  are  particularly  relevant  to  the  Group.  This expansion  has  resulted  in  changes  to  eligible  turnover, CapEx, and OpEx since the prior reporting period.\n\nWe determine the KPIs for the turnover, CapEx and OpEx KPIs by mapping the eligible activities per the delegated acts  to  the  financial  information  of  the  Group.  Each eligible activity was  assessed  against  a  materiality threshold for CapEx and OpEx, under which the economic activities were considered to be immaterial for reporting purposes. Thresholds  were  set  based  on  absolute numbers with a consideration of the average transaction value per economic activity. The CapEx threshold was set at \u20ac100,000 which represents 0.003% of the Group's total capital expenditure, while the OpEx threshold was set at \u20ac50,000  which  represents  0.001%  of  the  Group's  total operating costs.\n\n## Contextual information and methodology\n\nThe definitions of the turnover, CapEx and OpEx KPIs for the  purposes  of  the  EU  Taxonomy  corresponds  to  the following  items  as  discussed  below.  Since  the  three activities  (3.21  Manufacturing  of  aircraft,  6.19  Passenger and  freight  air  transport  and  6.20  Air  transport  ground handling  operations)  were  newly  eligible  in  2023,  the reported turnover, CapEx and OpEx for the Group differs from the 2022 reporting period.\n\nDouble counting of activities and KPIs has been avoided through the mapping of the eligible turnover, CapEx and OpEx to only one eligible activity.\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe denominator  is based on the Group's total consolidated  revenue,  as  set  out  in  the  consolidated income statement in section 5.2.1 of the URD.\n\nThe eligible numerator covers net turnover derived from services  associated  with  Taxonomy-eligible  economic activities,  which  are  reported  under  the  following  three activities and relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft: revenues from maintenance contracts;\n- \u25a0 6.19  Passenger  and  freight  air  transport:  revenues derived from  the  Group's  Network  and  Leisure businesses,  other  than  revenues  that  do  not  comply with  the  description  of  the  activity,  which  relate primarily to revenues from fees, credit card surcharge, booking fees, fuel trading, hedging income, and sales of  certain  airway  bills.  This  also  excludes  revenues derived  from  ground  handling  operations,  which  are included in activity 6.20 Air transport ground handling operations and hence not double counted;\n- \u25a0 6.20 Air transport ground handling operations: revenues from ground handling operations under the Group's Network business.",

This relates to additions to property, plant and equipment and additions  to  intangible  assets,  as  reported  in  the consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  Notes  to  the consolidated  financial  statements  in  'Note  16:  Intangible assets',  'Note  17:  Tangible  assets'  and  'Note  19:  Right-ofuse assets'.\n\nThe  eligible  numerator  comprises  the  part  of  the  CapEx included in the denominator associated with Taxonomyeligible  economic activities,  and  the  individual  measures as  detailed  above.  The  core  business  activities  are  those which  are  newly  eligible  for  the  2023  reporting  period, where the eligible CapEx numerator is derived from:\n\n- \u25a0 3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft: fleet-related and maintenance CapEx;\n- \u25a0 6.19 Passenger and freight air transport: fleet CapEx;\n- \u25a0 6.20  Air  transport  ground  handling  operations:  CapEx incurred relating to ground handling operations.\n\nThe aligned numerator comprises CapEx associated with the  aligned  individual  measures  identified  across  the Group, as detailed in the 'EU Taxonomy Results Over FY 2023' section.

In  line  with  our commitment  to  responsible  business  practices,  we  are actively working on strengthening our Human Rights risk assessment procedures. This includes the implementation  of  an  adaptation  plan  that  will  further enhance our ability to identify, prevent and mitigate any potential  adverse  human  rights  impacts  associated  with our business activities.\n\nThe  new-generation  aircraft  fall  within  the  scope  of activity 6.19 passenger and freight air transport. For 2023, only  the  eligibility  of  these  activities  has  been  disclosed, but their alignment to the Taxonomy and environmental objectives  will  be  disclosed  in  2024.  The  new-generation aircraft incorporate  technological  advances  enabling reduced fuel consumption and a reduction in noise. This presents  an  immediate  reduction  in  carbon  emissions\n\nand noise levels, and the inclusion of the new-generation aircraft in our fleet is a move towards meeting our future sustainability goals and the evolving requirements of the EU Taxonomy.\n\nGiven  the  current  absence  of  technologically  and economically-feasible  lower-carbon  alternatives  in  the aviation  sector,  the  Group  will  only  be  able  to  achieve carbon neutrality subject to technological developments and the implementation of public policies in favour of the energy transition. The Group will continue to reduce our environmental  emissions  by  employing  more  fuelefficient aircraft.\n\nAs  part  of  our  broader  plan,  the  Group  aims  to progressively  transition  to  sustainable  aviation  fuels  that emit less and less carbon. It is crucial to aim for achieving zero  or  lower-emission  flying.  Therefore,  the  transitional activities play a key role in aligning with our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2050, contributing to the sustainable evolution of aviation practices.\n\nEU Taxonomy reporting forms a part of our CSR strategy to  align  with  environmental  objectives.  We  aim  to  align with  the  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive (CSRD) and aim to streamline our reporting for enhanced transparency and compliance with evolving regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thanks  to  their collective commitment and professionalism, the Group is able to offer its customers high-end services and a caring journey,  promoting  lasting  relationships  while  operating its activities efficiently and safely.\n\nAir France-KLM aims to provide one of the best places to work, by creating a safe and motivating environment for\n\nemployees and by monitoring engagement through the Employee Promoter Score (EPS). The Group continues to invest in human capital development, to develop the skills of  employees  and  empower  them,  to  enable  them  to exceed customer expectations.\n\nThe relationship that links the Air France-KLM group to its  employees  is  based  on  four  values:  trust,  respect, transparency and confidentiality.\n\n| Key Performance Indicator                    | Definition                                                                                  | 2022 Results   | 2023 Results   | Targets     |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Employee Promoter Score  (EPS)               | Annual change in the EPS measured with  Air France and KLM employees between 2022  and 2023 | (56%)          | 71.5%          |             |\n| Percentage of women  in managerial functions | Executive Committee members                                                                 | 31%            | 33.3%          |             |\n| Percentage of women  in managerial functions | Top 10% management level for ground staff                                                   | 35.4%          | 36.2%          | 40% by 2030 |\n| Percentage of women  in managerial functions | Flight deck crew managerial functions  (Cockpit crew)                                       | 5.9%           | 6.2%           | 40% by 2030 |\n| Percentage of women  in managerial functions | Cabin crew managerial functions (Purser)                                                    | 65.1%          | 66.1%          |             |\n| Number of hours  of training per employee    | Number of hours of training per employee  consolidated at Group level                       | 41.8 hours     | 38.6 hours     |             |\n\nSee note on the methodology for the reporting of the social performance indicators, section 4.2.6.4.\n\n## 4.2.1 Working conditions and employee engagement\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nSince  the  Covid-19  crisis,  repaying  the  loans  guaranteed by the French and the Dutch States has been a priority for the Group and Air France-KLM has succeeded in this key factor  of  success  for  the  long-term  future  thanks  to  a continuous dialogue between the social partners and the General Management.\n\nWithin  the  wider  context  of  rising  inflation,  limited capacity  in  some  airports  and  workforce  shortages  in certain  positions,  the  Group  consolidated  its  resilience and demonstrated great agility to adapt to the changing volume of operations.\n\nNow  more  than  ever,  the  strategy  common  to  all  the Air  France-KLM  group  businesses  remains  to  foster employee  commitment  and  motivation,  by  offering employees working conditions that enable them to fulfil their  professional  duties  effectively  and,  thus,  contribute to the Group's performance.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nWithin the Air France-KLM  group,  the  Employee Experience is a key element of its People strategy and a pillar of  its  Sustainable  Development  strategy.  'Our people deliver our customer experience' and it is through this policy that the company  can  outperform  its competitors. The roadmap  ('Flight Plan') aims at motivating  employees  through  defined  action  plans  at\n\nthe  level  of  every  division  of  the  airlines  and  the  Group including,  notably,  an  ongoing  commitment to diversity, inclusion and interpersonal connection, staff development,  support  for  initiative,  promotion  of  team spirit and collaboration.\n\nTo measure the level of employee engagement, Air  France,  KLM and Transavia France use the Employee Promoter Score (EPS), the in-house equivalent of the Net Promoter  Score  which  measures  the  level  of  customer satisfaction.  In  the  three  companies,  a  rotating  random selection  of  employees  is  regularly  polled  to  ascertain whether  they  would  recommend  Air  France,  KLM  or Transavia  as  employers  to  their  friends  and  family.  The method  enables  (theoretically)  all  employees  to  express themselves about twice a year and the results are shared with all staff. At the Group level, the consolidated EPS saw an overall fall between 2020 and mid-2022 and has been on  a  recovery  trend  since  the  summer  of  2022,  albeit without yet reaching its pre-Covid-19 level.\n\nIn  2023,  high  inflation  rates  and  workforce  shortages  in certain areas of the company had a significant impact on working  conditions,  compensation  and  other  elements related to the high activity level the industry was facing. During  summer  2022.  Air  France-KLM  succeeded  in improving employee engagement by activating in-depth listening  to  employees,  dedicated  action  plans  and exceptional  salary  measures  to  protect  the  workforce from inflation.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nHuman resources\n\nA  plan  was  established  to  give  substance  to  the  EPS recovery in the long term:\n\n- \u25a0 steering:  We  are  all  responsible  for  creating  a  culture and environment in which everyone feels comfortable and is supported in the right way to make a difference. Employee engagement is steered in all the teams and businesses;\n- \u25a0 listening:  At  Air  France,  open  questions  have  been added  to  the  EPS  survey  to  gain  employee  insight whereas KLM and Transavia have opted to complement  the  EPS  measurement  with  a  wider questionnaire sent once a year; thus, KLM launched its first  Employee  Survey  in  May  2023,  to  almost  all  their employees  in  the  Netherlands,  consisting  of  35  to 45 questions depending on the target group;\n- \u25a0 action  plan:  At  Air  France,  managers  are  strongly encouraged  to  listen  to  local  specificities  and  needs, and to work on local working conditions or any other local  issues  raised  by  employees.  They  are  provided with  resources  to  come  up  with  solutions  and  move forward together. Initiatives  include  the  improvement of working conditions (e.g.: redesign of the work place in cargo and for flight crews), high salary measures in response to the inflationary context, celebration of the 90 th anniversary  of  Air  France  with  many  events involving employees, dedicated budgets for managers to act on team building and cohesion.\n\nStarted  in  2022,  a  communication  plan  for  employees enabled buy-in to the ' Nous sommes Air France ' pride in teamwork  initiative,  to  share  important  assets  of  the company like its history, its products, its brand history and its  commitment  to  be  able  to  contend  with  the  current environmental and societal issues, and to value the many professional perspectives within the company.\n\nAt KLM, the results of the Employee Engagement Survey are aggregated KLM-wide and at the divisional and team levels,  enabling  everyone  to  do  something  to  improve engagement within their circle of influence. A toolkit has been developed to help managers define their priorities and follow up on the results.\n\nAt  Transavia,  the  results  of  the  Employee  Experience Index  show  that,  since  last  year,  the  level  of  satisfaction regarding  leadership,  structure  and  working  conditions has  risen  significantly.  In  terms  of  remuneration,  in addition  to  the  general  salary  increase  to  support  all employees  during  this  period  of  high  inflation,  specific actions  were  implemented  to,  for  example,  support  the operational  teams  during  the  summer  peak  in  activity and retain specific talents.\n\n## Employee commitment despite the difficulties\n\n2023 was  marked  by  a  very  significant  level of commitment from the Group's employees in a context of a rebound in activity for the second year in a row. The EPS has  not  yet  returned  to  the  pre-Covid-19  crisis  level,  a situation  probably  due  to  some  feeling  of  uncertainty linked  to  the  departures  of  many  colleagues  in  the previous  years  and  a  high  inflation  rate.  In  2023,  the Air  France-KLM  group  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to social  and  environmental  topics  in  the  regions  where  it operates and the involvement of Air France employees in the  ' Mon  Engagement  Citoyen '  initiative  is  still  going strong (see chapter 4.6).\n\nKLM's  approach  to  promoting  sustainable  development at the scale of the organization also drove the establishment of programs aimed at making KLM a more welcoming  and  inspirational  employer  offering  diverse professional development opportunities. Strategic partnerships  with  esteemed  institutions,  including  ROC education  centers  and  the  Amsterdam  University  of Applied  Sciences,  aim  to  stimulate  employees  and facilitate  the  discovery  and  development  of  their  talents so  that  they  can  make  better  choices  in  a  constantly changing environment.\n\nAs  an  example,  the  alliance  with  Luchtvaart  Community Schiphol  (LCS),  is  used  across  our  various  divisions:  LCS operates on the three fundamental pillars of labor market expertise,  targeted  programs  and  projects,  and  effective community management; it is steadfast in its commitment  to  expanding  a  community  of  businesses that  share  its  mission.  As  an  integral  part  of  the  KLM ecosystem,  LCS  collaborates  with  relevant  partners, bringing together the government, knowledge institutions  and  our  aviation  sector  to  foster  closer collaboration and synergy.\n\nThroughout the year, entities and divisions of the Group held  multiple  employee  events  to  foster  employee engagement. The events were interactive and informative to  promote  interaction  between  the  employees.  The CEOs, Board members  and  Executive Committee members frequently held webcasts to connect with staff, keep  them  informed  of  relevant  developments  and  be available to answer any questions. In addition, the Human Resources departments multiplied their touch points with employees and managers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Dutch  and  French governments supported the Group's efforts,  each  within the framework of their own country's social systems.\n\nThis resource adaptation was accompanied by reorganization  and  transformation  projects  aimed  at improving  the  Group's  efficiency  and  restructuring  its French  domestic  network,  but  also  to  take  into  account the new environmental conditions.\n\nIn  2022  the  business  context  radically  changed  with  a steep ramp-up in activity through the summer and 2023 saw the  level  of  activity  maintained  at  a  very  high  level. This  was  a  challenging  operational  context  for  both airports  and  airlines  in  a  tight  labor  market  and  with inflation  at  levels  that  had  been  unprecedented  in  the previous  decades.  In  this  new  context,  the  calibration  of the different plans and support measures continue to be systematically discussed and negotiated with the unions within the framework of the procedures imposed by the country's legislative framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nFor Air France-KLM, employees are covered by collective bargaining  agreements  and  the  coordination  of  the workplace dialogue takes place in each Group entity and within  the  Group's  European  Works  Council,  bringing together the representatives of staff whose head offices or entities are based in the European Community.\n\nDuring 2023,  Benjamin  Smith  (Chief  Executive  Officer  of Air  France-KLM),  Marjan  Rintel  (KLM's  President  &  Chief Executive  Officer)  and  Anne  Rigail  (Air  France's  Chief Executive Officer) held regular meetings with employees in  the  various  sites,  to  engage  in  dialogue  on  current topics.  The  number  of  Air  France-KLM  employees  and their  skill  sets  need  to  be  adapted  to  the  transition currently being experienced by the aviation industry. New aviation industry technologies, digitalization and changes in  the  labor  markets  are  pressurizing  the  company  to prepare its employees to adapt to these changes.\n\nAll airline entities of the Group organize regular meetings with their employee representatives and works councils.\n\nThus in total, during 2023, Transavia Netherlands convened 12 meetings of the works councils and four of the  health  and  safety  committees,  and  Transavia  France 13 meetings of the works councils and four of the health and safety committees. KLM convened 10 meetings with the work councils, four consultation meetings with other employee  representatives  and  10  with  the  health  and safety committees.\n\nIn  2023  Air  France-KLM  started  with  a  renewed  protocol and new elected members and convened four meetings with  the  Group's  European  Works  Council.  In  France,  in line  with  the  country  directive  and  the  agreement  with the  representatives  of  staff,  Air  France  conducted  three meetings  with  the  French  Works  Council,  19  meetings with the Central Social and Economic Committee ( Comit\u00e9 Social  et  \u00c9conomique  Central -  CSEC),  and  various meetings in the diverse establishments. These interactions  testify  to  the  intensive  employee  dialogue required to adapt to the challenges facing our company and the industry.\n\n## Signature of major agreements\n\nThe negotiation of agreements in the different airlines of the Air France-KLM group continued throughout 2023, to respond to the health, inclusion and financial challenges arising  from  the  need  for  reactivity  and  flexibility  in  a context of high inflation.\n\nIn view of the health context and following the lockdowns in France, the TeleWorking Charter ( Charte du T\u00e9l\u00e9travail ) was  introduced  in  February  2022  allowing  employees whose  positions  are  eligible  and  following  agreement from  their  managers  to  benefit  from  remote  working, either for a few days per year or on a regular basis, while initiating  discussions  on  hybrid  working.  Since  2022, based on the results of a dedicated survey, actions have been  implemented  to  further  improve  hybrid  working, and  to  ensure  the  more  effective  use  of  the  working spaces and collaborative tools.\n\nThe salary negotiations with Air France unions enabled a formal response, in June 2023, to the exceptional inflation situation.  Further  to  the  announcement  of  the  reorganisation of the domestic network on departure from Paris, negotiations were initiated with the representative trade  union  organizations  to  define  support  for  the relevant employees.\n\nIn  March  2023,  the  professional  elections  at  Air  France were  the  subject  of  a  significant  number  of  collective agreements  organizing  the  electoral  process  and  the conditions of social dialogue for the 2023-27 period: preelectoral  agreement,  central  union  rights  agreement, local union rights agreement, agreement  on  the functioning of the Central Social and Economic Committee.\n\nAt  KLM  in  2023,  three  collective  labor  agreements  were signed  with  the  Ground  Staff,  Cabin  Crews  and  Flight Deck  Crews,  including  a  wage  increase  over  the  period from March 2023 to February 2025. Defining a minimum monthly increase,  KLM  set  a  high  social  standard  in  the Dutch  market,  enabling  the  operational  functions  with the  lowest  salaries  to  receive  a  salary  increase  of  up  to 12.5% for 2023, not far from the inflation rate.\n\nIn  addition,  these  agreements  further  improve  working conditions,  with  a  revised  senior  policy,  commuting facilities,  compensation  for  working  from  home  and regulations regarding work and rest times.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nHuman resources\n\nTransavia Netherlands numbered four collective agreements,  three  of  which  were  renewed  in  Summer 2023, for cabin, flight deck and ground staff; Cabin on call staff  are  subject  to  another  agreement  which  had  been signed  in  December  2022.  These  agreements  improved wages  to  face  the  unprecedentedly  high  inflation, established retention measures for technical personnel of whom there was a shortage in the market, and took steps towards  a  sustainable  mobility  policy  and  inclusive collective agreement. The senior policy previously agreed for cabin crew was extended.\n\nThrough the agreements signed, we are investing in the employment conditions of today and tomorrow.\n\n## Resource adaptation via a number of measures\n\nAfter  having  implemented  emergency  measures  via  a hiring  freeze  for  external  staff  and  the  only  limited renewal of temporary contracts in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 public health crisis, the context was to prove very different in summer 2022 with a steep ramp-up to a high level of operational activity. Air France-KLM prepared for  both  seasonal and longer-term recruitment as of the end  of  2021  and  in  2022  and  2023.  Despite  the uncertainties  linked  to  the  geopolitical  context,  the demand for travel was confirmed and required continued hiring  in  the  operational  and  aeronautical  maintenance professions:  pilots,  mechanics  and  fixed-term  contract cabin crew and airport staff for the summer season.\n\nDespite tight labor market conditions in some areas, the attractiveness  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group  remained strong. Both the quality and volume of applications were satisfactory in 2023 however high demand for mechanics in  the  market  slowed  down  the  recruitment  of  these profiles.\n\n- \u25a0 Regarding work-study students, Air France returned to its  pre-Covid-19  crisis  volume:  around  1,000  students joined the company in all sectors and levels in 2023.\n- \u25a0 Volume  and  time  of  seasonal  hiring  and  training  of staff were key factors in the success of the operations in the summer season.\n- \u25a0 Long-term hires focus on mechanics, pilots, cabin crew and other key (and often scarce) skills linked to activity transformation  or  the  age  pyramid.  Internal  mobility remains the preferred solution whenever possible.\n- \u25a0 The  matching  of  needs  and  resources  remains  a priority: sectors  that  may  appear  overstaffed  are monitored through the Forward Planning of Jobs and Skills  process  (G estion  Pr\u00e9visionnelle  des  Emplois  et des  Comp\u00e9tences -  GPEC)  and  a  cross-functional Employment Committee.\n- \u25a0 Departures  took  place  at  the  Orly  and  other  French airports through a voluntary departure plan as part of a Collective Conventional Termination agreement at the start of 2023.\n- \u25a0 With revitalization  actions  in  the  territories,  Air  France offsets  the  eradication  of  jobs  linked  to  workforce reduction.  Since  2011,  three  revitalization  agreements have  been  implemented  in  Mainland  France  and  and the  overseas  departments,  which  invested  in  the creation  or  maintenance  of  more  than  5,000  jobs. Air France's Sodesi subsidiary is responsible for working with the public territories administrations to implement employment projects. A fourth revitalization agreement launched in 2022 is currently being deployed.\n\nIn  the  Netherlands,  many  new  recruitment  initiatives supported the ramp-up in activity:\n\n- \u25a0 attracting new baggage and apron staff was one of the main focuses for the recruitment of ground staff, with several hundred new employees;\n- \u25a0 KLM Recruitment Flight Staff attracted and selected a large number of new colleagues, including cabin crew and pilots;\n- \u25a0 KLM rebuilt a solid flex pool for ground staff of all levels, with the contracting of two extra flex agencies in 2022. Additionally, in the same year, a pool of flex workers in KLM's  ground  operations  signed  contracts  for  a  fixed tenure;\n- \u25a0 based on in-depth labor market data, KLM created and launched the sub-brand KLM Tech & Data, enabling a large scale recruitment campaign targeting IT talents.\n\nAlong with the pilots' representative unions, KLM adopted a variety of measures to address its temporary shortage of pilots. Thanks to a pilot-competitiveness plan introducing more flexibility and productivity over the 2023-25 period, the  company  is  able  to  hire  and  train  its  pilots  faster, mitigating the risk of a shortage of flight deck crew staff in the short- and long-term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our inclusive Talent  Development  strategy  aims  to  enable  employees to  make  optimal  use  of  their  talents,  improve  their employability and thus add value to the organization.\n\nThe 2020-22 campaign on the Forward Planning of Jobs and Skills (GPEC), combined with a strategic vision and a business-focused approach, enabled the identification of the future staffing needs based on a number of different scenarios, while providing solutions on mobility, employability,  research  and  employee  loyalty,  and  the management of the effects of the digital transformation.\n\nThe Human  Resources  teams  and  the  Executive Committee very rapidly pinpointed the strategic challenges involved in retaining and developing talent to add to the succession plan for key positions.\n\nIn  2021,  Human  Resources  assessed  the  current  talent management  approach  for  the  Group,  redefining  the requirements  of  the  business,  reviewing  the  tools  and processes used by the human resources departments and sharing the needs and expectations of the talents. Priority areas for improvement were defined and implementation continued  in  2022  and  2023.  This  process  covered  the definition  of  leadership  expectations  common  to  all  the Group entities, the development of transversal leadership training  programs  for  the  different  levels  of  leadership maturity and a coordinated approach for talent identification and succession planning.\n\nTo  structure  this  process,  the  airlines  follow  an  annual cycle  for  managers  and  employees  with  a  specific pathway through which to address Talent and Performance Development topics. At  KLM,  the  outcome of  the  talent  identification  session  is  captured  in  the  HR system (SAP SuccessFactors) and in 2023 the implementation  of  the  recording  of  the  succession planning in SAP SF began.\n\nAir France-KLM is building solid bases to connect people, skills  and  opportunities,  a  key  factor  in  our  successful transformation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nDespite the challenging financial context of exit from the crisis,  the  Group pursued its policy of investing in formal training:  the  number  of  training  hours  per  employee stood at 38.6 hours in 2023.\n\nThe  Group  considers  people's  development  through  the three dimensions of on-the-job experience, feedback and formal  learning.  In  2023,  the  entities  launched  and continued  actions  covering  these  three  dimensions, taking into account the businesses' own specificities and starting points.\n\nRelated  to  development  through  on-the-job  experience, dashboards based on HR data are used and updated to monitor  the  number  of  promotions  and  the  inflow  and outflow of employees.\n\nIn  this  respect,  particular  attention  is  paid  to  employee turnover and the age pyramid is also considered when we study employee development support options.\n\n## TOTAL TURNOVER AND VOLUNTARY TURNOVER OF AIR FRANCE-KLM GROUP EMPLOYEES\n\n|                                                          | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total turnover rate (1)                                  | 6.1%   | 9.9%   | 9.4%   | 8.4%   | 6.9%   |\n| Total voluntary turnover rate  (retirement included) (1) | 1.5%   | 4.3%   | 4.8%   | 5.1%   | 4.7%   |\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  the  data  collection  process, people leaving the company are offered exit interviews or the opportunity to complete an exit survey to gain insight into  the  reasons for their departure. They form the basis for a further  improvement  in  our  employee  value proposition.\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  continued  the  policy  launched  in 2019,  to  transition  from  exclusive  (aimed  at  a  targeted group  of  employees)  to  inclusive  talent  management (every  employee  is  a  unique  individual  who  should  be given the opportunity to develop their skills). In 2023 the common talent management approach was updated and a common people development strategy and action plan were implemented.\n\n## Formal learning actions to support employee development\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  strongly  encourages  its employees to learn, take responsibility for their individual and professional development, build personalized career paths  and  foster  their  own  employability.  The  yearly training plan has  been  designed  to  support  and accompany  the  strategy  of  the  Group  and  to  develop individual and collective performance.\n\nOver  the  last  two  years,  major  efforts  were  made  to further modernize and fluidify the search process for the various  learning  programs  in  the  modern  and  userfriendly  MyLearning  tool,  using  Artificial  Intelligence.  In 2023,  KLM  further  enlarged  the  scope  of  the  learning content  distributed,  via  a  link  to  the  'external  training portal' which includes a rich and varied training offer with special  attention  paid  to  workers.  It  also  enables  KLM  to suggest specific training courses to its employees and to",

This  year,  the  LC  Data was  introduced  supporting  the  development  of  data management  skills  for  all.  The  company  also  strongly supports its managerial transformation with a multiplication of face-to-face training courses and virtual classrooms led by experts.\n\nTo  promote  its  learning  culture,  Transavia  Netherlands launched  its  learning  hub  in  2023,  a  learning  and development  ecosystem  aiming  at  centralizing  personal behavioral training.\n\nTransavia France deployed its new Learning Management System,  which  proposes  e-learning  and  face-to-face content  for  all  staff.  The  latest  and  third  edition  of  the Learning Week at Air France was launched in December 2022, introducing the diverse and numerous possibilities on offer for learning.\n\n## A portfolio aligned with the strategy\n\nLinked to the transformation of the company, Air France has prioritized several areas of development:\n\n- \u25a0 risk  management:  flight  safety,  occupational  health, and safety, compliance (anti-bribery, GDPR);\n- \u25a0 fundamentals: customer care, sustainable development, English language, diversity;\n- \u25a0 data  world:  addressing  the  attraction  of  jobs  around data,  onboarding  of  these  jobs,  and  transforming  the potential of our data into a competitive advantage;\n- \u25a0 managerial  transformation:  to  enrich  the  dynamic  of training and development of all managers and cadres, the program \"Boost Your Performance\" was launched in  2023,  guiding  employees  in  developing  six  key competencies such as: Feedback and Manager Coach, Oral communication  and  impact,  Economic  and Financial  Knowledge,  Safety  Culture  and  Multi-Risk, Ecological Transition, Labor law/Labor law in management.  This  program  contains  mandatory training modules.\n\nIn 2023, KLM focused on education around the following topics:\n\n- \u25a0 occupational  risks:  raise  awareness  about  dangerous goods,  psychosocial  labor  load,  physical  load,  noise, hybrid working;\n- \u25a0 customer-centric culture: to create memorable experiences  on  the  planet  we  care  for,  we  need  to deliver our brand promise to every customer. To engage employees  in  their  role  and  impact  the  customer experience,  a  specific  e-learning  module  was  created for  internal  stations  and  customer  services,  under  the umbrella of the We Care for our Customers program;\n- \u25a0 operational  excellence:  cargo  provided  around  700 operational  employees  with  training  around  role awareness,  becoming  professionally  competent  and remaining professionally competent;\n- \u25a0 in-flight services: an inspirational day to reflect on the core of what cabin crew do onboard and the meaning of their mission;\n- \u25a0 pilot: anticipating a workforce shortage and encouraging  those  with  ambitions  to  become  a  KLM pilot, the company now covers the full cost of the flight training;\n- \u25a0 new Airbus NEO aircraft: Virtual reality is cost-efficient and easy to incorporate in planning and rostering. To support  all  crew  in  obtaining  compliance  certificates for  this  aircraft,  an  Aircraft  Visit  training  module  is being designed in-house;\n- \u25a0 flight operations: A start has been made on providing insight into learning paths between various secondary functions.  This  contributes  to  transparency  and  the quality of development of secondary staff.\n\nSome initiatives are also conducted jointly in development areas that are essential for both Air France and KLM, such as the \"Sales Excellence\" program with the renewal of an academy aimed at the specific target of regional directors, sales  directors,  account  managers,  and  domestic  sales, which represents approximately 1,400 people.\n\n## Developing performance management\n\nIn the shift from performance management  to performance  development,  the  Air  France-KLM  group's approach  to  performance  appraisal  is  now  oriented towards  a  forward-looking  and  appreciative  process based on constructive feedback to contribute to professional maturity, career development and sustainable employability. In these individual conversations,  managers  are  asked  to  put  the  emphasis on  talent  and  the  development  of  the  expertise  and actions  needed  to  enhance  an  individual's  value  in  both their current and future roles and activities. The aim is to help  identify  employees'  talents  and  their  individual growth potential, and thus maximize everyone's contribution to the company's results.\n\nAt  Air  France,  this  program  is  supported  by  a  tool developed internally and is positioned as a management transformation  lever.  It  is  based  on  two  key  concepts: continuous performance management and multievaluation.  Development  of  the  feedback  process  builds employee  skills  and,  consequently,  enhances  individual and  collective  performance.  Managers  conduct  at  least one annual interview with every member of their teams to assess their performance for the year and their potential development for the following year.\n\nSince  2022,  Air  France  has  reinforced  its  performance management  process  with  dedicated support for managers  in  their  roles:  the  Management  Lab  enables hundreds of managers to share best practices, advertise learning  and  development  opportunities  and  connect with  each  other.  In  2023,  a  Lab  focused  on  'managing team performance'. Managers could also attend training courses dedicated to goal setting or annual performance evaluation, strongly  encouraged  by  push  corporate communications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

An evaluation of the process is ongoing, via a questionnaire added  to  the  end  of  the  discussion  form,  encouraging managers and employees to evaluate both the process as well as the impact of the conversation.\n\nTransavia  France  opened  a  new  performance  review campaign  at  the  end  of  2023,  articulating  the  two  key steps  of  the  annual  review  of  objectives  and  the professional  development  discussion.  The  online  tool supports  the  review,  updating  and  co-building  of objectives throughout the year and encourages feedback.\n\nIn terms of the content of performance, both the 'what' and  the  'how'  of  performance  are  considered  in  the development discussions and performance assessment.\n\n## Developing leadership\n\nIn 2022 the Air France-KLM leadership model was defined, and the executive leadership competencies were formulated.  In  parallel  and  in  addition  to  addressing leadership  development  needs  transversally  within  the Group, with Air France-KLM training programs for leaders at  both  the  senior  and  middle-management  levels, several  development  initiatives  were  built  to  enrich  the executive and managers  succession plan and to anticipate  the  need  for  specific  competencies  in  the business units:\n\n- \u25a0 a  pilot  for  3-5-7,  on  sustainable  employability  was proposed  to  KLM  executives.  Together  they  look  at their  professional  future,  consciously  take  a  step  back to reflect on their contribution after three years in the position,  review  their  ambitions  in  this  position  and elaborate  long-term  goals  for  their  own  professional and  personal  development.  The  same  reflective approach is proposed after five and seven years in the position,  with  a  more  outward-bound  view.  Support and intervention possibilities are offered and used;\n- \u25a0 for  new  leaders,  a  'fundamental  leadership  program' was  launched  in  2022  and  14  groups  have  already started this program. The main focus points are people skills,  managing  an  inclusive  working  environment, people  sustainability,  talent  development  and  the setup for success and results;\n- \u25a0 for experienced leaders, a 'modular leadership program' was launched with two groups in 2023. The modules  cover  self-awareness and development, connection and navigation, inclusive leadership, attract, engage and retain, reflect and optimize and the setup  for  success  and  results  in  a  complex  and changing environment;\n- \u25a0 since 2019, for shift leaders in the operational divisions, KLM has been running a leadership program and has already  benefited  24  groups  of  employees.  The mandatory modules are communication skills, connect, leading teams and supportive leadership;\n\n- \u25a0 for functional leaders in the operational divisions, KLM started  a  leadership  program  in  2022  with  a  kick-off attended by 40 people from several divisions. In 2023 three  more  groups  experienced  the  program  which aims  to  enable  hundreds  of  functional  leaders  to improve  their people skills, create a safe and sustainable working environment and lead for results;\n- \u25a0 about 320 employees have benefited from customized leadership  acceleration  development  programs  like the Senior Leadership development program for Senior Management,  the  Focus  on  Your  Future  leadership development  program  for  middle  management,  the Reflective  Leadership  Day  and  the  Development  of Leadership Skills Under  Pressure  focus  for top management.  Complementing  this  offer,  in  2023  the company  launched  the  Unleash  Your  Leadership program,  based  on  Art  thinking.  All  these  programs focus  on  business,  leadership  skills,  engagement  and personal growth;\n- \u25a0 creating  a  safe  and  motivating  working  climate: completing initiatives like more simple procedures and clear  reference  guides,  training  and  dialogue  sessions were  built  for  leaders  who  face  challenging  situations and need to practice in dedicated and safe workshops. Three training courses and 10 sessions were run in 2023.\n\nTransavia  Netherlands  renewed  its  vision  of  leadership development and took the first steps in putting this into action with the launch of a Leadership Day in November 2022. Looking at the many new managers, the airline also focused  on  connection  and  knowledge  exchange  with online  peer  groups  of  leaders  and  with  wider  circles. Several leadership development initiatives were launched in 2023 touching approximately 130 managers.\n\nIn line with the Group's new leadership model, to support the  challenges  of  the  business  and  to  accelerate  its transformation,  Air  France  updated  the  cross-functional skills reference framework for managers and rolled it out in 2022. It defines the required soft and hard skills with the levels  of  proficiency  that  executives  and  managers  can call  on  to  develop  their  teams  and  their  own  skills.  To supplement  the  manager  toolbox,  the  training  and development offer has been enhanced accordingly, with assessment  and  self-assessment  tools  to  measure  skill gaps and better identify the relevant individual plans. For instance:\n\n- \u25a0 knowledge  of  self:  transversal  competencies  autodiagnostic, mirroring (' retour d'image ') 360\u00b0;\n- \u25a0 individual coaching and mentoring;\n- \u25a0 peer sharing: The Lab Program for managers and the Co-development  and  'Coup  de  Pouce'  program embarked around 1,400 managers in 2023;\n- \u25a0 in  2023,  Air  France  launched  a  new  \"Develop  your potential' program for first-level women managers, to develop their leadership skills with specific attention to the female perspective.",

Air  France-KLM  has  invested,  via  the  Human  Resources departments, in supporting the whole organization in the analysis  of  performance  gaps,  researching  development, and learning  needs,  designing  learning  experiences  and developing  learning  products.  Aside  from  an  increase  in levels of performance, we expect these activities to have a positive  impact  on  employee  engagement  within  their field  of  work,  on  retention  and  ultimately  on  employee satisfaction.\n\nWe recognize  our  employees  for  their  whole  selves  and develop  their  ability  to  build  their  careers  around  their unique talents.\n\nEmployees  are  encouraged  to  think  about  what  their work  means  to  them  now  and  in  the  future.  With  the online  platform  tool  'MyTalent'  on  the  'TalentBase' platform,  KLM  feeds  and  stimulates  employee  thinking about  the  use  of  their  interests  and  talents.  Employees can  run  several  scans  to  explore  their  skills,  motivation and  talents,  and  can  match  these  against  vacancies within  the  company  and  in  other  organizations  in  The Netherlands.  Since  December  2022,  MyTalent  has  also been available in English; with this upgrade, a wider range of employees can be reached.\n\nAir  France-KLM  is  deliberately  shifting  towards  a  more skills-based organisation, aiming at continuously ensuring that  the  skills  needs  are  covered,  for  now  and  in  the foreseeable future. The outcome  of  our  Strategic Workforce Planning methodology is now available from a roles  and  skills  perspective,  enabling  the  creation  of  an appropriate  build/buy/borrow  strategy  of  skills,  for  each area of the organisation.\n\nNextGen  is  an  inclusive  Air  France  program  benefiting young graduate employees with various profiles and skill sets,  that  respects  the  employees'  pace,  development objectives  and  motivation.  Employees  are  individually supported  in  their  development  and  integration  with onboarding  days,  events,  conferences  throughout  the year,  talent  manager  support  (buddy  system,  industry discovery), a Teams  network,  meeting  points  with Executive  Committee  members,  a  dedicated  Learning channel  and  off-site  visits,  all  energize  the  Next  Gen Program.\n\nThe 'Spirit for the Future' program aims to meet the need to  be  inspired  and  to  enhance  skills  and  knowledge,  to promote personal growth, to make an impact, to expand the vision of the airline and to build a network outside the employees'  immediate  work  surroundings.  It  had  been built during the crisis with the aim of retaining the talents\n\nidentified  as  change-makers,  the  key  players  in  the transformation. The program is still relevant and feedback about  it  was  used  to  develop  two  additional  talent programs: one for Pilots aspiring to an ancillary function on  the  ground,  launched  in  2022,  and  one  for  Cabin Attendants/Pursers  aspiring  to  hold  ancillary  ground functions, launched in 2023.\n\nIn  2023  KLM built on the pilots program held in 2022 to further  implement  its  skills  and  competency  strategy roadmap.  The  first  steps  were  taken  towards  a  specific skills  taxonomy  using  an  external  AI/Machine  Learning solution and the data currently available in the talent and learning systems.\n\nAir  France-KLM  numbers  a  large  proportion  of  senior employees and is developing dedicated initiatives related to  skills  development  and  career  opportunities.  The  new 2023-24 PACTE agreement signed in July 2022 came into force on January 1, 2023. It includes special arrangements for  seniors'  employment,  learning,  skills  development, health and retirement planning.\n\nAs with many organizations in The Netherlands, KLM has an  aging  working  population.  To  better  understand  and enable  this  population  to  remain  fit  for  the  future,  a multidisciplinary  team  has  used  design  thinking  to research the needs of this target population and has built answers  with  both  low-hanging  fruit  and  longer-term solutions.  Consequently,  a  digital  skills  training  program was  launched  in  2023.  Working  together  with  a Knowledge Centre allows KLM to offer  not  only  training but also a refurbished laptop for this target group, so they can,  with  guidance  available  up  until  one  year  after  the training,  further  practice  and  use  their  newly  developed skills.\n\n## Reinforced steering of mobility\n\nIn 2022, the Air France-KLM  group  reaffirmed  its commitment  to  promoting  skills-based  mobility.  The Group  identified  the  connection  of  people,  skills  and opportunities as a key factor in success and a contributor to talent management and sustainable employability.\n\n## Promoting mobility\n\nThroughout  2023,  the  steering  process  for  transverse mobility between the different Group companies, deployed in December 2020, was activated to enable the more effective matching of requirements and resources, and to foster the development of human capital.\n\nThe airlines also strongly promote internal mobility. A few Air France initiatives were developed in 2022 and 2023: a dedicated  internal  e-magazine  with  testimonies  and mobility supporting tools, 'I changed position' replays of employees with inspiring career paths, 'Career Path Day' to  explain  mobility  steps  and  meet  managers  who  are recruiting  (110  participants  in  2022,  185  in  2023),  internal recruitment forums (1,450 participants in 2023), webinars aiming  at  engaging  managers  to  promote  internal mobility and welcome newcomers in their teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of the end of 2021, KLM was already preparing for the roll-out  of  a  series  of  external  recruitment  campaigns, specifically  in  the  technical  and  IT  functions.  Air  France consolidated  its  partnerships  with  schools  and  public recruitment  forums,  launched  a  'Take  Off  Day'  to showcase  our  job  opportunities  to  undergraduates  and students,  and  actively  participated  in  the  planning  of  a new university diploma dedicated to innovation in social science.\n\n## Supporting individualized mobility\n\nHowever, despite all these efforts, meeting the workforce needs remains a challenge for the coming years, meaning that individualized and skill-based mobility appears to be an attractive solution that the company tested in 2023 via several initiatives; here are a few KLM examples:\n\n- \u25a0 technical leadership program: training from medior to senior (five employees);\n- \u25a0 business & Tech management traineeship (20 participants);\n- \u25a0 reverse  mentoring:  a  professional  at  the  beginning  of his or her career mentors an experienced professional to  inspire  him  or  her  with  innovative  insights  and techniques;\n- \u25a0 in  IT,  Operational  Development  Engineers  are  trained on  Cloud  technology  to  take  on  a  new  IT  role,  from server to the cloud (50 employees);\n- \u25a0 re-skill and upskill in Data & Technology, 72 employees followed 130 training courses;\n- \u25a0 pioneer exchange program from BlueLabs: internship aimed  at  acquiring  new  knowledge  and  skills  in  an innovative environment;\n- \u25a0 implementation of a Talent Development Cycle for HR Talent managers and business partners.\n\n## Supporting mobility of the targeted groups\n\nAs  a  pilot  for  the  E&M  population,  the  initiative  'At  the helm of  your  own  development'  encourages  employees to build a match between their experience and ambition, making optimal use of their talents.\n\nIn May  and  June  2022,  the  company  successfully organized workshops for operational staff and managers along with individual career coaching involving approximately  80  employees.  This  pilot  confirmed  that\n\noperational  staff  need  strong  support  for  mobility,  in addition  to  the  online  mobility  platform;  this  can  be provided  by  their  managers  and  supplemented  with career  coaching.  Based  on  this  trial,  KLM  continued  to develop  and  offer  workshops  for  both  employees  and managers,  and  is  expanding  its  pool  of  career  coaches. The  'KickStart'  program  was  launched  in  2023  to complement the above initiative. It consists of interviews, workshops  and  coaching  sessions,  and  the  first  cohort started in October 2023 with 55 employees.\n\nTo attract applicants for logistics and limit heavy work to a limited  period  of  time,  in  2022  KLM  Ground  Services started offering a new  five-year contract with a development  program  for  operational  staff.  Employees were  recruited  for  a  limited  period  with  a  development program  which  includes  a  path  towards  a  logistics diploma and career guidance. The promotion of the new contract format resulted in the arrival of around 600 new employees  during  2022  and  during  2023  the  limits  of these  contracts  changed;  KLM  decided  to  create  steady jobs for these employees, keeping the advantage of their ability  to  move  through  different  workplaces  and  even divisions.\n\nManagement  Traineeships  enable  young  top  talents  to find their way within the organization and use their skills to  contribute  to  creating  a  more  innovative,  sustainable, people-orientated and efficient organization. Four specializations  are  available:  Corporate,  Business  and Technology,  Finance  and  Engineering  and  Maintenance, via a recruitment process that uses motivational questions  rather  than  based  on  a  growth  mindset. Air France established the Mobility Steering Committee to address the challenges of matching needs and resources linked to activity reorganization. The aim was to monitor staffing levels and  skill sets, to bring  visibility to applications from employees whose positions have been made redundant  and  to  focus  on  the  need  for  external recruitment to fill  the  gaps  for  rare  or  specific  skills.  The Mobility Steering Committee also promotes the retention and  development  of  talents,  bringing  agility  to  both selection and development.\n\n2023 saw a high number of internal job moves, supported by internal selection, enabling employees to assess their employability.\n\nCollaboration  in  ecosystems,  with  partners  such  as Schiphol,  knowledge  institutions,  government,  defense and  the  Schiphol  Aviation  Community,  supports  key themes  such  as  sustainability  innovation  and  the tightness  in  the  labor  market.  Knowledge  sharing  is crucial to face shared social challenges and to learn from each  other.  One  example  is  the  Brightsky  project,  from which  an  Aviation  Academy  Schiphol  will  emerge.  The format delivered in December 2023 will continue during 2024.  Through  education,  training  and  multidisciplinary work on assignments in all forms, employees can become more mobile and potentially grow in their careers.",

Various  initiatives  have  been  implemented  in the airlines to support this commitment.\n\nAir  France-KLM  strongly  believes  that  a  diverse  and inclusive workforce  has  a  positive  impact  on  the performance  of  the  organization,  attracting  more  talent and being more customer-driven, having higher levels of employee engagement, taking better decisions and being more innovative and creative. Thus, the Group continues to  support  all  forms  of  action  to  encourage  equal opportunity, equality between men and women, LGBTIQ+ and under-represented minority networks, the vocational integration of young  people, the transmission of knowledge  and  skills,  and  the  maintained  employment and recruitment of persons with disabilities.\n\nThe  far-reaching  societal  and  economic  implications present both opportunities for and  challenges  to promoting Diversity & Inclusion within the workplace. The business  imperatives  for  Diversity  &  Inclusion  (D&I)  have become increasingly clear; Diversity & Inclusion remains a key  priority  in  the  transformation  of  the  Group,  of  the teams, and of every individual. For instance, Air France is conscious  of  its  social  and  societal  responsibility  as  the leading  private  employer  in  the  Ile-de-France,  with  two airports located in the heart of the region. The company is mobilized  at  all  levels  to  fight  against  all  forms  of discrimination,  and  to  promote  equal  opportunities, fairness and  inclusion.  This  D&I  statement  is  also accessible to all visitors to klm.com.\n\nIn  September  2021,  the  Group  launched  an  internal assessment to understand its current D&I departure point and its transversal mindset going forward. The goal was to further  improve  and  encourage  an  inclusive  culture  and\n\nThe  offer  of  peer-to-peer  co-development  sessions  for managers  has  been  reinforced  within  Air  France. Diagnostic tools such as 360\u00b0 feedback saw a wider rollout  from  2022  and  individual  mentoring  and  coaching continued  to  be  deployed.  In  2023,  more  than  100 managers  benefited  from  mentoring  at  Air  France,  and the  use  of  the  Listen  Up  feedback  tool  for  managers increased as well as the use of 360\u00b0 and peer feedback.\n\nTransavia  Netherlands  improved  and  expanded  its  team coaching product. With a large team of internal coaches 15 employees have obtained their certification since 2021 in 2023 21 teams benefited from behavioral coaching and almost forty individuals within these teams  from additional individual coaching.\n\nleadership,  consolidate  our  approach  to  combating  all forms of discrimination and inequality, make our progress more  measurable  based  on  relevant  data,  insights  and good  practices,  and  prioritize  decentralized  activation based  on  specific  needs,  with  clear  objectives  and initiatives. In November 2021, a D&I survey was sent to all employees within the Group and the strong response rate testified to their keen interest in the topic. The objective of the  survey  was  to  develop  deeper  insights  into  multiple aspects, like representation, inclusion and equity.\n\nThe  Group's  priorities  are  based  on  stakeholder  needs, improvement points and external good practices, and they mainly touch on the dimensions of leadership, culture and measurement.  The  results  were  analyzed  in  early  2022, providing deep insights into employee perception of D&I; they  now  form  recognized  elements  for  our  baseline.  To anchor diversity and inclusion in the day-to-day lives of our employees and teams within the company, the first step in our  multi-year  plan  was  the  raising  of  awareness  around the  topic,  the  sharing  of  our  ambition  and  the  deep understanding of our starting point.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nAir  France-KLM  has  set  itself  a  long-term  objective  of reaching  parity  between  men  and  women  within  the Group  Executive  Committee  and  within  the  top  10% highest levels of management.\n\nIn addition, in parallel with the French entities achieving their  diversity  targets  in  accordance  with  the  deadlines set by French law, medium-term targets of a minimum of 40% women within the Group Executive Committee and 40%  of  the  top  10%  management  level  positions  to  be held by women by 2030 have also been set by the Board of  Directors.  Concretely,  in  the  event  of  the  recruitment and/or  appointment  of  new  members  and  candidates with  equal  skills,  expertise  and  management  qualities, preference is given to female candidates. An action plan has been deployed with a stronger focus on the careers and  promotion  of  female  profiles  at  all  levels  of management. In 2023, 33.3% of the members of the Group Executive Committee were women.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

An  independent  D&I  Ecosystem  has  been established,  with  representatives  from  the  different businesses,  D&I  leads  as  well  as  employee  network resource  groups  (ERGs)  providing  insight  about  underrepresented population groups, increasing awareness and enhancing  discussions.  Air  France  is  supported  by  a centralized D&I team that defines the direction, launches actions and interacts closely with all management levels to embody the change and make it tangible in all areas of the  company.  Transavia  has  trained  all  its  formally mandated employee representatives. Improving Diversity &  Inclusion  is  a  journey  during  which  we  pay  constant attention  to  the  way  our  employees  experience  this cultural transformation. The evolution of their perception  of  their  own  inclusion  within  their  teams will  guide  us  on  the  path.  As  a  result  of  our  first  D&I survey, 76% of the 13,000 respondents agreed with the statement  'I  feel  welcome  and  included  within  my teams'.\n\nThe  strong  engagement  of  Air  France  in  numerous actions promoting diversity and inclusion is reflected in its contractual  policy  i.e.  the  12 th three-year  agreement  on employment and retention of people with disabilities and the  6 th three-year  professional  agreement  on  gender equality,  and  their  concrete  results.  These  actions  are  at the heart of our values and are the subject of daily work by the teams and a dynamic of continuous improvement. Air  France  has  retained  a  Glassdoor  score  of  3.8/5  and  is recommended  by  its  employees  for  its  diversity  and inclusion policy, and its culture and values.\n\n## Raising awareness of Diversity & Inclusion\n\nWe have identified raising awareness about Diversity and Inclusion and understanding of our ambition on this topic as  a  key  starting  point  for  our  D&I  journey.  Indeed, awareness and training are key to combating stereotypes and preventing situations of discrimination.\n\nThe entities have set up several face-to-face or e-learning training modules, some of which are specifically aimed at managers  and  the  HR  network.  Throughout  the  Group, the learning platforms cover topics about Bias and Bias in Recruitment  (unconscious  bias  and  the  ways  to  remove structural  barriers  and  systematic  bias),  diversity  of religions  within  the  company,  Discrimination,  Racism, psychological  troubles,  organizational  sensitivity  and micro-aggression.\n\nThe entities have also raised awareness in different ways in accordance with their countries and cultures; we might mention  initiatives  like:  the  interactive  talk  'Are  you  an inclusive colleague', the podcast about D&I for the whole company, speed coaching and mentoring for the young with  difficult  socio-economical  backgrounds,  a  fun  and interactive challenge to approach  and  understand handicap,  the  'intergenerational  duos'  photography exhibition, dedicated D&I leadership workshops  to educate leaders on how to implement D&I within teams (230  leaders  trained  in  2023),  Inclusion  Scan  (more  than 600  this  year)  i.e.  a  personal  assessment  on  inclusive thinking and doing based on a scientific approach by the University of Leiden.\n\nFor  two  years  now  and  again  last  November,  Air  France has  been  organizing  a  Diversity  Month,  during  which webinars, forums, exhibitions and challenges reiterate the company's  diversity  ambitions  and  explore  the  topic. Participation in Diversity frescoes is proposed to employees,  a  collective  intelligence  workshop  to  raise awareness and questions about the issues of discrimination and inclusion within organizations.\n\nKLM  organizes  quarterly  D&I  events,  the  opportunity  to learn and grow from external speakers or companies that share their best practices and policies. KLM has also built the  annual  D&I  calendar  which  was  launched  in  early 2023,  to  celebrate  cultures,  religions  and  highlight important topics such as Autism, Women's Day, Keti Koti, etc.\n\nInternal policies are adapted to strongly anchor diversity and inclusion throughout the company.\n\n- \u25a0 Onboarding:  the  D&I  chapter  is  now  included  in  the KLM onboarding program for new employees.\n- \u25a0 Language:  KLM  has  updated  the  recruitment  text  on job  sites,  vacancies  and  communication,  and  around 440  templates  of  letters  to  employees  have  been changed to a more inclusive language.\n- \u25a0 Recruitment: KLM organized an 'unbiased recruitment'  pilot  with  one  division.  This  method without  a  CV  involved  a  few  initial  tests  to  see  if candidates  have  the  correct  skills  and  competencies; evaluation of the pilot run will follow.\n- \u25a0 HR policy adaptation: often brought to the table by the Employee  Resources  group,  topics  touching  minority groups are investigated and discussed; as an example, the  parental  leave  policy  was  adopted  for  rainbow families.",

This Gender Balance Act provides strict guidelines for:\n\n- \u25a0 a quota of at least one-third male and one-third female members  on  the  Supervisory  Boards  of  Dutch  listed companies. This is not applicable to KLM, but KLM has decided to voluntarily comply  with  the Dutch Corporate Governance Code;\n- \u25a0 a  self-determined  target  and  reporting  obligation  for 'large' entities, applicable to KLM. An appropriate and ambitious target to promote gender diversity on KLM's Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board as well as for the Executive Team has been set. Each year KLM must report on the implementation and progress to the SER. In addition, this report will also form part of KLM's annual report.\n\nFor  Air  France,  professional  and  wage  equality  between men and women is a major priority in which the company would  like  to  make  further  progress  in  terms  of  human resource management. This undertaking was reflected in the  signature,  in  January  2022,  of  a  sixth  three-year agreement  with  the  unions  on  Professional  Gender Equality. It aims to accelerate economic and professional equality over the next three years and now includes new measures that represent significant progress for professional  equality  and  the  fight  against  sexism;  it contains quantified targets for the proportion of women in  management  roles  and  management  committees; follow-up  of  the  agreement  is  discussed  yearly  with  the Unions.  It  complements  the  publication  of  the  French Professional  Equality  Index  where,  for  5  years  in  a  row, Air France has obtained a score high above the threshold, demonstrating the good dynamics within the company.\n\nTo  ensure  equal  treatment  between  men  and  women, male-female comparative indicators are tracked annually within  each  division  of  the  company  (training,  careers,\n\nvocational safety, remuneration,  etc.). Special wage equalization and equitable salary management measures are in place, together with an annual review of male and female comparative remuneration.\n\nTo encourage women to access the highest management positions, coaching and mentoring initiatives are in place to promote their career progression. Since 2015, 250 women have benefited from the ' Femmes de Talent ' coaching program.\n\nAt  KLM,  a  communication  campaign  to  encourage  the increase  of  women  in  leadership  was  led  by  HR  and relayed  by  the  Employee  Resource  Group  Women  on Board, creating events on the topic and providing tips and tricks correlated to pain points linked to career paths for women (daring to apply for jobs, negotiating the salary). A  dedicated  Female  Leadership  workshop  aims  at empowering KLM women and 2023 saw more than one hundred participants.\n\nContinuing  to  raise  awareness  on  the  topic  of  gender equality  remains  key  for  embarking  all  the  relevant employees. Thus, Air France held a Female Career Paths photographic  testimony  exhibition  at  its  headquarters and  organized  a  conference  with  an  expert  on  the question of female quotas vs. discrimination against men. In  addition,  more  than  150  people  participated  in  a discovery and awareness challenge, a fun and interactive journey  to  learn  everything  about  issues  of  professional equality  and  diversity  within  society  and  within  the company.\n\n## Promotion of the aeronautics and airline industry professions\n\nThe Air France-KLM group airlines are active in promoting airline vocations for women:\n\n- \u25a0 Air  France-KLM  is  a  member  of  the  25by2025  global initiative led by the International Air Transport Association  (IATA)  to  enhance  diversity,  equity  and inclusion  in  the  aviation  industry.  Created  in  2019, 25by2025 emphasizes the significance of adopting best practices to foster greater D&I and gender balance in the aviation sector;\n- \u25a0 Air France is a member of the ' Elles Bougent ' external network,  whose  female  business  mentors  encourage young  girls  to  join  the  engineering  and  technical professions.  In  2023,  120  female  pupils  from  middle schools  participated  in  visits  within  institutions  and companies  (including  Air  France)  thereby  benefiting from insights into  maintenance, flight  operations  and IT career choices;\n- \u25a0 in The Netherlands, for the second year, the Engineering and Maintenance business participated in a  Girls'  Day  in  April  to  inspire  young  girls  to  choose  a technical  future  in  the  field  of  aeronautics  and engineering.  At  Transavia,  young  secondary  school students were welcomed to the company's headquarters to discover airline jobs accessible to both men and women beyond preconceived ideas;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Air Emploi also organized the second edition of  ' F\u00e9minisons  les  M\u00e9tiers  de  l'A\u00e9ronautique' at  the Delivery center  of  Airbus  in  Toulouse,  involving 200 female students.\n\n## Prevention of sexism and harassment\n\nThe Group has a zero-tolerance policy with respect to any form of discrimination and inequitable treatment. Bullying,  harassment,  and  any  other  harmful  behavior that  stems  from  discrimination  has  no  place  within  our Group and our corporate culture. We have zero tolerance for  any  form  of  harassment,  whether  of  a  sexual,  verbal, physical  or  psychological  nature.  We  are  committed  to increasing the awareness of protection and improving our prevention measures. Since 2022 we have been intensifying our awareness raising and actions to prevent sexism and sexual harassment.\n\nAir France has addressed this issue since 2018 by adhering to the 'Stop ordinary sexism in business' (#StOpE) French State commitment process and signing the Stop Sexism Charter,  to  be  followed  by  Transavia  France  in  2021.  In 2023, both companies launched an e-learning course on 'Preventing  and  combating  ordinary  sexism  in  the workplace'  to  understand  what  ordinary  sexism  in  the workplace is, how it manifests itself and how to react to it. Furthermore, at Air France, a webinar 'Unmasking sexism at work' was organized as part of Diversity Month. Since 2022,  a  booklet  on  'Preventing  and  Acting  against Violence and Sexual and Moral Harassment at Work' has been  available  after  the  zero-tolerance  principle  was reaffirmed  by  the  Air  France  Executive  Committee.  At Transavia,  the  prevention  of  behavior  that  could  be  a source  of  difficulty  at  work  has  been  integrated  into Transavia's internal regulations.\n\nBecause  violence  against  women  in  the  private  sphere also has an impact on professional life (stress, absenteeism,  isolation,  etc.),  Air  France  is  committed  to preventing, helping to understand and providing assistance  to  victims  of  domestic  violence.  In  2022, Air France joined the 'One in 3 Women' network, the first European network of companies committed to combating violence against women.\n\nKLM prioritizes a safe and welcoming work environment for  all  employees  and  has  implemented  measures  to prevent  and  effectively  respond  to  bullying,  violence, harassment  and  discrimination.  In  January  2023,  KLM launched a comprehensive campaign against undesirable behavior,  utilizing  various  communication  channels  and interventions to raise awareness and educate employees. This  included  e-learning  modules  for  self-education  and team workshops for 400 participants, as well as education on  microaggressions,  racism  and  discrimination  by  the Employee Resource Group Connecting Colors. Additionally, KLM  established  a  central  advice  and reporting  point  for  unwanted  behavior,  expanded  the team  of  trusted  advisors  and  implemented  a  new complaints procedure with a complaints committee.\n\nAir  France-KLM  combats  discrimination  linked  to  sexual orientation  and  gender  identity  in  the  professional context.  Fostering  an  inclusive  work  environment  in which all employees can be themselves represents a firm commitment of the company.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  a  long  history  of  proud engagement  with  the  LGBT+  community.  In  2019, Air  France's  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Anne  Rigail,  signed the  association  L'Autre  Cercle's  LGBT+  Commitment Charter. With the signature of Workplace  Pride's Declaration  of  Amsterdam  in  2021,  KLM  committed  to developing a working environment where openness and equality  are  fundamental,  and  where  there  is  an  explicit awareness  of  diversity,  inclusion  and  the  LGBTIQ+ community.\n\n- \u25a0 In collaboration with their Employee Resource Groups LGBT+, the Group's entities organize awareness-raising actions: webinars, meetings, discussions and initiatives. On  anti-homophobia  day  2023,  Air  France  organized dedicated communication and KLM operated two allLGBTIQ+ flights to Bogota and Munich in a campaign entitled 'Taking off with Pride'.\n- \u25a0 Transavia  France  drew  and  launched  its  Tolerance Frescoes  now  visible  in  its  meeting  rooms  and deployed a 'Halte au sexisme ' communication campaign.\n- \u25a0 KLM  led  a  Pride  'road  show'  involving  colleagues discussing D&I at different KLM locations and engaging in external societal activities to increase awareness and acceptance on the work floor for LGBTIQ+ colleagues.\n- \u25a0 KLM has been a member of Workplace Pride for eleven years  and  reinforced  its  'Ambassador'  status  in  2023: for the second year in a row, the company was officially considered  to  be  a  front-runner  in  LGBTIQ+  diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Promoting employment of people with disabilities\n\nFor  more  than  30  years,  Air  France  has  been  strongly committed  to  an  employment  policy  in  favor  of  people with  disabilities,  and  despite  a  challenging  economic situation,  the  Air  France-KLM  group  has  reaffirmed  its commitment to welcoming persons with disabilities.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  a  12 th three-year  agreement  on  the employment  of  people  with  disabilities  was  signed unanimously  by  the  management  and  by  all  the  union organizations  representing  employees.  Over  the  2021-23 period  Air  France  recruited  more  than  60  persons  with disabilities and  each  year  around  200  actions  are conducted  to  maintain  employment.  Through  this agreement  covering  the  2024-26  period,  Air  France reaffirms  its  desire  to  pursue  an  ambitious  policy  by maintaining  the  recruitment  of  people  with  disabilities and  by  pursuing  actions  on  their  employability,  training and professional  support  via,  in  particular,  coaching  and co-development.  The  changes  also  relate  to  suitable career support, the implementation of measures in favor of family carers and, more particularly, employees who are parents of children with disabilities. At KLM,  the recruitment  teams  have  expanded  their  manpower portals by going to different schools and by approaching diverse  university  fraternities  and  recruitment  agencies that employ disabled or special needs candidates.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nHuman resources\n\nAir France strongly supports suppliers who employ people with  disabilities.  Thus,  about  sixty  external  organizations have  signed  agreements  with  Air  France,  to  cover activities such as the laundering of blankets or bolting in aircraft  maintenance.  In  2023,  the  budget  for  these activities was 17.4 million euros, making the company one of  the  most  engaged  in  promoting  the  employment  of persons with disabilities.\n\nAir France continues to take an active part in awarenessraising  initiatives  and  has  been  participating  for  years  in the European Week for the Employment of People with Disabilities,  through  webinars  and  information  sessions, and  in  the  DuoDays.  Air  France  also  partnered  with  the world  para-athletics  championships  (July  8-17  2023), financing a solidarity ticket office that allowed 500 people, young  people  from  the  regions  and  young  people  with disabilities,  to  attend  the  events.  At  the  Job  Forum, recruitment offers were dedicated to athletes undergoing retraining and the company conducted 70 pre-interviews. Such actions underscore Air France's strong commitment to  people  with  disabilities,  whether  employees,  future employees or customers.\n\nDuring  its  week  in  favor  of  people  with  disabilities, Transavia proposed a sensorial journey to raise awareness about handicaps and participated in the DuoDays.\n\nAt KLM, pursuant to Dutch Law, all employees have equal rights in the workplace. Differentiating between employees on the basis of disability or chronic disease is not permitted. Adjustment  of  tasks  or  the  work  environment  to  assist  a person  with  a  disability  to  perform  the  job  in  question  is considered. It is only when people with a disability or health condition are unable to fulfil the tasks necessary to do a job effectively  that  employers  may  refuse  to  hire  them, especially if health or safety is a major issue.\n\nKLM and Air France are strongly engaged in the care of customers with disabilities: for instance, KLM supports the 'Hidden Disabilities' organization which educates staff at the  airport  on  how  to  take  care  of  customers  with  a disability  that  is  not  visible.  Customers  wear a green key cord  which  indicates  hidden  disabilities,  making  crew aware so that they can provide the attention and service needed.\n\n## Promoting the education and recruitment of young people\n\nYouth  diversity  is  reflected  in  the  diversity  of  our initiatives,  covering  a  wide  spectrum  of  socio-economic backgrounds and educational levels. As part of a growing commitment to the territories in which they exercise their activities,  the  airlines  have  stepped  up  their  support  for educational actions in line with the airline industry.\n\n## Education and internship for all, a focus on people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds\n\nAir  France  and  Transavia  France  cooperate  with  the Association  for  Training  in  Aviation  Professions  (AFMAE) and work with local organizations and French job centers (France Travail and the previously-named P\u00f4le Emploi) to identify  profiles  who  could  benefit  from  educational actions  linked  to  the  airline  industry  (for  instance,  two-\n\near  or  three-year  apprenticeships).  In  2023,  1,164  new work-study  students  joined  the  company,  bringing  the number of work-study students for Air France to almost 1,874  (new  contracts,  2 nd and  3 rd year).  The  company complements  classroom-based  education  with  training offers covering soft skills and the English language.\n\nAir  France  has  voluntarily  signed  the  governmental PAQTE  programs  agreement,  ' La  France,  Une  Chance, Les  Entreprises  S'ententent '  and  '1  student,  1  solution'. Thus, in partnership with the association ' Tous en Stage ', Air  France  continues  to  regularly  welcome  students  in year three of secondary school for an internship lasting a few days (about 200 students per year).\n\n## Helping young people to find employment\n\nIn line with its commitment to helping local young people find  employment,  Air  France  participated  in  the 'Envol pour votre futur '  event at Roissy, enabling young people to benefit from support in their first job search efforts with conferences and practical workshops.\n\nAt  the  end  of  their  work-study  contract,  Air  France supports  interns  in  their  transition  to  employment  with the  organisation  of  forums  and  workshops  dedicated  to business creation, job search and access to numerous job offers.  Work-study  is  Air  France's  primary  sourcing  lever with more than 70% of contracts being transformed into employment contracts.\n\nTo strengthen local relations between Air France and the target  schools  and  facilitate  its  external  recruitment, Air  France  welcomed  representatives  from  23  major schools and universities in May 2023. In June, the forum \"Take Off: Get your career off the ground with Air France!\" aimed at meeting young talents who could take on the challenges of sustainable transport and new technologies within the Air France Industries teams.\n\nThe  KLM  IT  traineeship  has  also  been  opened  to international  students.  New  trainees  complete  the  D&I Leadership  workshop  which  gives  them  the  tools  to deploy inclusive leadership.\n\n## Mentoring for all, a focus on people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds\n\nIn  2022,  Air  France  partnered  with  the  local  associations 'Article  1'  and  ' Nos Quartiers  Ont  du  Talent '  to  sponsor secondary  school  students  and  young  graduates  from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and to help them  succeed  in  their  studies  or  in  their  professional integration. Approximately 50 managers  from  the company mentor these students and, in November 2023, the  company  organized  the  first  mentoring  meeting workshop in favor of equal opportunities at its headquarters, with the help of four partner associations.\n\nAir France remains very attractive to young people having been  ranked  first  in  the  Palmares  ranking  of  the  best places to work for graduate students (source: Universum).\n\nAt  KLM,  the  recruitment  teams  are  expanding  their manpower  portals,  by  going  to  different  schools  and approaching diverse university fraternities and recruitment  agencies  that  employ  disabled  or  special needs candidates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Air France has support initiatives in place to optimize the return  to  work  after  maternity  or  parental  leave  and  to promote a serene resumption of activity combining their\n\nprivate  and  professional  lives  for  employees  who  have recently become parents (men and women).\n\nAir  France-KLM  offers  flexible  working  conditions  to  all employees  whose  positions  enable  this,  subject  to  the service  requirement.  Thus,  part-time  employment  is widespread within our entities (see the social indicators).\n\n## 4.2.5  Health, Safety and Quality of Life in the Workplace\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFor the Air France-KLM Group, health, safety, and quality of life in the workplace is a major priority on which there may be no compromise. Everyone working for or with the Air France-KLM Group has the right to a healthy and safe working  environment  that  considers  their  physical  and mental well-being.\n\nThe public health crisis had major human consequences for  every  one  of  us  and  thus  for  the  Group's  employees. Remote  working,  partial  activity,  and  especially  the  Job Protection  and  Voluntary  Departure  Plan  formalized  in 2020,  had  human  repercussions  that  the  company supported with care.\n\nAir France-KLM recognizes that vitality is essential to the health  and  development  of  the  organization.  Healthy employees  are  crucial  for  productivity,  performance  and engagement.  They  reduce  absenteeism,  increase  job satisfaction  and  help  the  company  retain  top  talent. Additionally, investing in employee health and well-being can  reduce  safety  risks  and  improve  both  mental  and physical  health.  Investing  in  employee  health  and  wellbeing  will  yield  long-term  benefits  for  both  individuals and the organization.\n\nSince 2022, the inflation-driven global economic environment and strong business growth in a tight labor market  have  put  pressure  on  the  airline  industry's workforce  and  Air  France-KLM  has  been  working  to support its employees in this new context.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nOn an annual basis, the Air France-KLM Group measures and reports the indicators related to health and safety at work:  absenteeism,  number  of  workplace  accidents, frequency  rate  and  severity  rate  of  workplace  accidents (see sections 4.2.6.2 and 4.2.6.3).\n\nWithin Air France, the Health and Quality of Working Life and  Multi-Risk  departments  are  responsible  for  steering and  coordinating  the  Health,  Safety  and  Quality  of working life networks. These departments have representatives  in  all  the  company's  business  units, enabling  the  coordinated  deployment  of  the  policy, actions and objectives. Accident analysis is used to adjust the policy and actions designed to protect the health and safety of individuals. The monitoring of indicators ensures that the initiatives are continuously adapted.\n\nWithin  both  Transavia  Netherlands  and  KLM,  safety  and compliance  are  achieved  via  a  continuous  system  of processes and procedures known as the Safety Management  System  (SMS).  The  SMS  guarantees  the safety performance of all processes, in all safety domains, through the effective management of safety risks. Safety and compliance are continuously improved via collaboration between the tasks and responsibilities of the Safety & Compliance  Organization  (SCO)  and  the divisions/business  units.  The  SMS  identifies  hazards, threats  and  safety  issues,  collects,  and  analyses  data, assesses safety risks, implements mitigations and monitors the results. The SMS supports the mitigation of risks  to  keep  accident  and  incident  rates  below  an 'acceptable  level'  and  to  further  improve  occupational safety  and  health  performance,  the  mitigation  team  of occupational  experts  continues  to  support  the  line management and their departments in the implementation of KLM's Occupational Safety and Health policies and the mitigation of the occupational safety and health risks.\n\nIn  2023,  Air  France  had  two  fatal  accidents  in  the workplace. Sodexi and Transavia France reported two fatal accidents.  No  fatal  accidents  occurred  at  KLM  this  year. Fatal accidents are calculated and determined in line with local regulations and rules.\n\n## Permanent adaptation and application of health measures\n\nIn 2023, in line with 2020, the focus was on managing the consequences and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and more  broadly  on  respiratory  patients,  and  on  adapting and  pursuing  risk  prevention  measures  for  the  Group's operations.\n\nAs  in  2022,  the  focus  in  2023  was  on  restoring  normal operations,  within  safety  limits  and  in  compliance  with the  worldwide  Covid-19  regulations.  As  part  of  the  risk inventory and assessment, further in-depth studies were carried  out  in  the  areas  of  physical  workload,  work equipment  and  psychosocial  risks.  External  authorities and companies, such as Baines Simmons, IATA and DSS+, carried  out  assessments  in  operational  and  professional areas, thus reinforcing the company's safety culture.",

A  digital platform is also available on a computer, tablet and cell phone for rapid contact with a psychologist or access to psychological health information;\n- \u25a0 the  association  Amiti\u00e9  Entraide  d'Air  France  (AEAF) helps employees in difficult situations due to addiction (alcohol or other drugs);\n- \u25a0 a  listening  device  dedicated  to  pilots  and  cabin  crew was  implemented  in  2021:  the  Critical  Incident Response  Program  facilitates  the  return  to  nominal functioning  of  people  who  have  experienced  critical incidents as part of their mission. A dedicated program relying  on  peer  support  with  specifically  trained employees  is available for aircrew experiencing professional fragility.\n\nAt  KLM,  a  procedure  for  complaints  about  inappropriate behavior  is  in  place  with  a  pool  of  skilled  confidential advisors  and  a  Complaints  Committee.  They  provide employees with independent consultation, advice on how to deal with inappropriate behavior and support in filing reports or complaints.\n\nA  range  of  training  options  is  available,  from  workshops for  team  development  to  interventions  when  serious issues arise in the teams. The management can also bring in external expertise or request mediation. Experts in the Corporate Social Work department remain available for all forms of mental support.\n\n## Continuous improvement of health, safety and quality of life in the workspace\n\n## Preventive actions\n\nAir France-KLM continually adapts and enriches its Health and Safety preventive actions.\n\n## Health Interventions\n\nAir  France  is  implementing  several  initiatives  to  monitor the  mental  health  of  its  employees  working  under pressure  and/or  at  home.  Every  month,  a  sample  of 1,000 employees is surveyed to assess their levels of stress, depression and anxiety. This psychosocial risk observatory is  managed  by  the  occupational  medicine  department, and  the  results  of  the  survey  are  shared  with  the Executive Committee and the Central Health Committee, leading to the implementation of specific action plans.\n\nOn  a  dedicated  Learning  Channel  launched  in  the summer  of  2022,  training  content  is  offered  to  prevent psychosocial risks, addictive behavior, incivilities, harassment  and  sexist  behavior,  organize  teleworking, manage  work-life  balance  and  be  aware  of  the  right  to disconnect.  Videos,  practical  information  sheets  and interactive  courses  are  available.  This  digital  training library  encourages  every  employee  to  be  a  player  in health and quality of life at work.\n\nContinuous company-wide execution of Safety Issue Risk Analyses on the virus and the monitoring/introduction of new  regulations,  procedures  and  methodologies  have ensured the appropriate measures and mitigations are in place to maintain safety.\n\nKLM launched a new MyHealth portal in 2023 that offers over  90  high-quality  health  interventions  focused  on seven  health  themes.  These  themes  include  vitality, physical well-being, addiction, nutrition, social well-being, mental  well-being  and  sleep.  The  interventions  range from  fitness  activities  and  ergonomic  workspaces  to (online) courses on stress management, mindfulness and access to counselling services.\n\n## Health experts in the KLM business lines\n\nHealth  representatives  play  a  crucial  role  in  identifying health issues and advise on and create customized health programs  specifically  designed  or  adapted  to  meet  the business's  needs,  preferences  and  specifications.  They provide insights into health-related problems in different target groups, follow emerging  health/absenteeism trends  and  help  businesses  to  make  informed  decisions when it comes to sustainable employability (initiatives).\n\n## Integrated 'chain' approach for Health, Safety and Absenteeism\n\nKLM  will  implement  a  central  Health  Management System in 2024, following the pilots launched in 2023. This system  will  create  a  comprehensive  and  coordinated strategy to promote  a  healthy  and  safe  working environment,  with  representatives  from  HR,  the  HR Center  of  Expertise  Health,  HR  Reintegration,  the  Safety department and KLM Health Services working together to optimize  sustainable  employability,  prevent  sick  leave, and address absenteeism at an early stage.\n\n## Regular health check-ups\n\nIn  2023,  Air  France  and  its  medical  teams continued the intensification  of  prevention  campaigns  for  employees' health, thanks  to  funding  from  Air  France  health insurance  (MNPAF),  a  very  active  prevention  player,  and the 'Prevoyance Social Action Fund'. In 2023, more than 40 skin cancer screening days (twice as many as before the Covid crisis) were organized with dermatologists and the Occupational Health and Prevention Services, at most of  the  French  sites.  The  Social  Action  Fund  set  up  in conjunction  with  provident  fund  AXA,  has  financed  the purchase of devices for Air France medical departments: rebound tonometer to screen for glaucoma, tympanometers, electrocardiograph (all Air France health departments  are  now  equipped  with  one),  Tremoflo  for screening  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease (COPD), to name but a few. These new devices will further strengthen the preventive actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  survey  results  provide  insight  into  an employee's  health  and  vitality,  with  an  opportunity  to discuss the results with vitality coaches. The company also collates information at group level to be able to work on the  most  important  health  topics  and  identify  potential health issues early on.\n\n## Raising awareness about health\n\nAir France organized the Quality of Life at Work Week in June  2023,  which  included  a  challenge  to  take  care  of one's health, a conference on \"The keys to a healthy brain\" led by a doctor in cognitive neuroscience, an experimental  course  on  the  effects  of  alcohol  and  illicit substances  on  motor  skills  and  attention  span,  and healthy menus in company restaurants.\n\nKLM held a KLM-wide Vitality Week in September 2023 to raise awareness of health and well-being. Health experts visited  all  the  KLM  businesses  to  familiarize  employees with the new KLM Health portal, hand out brochures and fill  out questionnaires for more customized interventions. Additionally,  employees  were  provided  with  healthy snacks during the Vitality Week.\n\n## Focus on inappropriate behavior in the workplace\n\nIn 2020, Air France and the unions signed an agreement to  \"prevent  and  act  against  violence  and  harassment  in the  workplace\"  and  since  then  the  actions  and  results have been regularly monitored with professional organizations. To further professionalize those responsible for  health  and  quality  of  life  at  work,  as  well  as  human resources players, a harassment action plan was deployed in  July  2023,  supported  by  the  joint  statement  from  the Air France Executive Committee, confirming its collective commitment  and  the  company's  zero  tolerance  of  any inappropriate  behavior:  \"We  do  not  accept  that  the actions  of  a  few  individuals  hurt  our  colleagues,  weaken our collective and tarnish the image of our company\". Our approach is based on several pillars:  prevention  through awareness-raising and training, reporting, listening to and supporting  victims,  triggering  resolution  mechanisms, and implementing disciplinary measures where necessary.  A  booklet  entitled  \"Preventing  and  taking action against sexual and moral violence and harassment in the workplace\" and training courses for conducting and investigating harassment,  as  well  as  a  mandatory \"harassment  and  violence  in  the  workplace\"  e-learning course for all executives and managers, are also available.\n\nAs  part  of  its  campaign  to  prevent  violence  against women, Air France has signed a partnership agreement with the association Face/one in three women. An internal charter was also signed at the end of 2022 and tools such\n\nas podcasts, e-learning modules and training courses, cohosted with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes , were  provided  to  employees  along  with  a  guide  and posters. An in-house working group has also been set up, made  up  of  social  workers,  doctors,  human  resources managers,  diversity  and  Quality  of  Life  at  Work  point people,  with  the  aim  of  proposing  targeted  initiatives when relevant.\n\nIn  The  Netherlands,  as  with  the  D&I  survey  results,  the attention paid to social  security  in  the  workplace  by  the Netherlands Labor Authority and the increased awareness of inappropriate behavior within Dutch society has led to a  review  of  the  reporting  policy,  processes,  existing mitigating  measures  and  interventions.  For  more  than two years, KLM  has been focusing on tackling inappropriate  behavior  and  it  is  now  an  integral  part  of the  leadership  training  and  team  workshops  at  the divisional level.\n\n- \u25a0 This topic is continuously addressed on various media, through  meet-and-talk  events  with  employees  or  in the presence of confidential advisors, and via a movie in the briefing rooms of in-flight and flight operations.\n- \u25a0 KLM's  code  of  conduct  and  policy  for  psychosocial occupational  safety  have  both  been  updated  setting the appropriate standards for professional behavior.\n\n## Hybrid way of working\n\nIn  2023,  Transavia  France  evaluated  the  hybrid  2-3-2 working  method  introduced  in  2022  in  the  office organization  for  all  colleagues  who  do  not  work  in operational  positions  or  rosters  and  who,  based  on  the requirements of their positions, (also) work from home. To ensure  the  health  and  safety  of  its  home  workers Transavia has developed several interventions: employees can take office supplies and furniture such as a desk, chair or keyboard from the office to use at home; a mandatory online course explains how to work from home healthily and  safely.  The  office  staff  gave  a  score  of  eight  in  the employee experience survey (response rate 50%).\n\nWithin the Group, there are many and varied initiatives to promote physical activity and/or sports.\n\nIn  France,  the  organization  and  promotion  of  sports activities  and  the  use  of  sports  facilities  and  halls  are carried out by the CSE (Social and Economic Committees) and  are  implemented  in  conjunction  with  the  ASAF (Amicale Sportive d'Air France).\n\nKLM  promotes  sports  via  traditional  communication channels  (e.g.  NewsApp,  My  Health)  and  also  organizes sports events for its employees; for example, a boot camp on  the  King's  Day,  a  soccer  tournament  for  the  Flight Operations teams or the 5 th KLM Urban Trail in Utrecht.",

Furthermore, in the Netherlands, employees are provided with a Sustainable  Employability  budget  enabling  them  to choose  to  receive  a  maximum  of  five  extra  days  of annual  leave.  Three  times  a  year  employees  can  use their annual bonus to purchase an additional maximum  of  20  days  if  the  balance  of  their  annual leave  doesn't  suffice  in  that  calendar  year.  In  France, between  five  and  ten  additional  days  are  granted depending  on  the  weekly  work  duration,  and  the annual bonus (one month of salary for workers) can be transformed into days of leave.\n- \u25a0 Parental leave: Air France and KLM employees benefit from  parental  leave  by  the  applicable  laws  and  local regulations.  In  France,  fathers  are  granted  up  to  25 days  of  paternity  leave  or  32  days  in  the  event  of multiple births and Air France pays a salary supplement to the daily social security allowances over this  period.  If  the  parents  are  two  fathers,  Air  France grants paternity leave despite this not being required\n\nby  law.  Women  benefit  from  paid  hours  of  leave  for breastfeeding  during  the  child's  first  year  and  crew members  can  opt  for  schedule  arrangements  or temporary  ground  assignments.  Within  Air  France, most  employees  who  work  part-time  are  between 30 and 45 years old, probably related to parenthood. At the end  of  December  2023,  the  proportion  of employees who had chosen to work part-time stood at 18% at Air France and 41% at KLM.\n\n- \u25a0 Flexibility: at KLM, employees can request a temporary or  structural  adjustment  to  their  contractual  working hours. Within ten years of their retirement date these adjustments  are  financially  supported  to  allow,  for example, employees to reduce their contractual hours to  80%  while  still  accruing  a  full  (100%)  pension entitlement. Employees can also opt for an alternative arrangement  where  the  number  of  working  hours remains unchanged but a reduction or even exemption from night shifts is requested. At Air France, employees  can  retire  one  year  ahead  of  their  legal retirement  date  and  receive  70%  of  their  gross  salary during this year.\n- \u25a0 Flexibility: Air France-KLM recognizes the importance of  the  Nation-Army  link  and  supports  colleagues' commitment  to  the  reserves.  As  such,  the  company provides  flexibility  for  colleagues  to  participate  in reserve duties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Airline Services, representing 98% of the employees in the subsidiaries of the KLM Group.\n\nThe reporting scope for the Air France subsidiaries did not change relative to 2022, with no subsidiaries having been either included or withdrawn.\n\nThe  reporting  scope  for  the  KLM  subsidiaries  did  not change relative to 2022, with no subsidiaries being either included or withdrawn.\n\nThe  reference  number  of  employees  to  calculate  the coverage  rate  of  the  social  reporting  is  the  average number  of  employees  in  Full  Time  Equivalent  during 2023,  derived  from  the  Management  Control  division's BFC tool.\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's social information is based on the calendar year to ensure consistency with the social performance indicators of other French companies.\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nAs  last  year,  the  social  reporting  has  been  carried  out using  the  ONEmission  tool  from  the  editor  Enablon implemented for the Air France-KLM Group. Consistency tests  have  been  incorporated  within  this  tool  together with  precise  definitions  of  each  indicator.  The  data  are verified  and  approved  locally  at  the  level  of  each subsidiary  by  a  manager  who  is  responsible  for  the  HR statistical data.\n\nThis  tool  is  supplemented  by  overall  coordination  of  the process  and  by  a  general  reporting  procedure  that defines  the  process  for  compiling,  calculating  and consolidating  the  indicators,  based  on  an  instruction memorandum circulated by the Air France-KLM group's Finance division.\n\nThe  consolidation  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group's  social information is carried out by Air France-KLM's Sustainability & Compliance department.\n\n## Details and methodology Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators Employee Promoter Score (EPS)\n\nScope: Air France, Transavia France and KLM (employees on French or Dutch contracts).\n\nThe Employee Promoter Score (or EPS) is the score given to Air France, Transavia France and KLM in their capacity as employers by their employees. This indicator has been measured at Air France and KLM since July 2019, and at Transavia France since the end of 2021, on a weekly basis, based on a random group of employees in the form of a question sent by mail: 'How likely are you to recommend Air France-KLM as an employer to friends and family?', on a scale of 0 to 10. The EPS corresponds to the difference between the percentage of employee promoters (score of 8  to  10)  of  the  employer  brand  and  the  percentage  of detractors (scores 0 to 5).\n\nThe  indicator  measured  is  the  annual  change  in  the consolidated EPS.\n\n## Percentage of women in management functions (ground staff, pilots, cabin crews)\n\nScope:  Air  France  and  KLM  employees  (expressed  as 'headcount')  on  both  permanent  (CDI)  and  fixed-term (CDD) contracts, on the payroll as of December 31 of the reference year.\n\nThe  indicator  measured  is  the  percentage  of  women  in the three staff categories:\n\n- \u25a0 ground  staff:  percentage  of  women  in  the  top  10% management  level.  The  percentage  of  women  is calculated by combining all the levels of management, classified  in  descending  hierarchical  order  until  the threshold  of  10%  of  the  total  salaried  workforce  of Air  France  and  KLM  is  reached.  For  this  last  level  of management,  the  entire  workforce  is  taken  into account;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These indicators are consolidated at the level of the Air France-KLM Group.\n\nThe  following  notes  refer  to  the  references  in  the  social indicator tables (section 4.2.1).\n\n## Employees\n\nNote  1:  The  number  of  people  employed  by  the  Group (expressed  as  headcount)  on  both  permanent  (CDI)  and fixed-term  contracts  (CDD)  on  December  31  of  the reference year.\n\n## Recruitment on permanent contracts\n\nNote  2:  The  indicator  concerns  employees  hired  on permanent contracts (CDI).\n\nFor  Air  France,  the  calculation  of  the  number  of employees  recruited  on  permanent  contracts  includes those  initially  recruited  on  fixed-term  contracts  (CDD) transferring to permanent contracts (CDI) during the year.\n\nFor KLM, only employees recruited directly on permanent contracts are taken into account.\n\n## Percentage of women Organization of working time\n\nNote 3: These indicators enable the percentage of women to be  evaluated  relative  to  the  workforce  and  the proportion of part-time employees on both permanent and fixed-term contracts on December 31 of the reference year.\n\n## Employees by geographical zone on December 31\n\nNote  4:  In  2023,  the  Air  France  Group  employees  in  the French Overseas Departments and Territories, i.e. 1,034  employees,  have  been  included  in  the  CaribbeanIndian Ocean geographical zone.\n\n## Training\n\nNote  5:  The  'Number  of  training  hours  by  employee' indicator is  calculated based on all the training sessions, divided  by  the  average  monthly  headcount.  All  training occurred  between  January  1  and  January  31  (inclusive). This  indicator  is  presented  at  Air  France-KLM  Group consolidated level.\n\nAt  KLM,  training  hours  are  accounted  for  based  on estimates  and  each  type  of  training  has  a  specific calculation methodology. The training programs at KLM are:\n\n- \u25a0 training  for  Cockpit  and  Cabin  crew:  the  estimate  is based  on  the  training  recorded  in  days.  Each  day counts for 8 hours of training. This training represented 75% of the total training hours at KLM. Training in 2023 for Cockpit and Cabin Crew of Q4 2022 and Q1-3 2023 included;\n- \u25a0 training  for  ground  staff:  actual  training  hours  are accounted for up to 320 hours of training per year per staff.  This  threshold  has  been  determined  by  KLM Group to exclude the hours spent by the trainers (6% of the  total  training  hours  at  KLM  are  then  excluded). These  training  courses  represent  19%  of  the  total training hours at KLM;\n- \u25a0 e-learning:  training  hours  are  based  on  actual  time within  the  limit  of  twice  the  expected  training  time required.  These  training  courses  represent  6%  of  the total training hours at KLM.\n\nFor KLM and the KLM subsidiaries, the hours of external training dispensed to KLM group administrative employees and the hours of training given to employees of  the  Transavia Netherlands subsidiary (less than 10% of the Air France-KLM Group's headcount) are not included in  the  'Training  Hours'  indicator  due  to  there  being  no information  collation  process  in  place.  Measures  will  be taken to progressively expand the reporting scope of the indicator  in  the  coming  financial  years.  The  subsidiaries regrouped under KLM  International are managed independently locally and KLM Group only has access to e-learning training.\n\n## Turnover Rate\n\nNote 6: Turnover rates are calculated based on headcount under  permanent  contracts  at  the  end  of  the  latest reporting year. The Group has adjusted and implemented a revised calculation method.\n\n- \u25a0 Total employee turnover rate (outgoing): total departures  minus  departures  due  to  the  ending  of fixed-term  contracts  minus  departures  due  to  the exclusion  of  manpower  divided  by  the  number  of employees on permanent contracts at 31/12. Including retirements and changes in employment contracts.\n- \u25a0 Voluntary  turnover  rate:  the  number  of  resignations plus the number of retirements divided by the number of employees  on  permanent  contracts  at  31/12. Including  retirements  and  excluding  changes  in employment contracts.",

The  subsidiaries concerned in these tables are listed in the reporting scope section above.\n\n## Absenteeism - Health and safety in the workplace (Note 1)\n\nA significant portion of the work-related accidents reported by  Air  France  is  due  to  cases  of  barometric  otitis  and musculoskeletal  disorders  which  are  recognized  as  workrelated accidents in France whereas they are recorded as sick leave by KLM in accordance with Dutch law.\n\nAll  KLM  absences  are  on  a  declarative  basis  due  to  the local  legislation  which,  unlike  in  France,  requires  an evaluation of the employee by KLM Health Services only after  six  weeks  of  absence.  For  work-related  absences, only absences following a work-related accident are easily detected.\n\n## Air France and Air France subsidiaries (Note 1)\n\nThe absenteeism rates are calculated based on the hours of absence expressed as a ratio of the hours theoretically worked  (excluding  leave).  For  Air  France  flight  crews, absenteeism  is  broken  down  into  days  and  then converted into hours by multiplying by five hours.\n\nThe absenteeism rate for accidents in the workplace also takes into account travel-related accidents.\n\n## KLM and KLM subsidiaries (Note 1)\n\nSince the 2014 financial year, the absenteeism rates due to  work-related  accidents  or  illness  have  been  reported separately.\n\nThe  absenteeism  rates  are  calculated  by  expressing  the number of calendar days of absence as a percentage of the  calendar  days  theoretically  worked.  Absenteeism  is tracked based on the figures declared by the KLM entities in The Netherlands.\n\n## Health and safety - work-related accidents (Note 2)\n\nThere are  significant  differences  in  the  definition  criteria for  work-related  accidents  between  France  and  The Netherlands (see also the paragraph on absenteeism).\n\n## Air France and Air France subsidiaries together with KLM and KLM subsidiaries\n\nThe work-related accidents taken into account are workrelated accidents involving time off work (at least one day of  absence  from  work).  Travel-related  accidents  are  not included  in  the  indicator  but  are  the  subject  of  specific monitoring and action plans.\n\n## Number of fatal workplace accidents (Note 3)\n\nThe fatal workplace  accidents  are  calculated  and determined in line with the local legislation and rules.\n\n## Frequency and severity rates (Note 4)\n\nThe  frequency  and  severity  rates  concern  97%  of  the Air France-KLM Group workforce.\n\n## Air France and Air France subsidiaries\n\nThe  frequency  and  severity  rates  are  calculated  in calendar days:\n\n- \u25a0 for  ground  staff,  based  on  the  actual  paid  hours worked;\n- \u25a0 for flight crews, based on the hours of 'commitment'.\n\nFor Air France, the number of days of sick leave recorded for  the  year  corresponds  only  to  the  accidents  having taken place during the financial  year.  Part-time  working for health reasons is booked as sick leave. The total period of sick leave is booked in the month of the accident.\n\nAir  France  International,  representing  3%  of  the  total headcount, is excluded since the data is unavailable at the reporting date.\n\n## KLM and KLM subsidiaries\n\nThe frequency and severity rates are calculated for all staff based on the hours theoretically worked.\n\nThe days lost for work-related accidents are tracked based on figures declared by the KLM  entities in the Netherlands.\n\n## Number of disabled employees (Note 5)\n\n## Air France and Air France subsidiaries\n\nFor Air France, the number of disabled employees refers to those who, based in Continental France and the French Overseas Departments and Territories, were present for at least  one  day  during  the  year  and  for  whom  a  valid certificate, pursuant to French law (Article L. 5212-2 of the French  Labor  Code),  is  available.  Note  that  the  data  for international  employees  are  reported  based  on  local legislation.\n\nThe number of disabled employees recruited corresponds to the number of permanent and fixed-term employment contracts  signed  during  the  year;  an  employee  recruited on  a  fixed-term  contract  who  then  transfers  to  a permanent contract during the year will be reported twice.\n\n## KLM and KLM subsidiaries\n\nThe definition of a disabled person varies according to the local legislation governing the entities in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\n\nFor  KLM  and  KLM's  Dutch  subsidiaries,  an  individual  is deemed to be disabled  if  unable  to  carry  out  his  or  her work or any other work at an equivalent salary level. This requires  the  employer  and  the  employee  to  look  for another position with a salary as near as possible to the previous  level  and  gives  the  employee  the  right  to government benefits to compensate for any difference.\n\nFor  KLM's  UK  subsidiaries,  the  reported  number  of employees with disabilities refers to the employees on the payroll on December 31, 2023, for whom a valid certificate, pursuant to national legislation, is available.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  aviation  sector's  pathway  to  Net  Zero will  require  substantial  investment  in  efficiency  and disruptive technologies to switch fuel sources, in addition to  optimized  airspace  management  and  a  modal  shift. IATA recently set a course towards Net Zero emissions by 2050. The  Air  France-KLM  Group,  whose  emission intensity  was  reduced  by  30%  (based  on  fuel  reduction) between 2005 and 2019, is committed to playing a leading role in the sector transition.\n\nClimate change is a major concern for the airline industry and for the Air France-KLM group in particular. Attitudes towards  the  acceptability  of  air  transportation  are changing at both a political level and in terms of society. Both  France  and  The  Netherlands,  as  well  as  the\n\nEuropean  Union,  have  implemented  policies  to  ensure the transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050.\n\nThe  Air France-KLM group intends  to  be  a  player  in  the transformation of its sector, and aims to occupy a leading role.\n\nPlaying  an  active  role  in  advancing  towards  our  goal  of Net  Zero  emissions  by  2050  at  the  industry  and  ICAO levels,  and  obtaining  validation  from  the  SBTi  (Science Based Targets Initiative) for our 2030 emission reduction target, were crucial milestones in 2022 and an important marker  for  the  Group,  reflecting  people's  changing perceptions  of  travel  and  the  call  for  more  responsible aviation.

In 2023, SBTi released a new technical report  outlining  an  interim  1.5\u00b0C  pathway  for  aviation companies,  which  the  Group  is  following,  alongside  the Well  Below  2.0\u00b0C  trajectory,  during  the  2023  to  2030 period (2) .  As  soon  as  the  final  pathway  is  released,  the Group  will  assess  a  potential  update  to  its  current ambition scenario. In addition to monitoring the development of leading industry guidance, the Group is internally developing its Net Zero by 2050 Trajectory, set to be finalized for external disclosure in 2024.\n\nTo  meet  its  ambitious  objectives,  The  Air  France-KLM Group acknowledges the importance of working with all the players in the aviation industry -aircraft manufacturers, airlines and industrial partners - as well as with  the  entire  transport  sector,  including  rail  partners. Decarbonizing  aviation  is  highly  dependent  on  the availability of future technologies, and thus requires close cooperation  and  investment  with  industry  players  to secure  the  technological  capacity  to  reduce  business operations.\n\nThe  Group  has  identified  several  strategic  priorities, investments  and  actions  per  decarbonization  lever  that are pivotal to meeting the Group's climate objectives, as identified  below  in  our  Decarbonization  Road  Map section.  In  addition,  the  Group  has  instituted  internal carbon pricing, placing a monetary value on greenhouse gas emissions, which is factored into investment decisions and increasingly into business cases as a decision factor.\n\n## Our carbon footprint in 2023\n\nKey 2023 emission milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 20.3%  of  the  Air  France-KLM  fleet  was  composed  of new-generation aircraft compared to 10% in 2021;\n- \u25a0 87,000 metric tons of SAF were uplifted, representing 1.1%  of  the  Group's  total  fuel  volume  and  saved 315 ktons CO2eq vs. the use of traditional jet fuel;\n- \u25a0 new MoUs were signed in 2023 to further support our Sustainable Aviation Fuel need for 2030. Our strategy is to  sign  contracts  based  on  the  best  criteria  of  price, availability and sustainability;\n- \u25a0 64%  electrification  of  our  ground  equipment  services vehicles;\n- \u25a0 reduction  of  building  energy  consumption  by  46%  in 2023 compared to 2011.\n\n## Engaging our customers and partners\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  were  the  first  carriers  to  offer  their customers a SAF program for both businesses and cargo, thereby  raising  awareness  and  knowledge  around  SAF, and  encouraging  companies  to  reduce  their  Scope  3 emissions linked to business travel and the transportation of cargo. The  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel  programs currently  have  116  companies.  In  2023,  Air  France-KLM extended the SAF program to its BlueBiz members with 188 companies  now  participating. Air France-KLM Martinair Cargo, the Group's cargo division, runs a similar program  that  was  joined  by  29  freight  forwarders  and customers in 2023.\n\nIndividual  customers  can  also  voluntarily  contribute  to increasing the use of SAF when they make a booking or up until check-in.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

As  a  mark  of  recognition  for  high-value customers,  these  contributions  also  count  towards earning  or  maintaining  Flying  Blue  Elite  status.  Flying Blue was the first loyalty program in the travel industry to structurally introduce such a choice to earn status.\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  have  taken  steps  to  participate  in addressing  climate  change  and  promote  sustainable aviation.  Both  airlines  have  launched  video  campaigns and dedicated pages on their websites, and engaged with the public to share their actions and provide information about their sustainability efforts. Additionally, they encourage  customers  to  learn  more  about  the  climate impact  of  aviation.  The  airlines  offer  a  user-friendly  CO2 impact calculator  that  allows  customers  to  estimate  the carbon footprint of their journeys.\n\nKLM and Air France have made significant strides towards sustainable aviation, including the launch of The Sustainable  Flight  Challenge  (TSFC).  The  initiative  was embraced by the SkyTeam alliance in 2023 with 22 airlines having  operated  72  flights  in  2023,  resulting  in  a  19% reduction in CO2/RTK (3) . During the TSFC, customers were provided  with  information  on  sustainable  actions  they could  take  before,  during  and  after  their  flights.  Over 200 suppliers took up the challenge, providing circular onboard products, lightweight materials, Sustainable Aviation Fuel and IT solutions.\n\n## The Air France-KLM Decarbonization Strategy\n\nAir  France-KLM's  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  are primarily  generated  by  its  direct  activities  (Scope  1),  and mainly by the flight operations which represent 99.8% of the Group's total direct emissions. The ground operations (testing  bench,  runway  vehicles,  etc.)  represent  0.2%  of emissions.  Ground  operations,  like  aircraft  maintenance and tertiary  activities,  also  generate  indirect  greenhouse gas emissions through energy consumption in buildings (electricity and air conditioning) (Scope 2).\n\nFor  Scope 3 emissions, see the dedicated section below. Although Scope 3 is less material in terms of the Group's overall footprint, the Group monitors its Scope 3 emissions annually for the relevant categories.\n\n## Our Decarbonization Road Map\n\nTo achieve its ambitions and reduce its carbon footprint by  activating  all  the  levers  at  its  disposal,  the  Group  is pursuing  its  Decarbonization  Road  Map.  This  directional road  map  is  updated  yearly  to  incorporate  the  latest developments  and  insights and  Air  France-KLM  has developed  a  carbon  forecasting  tool  with  detailed assumptions  that  are  updated  twice  a  year .  This  road\n\nmap  includes  the  following  key  priority  areas  for  which targets  have  been  identified  and  action  plans  are deployed.\n\nThe  plan  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Group's  financial planning  and  includes  an  annual  investment  of  over \u20ac2  billion  in  new  aircraft.  To  fund  Sustainable  Aviation Fuels  (SAF),  Air  France-KLM  will  continue  to  implement specific pricing measures such as the SAF surcharge and our  customer  marketing  programs.  The  decarbonization strategy  was  produced  by  the  Group's  Decarbonization Committee  and  approved  by  the  Group  Executive Committee,  and  finally  validated  by  the  Air  France-KLM Board  of  Directors.  See  chapter  4.1  for  more  details  on these governance bodies.\n\nIn  parallel,  Air  France-KLM  has  been  developing  its 'Net Zero 2050' road map, which is set to be published in 2024.\n\n## Fleet renewal and technological improvements\n\n## Fleet modernization\n\nThe renewal of the fleet with more fuel-efficient aircraft is the  first  lever  in  the  Group's  decarbonization  trajectory. The Group is continuously investing in fleet renewal with the latest-technology aircraft like the A350s, the A320neos and  the  Embraer  195-E2s,  which  are  up  to  25%  more efficient,  in  terms  of  fuel  consumption  and  thus  CO2 emissions  per  passenger  km,  than  the  aircraft  they replace. It is also progressively accelerating the phase-out of aircraft that are the least adapted to its environmental route map.\n\nIn  line  with  its  fleet  renewal  policy,  the  Air  France-KLM Group  is  continuing  to  take  delivery  of  new  generation aircraft like:\n\n- \u25a0 the  Airbus  A350  which  consumes  25%  less  fuel  per passenger  km  than  the  previous  generation  aircraft and is 40% quieter;\n- \u25a0 the  Airbus  A320neo  aircraft  family,  which  consumes 15%  less  fuel  per  passenger  km  than  the  previous generation aircraft and is 50% quieter;\n- \u25a0 the  Airbus  A220  which  consumes  20%  less  fuel  per passenger  km  than  the  previous  generation  aircraft and is 34% quiete r;\n- \u25a0 the Embraer 195-E2, which consumes 9% less fuel per flight  and  emits  31%  less  CO2  per  passenger  km compared to the E-190 that it replaces. This new type of aircraft is also 63% quieter than the EMB190.\n\nBy 2025, the Air France-KLM group projects that up to 37% of  its  fleet  will  be  composed  of  new-generation  aircraft compared to 10% in 2021, taking into account the delays foreseen in aircraft deliveries.",

This  sub-table  of  the  mobility  sector-table  is facilitated  by  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Water Management,  and  involves  sector  parties,  knowledge institutes, trade organizations and social organizations.\n\nKLM is also a partner of TULIPS, a \u20ac25 million EU-funded consortium,  which  will  develop  sustainable  innovations for  airports  between  January  2022  and  December  2025. The project aims to accelerate the roll-out of low-carbon mobility  technologies,  achieve  zero  emissions  and  zero waste  airports  by  2030,  and  climate-neutral  aviation by 2050.\n\nAir France is a key partner in the OLGA project, launched in  2021  by  the  A\u00e9roports  de  Paris  (ADP)  Group  and comprised of four international airports and 57 partners. Air France is a pioneer in the electrification of the ground support equipment fleets at the Paris airports, is a driving force in the clean energy transition and the reduction in local  emissions  thanks  to  its  work  on  optimizing  electric recharging  operations  and  hydrogen  solutions,  and  the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.\n\n## Operational measures generating fuel savings of up to 5% (CO 2 emissions)\n\nIn  2023,  both  KLM  and  Air  France  launched  internal programs geared towards further improving operational efficiency measures within the respective businesses. The programs  investigate  opportunities  for  CO2  reduction across all the divisions, including cross-divisional projects. The  focus  areas  of  the  programs  are  related  to  the categories below and, in the future, additional measures may be introduced.\n\n## Weight reduction\n\nThe  lighter  the  aircraft,  the  less  fuel  it  consumes.  The Group recognizes that  reducing  the  weight  of  aircraft  is crucial  to  reducing  CO2  emissions.  To  achieve  this,  the companies have implemented various measures, such as reducing  the  weight  of  seats,  galley and  service equipment,  and  minimizing  the  use  of  heavy  products and  drinking  water.  Also,  the  weight  of  equipment required  to  transport  payloads  is  being  addressed,  with wooden beams to support the cargo being replaced by a lightweight cardboard version and the use of lightweight cargo containers.\n\n## Aircraft performance optimization\n\nAir  France-KLM,  as  part  of  its  fleet  renewal,  adopts  fuelefficient engines like the LEAP, P&W 1500, and GENx. An innovative  engine  wash  process  allows  on-the-gate cleaning, boosting performance and cutting fuel consumption. Collaboration with paint suppliers reduces paint weight, enhancing  aircraft streamlining and efficiency.  Winglet  upgrades,  such  as  the  Split  Scimitar Winglets  by  Transavia  in  partnership  with  GKN  Fokker Techniek, also contribute to fuel savings.\n\nThe airline group is also engaged in aerodynamic studies, including  the  Flying  V  project,  for  further  technological advancements.\n\n## Route and flight path optimization\n\nImprovements  in  fuel  efficiency  are  achieved  through  a range of measures. These include:\n\n- \u25a0 Air France-KLM is participating in the Single European Sky  ATM  (Air  Traffic  Management)  Research  and Development (SESAR)  program.  This  10-year  program (2021-31)  aims  to  deliver  technological  solutions  to transform  air  traffic  management  in  Europe  and reduce  fuel  burn  to  contribute  to  the  Single  Europe Sky's  10%  CO2  reduction  target.  Through  SESAR, Air France-KLM can optimize its routes and flight paths to  reduce  fuel  burn  and  emissions.  SESAR  addresses the  whole  scope  of  aviation's  environmental  impact, including  CO2  and  non-CO2  emissions,  noise,  and  air quality. https://www.easa.europa.eu/eco/eaer/topics/ air-traffic-management-and-operations/sesar-towardsdigital-european-sky;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  has  developed  decompression  and  driftdown  procedures  to  enable  shorter  routes  around airspace  closures,  reducing  the  impact  of  flight disruption;\n- \u25a0 implementing new tools based on artificial intelligence in  partnership  with  innovative  start-ups.  For  example, Air  France  and  Transavia  France  have  joined  forces with OpenAirlines to deploy the SkyBreathe tool for the precise  tracking  of  fuel-efficiency  practices.  They  also engage in partnerships like developing the OptiFlight Solution by SITA. which uses flight data and machine learning to determine the most-fuel-economical scenarios for all phases of a flight.\n\nThe Group's airlines work closely with French and Dutch Air Traffic Control to optimize their descents and take-offs for greater efficiency. Air France is closely associated with the Green Operation Task Force led by French Air Traffic Control,  while  KLM  is  involved  in  the  Dutch  Airspace Redesign Program (DARP) discussions, which enable the use  of  more  efficient  routes  in  the  European  and  Dutch airspace.  This  redesign  is  expected  to  be  completed  in 2030,  which  should  lead  to  optimized  routing  and reduced fuel consumption and noise pollution.\n\n## Other fuel-saving measures\n\nAll possible avenues of fuel-saving measures are identified and, when feasible, implemented, subject to strict respect of  the  rules  on  Flight  Safety.  All  the  airlines  within  the Air  France-KLM  Group  are  included  in  the  Fuel  Plan,  to improve  the  Group's  energy  efficiency  and  reduce  its carbon footprint.\n\nPilots  apply  fuel-efficient  procedures  wherever  possible, including  Flight  Plan  precision,  speed  adjustments  and optimized trajectories,  and  taxiing  with  one  engine  shut down.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\n## Addressing the impact on the environment\n\nTo  mitigate  the  impact  of  fuel  tankering,  which  involves carrying  excess  fuel  to  destinations  where  it  is  more expensive,  KLM  and  Transavia  have  decided  to  stop  this practice  completely,  while  Air  France  has  discontinued fuel tankering on its short and medium-haul routes.\n\nMobile  engine  water  wash;  cleaner  aircraft  engines  are more  fuel  efficient.  In  2019  KLM  began  to  use  mobile engine  washers  to  clean  its  engines  more  regularly, leading  to  fuel  savings  of  3.4  million  kilograms  per  year and a CO2 reduction of approximately 10,000 tonnes.\n\n## Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)\n\nSustainable  Aviation  Fuels  (SAF)  offer  a  promising  and essential method for decarbonizing the aviation industry. SAF can decrease CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to  conventional  jet  fuel  on  a  life  cycle  basis,  without requiring engine modifications (4) . Future carbon reduction ratios could be even higher, depending on the type of SAF technology utilized. There are ongoing global initiatives to encourage and enforce the use of SAF, such as the SAF tax credits introduced in the US 'Inflation Reduction Act' to  promote  SAF  production.  Notably,  the  'ReFuelEU Aviation  Regulation'  was  adopted  by  the  European Parliament  on  September  13,  2023,  and  will  come  into effect  on  January  1,  2024.  This  regulation  mandates targets for SAF incorporation in global fuel consumption, aiming  for  up  to  70%  by  2050  for  all  flights  within  and departing from Europe.\n\n## In 2023, the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 incorporated 87,000 metric tons of SAF, almost doubling the amount of SAF used in 2022. Air France-KLM aims to remain one of the world's largest users of SAF;\n- \u25a0 announced that it will be investing $4.7 million in DG Fuels,  a  producer  of  SAF  in  the  United  States.  The capital investment will aid in the development of a new SAF refinery in the state of Louisiana. The investment has secured access to 75,000 tons of SAF annually from 2029,  which  is  an  addition  to  the  previous  uptake agreement  signed  in  October  2022  for  the  sourcing 600,000 tons of SAF over the 2027 to 2036 period;\n- \u25a0 in April 2023, KLM  successfully  conducted  tests confirming  that  it  is  safe  to  run  aircraft  engines  on 100%  SAF.  The  engine  tests  were  carried  out  in partnership with engine manufacturer CFM International and fuel producer Neste.\n\n## Committing to SAF incorporation\n\nAir France-KLM is a pioneer in the use of SAF. In line with its goal to reduce total CO2 emissions per RTK by 30% by 2030  compared  to  2019,  the  Group  has  committed  to incorporating a minimum of 10% SAF by 2030. This target goes  beyond  the  European  mandate  of  6%  for  flights departing from Europe by the same deadline.\n\n## Committing to long-term SAF procurement\n\nThis  year's  announcements  build  on  Air  France-KLM's long-term SAF deals with Neste and DG Fuels, covering a total of 1.6 million tons from 2023 to 2036. As pioneers in the  industry,  we  are  fully  committed  to  promoting sustainable  aviation  by  increasing  the  demand  for  and usage  of  SAF,  and  driving  its  growth  and  development worldwide. We achieve this by forging multi-year supply agreements  and  actively  supporting  suppliers  in  their journey  towards  achieving  the  highest  sustainability standards.\n\n## Securing the quality of our SAF supplies\n\nSustainable  Aviation  Fuels  (SAF)  are  aviation  fuels  either made  from  biomass  and  biofuels,  or  synthesized  from renewable CO2 and Hydrogen synthetic fuels. The second category is not currently produced on a commercial scale. The European Directive for Renewable Energy defines the sustainability  criteria  for  aviation  biofuel  to  ensure  the production of SAF does not create demand for land while promoting the use of waste and residues as feedstocks.\n\nAir France-KLM has established a strict sourcing policy to ensure that the SAF production facilities selected have a minimal  impact  on  the  environment.  The  SAF  selection criteria include minimizing the overall direct and indirect land-use  change  to  ensure  no  competition  with  human food and animal feed supply, excluding palm oil-derived materials, and requiring RSB or ISCC certification.\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  have  been  members  of  RSB  since 2008,  in  their  capacity  as  founding  members  of  the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG). This body takes into account 12 criteria ranging from food security to rural  development,  the  quality  of  air,  soil  and  water resources, and waste management.\n\n## Supporting the development of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production chain in Europe\n\nAir  France  and  Elyse  Energy  hosted  the  SAF  Connect breakfast  event  on  April  5,  2023  bringing  together  key stakeholders in the SAF ecosystem to exchange ideas and promote  decarbonization  in  the  aviation  industry.  The event  featured  financial  and  technology  experts,  project leaders,  public  administration  and  off-takers,  discussing the  challenges  and  opportunities  for  SAF  production  in France.  This  was  the  first  event  of  its  kind  organized  by Air France,  highlighting  the  importance  of  SAF  in contributing  to  decarbonization  goals  in  the  aviation sector. The discussions emphasized the need for clarity in the  European  regulatory  context,  financing  support  for producers  and  end-user  pricing  visibility  to  ensure  the future success of SAF production in France. A second SAF Connect event was held in December  2023, in collaboration  with  ENGIE  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Corporate Investment Bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

KLM flights departing from Los Angeles airport have  been  operating  with  SAF  produced  by  the  local World Energy refinery and are supplied by SkyNRG. In 2019, KLM committed to purchasing  an  annual  75,000  tons  of SAF for the next decade, becoming the world's first airline to  invest  in  SAF  on  such  a  large  scale.  SkyNRG  is  now developing Europe's first dedicated plant to produce SAF.\n\n## Supporting SAF-related Research and Development\n\nFor  over  15  years,  the  Air  France-KLM  group  has  been  a leader  in  the  research  and  development  of  Sustainable Aviation Fuel.\n\nKLM made history in 2011 as the first airline to operate a commercial flight partially fueled by SAF, while Air France launched the Lab Line for the Future in 2014, conducting 78  flights  partially  powered  by  SAF.  In  2021,  Air  France completed  its  first  long-haul  flight  fueled  by  SAF produced  entirely  in  France,  while  KLM  made  history again  operating  with  the  world's  first  commercial  flight using synthetic fuel. Air France has been instrumental in promoting  biofuels  for  aviation  and  raising  public authority  awareness  of  the  need  for  a  French  biofuels industry.  Together  with  ATAG  (Air  Transport  Action Group),  Air  France  helped  establish  the  French  national road map on aviation biofuels in 2018.\n\nThrough the Council for Civil Aviation Research (CORAC), Air France is driving the development of a sustainable fuel strategy  through  technological  research  and  innovation, aimed  at  achieving  the  global  ecological  transition objectives.  Additionally,  as  a  founding  member  of  the Aviation  Climate  Taskforce  (ACT),  Air  France-KLM  is committed  to  accelerating  breakthroughs  in  emerging decarbonization  technologies,  with  a  focus  on  synthetic SAF, hydrogen and direct air capture.\n\n## 100% SAF certification\n\nReaching 100% SAF certification is a critical milestone for the  aviation  industry,  as  it  eliminates  the  current limitation of planes being allowed to fly with a maximum of  50%  SAF.  This  flexibility  will  help  the  SAF  industry  to emerge and grow.\n\nThe Air France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance  (AFI  KLM  E&M)  business  unit  has  proudly contributed  to  this  effort  by  conducting  the  first-ever 100%  SAF  test  this  year  on  a  CFM56-7B  engine  at Amsterdam-Schiphol in collaboration with CFM International  and  Neste.  Furthermore,  in  October  2023, EPCOR  BV,  a  wholly-owned  Air  France-KLM  subsidiary, became the  first  MRO  in  the  world  to  test  a  100%  SAFpowered APU in a full test environment, in collaboration with Virgin Atlantic Airways, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Boeing.  These  tests  paved  the  way  for  Virgin  Atlantic's transatlantic  flight  carried  out  on  November  28,  2023, powered entirely by 100% SAF.\n\n## Combining different modes of transportation\n\nWherever  possible  for  journeys  over  short  distances,  the Group's  airlines  offer  their  customers  the  possibility  of combining  different  modes  of  transportation,  a  solution known as inter-modality. Customers can book their entire journey, including both flights and trains, in a single ticket, with guaranteed connections. These offers called 'Train+Air'  and  'Air&Rail'  are,  respectively,  in  partnership with SNCF and Eurostar. The Air France 'Train+Air' product is used  every  year  by  more  than  100,000  customers travelling  to  and  from  Paris-Charles  de  Gaulle  and  ParisOrly  airports.  The  KLM  Air&Rail  product  is  available  for customers connecting via Amsterdam to or from Brussels and  Antwerp  Central,  with  a  yearly  capacity  of  almost 100,000 seats.\n\n## Reducing emissions from the ground operations\n\nIn addition to reducing emissions from kerosene combustion,  which  are  responsible  for  the  majority  of Air  France-KLM carbon footprint, the Group is aiming to achieve  Net  Zero  CO2  emissions (5) for  its  passenger  and cargo-related  activities  in  its  ground  operations  at  its Paris-Charles  de  Gaulle,  Paris-Orly  and  AmsterdamSchiphol hubs by 2030.\n\nIn  2023,  64%  of  the  ground  equipment  at  its  hubs  was electrically  powered.  Proof  Of  Concepts  of  so-called 'Taxibots'  are  in  progress  at  Schiphol  and  Paris  Charlesde-Gaulle. The results and analyses will be used in 2024 to define the next steps in their potential deployment.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  been  actively  pursuing measures  to  reduce  CO2  emissions,  including  trials involving  electric  Ground  Power  Units  (e-GPUs)  and thermal  Air  Conditioning  Unit  (ACU)  converters  for  air conditioning  on  the  ground.  The  Aircraft  Power  Unit (APU) OFF concept, which minimizes APU usage during ground  operations,  is  progressively  being  extended  to medium-Haul  flights,  with  100%  of  Charles-de-Gaulle Terminal 2F's medium-haul gates having been equipped.\n\nTransavia has been experimenting with the start-up SAS on the use of thermal ACU converters for air conditioning on the ground. This reduces the emissions from the use of APUs.  During  the  first  test  phase,  Transavia  was  able  to save  50,000  liters  of  fuel,  i.e.  around  100  tons  of  CO2 emissions. In the long run, Transavia is pursuing its road map for electric Ground Power Units (GPUs) and ACUs.\n\nKLM Catering Services (KCS) is testing the world's first allelectric  catering  truck  as  part  of  its  plan  to  transition  to electric  transport.  The  aim  is  to  replace  all  vehicles  with electric  models  and  aim  for  Net  Zero  CO2  ground operations by 2030. Two electric catering trucks are being built  to  specifications  and  are  expected  to  join  the  fleet in 2024.",

In 2023,  this  accounted  for  0.1%  of  Air  France-KLM's  total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\n## Reducing the energy consumption of the ground facilities\n\nAir  France-KLM  launched  an  active  program  of  energy efficiency measures, reducing building energy consumption by 46% in 2023 compared to 2011. Concrete actions  include  switching  off  lighting,  automatic  switchoff  for  electronic  devices,  thermal  insulation  work  and adjusting temperature settings.\n\nThe Group constantly pursues actions to reduce its energy consumption. KLM has obtained ISO 50001 certification to manage energy efficiency improvements. The photovoltaic  energy  project  on  the  roof  of  KLM's  largest aircraft hangar was completed in 2021. These solar panels generated  1,398  million  kWh  of  renewable  electricity  in 2023. The remaining electricity required to be purchased from  the  grid  to  power  KLM's  ground  operations  was 100%  renewable  and  was  produced  by  onshore  wind farms in Europe.\n\nAt  Air  France,  100%  of  the  heating  needs  of  the  tertiary buildings  at  Toulouse  and  Valbonne,  where  the  bulk  of the  IT  servers  are  located,  are  met  by  recycling  air conditioning system heat. In July 2023, two contracts (of 20  years  duration  called  PPAs  -  Power  Purchase Agreements)  were  signed  with  'EDF  Renouvelable'  to contribute to the installation of two photovoltaic farms in France  (La  Charit\u00e9-Nievre  and  Grand  Gueret-Creuse) which  should  deliver  their  first  production  in  2024.  The annual potential is estimated at 28 GWh  which corresponds  to  20%  of  Air  France's  current  electricity consumption supplied by EDF.\n\n## Reducing Scope 3 emissions\n\nIn  2022,  Air  France-KLM conducted a preliminary spendbased  assessment  of  its  significant  Scope  3  emissions, estimating that they account for 20%-25% of its total CO2 emissions,  with  around  10%  arising  from  non-jet  fuelrelated activities. The main components of its (non-jet fuel related)  indirect  emissions  are  the  purchasing  of  goods and services,  aircraft  manufacturing,  business  travel  and employee commuting.\n\nIn 2023, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the  nature  of  various  Scope  3  emissions  and  to  prepare emission reduction programs in partnership with suppliers, Air France-KLM in collaboration with an external consultancy  firm,  conducted  in-depth  Scope  1,  2  and  3 emission analyses for Air France Industries KLM Engineering  &  Maintenance  as  well  as  for  KLM  In-Flight Services.  The  findings  revealed  that  the  procurement  of goods  and  services  constitutes  their  primary  Scope  3 category.\n\nIn addition, about 100 suppliers have been contacted and invited to participate in the CDP climate module. This will help  to  align  Air  France-KLM's  Scope  3  emissions  data with the Scope 1 emissions data from these suppliers and create  a  common  base  for  joint  emission  reduction actions.\n\nAir  France-KLM  is  also  preparing  for  the  CBAM  (Carbon Border  Adjustment  Mechanism)  which,  as  of  2024, requires the registration of supplier-incurred emissions for products  made  of  iron,  steel  and  aluminum  imported from non-ETS countries.\n\nIn  the  past  years,  Air  France-KLM  has  reported  energyrelated Scope 3 emissions as these represent the largest part  of  Scope  3.  For  2023,  the  emissions  related  to upstream  and  downstream  transportation  (Scope  3 categories 4 and 9) have been reported.\n\n## A sustainable supply chain\n\nThe  Group  has  appointed  EcoVadis,  a  market-leading provider  of  business  sustainability  ratings,  to  support  its understanding  of  every  aspect  of  sustainability  in  the supply  chain,  including  the  environment,  labor  and human rights, and ethics.\n\nSustainability is a key part of the Procurement department's transformation plan.  As  well  as  continuing the  measures  above,  the  plan  includes  embedding sustainability  KPIs  into  the  procurement  processes  and the  criteria  for  awarding  new  business  to  suppliers.  We are also developing  a  wider  training  program  for employees, building sustainability awareness and driving higher  sustainability  performance  across  the  entire organization.\n\n## Support carbon capture, storage projects and biodiversity conservation\n\nThe  Group's  airlines  are  contributing  to  projects  that capture and store carbon from the atmosphere in natural carbon  sinks  such  as  forests  and  mangroves,  with  the support of customers participating in their environmental programs.\n\nAir France has selected EDF Oklima, a subsidiary of EDF, which is known for its expertise in decarbonization. EDF Oklima will support Air France to comply with the Climate and Resilience regulation (article 147). https://www. legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/article\\_jo/JORFARTI000043957219.\n\nMeanwhile,  KLM  has  been  supporting  a  reforestation project  in  Panama  since  2017  and  has  added  two  more projects  in  Uganda  and  Colombia  to  its  portfolio  since 2022.  These  projects  are  all  Gold  Standard  and  FSC certified, contributing to job creation, community development  and  the  United  Nations'  Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMore  details  on  these  programs  are  available  in  section 4.3.3 'Biodiversity' of this document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  achieve  its  ambition  of  Net  Zero emissions in 2050, the Air France-KLM Group is investing in  all  the  mechanisms  in  place,  while  advocating  strict complementarity.\n\n## Mandatory offsetting of domestic flights (French national level)\n\nSince January 1, 2022, operators of French aircraft whose emissions exceed the annual threshold of 1,000t/CO2 must offset  the  carbon  emissions  from  flights  within  France (excluding the French  overseas  departments).  The regulatory  threshold  of  50%  by  2022  was  met  thanks  to anticipation and an ongoing dialogue with the competent authorities. In 2023, this threshold will increase to  70%  followed,  in  2024,  to  100%.  The  2023  project portfolio will be submitted in May 2024.\n\n## Integration into the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ETS (European level)\n\nAir  France-KLM  is  also  preparing  for  the  ramp-up  in  the European  carbon  emissions  trading  scheme  (European level).  A  pillar  of  the  'Fit  for  55'  legislative  package currently  being  adopted  by  the  EU  institutions,  the revision  of  the  European  carbon  market  should  lead  to the  gradual  elimination  of  free  ETS  allowances  at European  level as a clear market  signal against conventional kerosene. The Air France-KLM  Group welcomes  these  orientations  adopted  by  the  European institutions  while  actively  participating  in  the  ongoing discussions.\n\n## Participation in the international carbon offset and reduction scheme CORSIA (International level)\n\nThe Air France-KLM group is fully committed to the CORSIA scheme,  implemented  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO), under the voluntary commitments of France and The Netherlands. The Group is participating in the first  phase of implementation over the 2021-26 period by  reporting  its  emissions  and  implementing  any  offsets. Air France-KLM, which supports its representative organization  IATA,  welcomed  this  step  forward  as  well  as the adoption of the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) for the entire industry at global level.\n\nIn this context and in view of the possible complementarity of the different systems, Air France-KLM considers that the same CO2 emissions should not be simultaneously subject to the domestic offset obligations, the European Emissions Trading Scheme and the CORSIA scheme.\n\n## Non-CO 2 effects\n\nThe  climate  impact  of  aviation  is  larger  than  CO\u2082  alone. Aircraft  produce  other  emissions  such  as  water  vapor, soot  particles  and  nitrogen  oxides  that  interact  with  the atmosphere  and  contribute  to  climate  change.  The  two main  non-CO\u2082  effects  are  condensation  trails  (contrails) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). There are still many uncertainties in assessing the climatic impact of non-CO\u2082 effects,  but  the  latest  scientific  studies  agree  that  they have a significant warming impact, especially in the short term, comparable to the impact of CO\u2082.\n\nThe most significant non-CO\u2082 effect is due to contrails, the line-shaped  clouds  that  sometimes  form  behind  an aircraft.  The  exhaust  soot  particles  emitted  by  engines promote their formation and they can persist for dozens of  hours  under  specific  atmospheric  conditions.  NOx emissions from aircraft  engines  at  altitude  contribute  to the formation of ozone and the destruction of methane, both  greenhouse  gases,  such  that  the  overall  effect  is estimated to be warming although this is dependent on background surface air pollution levels.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  is  actively  working  with research facilities, policymakers and solution providers to deepen the knowledge of non-CO2 effects and speed up the implementation of mitigation measures.\n\n- \u25a0 Since 2013, Air France has been involved in the research infrastructure  IAGOS  (In-Service  Aircraft  for  a  Global Observing  System)  and  operates  one  aircraft  with sensors collecting atmospheric data.\n- \u25a0 Since  2021,  Air  France  has  been  working  in  close collaboration  with  M\u00e9t\u00e9o  France  to  help  further improve  their  forecasting  of  the  contrail  risk  area. Air France has collected more than 2,700 observations with its Contrail Observation Program.\n- \u25a0 In 2023, KLM conducted a six-month pilot project with SATAVIA. Flight paths within Europe were adjusted to avoid  the  formation  of  potentially  warming  contrails. This pilot project gave insights into the non-CO2 effects of KLM  and  the operational implications and constraints of contrail avoidance.\n- \u25a0 KLM  is  a  member  of  the  Advisory  Board  for  the  EU project  which  will  investigate  the  revision  of  the  ETS Directive to include a MRV (Measuring, Reporting and Verification) system for non-CO2 effects in aviation.\n- \u25a0 Air  France-KLM  is  involved  in  CICONIA,  a  three-year European project that aims to define and assess new procedures for airlines and air traffic control to mitigate non-CO2 effects.\n- \u25a0 Air  France-KLM  participates  in  research  through  the ' Conseil pour  la Recherche  A\u00e9ronautique  Civile ' (CORAC) which supports Climaviation, a Climate Chair focusing on the non-CO2 effects of aviation.",

These certifications provide  companies  with  frameworks  to  manage  their environmental impacts, improve their environmental and energy efficiency performance and comply with regulations. These are particularly relevant for Air FranceKLM,  as  the  company  is  aiming  to  improve  its environmental performance within the organization and at its suppliers.\n\nThe Air France Environmental Management System (EMS) has been ISO 14001:2015 certified since 2008 and covers all the  following  activities:  Flight  and  Ground  Operations, Cargo, Engineering & Maintenance, Corporate, Real Estate as well as IT, and the Procurement department based in Metropolitan France.\n\nAir France's ISO 14001:2015 certification covers 100% of the French stopovers and the following sites:\n\n- \u25a0 the Air France headquarters: Paris-Roissy CDG, Montreuil;\n- \u25a0 the Cargo station G1XL: Roissy CDG;\n- \u25a0 the  Engineering  &  Maintenance  facilities  based  in Roissy CDG, Orly and Villeneuve Le Roi;\n- \u25a0 IT: Toulouse, Valbonne.\n\nKLM's  Environmental  Management  System  (EMS)  has been ISO 14001:2015 certified since 1999. The certification covers 100% of the Flight and Ground Operations, Cargo, Engineering & Maintenance, Corporate, and Real Estate & Facility Services in The Netherlands.\n\nIn  total  100%  of  all  the  operational  activities  owned  by Air  France  and  KLM  airlines  have  been  ISO  14001:2015 certified.\n\nSince its inception, Air France-KLM has been committed to maintaining an environmental management system as underscored by its ISO 14001:2015 certification (held since 2008 for Air France and 1999 for KLM). The ISO 14001:2015 certification  requires  the  tracking  and  monitoring  of environmental impacts and issues.\n\nSince  September  2022,  Air  France's  Environmental  Risk and  EMS  has  been  part  of  the  Multi-Risk  Management department.  This  move  was  made  to  leverage  the expertise and experience of the safety flight risk and other risk  management  teams  to  continuously  improve  the\n\nISO  14001  environmental  management  practices.  By joining  forces,  the  teams  will  be  able  to  share  best practices and collaborate more effectively to identify and mitigate the environmental risks.\n\nAir  France's  ISO  14001:2015  certification  was  renewed  in 2023 and KLM will renew its certification in 2024. During the  three  years  of  certification,  local  independent  third parties  will  conduct  annual  follow-up  external  audits  to ensure  compliance  with  the  standard.  Additionally,  an internal  audit  program  is  in  place  to  verify  the  effective performance of the  EMS  across  all  network  contributors throughout the year.\n\nTo comply with the European legislation both companies have  performed  energy  audits.  The  KLM  Group  has chosen  to  comply  with  ISO  50001:2018  for  its  relevant activities (including  subsidiaries)  in  The  Netherlands except  for  airplane  fuel  consumption.  Air  France  has decided  to  make  a  complementary  energy  audit  to ISO 14001:2015, as allowed by the authorities.\n\n## Reducing noise\n\nAs air travel continues to grow and to meet the increasing demand  for  mobility,  airlines  must  also  prioritize  a reduction in noise pollution for those living near airports. The  Air  France-KLM  Group  recognizes  this  responsibility and has formalized its commitment to noise mitigation by enshrining  it  as  a  requirement  in  The  Air  France-KLM Principles. This commitment reflects the Group's dedication  to  balancing  operational  efficiency  with environmental  responsibility,  ensuring  that  air  travel  is sustainable and respectful of the local communities.\n\n## Air France-KLM's approach to noise reduction and mitigation\n\nAir France-KLM  is  committed  to  flying  in  a  more environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  responsible manner, in line with governmental and societal objectives. The Group actively collaborates with Member States and other  stakeholders  to  ensure  compliance  with  the Balanced  Approach,  an  EU  regulation  (no.  598/2014) designed  to  improve  the  noise  environment  around  EU airports,  and  to  promote  greater  compatibility  between aviation  activities  and  residential  areas.  To  meet  these regulations,  Member  States  are  encouraged  to  adopt  a comprehensive  approach,  combining  all  the  available measures to identify the most cost-effective solutions. At the  Air  France-KLM  hubs,  including  Paris-Charles  de Gaulle, Paris-Orly, and Amsterdam-Schiphol, the Balanced Approach  procedure  is  followed,  which  includes  four categories  of  additional  measures  that  Member  States can take to address noise pollution:\n\n- \u25a0 reduction in noise at the source (such as fleet renewal);\n- \u25a0 land-use planning and management  (including insulation projects and continuous descent);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compared  to  previous  generations,  the  A350  is 40%  quieter,  while  the  A320neo  aircraft  family  is  50% quieter,  the  A220  is  34%  quieter,  and  the  E195-E2  has  a 63%  reduction  in  noise  levels.  In  September  2023,  the Air France-KLM Group announced an order for 50 Airbus A350 family aircraft, with purchase rights for 40 additional aircraft,  to  accelerate  the  renewal  of  its  long-haul  fleet, further contributing to reducing noise and improving air quality.\n\n## Land-use planning and management, stakeholder dialogue, insulation projects\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  are  committed  to  engaging  in  a continuous  dialogue  with  stakeholders  in  all  territories, including  the  representatives  of  local  communities, airport authorities and air traffic control. By collaborating closely with these stakeholders, the airlines aim to identify measures that can reduce noise hindrance and improve the quality of the local environment.\n\nIn The Netherlands, KLM has been involved in the Minder Hinder  (less  hindrance)  program  with  Schiphol  and  Air Traffic Control the Netherlands since 2022 to reduce noise hindrance and improve the quality of the local environment. https://minderhinderschiphol.nl/over-dit-plan/.\n\nIn France,  Air  France  actively  participates  in  CCEs (Environmental  Consultative  Commissions)  and  CCARs (Advisory  Residents'  Assistance  Commissions)  at  all  the French  airports  where  it  operates.  Air  France  has  also been actively involved in the Night Flights working group, overseen by the Prefect of  the  Paris-CDG  airport  region, which  has  proposed  new  'dead  of  night'  continuous descent procedures and facilitated the voluntary retirement  of  noisy  aircraft,  including  Air  France's  B747s and A340s.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Air  France  Group  (Air  France,  Air  France HOP!  and  Transavia  France)  contributes  to  the  Airport Noise  Tax  (TNSA)  paid  to  the  French  State,  with  a contribution  of  \u20ac17.5  million  in  2023,  which  funds soundproofing for homes located around French airports. Since the introduction of the TSNA in 2004, \u20ac850 million has been allocated to soundproofing homes, to which the Air France Group has made a significant contribution.\n\nAround Schiphol airport, airlines have collectively contributed \u20ac750 million in noise levies over the past two decades, which have been devoted to soundproofing and\n\ncompensation  for  the  loss  of  property  value  around  the airport. In 2023, the Dutch Ministry decided to resume this noise insulation program,  with  a  new  tranche  of approximately  670  homes  in  the  vicinity  of  Schiphol Airport to be launched at an expected cost in the coming years  of  more  than  \u20ac30  million.  The  cost  of  installing soundproofing is paid entirely by the airlines flying from Schiphol.\n\n## Operational procedures (e.g. better flight routes, continuous descent)\n\nAir France-KLM is committed to reducing its environmental  impact  through  a  range  of  measures, including participation in the SESAR program to optimize routes  and  reduce  fuel  burn,  and  the  development  of decompression and drift-down procedures. These measures contribute not only to the group's sustainability goals  and  the  CO2  reduction  target  but  also  to  the reduction of noise and the improvement in air quality. For more  examples  of  measurements,  see  section  4.3.1 'Accelerate the environmental transition'.\n\nThe  group  also  works  closely  with  air  traffic  control  to optimize descents and take-offs, and whenever possible, implements continuous descent or NADP  (Noise Abatement  Departure  Procedure)  procedures  which significantly  reduce  noise  pollution.  Air  France-KLM  is committed to supporting the government and the DGAC departments in the rapid and widespread implementation of continuous descent procedures at all airports.\n\n## Operating restrictions (e.g. night closure or capacity limitations)\n\nIn  June  2022,  the  Dutch  Minister  of  Infrastructure  and Water  Management  announced  a  plan  to  reduce  the number of aircraft movements at Schiphol from 500,000 to 440,000 by 2024, to reduce noise pollution around the airport.  However,  the  KLM  Group  and  the  European Committee  have  noted  that  the  current  approach  and process of the Balanced Approach procedure differs from the  prescribed  procedure  referred  to  in  the  Noise Regulation. In June 2023 KLM submitted a plan calculated by the Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) which offers a greater  reduction  in  noise  pollution  at  night  (18%)  and exceeds the Minister's target of 15% in 2024. The KLM plan aims to reduce noise pollution by 18% at night and 28% by 2026, while also reducing noise pollution more effectively in  the  long  term.  The  KLM  plan  involves  investing  in quieter, fuel-efficient aircraft, smarter operational processes and the scheduling of quieter aircraft for night flights.\n\nNoise  restrictions  also  apply  to  Paris-Orly  and  ParisCharles de Gaulle airports (curfews, slot caps at Paris-Orly, noise cap on night-time slots at Paris-Charles de Gaulle) and are managed within the framework of the balanced approach.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nAddressing the impact on the environment\n\n## Air quality\n\nAir  quality  is  an  important  aspect  of  our  sustainability efforts within the Air France-KLM Group. It impacts health and  the  environment,  and  as  such,  the  Group  is committed to conducting our operations in a responsible and  environmentally  conscious  manner  that  safeguards the well-being of the wider community.\n\n## Managing air quality\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  Group  monitors  its  atmospheric emissions for both flight and ground operations, including low-altitude  emissions  that  impact  air  quality  around airports.  The  indicators  cover  emissions  of  SO2  and  NOx with  most  of  these  emissions  coming  from  aircraft movements.\n\nIn the framework of the 'Minder Hinder' program, KLM is committed to the hindrance program and to contributing to the government  and  Schiphol's  local  emission reduction plans covering ultrafine particles and nitrogen.\n\nKLM  is  working  with  industry  partners  to  measure Ultrafine  Particulates  (UFP)  and  find  ways  to  reduce  the use  of  Auxiliary  Power  Units  (APUs)  and  increase  n-1 taxiing.  It  is  conducting  a  study  with  Schiphol  Airport  to understand  employee  exposure  to  UFPs  and  their sources. The results will be used in an external follow-up study.\n\n## Electric ground equipment\n\nElectric ground equipment has the benefit of generating no  local  emissions.  This  contributes  to  cleaner  air  and better working conditions at and around airports. In 2023, for  the  Group's  airlines,  64%  of  the  Ground  Service Equipment (GSE) at Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Paris-Orly and  Amsterdam-Schiphol  airports  was  electrically powered.\n\nSince  2022,  in  collaboration  with  other  partners  like A\u00e9roport  de  Paris  and  Amsterdam  Airport  Schiphol, Air  France-KLM  has  conducted  sustainable  taxiing  trials, using  special  towing  vehicles  to  bring  aircraft  to  the runway. This so-called 'Taxibot' is driven by a combination of electric and diesel engines that use 95% less fuel than airplane  engines.  This  method  of  taxiing  greatly  reduces fuel  consumption  and  therefore  CO2,  as  well  as  local emissions  such  as  Nitrogen  (NOx)  and  (ultra)  fine particulate  emissions.  This  innovation  is  still  in  the  trial phase at Schiphol.\n\nBesides this opportunity, other initiatives include trialing electric  Ground  Power  Units  (e-GPUs)  and  thermal  Air Conditioning Unit (ACU) converters for air conditioning on the  ground,  as  well  as  the  introduction  of  electric  Fixed Power  Units  (e-FPU)  at  Schiphol  Airport  and  the  use  of electric  Air  Conditioning  Units  (ACUs)  at  all  the  gates  in the Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly terminals. More details  can  be  found  in  section  4.3.1  'Accelerate  the environmental transition'.\n\nThe Air France-KLM group plans to pursue the electrification of equipment and expand its ground support equipment  (eGSE),  focusing  on  airports  with  the  existing\n\neGSE and adequate charging capabilities,  as  expansion  is dependent on the supply of electric equipment and airport investment in charging infrastructure.\n\n## Transitioning to alternative and renewable fuels for Ground Equipment\n\nMoving  to  Gas  to  Liquid  (GTL),  a  synthetic  diesel,  is  an important measure as it can reduce emissions of harmful pollutants,  such  as  SO2  and  particulate  matter.  GTL  fuel has  a  higher  energy  content  and  burns  more  efficiently, resulting in lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. This shift to GTL fuel can effectively contribute towards reducing emissions and improving air quality.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports  adopted  GTL  to  replace  Non-Road  Diesel  (GNR). All Air France Ground Service equipment at Paris-Charles de Gaulle is now powered by this fuel, which is 15% to 20% more  economical  in  terms  of  CO2,  emissions,  generates 10%  less  NOx,  requires  10%  less  fuel  consumption  and lowers  maintenance  costs  due  to  less  engine  clogging. Air France plans to systematically use GTL as a substitute fuel  for  GNR  throughout  the  electrification  phase  of  its equipment.\n\n## Water management\n\nAlthough  water  conservation  was  not  considered  to  be material in the Air France-KLM double materiality analysis, proper  management  of  water  can  reduce  water  usage and  minimize  the  environmental  impact  of  operations. Air  France-KLM's  commitment  to  sustainable  practices was demonstrated by its achievement of a 9% reduction in  water  consumption  between  2019  and  2023.  This  is particularly relevant considering the UN's prediction of a 40% shortfall in freshwater resources by 2030.\n\nAir France-KLM has implemented several water conservation measures since 2011, such as using pads to clean  aircraft  exteriors  which  has  reduced  water  usage from the 12,000 liters previously used to a mere 150 liters to clean a Boeing 777, recycling the water used for engine washes  and  leveraging  artificial  intelligence  to  optimize drinking  water  loading.  Furthermore,  the  Group  has discontinued  the  practice  of  aircraft  water  salutes  to reduce water waste since 2022.\n\nKLM also introduced the KLM Environment Center (KMC) in  1990 to collect and clean water from most operations. Using  reverse  osmosis  filters,  KMC  is  able  to  remove pollutants like heavy metals before draining the cleaned water into Schiphol Group's wastewater treatment plant. In  the  reporting  period,  KMC  cleaned  and  drained 28,791 m 3 of water.\n\n## Waste management\n\nAir  France-KLM  is  committed  to  minimizing  waste  and increasing the proportion of waste recycled or incinerated using energy recovery where possible. The Group handles many forms  of  waste  arising  from  flight  operations  and maintenance,  while  complying  with  strict  regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  is  exemplified  by  the  regulations  that restrict the  recycling  of  most  catering  waste  from intercontinental  flights  entering  the  EU.  To  address  this issue,  in  2021  Air  France  and  KLM  joined  a  coalition  with other  European  airlines  to  raise  awareness  among legislators. In 2023, the collaboration expanded to include NGO Zero Waste Europa. Additionally, KLM produced an explainer video aimed at the public to raise awareness of the  issue  and  encourage  policymakers  to  act.  These efforts  aim  to  overcome  the  regulatory  hurdles  and improve waste management practices across the aviation industry.\n\nThe following performance targets have been set:\n\n- \u25a0 a 50% reduction in non-hazardous residual waste (nonrecycled waste from the cabin and ground activities) by 2030 compared to the 2011 baseline for all operations in France and The Netherlands;\n- \u25a0 in  March  2023,  Air  France  reached  its  target  of eliminating  90%  of  single-use  plastics  compared  to 2018, having replaced plastic cups, cutlery and stirrers with  sustainable  alternatives  back  in  2019.  In  2023 Air  France  thus  succeeded  in  avoiding  79  tons  of single-use plastic items;\n- \u25a0 the Group's actions are based on the four principles of the  circular  economy:  rethink,  reduce,  reuse  and recycle. Risks and mitigation actions are assessed from a  life  cycle  perspective.  The  airlines  run  programs aimed  at  a  constant  improvement  in  the  overall management  of  waste:  waste  prevention,  increasing the use of recycled content, the eco-design of products and the identification of the appropriate reprocessing facilities. The  end-of-life  management  of  items  is factored into their initial design.\n\nIn  2023,  Air  France-KLM  achieved  a  52%  reduction  in residual waste in France and The Netherlands compared to 2011, representing 8,755 tons of recycled waste. All the entities  in  France  are  the  subject  of  a  comprehensive tracing system pursuant to the Decree of March 25, 2021 on  waste  traceability  transcribed  into  the  Environment Code (Art. R. 541-43 and R. 541-45). https:// www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000043294613.\n\n## Reduction of single-use plastics\n\nWhether  for  reasons  of  hygiene  and  food  safety,  or  to reduce the weight embarked, the in-flight service uses a substantial quantity of Single-Use Plastic products (SUPs). The Air France-KLM group is committed to reducing the environmental  impact  of  SUPs  in  its  operations.  The Group  achieves  this  via  several  levers:  eliminating  SUPs wherever  possible;  replacing  these  plastics  with  other materials  whenever  more  sustainable  alternatives  are available; redesigning SUP items to decrease material use, using  recycled  plastic  and  ensuring  SUPs  are  recycled wherever possible.\n\nSome sustainability measures taken by Air France-KLM to reduce its use of single-use plastic:\n\n- \u25a0 Transavia now uses certified alternatives to single-use plastic,  eliminating  over  7  million  single-use  plastic items per year, or 41 tons of plastic;\n- \u25a0 KLM  Inflight  Services  uses  a  Life  Cycle  Assessment (LCA)  tool  to  choose  packaging  materials  with  the lowest  environmental  impact  and  reduce  waste, aiming to find alternatives to SUPs. Surplus packaging is  avoided  and  items  are  replaced  with  sustainable alternatives whenever possible.\n\n## Other in-flight waste\n\nIn 2023, our airlines continued with the following actions:\n\n- \u25a0 Air France worked with Delta and IATA to recycle waste on  flights  and  launched  recycling  trials  on  the  US routes;\n- \u25a0 Air France participated in The SkyTeam  Flight Challenge  for  environmentally  responsible  flights  and achieved  an  impressive  level  of  waste  reduction  on  a CDG/ATH/CDG flight, with only 3% of waste incinerated;\n- \u25a0 KLM sorts and recycles on-board waste on its European flights,  including  plastic  and  cardboard  cups,  glass, cans, aluminum lids, paper, EPS boxes and PET plastic bottles;\n- \u25a0 KLM  conducts  waste  sorting  and  management campaigns for its flight crews and supplies information via an internal website and e-book;\n- \u25a0 KLM has redesigned its Economy glass, resulting in a 10%  material  reduction,  replaced  plastic  packaging with  paper  for  salt  and  pepper,  reduced  single-use plastic by 31,370 kg and reduced secondary packaging material through supplier conversations, resulting in a decrease of 5,833 kg of packaging material;\n- \u25a0 Transavia has started sorting waste on board, saving up to  80  tons  of  residual  waste  per  year  and  accounting for 45% of cabin waste (plastic, cans and drink cartons).\n\n## Action to combat food waste\n\nAir  France-KLM  manages  food  waste  from  its  flight operations  in  a  strict  regulatory  context.  The  Group employs two main levers to reduce food waste: adjusting on-board services and implementing a rigorous policy for the  management  of  merchandise  inventories.  The  key actions taken by the Group to combat food waste include the:\n\n- \u25a0 pre-selection of hot meals in the Business cabin, which made it possible to avoid 11 tons of waste in 2023;\n- \u25a0 a reduction in bread reserves in Air France's Premium Economy and Economy classes, which saved 61 tons of food waste over the year;",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nAddressing the impact on the environment\n\n- \u25a0 a  food  donation  policy,  where  unconsumed  items served on long-haul flights are donated to charities. In 2023, more than one million items (food and material) were donated to charitable associations by Air France;\n- \u25a0 the Zer0Waste project by KLM, which has resulted in a reduction  of  approximately  50%  in  unconsumed sandwiches that had previously been thrown away;\n- \u25a0 a survey of flight crews to gather their ideas for limiting waste  and  improving  on-board  sorting.  The  results  of this survey will lead to new initiatives in 2024;\n- \u25a0 adjusting perishable product orders and maintaining a rigorous merchandise inventory management policy to reduce wastage of unconsumed fresh products.\n\n## Aircraft end-of-life\n\nAircraft  that  are  at  the  end  of  their  service  with  the Air  France-KLM  group  are  returned  to  the  lessors  or  are sold to third parties to continue their operation. Aircraft at the end of their economic life will be dismantled by the lessor  or  purchasers,  or  under  the  management  of  the Air France-KLM group itself.\n\nEngines  &  Components  used  in  and  on  'end-of-life' aircraft have their own individual life cycles. Parts that are relatively new or recently overhauled will not be treated as waste  but  will  be  removed  to  serve  other  aircraft  in compliance with regulations (EASA part M and part 145 as well  as  FAA  regulations),  requirements,  form,  fit  and function  without  compromising  on  safety  or  reliability. The  remaining  parts  and  hull  will  be  dismantled  and recycled,  a  process  for  which  the  Group's  airlines  have contracted  specialized  companies  with  the  highest environmental  standards.  like  Tarmac  Aerosave.  Tarmac Aerosave recycles approximately 90% of aircraft materials. An additional 8% are fluids such as oils which are reused to produce energy, leaving only 2% of an entire aircraft for disposal.\n\n## Aeronautical waste\n\nEngine  parts,  aircraft  seats,  cargo  pallets  and  broken suitcases are just some examples of the production waste generated by our Engineering & Maintenance, Cargo and Flight  Operations.  Although  most  aeronautical  waste  is subject to strict regulation, Air France-KLM has implemented  many  initiatives  to  reduce  non-recycled production waste.\n\nEngineering & Maintenance prevents aeronautical component  waste  by  developing  alternative  repairs. Whenever  repair  is  no  longer  viable,  aeronautical components  are  deemed  to  be  Beyond  Economical Repair  (BER).  These  components,  as  well  as  other elements of aeronautical  waste,  are  then  sent  to  the  inhouse  salvation  and  scrap  team.  This  team  handles procedures  to  reuse  and  recycle  spare  parts,  and  other forms of waste. Wherever the rules and regulations allow, the  cradle-to-cradle  principle  is  applied  to  reintegrate waste into a new production cycle. Scraps that cannot be integrated within our own  production  cycles  and\n\ncomponents that are governed by strict regulations, and thus  are  not  reusable,  are  collected  by  external  partners and  either  destroyed  or  processed  into  secondary  raw materials.  The  process  foresees  procedures  to  reuse  and recycle  spare  parts.  This  program  has  been  extended  to other  types  of  waste:  furniture,  equipment,  pallets  and blankets.\n\nAt  Air  France,  the  move  up-market  for  the  medium  and long-haul  cabins  with  the  installation  of  new  seats  has been accompanied by the implementation of a recycling and  dismantling  process  for  the  old  seats  ranging  from the reuse and recycling of components to the recovery of foams and metals.\n\nHazardous  waste  from  the  maintenance  activities  is  the subject  of  a  comprehensive  tracing  system  and  its handling  is  harmonized  in  the  different  maintenance sites.\n\n## Incorporating circular economy principles\n\nAir France-KLM is implementing initiatives to incorporate circular  economy  principles,  such  as  the  up-cycling  of waste for new uses like, for example, the recycling of used cabin materials (life jackets, seat fabrics, seat belts, etc.) or aircraft parts (AIR ART).\n\nA permanent recycling process is in place for Air France uniforms  and  work  clothing.  Staff  are  encouraged  to adopt  good  sorting  practices  by  depositing  them  in secure containers located at the Air France premises. The uniforms  are  collected  from  various  sites  by  different partners  including  a  Work  Assistance  Establishment (ESAT for the employment of disabled workers). In 2023, a new  process  trialed  with  the  work  clothing  supplier enabled the reuse of 964 items, and the recycling of 3,827 white shirts and 5,433 other darker-colored uniform items. When this recycling is not possible, and for safety reasons, these textiles are crushed before being transformed into solid  recovered  fuels  with  a  high  calorific  value.  These fuels offer a non-fossil alternative for large fuel consumers such as the cement and lime industries. Since September 2018, the Roissy site has collected 86 tons of textiles.\n\nIn  another  initiative  to  reduce  the  impact  of  textile production, cabin crews and pilots have tested a new shirt including  mechanical  recycled  polyester  fiber,  or  rPET, which requires less energy and resources to manufacture.\n\nAt KLM, Schijvens Corporate Fashion is the new provider of uniforms  and  other  work  wear.  The  sustainable uniforms  and  work  wear,  which  will  be  provided  from 2024,  are  in  line  with  the  principles  of  the  circular economy. After use, they are collected by Schijvens to be used as feedstock for new uniforms. Schijvens's factories are being audited by the Fair Wear Foundation using the independent firm Modint Ecotool BaWear. Schijvens has also  conducted  sustainability  impact  calculations  and found that the new KLM blouses and shirts will result in an annual saving of 16 tons of CO2 and 12 million liters of water compared to the old uniform.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  is  achieved  by\n\n## 4.3.3  Impact on Biodiversity\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nAir  France-KLM's  2023  double  materiality  matrix  shows that  stakeholders  do  not  consider  biodiversity  to  be  a material  concern  due  to  the  nature  of  Air  France  KLM's activities,  however  Air  France-KLM  remains  continuously involved  in  efforts  and  projects  that  contribute  to  the protection  of  natural  ecosystems  and  the  restoration  of degraded ecosystems.\n\nBiodiversity encompasses three elements: diversity within species, diversity between  species  and  diversity  of ecosystems.\n\n## Commitments to biodiversity\n\nAir France made a strong commitment to biodiversity by joining the Act4Nature international initiative in May 2021: this  is  a  voluntary  commitment  initiative  in  favor  of biodiversity aimed  at French companies  with  an international  presence.  By  the  end  of  2023,  Act4Nature will have  brought  together  more  than  70  major companies,  all  of  which  have  pledged  to  respect  10 common  commitments  as  well  as  their  own  specific pledges. These  can  be  consulted  on  the  https:// www.act4nature.com/ website.\n\nAir France-KLM  ensures  that  its  partnerships  and contracts with SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) producers use  approved  renewable  raw  materials,  certified  by  the Roundtable  on  Sustainable  Biomaterials  (RSB)  and  have International Sustainability and  Carbon  Certification (ISCC+), using second- and third-generation materials that do not interfere with pre-existing land use.\n\nIn June 2017, Air France and KLM signed the Buckingham Palace  Declaration  formalizing  their  commitment  and determination  to  combat  the  trafficking  of  protected species  and  their  zero-tolerance  approach.  Through  its membership of IATA, the Group is also committed to full compliance  with  CITES  (Convention  on  International Trade  in  Endangered  Species  of  Wild  Fauna  and  Flora). Air  France  and  KLM  also  have  a  worldwide  policy\n\nadopting two approaches: Greening IT and Greening by IT, which minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency. Additionally,  the  company  focuses  on  reducing,  reusing, and  recycling  IT  equipment.  Examples  include  recycling iPads  and  obsolete  iPad  covers,  and  developing  Digital Eco Systems with suppliers to establish circular solutions and services.\n\nprohibiting  the  transportation  of  hunting  trophies  (even when  obtained  legally)  on  board  all  their  flights,  in checked luggage, carry-on baggage and cargo.\n\nAir  France  was  behind  the  creation  of  a  cross-industry platform bringing together several corporate partners, as well  as  government  bodies  and  NGOs,  with  the  aim  of making CDG a no-fly zone. Finally, since 2023, Air France has been collaborating with the newly-formed interdepartmental  working  group  on  the  subject  of combating wildlife trafficking and continues to work with international  associations  and  organizations  (WWF,  OIE, IATA,  United  for  Wildlife,  etc.).  By  taking  a  stand  against this  traffic,  the  Group  is  helping  to  combat  the  overexploitation of resources. To its cost, air transportation is particularly affected by this traffic.\n\nIn  2023,  numerous  actions  were  carried  out  within  the scope  of  the  Group's  responsibility  as  an  airline.  Raising customer and employee awareness is clearly part of the Group's scope of action and it is keen to play its full part. All the communication actions are designed to cover the entire customer journey, from ticket purchase through to the journey itself: updates to the commercial websites in the \"Items forbidden in baggage\"  section; poster communication  campaigns;  awareness-raising  video  on illegal  trade;  updates  to  customer  visuals;  pre-flight messages,  etc.  Air  France  is  continuing  its  awarenessraising  program  for  staff  in  contact  with  customers  or their  baggage,  to  help  them  spot  and  report  suspicious behavior or baggage to the relevant authorities.\n\n## Air France-KLM group biodiversity preservation actions\n\nThe Air France-KLM group's actions to preserve biodiversity are based on the main factors of biodiversity erosion:  overexploitation  of  resources,  climate  change, pollution  and  the  introduction  of  invasive  species,  and local action involving customers, suppliers and employees.",

All FORLIANCE  projects  supported  by  KLM  and  Transavia Netherlands meet the Gold Standard, the highest quality standard to maximize the positive impacts on climate and development.  The  projects  in  Panama,  Uganda  and Colombia  combat  deforestation,  protect  and  enhance biodiversity,  restore  degraded  land  and  provide  fair employment for local communities:\n\n- \u25a0 the  \"CO2OL  Tropical  Mix\"  project  in  Panama,  which aims to reforest an area of high biological diversity that has been severely degraded by unsustainable livestock farming  practices,  using  nature-based  solutions  such as agroforestry;\n- \u25a0 a project in the Bita wetland in Colombia, focusing on the  regeneration  of  native  trees  after  land  had previously been burned for cattle farming purposes;\n- \u25a0 a  project  in  Uganda,  aimed  at  conserving  biodiversity and improving the economic situation of the surrounding villages.\n\nFlying  Blue  program  members  have  the  opportunity  to donate Miles in support of associations, including A Tree for You, which carries out tree planting projects in France and around the world, in close collaboration with the local communities to maximize both the social and environmental impacts of such projects.\n\n## Contributing to the fight against climate change\n\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions is the primary lever for reducing our impact on biodiversity. Consequently, all actions  that  reduce  CO\u2082  emissions  also  have  an  indirect beneficial effect in reducing biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.\n\n## Combating pollution (air, water, noise, waste)\n\nAir  France-KLM's  actions  to  reduce  its  impact  on  air quality on the ground and water quality, reduce its noise footprint, reduce the use of single-use plastics and better manage  its  waste,  are  all  initiatives  that  help  limit pollution and, consequently, reduce the negative impact on biodiversity.\n\n## Contributing to the fight against invasive species\n\nAir France participates in the fight against the introduction  of  invasive  species  by  respecting  the prohibitions  on  transporting  certain  animal  and  plant species,  as  well  as  the  conditions  governing  authorized transport as laid down by the conventions and regulations in force.\n\n## Act locally by involving customers, suppliers and employees\n\nIn  addition  to  these  actions,  the  Air  France-KLM  group raises  awareness  among  its  individual  and  corporate customers of its initiatives to protect biodiversity.\n\nIn its relations with subcontractors  and  suppliers, Air France-KLM ensures that environmental protection is guaranteed. If, based on supplier screening, a supplier is found to belong to a supplier category that is associated with an elevated level of sustainability risk, the supplier is asked  to  carry  out  an  assessment  of  its  sustainability performance with Ecovadis. The Ecovadis assessment and its  360\u00b0  monitoring system in the Environment category ensures  that  the  assessed  supplier  has  had  no  serious negative results in the past three years.\n\nEcovadis  assessments  enable  a  score  to  be  assigned  to each  category  (Environment,  Human  Rights  and  Labor Rights,  Ethics  and  Responsible  Purchasing),  all  of  which contribute to the overall score awarded to each company assessed.\n\nBiodiversity  is  one  of  the  nine  themes  assessed  in  the environmental  field:  the  impacts  of  the  company's activities on flora, fauna, protected lands and ecosystems are all taken into account.\n\nAs  a  result,  the  severity  and  probability  of  occurrence  of risks (including deforestation) are reduced, or even greatly reduced, especially when  suppliers  are  themselves committed to combating deforestation.\n\nInforming and involving our employees and reaching out to  as  many  people  as  possible  are  also  among  our priorities,  with  the  help  of  forums,  briefings,  training courses  and  dedicated  intranet  pages.  In  addition,  since 2021, Air France has been encouraging and facilitating its employees' civic commitment by providing them with the Vendredi  platform,  which  connects  employees  with environmental  and  biodiversity  protection  associations, among  others.  Since  the  launch  of  the  platform  at Air France,  the  Environment  and  Biodiversity  have represented 49% of the most popular themes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, this update has no material impact on the Air France-KLM group's trajectory.\n\nThe  environmental  transition  of  the  air  transportation industry  is  a  priority  in  our  contribution  to  the  fight against climate change.\n\n- \u25a0 It is an immense challenge for our sector which plays a key  societal  role:  air  transportation  brings  together people,  cultures  and  economies.  It  contributes  to developing  tolerance  and  understanding  of  others through travel. It connects the territories and contributes to the development of numerous economies.  According  to  a  report  from  the  EM Strasbourg  Management  School,  published  in  early 2020 and based on 2019 figures (prior to the Covid-19 period), Air France-KLM contributes \u20ac39 billion annually  to  the  French  economy  (1.6%  of  GDP,  and 475,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs). During the Covid  crisis,  the  Group  demonstrated  to  the  full  its strategic  dimension,  with  repatriation  operations  and the  transportation  of  masks,  vaccines  and  medical personnel.\n- \u25a0 If  it  is  to  continue  to  play  this  role,  the  sector  must succeed in decarbonizing: it is a strong expectation of our customers and crews, and a requirement of society as  a  whole,  which  engages the whole of our industry. Throughout  its  history,  the  sector  has  managed  to keep pace with technological and operational transitions towards safer, more affordable air transportation  thanks,  in  particular,  to  aircraft  and engines  that  are  more  energy-efficient,  quieter  and less-polluting. A new revolution is now under way, that of  decarbonization.  All  of  the  sector's  abilities  are\n\nmobilized  around  a  successful  transition  to  more sustainable, more responsible aviation. This decarbonization constitutes a major challenge which is central  to  the  strategy  Air  France-KLM  group,  which aims to be a pioneer in this area.\n\n4.3.4.2\n\nThe National Low Carbon Strategy ( Strat\u00e9gie Nationale Bas-Carbone - SNBC): reminder of the overall principles\n\n## National Low Carbon Strategy (SNBC)\n\nThe National Low Carbon Strategy ( Strat\u00e9gie Nationale Bas-Carbone SNBC) serves as France's policy-making road  map in  terms  of  climate  change  mitigation.  It provides  guidelines  to  enable  the  transition  to  a  low carbon  economy  in  all  sectors  of  activity. It sets greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for France in  the  short/medium-term  in  the  form  of  carbon budgets, i.e., emission ceilings not to be exceeded per period of five years.\n\nThe carbon budgets account for the emissions recorded in mainland France, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, R\u00e9union, Saint Martin and Mayotte, as well as emissions from transportation between these geographical areas. Emissions from international air and maritime links are not included in these readings.\n\n## The AMS scenario for air transportation\n\nThe National Low Carbon Strategy is based on a baseline scenario developed  through  a  modelling  exercise  also used  in  the  Multi-Year  Energy  Programming.  This scenario,  called 'With  Additional  Measures' (Avec Mesures Suppl\u00e9mentaires -AMS ), details  all  the  public policy  measures,  in  addition  to  those  already  in  place, which  will  allow  France  to  adhere  to  its  short,  medium, and long-term climate and energy objectives. It  outlines a  possible  trajectory  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions until carbon neutrality is achieved by 2050, which  is  used  as  the  basis  for  defining  the  carbon budgets.\n\nThe air transportation AMS scenario is based on a number of  hypotheses  relating  to  traffic  growth,  the  improved energy efficiency of air transportation and the incorporation  of  sustainable  aviation  fuels.  The  latest version of the air transportation WAM, taking into account the most recent data available on the French Ecological Transition Ministry website, provides the following figures and revisions relative to 2015:\n\n| AMS scenario  (MtCO2)       | 2015   | 2025   | 2030   | 2050   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| National air transportation | 4.6    | 4.7    | 4.6    | 1.9    |\n| Change                      | 0 %    | 2 %    | 0 %    | -59 %  |\n\nhttps://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Guide%20art.%2066%20LFR3.pdf",

Some of these assumptions  are  implicit  in  the  Air  France-KLM  group's overall  decarbonization  road  map  at  global  level  while others  are  specific  to  the  construction  of  this  SNBC trajectory.\n\nNote that, across the SNBC scope, the Air France-KLM group  had  already  reduced  its  greenhouse  gas emissions  by  5%  in  absolute  terms  between  2015  and 2019) (2.26 MlnT of CO2 in 2015 and 2.16 MlnT in 2019).\n\n## Hypotheses common to the overall road map and the SNBC scope\n\n- \u25a0 Emissions  factor  relating  to  the  combustion  of kerosene: for 1 ton of kerosene burned, 3.16 tons of CO2 are  emitted.  This  emission  factor  is  in  line  with  the ICAO's  CORSIA  system  and  slightly  higher  than  the factor of 3.15 used within the framework of the EU ETS system.\n- \u25a0 Percentage incorporation of SAF (Sustainable Aviation  Fuel)  as  a  proportion  of  the  total  volume  of fuel:\n- \u00b7 2025:  target  of  2%  SAF  incorporation  on  the  SNBC scope,\n- \u00b7 by  2030:  the  Air  France-KLM  group  is  targeting  the incorporation  of  at  least  10%  SAF  at  global  level, higher  than  the  French  and  European  regulatory requirement,\n- \u00b7 at  the  time  of  writing  of  this  document,  there  is  no difference  in  the  SAF  incorporation  assumptions  in the specific SNBC trajectory below and those in the Air France-KLM Group's overall decarbonization road map.\n- \u25a0 Gains obtained thanks to air operations optimization: the  assumption is a gain of 5% by 2050 relative to 2019. This hypothesis is deliberately relatively conservative  since  it  depends  on  exogenous  factors (e.g.,  the  implementation  of  the  Single  European  Sky project).\n\n## Hypotheses specific to the SNBC scope\n\n- \u25a0 The schedule of activity expressed  in  Available  SeatKilometers (ASK), defined with the following granularity,  corresponding  to  the  Air  France-KLM Group's SNBC activity scope:\n- \u00b7 Air  France  (AF)  -  Long  Haul:  French  Overseas Territories: flights between  Paris  and  Cayenne/ R\u00e9union/Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre/Fort-de-France;  and  flights between the French overseas territories,\n- \u00b7 Air France - Hub: flights in mainland France feeding the Paris-CDG Hub,\n- \u00b7 Air  France  -  Point-to-Point:  Domestic  France  flights from/to Paris-Orly and Transversal flights,\n- \u00b7 Transavia  France  -  Domestic:  Domestic  activity  of Transavia France.\n\nThis  schedule  is  supported  by  activity  projections  per air line through to the end of 2028 as of the writing of this document, then beyond, by a projection of activity at a normative level established by the Air France-KLM Group's Strategy Division.\n\n- \u25a0 Aircraft  load  factor  data, specified  based  on  the above-mentioned  business  segments.  The  current hypothesis  retained  for  this  trajectory  is  a  return,  in 2024,  to  the  aircraft  load  factors  seen  in  2019,  on  the SNBC scope.\n- \u25a0 The fleet plan expressed as the number of aircraft by aircraft type  and  by  year  based  on  the  abovementioned  business  segments.  Several  elements  key to the specific SNBC fleet plan:\n- \u00b7 Air France - Long-Haul: taking into account the fact that the Long-Haul destinations on the SNBC scope are  currently  mainly  served  by  Boeing  777-300ER aircraft,  in  a  densified  configuration.  On  the  current forecasts, this will be the case until at least 2028,\n- \u00b7 Air  France  -  Hub  and  Point-to-Point  activity:  since 2021, the Airbus A320  family  fleet has been progressively  replaced  by  new-generation  Airbus A220s. These aircraft enable around a 20% reduction in  CO2  emissions  and  fuel  consumption  relative  to the previous generation of aircraft,\n- \u00b7 Transavia  France  -  Domestic:  Transavia  France  has historically  operated  Boeing  B737-800  aircraft.  The fleet mix retained within the framework of the SNBC for  Transavia  includes  the  introduction  of  the  newgeneration Airbus A320Neo as of 2024. These aircraft enable around a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions and fuel  consumption  per  passenger  km  relative  to  the previous-generation aircraft.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  ground  operations (engine  test  benches,  runway  vehicles,  etc.)  represent 0.2%  of  the  direct  emissions.  Tertiary  activities  also generate  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through  energy consumption in buildings (electricity and air conditioning) (Scope 2).\n\nThe indirect  greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3) mostly come  from  the  upstream  phase  (extraction,  production, distribution,  etc.)  of  aviation  kerosene  production.  A  first evaluation  based  on  the  2019  expenditure  and  figures showed  that  around  two-thirds  of  the  Air  France-KLM Group's  Scope  3  emissions  are  linked  to  the  emissions generated  during  the  upstream  phase  of  kerosene production.  The  other  main  components  of  indirect emissions  are  the  purchasing  of  goods  and  services, aircraft  manufacturing,  business  travel  and  employee commuting.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group's  CO2  emissions  trajectory below  is based  on  Scope  1  CO2  emissions, i.e.  taking account only of emissions linked to fuel combustion, so as to remain consistent with the specific targets assigned to  air  transportation  in  the  SNBC,  and  the  accounting of aviation sector emissions by CITEPA (Interprofessional  Technical  Centre  for  Studies  on  Air Pollution)  (see  OMINEA\\_2023.pdf  (citepa.org)).  Additional emissions  associated  with  the  extraction,  refining  and transportation  of  fuels  are  not  considered  here.  These additional  emissions  are  however  well  accounted  for  in other sectors by the SNBC. For information purposes, the emissions linked to the manufacturing and transportation of fuel can be calculated by applying a factor of x0.2545 to the emissions linked to the combustion of kerosene. This multiplier factor comes from the recommendations of the Science  Based  Targets  initiative  in  its  document  on  the airline sector.\n\nThe Climate Action Plan section figuring in this document includes  the  Air  France-KLM  group's  commitments  and actions on the remainder of the Scope 3 scope.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions and the focus on CO 2 emissions\n\nThe  trajectory  outlined  below  is  based  only  on  CO2 emissions, consistent with the WAM scenario for aviation.\n\nThe other greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. N2O, CH4) that are  generally  presented  in  the  form  of  CO2  equivalent (CO2e)  are  marginal  relative  to  the  CO2  emissions  from aircraft, with a contribution of around 1%, as shown in the CITEPA  data  (https://www.citepa.org/fr/secten/)  for  air transportation in:\n\n## Air transportation industry\n\n|                 | 2021   | % of the  total   | % 2021/90   |\n|-----------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|\n| NOX (Gg)        | 6.0    | 0.79              | (8.9)       |\n| COVNM (Gg)      | 0.62   | 0.05              | (72)        |\n| CO (Gg)         | 7.3    | 0.27              | (45)        |\n| HFC (Gg CO2e)   | 0.11   | 0.0               | -           |\n| CO2 (Tg)        | 3.80   | 1.2               | (8.8)       |\n| CO2e (Tg CO2e)  | 3.80   | 0.92              | (8.8)       |\n| As (Mg)         | -      | -                 | -           |\n| Cd (Mg)         | -      | -                 | -           |\n| Cr (Mg)         | -      | -                 | -           |\n| Cu (Mg)         | -      | -                 | -           |\n| Hg (Mg)         | -      | -                 | -           |\n| Ni (Mg)         | -      | -                 | -           |\n| Pb (Mg)         | 2.8    | 3.3               | (48)        |\n| Se (Mg)         | -      | -                 | 0           |\n| Zn (Mg)         | -      | -                 | 0           |\n| PM10 (Gg)       | 0.11   | 0.04              | (34)        |\n| PM2,5 (Gg)      | 0.08   | 0.04              | (41)        |\n| PM1,0 (Gg)      | 0.03   | 0.02              | (61)        |\n| BC (Gg)         | 0.02   | 0.06              | (54)        |\n| HAP (Mg)        | -      | -                 | -           |\n| PCDD-F (g-ITEQ) | -      | -                 | -           |\n\nThus, for 2023, for the Air France-KLM group, here are the volumes  of  GHG  emissions  at  global  level  to  appreciate the proportions between the various GHGs:\n\n|                  | Air France-KLM Group's emissions  in 2023   | Air France-KLM Group's emissions  in 2023   |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| CO2 (Scope 1)    | 24,681                                      | 99.961%                                     |\n| NOX (< 3,000 ft) | 8.88                                        | 0.036%                                      |\n| SO2 (< 3,000 ft) | 0.68                                        | 0.003%                                      |\n\nURD 2023 reference section 4.3.5.4.",

Two-thirds  of  aviation's  climate impact  is  estimated  to  be  caused  by  other  greenhouse gas emitted from jet engines that cause further warming beyond  the  impact  of  carbon  alone.  For  example, particulate  matter  has  been  linked  to  the  formation  of condensation  trails  (the  cloud-like  stripes  that  form behind  an  aircraft)  whose  warming  effect  is  potent  but short-lived,  lasting  from  a  few  minutes  to  a  day.  NOx emissions from aircraft  engines  at  altitude  contribute  to the  formation  of  ozone  and  the  destruction  of  methane (both  greenhouse  gases)  such  that  the  overall  effect  is estimated to be warming although this is dependent on background  surface  air  pollution  levels.  For  the  past  30 years, these non-CO2 effects on the climate have been the subject  of  scientific research  at  international  level. Quantifying  the  impact  of  these  phenomena  on  the climate,  which  requires  the  use  of  complex  multidimensional  models,  is  still  fraught  with  considerable uncertainty.\n\nTherefore the trajectory below does not take these nonCO2 effects into account, in the same way as the Science Based Targets for aviation. Nevertheless, Air France-KLM is fully  aware  of  these  effects  and  factors  them  into  its thinking, strategies and research work, as detailed in the Climate Action Plan section at the end of this document.\n\n## Baseline\n\nIn view of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the aviation industry, the baseline commonly used for the decarbonization trajectory is 2019.\n\nIn this document we also provide some figures based on 2015, in line with the reference year of the WAM scenario.\n\n## Air France-KLM's emission reduction targets over the short, medium and long term\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  set  itself  a  target  of reducing its Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) intensity by 30%  by  2030  relative  to  the  2019  baseline  (g  CO2eq/RTK [Revenue  Ton-Kilometers]).  This  target  was  validated  by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in November 2022 for the Air France-KLM group, as well as for Air France and KLM.\n\nOn  the  SNBC  scope,  i.e.  national  air  transportation,  the Air  France-KLM  Group  has  set  itself  the  following  short, medium  and  long-term  ambitions  for  reducing  CO2 emissions in absolute terms (excluding offsetting):\n\n- \u25a0 in the short term (2025), a -10% reduction relative to 2019;\n- \u25a0 in the medium term (2030), a -16% reduction relative to 2019;\n- \u25a0 in the long term (2050), a -65% reduction relative to 2019.\n\nTo define these targets, the Air France-KLM group carried out a CO2 emissions forecasting exercise, factoring in the expected  effects  of  the  various  measures  that  will contribute to their reduction: fleet renewal, incorporation of sustainable aviation fuel, improved operational efficiency  linked  to  the  optimization  of  air  traffic  control and flight management.\n\nNote  that  these  short  and  medium-term  targets  are based on the current forecasts for Air France-KLM's traffic growth,  the  Group's  ambitions  in  terms  of  sustainable aviation fuel and the current state of its market positions.\n\nFurthermore, the long-term trend in the Air France-KLM group's emissions (2050) is based on assumptions that are by  their  very  nature  uncertain  concerning,  in  particular, the  availability  of  sustainable  aviation  fuel  (SAF)  at competitive prices, technological advances in the development of aircraft emitting fewer greenhouse gases, or the implementation of measures to optimize air traffic control.  France's  strategy  for  building  a  national  SAF production  chain  will  thus  be  a  key  condition  for  the successful  decarbonization  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group and  of  the  French  aviation  industry  as  a  whole  -  as detailed in the decarbonization road map for the French aviation industry: Proposition de feuille de route d\u00e9carbonation transportation a\u00e9rien.pdf (ecologie.gouv.fr).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbsolute emissions [mT CO2]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  reduction  accounts for a significant portion of the overall decrease, with fleet renewal on the SNBC perimeter and the incorporation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (1.1% in 2023) playing a relatively minor role thus far. However, it is important to highlight that  in  the  future,  the  role  of  incorporating  SAF  and renewing the fleet will become predominant in reducing carbon emissions, while the contribution of activity levels will decrease.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBelow  is  the  translation  of  this  trajectory  based  on  the basis  of  a 2015  reference  year, consistent  with  the reference year for the airline industry in the WAM scenario -confirming  the  compatibility  and  performance  of Air  France-KLM objectives, which to beyond the sectoral targets:\n\n## AIR FRANCE-KLM GROUP EMISSIONS TRAJECTORY RELATIVE TO THE AMS SCENARIO\n\n(BASE 100 RELATIVE TO THE 2015 REFERENCE YEAR)\n\n| Emissions in absolute value  (mT CO2)   |   2015 |   2025 |   2030 |   2050 |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| SNBC (AMS scenario)                     |    4.6 |    4.7 |    4.6 |    1.9 |\n| Air France-KLM Group targets            |    2.3 |    2   |    1.8 |    0.8 |\n\nThe forecast rates of activity that underlie the Air FranceKLM group's emission reduction trajectory are in line with the forecasts for the French air transportation sector road map for which the link appears above, on the aggregate national  air  transportation  scope:  namely  a  modest average annual growth rate of 0.8% for the 2019-50 period.\n\nThe  assumptions  for  energy  prices  are  detailed  in  the second part of this document, in the section dedicated to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).\n\n## The Air France-KLM group's commitments concerning international traffic\n\nWhile domestic air transportation is included in national accounting  for  CO2  emissions,  and  is  governed  by  the SNBC targets, international air transportation is subject to the  ICAO  (International  Civil  Aviation  Organization)  legal framework, with which Air France-KLM complies.\n\nThe  ICAO  has  also  put  in  place  the  CORSIA  program, adopted  by  most  countries,  including  France.  This program  consists  of  offsetting,  through  certified  CO2 reduction  projects,  any  excess  -  compared  with  the benchmark of 85% of 2019 emissions - of greenhouse gas emissions  produced  by  commercial  flights.  All  of  the Air France-KLM  Group  airlines participate in this international program.\n\nThe  SBTi  (Science  Based  Target  initiative)  specifies  and validates  the  compatibility  of  a  company's  CO2  emission targets  with  the  climate  objectives  in  the  most  rigorous way possible. In this case, with the validation of this target, the  Air  France-KLM  group  is  committing  itself  to  a decarbonization  trajectory  in  line  with  a  'Well-below 2  degrees  C'  climate  target  according  to  the  Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nhttps://www.airfranceklm.com/fr/newsroom/les-objectifsde-reduction-des-emissions-de-co2-dair-france-klm-\n\npour-2030-ont-ete\n\n## Comparison of Air France-KLM's CO 2 intensity with that of the sector\n\nThere  is  currently  no  benchmark  against  which  airlines can  compare  themselves.  However,  the  independent Science Based Targets initiative has provided airlines with a tool enabling them precisely to assess the CO2 intensity of their operations and compare them with the sector as a whole, taking into account the types of market in which they operate (short-haul/long-haul and cargo).",

Note  that, within the framework of the SBTi benchmark, these CO2 intensities  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  Scope  1+3  fuel emissions, known as Well-to-Wake.\n\n| Chapter SNBC V2   | Topic                                                                                                       | 2023 URD reference                                          |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IV                | Greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy                                                                  | Chap 4.3.1 p. 277                                           |\n| IV                | Fleet modernization                                                                                         | Chap 4.3.1 p. 278                                           |\n| IV                | Reducing the weight on board                                                                                | Chap 4.3.1 p. 280                                           |\n| IV                | Optimizing aircraft performance                                                                             | Chap 4.3.1 p. 280                                           |\n| IV                | Optimizing routes and flight paths                                                                          | Chap 4.3.1 p. 280                                           |\n| IV                | Intermodality                                                                                               | Chap 4.3.1 p. 282                                           |\n| IV                | Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)*                                                                           | Chap 4.3.1 p. 281                                           |\n| IV                | Risk analysis*                                                                                              | Chap 3.1.2.2 Climate-related risks p. 204                   |\n| IV                | Impacts                                                                                                     | Chap 3.1.2.2 Climate-related risks p. 205                   |\n| IV                | Carbon credit risk                                                                                          | Chap 3.1.2.6 Carbon credit risk p. 207                      |\n| IV                | Link between the investment strategy  and the decarbonization trajectory                                    | Chap 5.3 Note 2.2 - Sustainable investments  and financings |\n| IV                | Modalities for the appropriation of the emission  reduction commitments in the governance  and by employees | Chap 4.1.3 p. 239                                           |\n|                   | to take into account the greenhouse gas emission  reduction targets                                         | Chap 4.1.3 p. 238                                           |\n| IV                | Contribution of Air France-KLM customers  to its decarbonization trajectory                                 | Chap 4.3.1 p. 277                                           |\n| IV                | Sustainable Procurement*                                                                                    | Chap 4.6.2 p. 323                                           |\n\n- * The URD2023 has undergone updates, surpassing the previous SNBC.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(KLC),  Martinair  and  the  HV  code  operated  by Transavia Netherlands.\n\nFor the ground operations, the environmental consolidation scope covers:\n\n- \u25a0 Air  France  consolidated  subsidiaries:  HOP!,  CRMA, Sodexi, BlueLink and Transavia France;\n- \u25a0 KLM consolidated  subsidiaries:  KLC  (KLM  Cityhopper), KES  (KLM  Equipment  Services),  KCS  (KLM  Catering Services), KHS  (KLM  Health Services), Transavia Netherlands, Martinair and EPCOR (for a portion of the indicators).\n\nFor  the  ground  activities,  the  consolidation  scope  of  the environmental  reporting  covers  nearly  100%  of  the  sites because some very small subsidiaries are excluded from reporting water and electricity consumption and represent  less than  2%  of  this  consumption.  The international stations are not considered (partially for the French Overseas Departments and Territories).\n\nFor  Air  France,  the  indicators  in  the  French  stations  are not  reported  when  there  is  no  detail  available  on  the charges  invoiced  by  airports.  The  contribution  from  the relevant stations is, however, marginal compared with the reported data.\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nThe environmental indicators are assembled at local level via different reporting tools: ONEmission  (Enablon software), Tennaxia for waste, SAP Finance (invoicing) for Air France and CaeSaR for KLM.\n\nThe  reliability  of  the  reporting  process  is  supported  by definitions  of  each  indicator  and  tool  user  guides  made available to the contributors. Consistency tests have also been implemented.\n\nThe consolidation of the Air France-KLM  group's environmental data is carried out by the Air France-KLM Sustainability department.\n\n## Details and methodology - Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\nAt  the  Air  France-KLM  group  level,  the  regulatory requirements  and  the  reporting  and  consolidation principles  are  outlined  in  a  joint  document  which  is updated annually. Within the framework of an improvement-based  approach,  methodological  details are provided on some indicators, and particularly on their definitions.  When  these  changes  have  a  significant impact  on  the  data,  comparison  with  the  figures  for previous years is not meaningful.\n\nWhen the data is not available, the figure reported for the year (N) is estimated based on the value reported for the previous year (N-1).\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's environmental data is based  on  a  rolling twelve-month  period  from October  1  until  September  30  for  ground  data  and January 1 to December 31 for flight data.\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators\n\n## Comments on changes in the indicators\n\nGlobal  capacity  in  available  seat  kilometers  recovered  to 95% of its  2019  level  in  2023,  reaching  99%  in  December 2023.  The  Russian  invasion  of  Ukraine  had  a  limited impact on worldwide capacity but resulted in the closure of  the  Ukrainian,  Russian,  and  Belarusian  air  spaces  to European airlines.\n\nWhile the Group increased its capacity by around 11% in 2023 compared to 2022 in terms of PAX kilometer, its level of  activity,  while  close,  did  not  return  to  its  2019  level (11%  difference).  The  overall  energy  efficiency  of  the Air  France-KLM  group  slightly  improved  in  2023  vs  2019 (-2%),  due  to  two  levers  of  decarbonization,  i.e.  Fleet Renewal  (+16  pts  2023  vs  2019)  and  the  incorporation  of SAF: 1.1% in 2023 (0% SAF in 2019).",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nAddressing the impact on the environment\n\nThe PAX + EQT Weight is calculated by assigning a weight of 100kg to each passenger, to which an additional 80kg is added for long-haul flights, 50kg for medium-haul flights, and 25kg for short-haul flights. The number of passengers used for  the  calculation  corresponds  to  the  RPK  divided by  the  segment  distance  (orthodromic  aircraft  distance divided  by  the  number  of  segments).  Note  that  this calculation  method  may  change  in  light  of  a  new methodology  published  in  late  November  2022  by  IATA (RP  1726)  which  consists  of  no  longer  adding  additional weight  based  on  the  type  of  flight  (long,  short,  and medium-haul)  and  instead using only 100kg per passenger.\n\nThe Weight of Freight + EQT is calculated by dividing the Freight RTK by the segment distance and increasing it by 5% for the long-haul, Cargo and A320 flights. The resulting figures are then divided by the RPK flight and the Freight RTK flight (RPK and Freight RKT increased by 5%, 12%, and 20% respectively for long, medium and short-haul flights, or increased by a weighted average of these factors when the  flight  has  multiple  configurations,  in  order  to  reflect the  actual  distance  covered  by  the  aircraft  and  not  just the orthodromic distance). The data is in tons but is then converted  to  liters  using  the  density  (1  liter  =  0.793kg). Note  that  the  5%  increase  for  long-haul  flights  may change  in  light  of  the  ban  on  flying  over  Russia  since Q1 2022, which extends flight times and distances.\n\nFor reference: tonne-kilom\u00e8tre transport\u00e9e (TKT) in French is translated into revenue ton-kilometer (RTK) in English.\n\n## Carbon efficiency - CO 2 eq emissions per passenger kilometer\n\nOperational  CO2eq  efficiency  is  expressed  as  grams of  CO2eq  per  passenger  kilometer.  It  is  calculated  using the  actual  jet  fuel  consumed  and  the  number  of passengers flown over the actual flight distance planned. For  international  flights,  the  fuel  burned  is  divided between  passengers  and  cargo  based  on  mass.  The distance used is the flight  distance  planned  which  is  on average around 7% longer than the great circle distance due  to  various  restrictions  (no-fly  zones,  local  air  traffic control, weather conditions, etc.). The standard mass for a passenger  plus  luggage  amounts  to  100  kg  (ICAOstandard).\n\nNote  that  the  CO2  saving  from  SAF  incorporation  is  not included  in  the  fuel  efficiency  calculation  for  pax transportation this year. It will be included next year.\n\nSince  2022  the  fuel  efficiency  with  the  market-based measures that compare the efficiency of the current year with  the  value  in  2005  has  no  longer  been  tracked  and has  been  replaced  by  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions Intensity (GHG) indicator (see note 1).\n\n## Carbon efficiency - CO 2 eq emissions for freight transportation\n\nFuel efficiency is expressed both in liters of kerosene per 100 kg of freight - 100 kilometers and in grams of CO2 per 100 kg of freight. The calculation is based on a split of fuel between  passengers  and  freight.  The  fuel  consumption for  freight  is  divided  by  0.1TK  and  corrected  by  the  ratio between  the  planned  flight  distance  and  the  shortest\n\ndistance.  Freight  CO2eq  emissions  are  calculated  based on the fuel consumption from which the CO2eq emissions linked  to  the  use  of  sustainable  alternative  fuels  are deducted.\n\nNote  that  the  CO2  saving  from  SAF  incorporation  is  not included  in  the  fuel  efficiency  calculation  for  freight transportation this year. It will be included next year.\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity (Note 1)\n\nIn 2022, the Air France-KLM group committed to the SBTi program  and  has  set  itself  the  target  of  reducing  its Greenhouse  Gas  (GHG)  emissions  intensity  by  30%  by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline (in gCO2eq/RTK). This target was validated in November 2022 for the Air FranceKLM group, as well as for Air France and KLM.\n\nThe  GHG  emissions  intensity  including  SAF  emissions reductions  is  expressed  in  Tons  of  CO2  equivalent  per Revenue  Ton -Kilometer  (gCO2eq/RTK).  This  indicator covers  in  absolute  terms  the  CO2eq  Scope  1  (emissions from the Group's direct activities) and Scope 3 category 3 (upstream  emissions  from  the  fuel  production  of  the Group's  activities)  emissions,  divided  by  the  sum  of  RTK (Revenue Ton -Kilometer) and RPK (Revenue Passenger -Kilometer), representing all the industry segments in which the Air France-KLM group operates.\n\nThe  scope  of  activities  taken  into  account  for  its evaluation is the same as that used for the URD. Carbon offsetting and avoided emissions are not included in the calculation  of  the  indicator  to  comply  with  the  SBTi methodology and framework.\n\nThe baseline for the indicator in 2019 is 948 gCO2eq/RTK.\n\n## CO 2 eq emissions from the ground operations (Note 2)\n\nThe CO2eq emissions from the ground operations include all Scope 1 and 2 emissions at the sites in France and the Netherlands. SAF has not been included this year but will be next year.\n\n## Non-recycled non-hazardous industrial waste\n\nNon-recycled  non-hazardous  industrial  waste  is  defined as  waste  disposed  of  (Eural  Code  D).  Waste  incinerated with energy recovery (Eural Code R1) and R12 or R13 waste, for which it is not possible to know whether this waste has been  recycled  or  incinerated  with  energy  recovery,  is categorized  as  Non-Recycled  Waste  as  a  conservative position.\n\n## Comments on changes in the environmental indicators\n\n## Share of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)\n\nThe share of SAF is the total amount of consumption of Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel  (SAF)  in  ktons  divided  by  the total  Aviation  Fuel  consumption  (Conventional  Aviation Fuel + Sustainable Aviation Fuel) in ktons. Consumption of SAF is the quantity of SAF purchased during the reporting period.  Consumption  of  conventional  aviation  fuel  is  the actual fuel consumption for each flight.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since 2017, Scope 3 emissions from flight operations (upstream emissions from jet fuel) have been reported. According to ADEME,  the  CO2eq  emissions  correspond  to  98%  of  all greenhouse gases.\n\n## Scope 1 - Aviation fuel\n\nScope  1  emissions  generated  by  the  combustion  of aviation  fuel  are  reported  for  all  the  kerosene  used  in Air  France-KLM's  flight  operations.  The  emission  factor used of 3.16 kg CO2eq per kg kerosene is in line with the emission  factor  from  the  ICAO  (CORSIA  -  Carbon Offsetting and  Reduction  Scheme  for  International Aviation). Since the combustion of kerosene does not emit CH4  or  N2O,  we  consider  in  this  situation  that  the  CO2 emitted is similar to the equivalent CO2.\n\nNote that there are differences between the scope of the CO2eq emissions published in the Extra-Financial Performance Statement and the scope of the EU ETS for the greenhouse gas emission allowance, so the comparison is not meaningful.\n\n## Scope 1 - Ground operations\n\nThe  direct  emissions  from  the  ground  operations  are based  on  the  consumption  of  energy  coming  from different sources  and  their  corresponding  emission factors. The factors are based on national standards or are delivered by the energy suppliers.\n\nIn 2023, the Air France-KLM group updated all its emission factors to express its direct emissions in CO2eq.\n\nCO2eq  (or  carbon  dioxide  equivalent)  is  the  unit  of measurement  used  to  compare  the  global  warming impacts of different greenhouse gases. CO2eq is calculated  by  measuring  all  the  greenhouse  gases (nitrogen,  methane,  carbon  dioxide  etc.)  emitted  at  all stages of the ground activities. To simplify the analysis of their  footprint,  we  convert  these  greenhouse  gases  into CO2 equivalent.\n\n## Scope 2 - Electricity, steam, other heating and cooling (Note 2)\n\nThe emissions from electricity, steam, other heating and cooling  are  based  on  the  consumption  volume  and  the corresponding emission factors.\n\nIn  2022,  in  order  to  further  comply  with  GHG  protocol standards, Air France-KLM adapted its reporting methodology.  The  calculation  of  Scope  2  emissions  is carried  out  according  to  the  two  methods  described  by the GHG protocol: one based on the market and the other based on geographical location:\n\n- \u25a0 location-based method:  this method  takes  into account the average emissions related to the production  of  electricity  in  the  area  where  it  is consumed. The emission factors  used  are  taken  from the ADEME  database  for  Air  France  and  the Co2emissiefactoren database for KLM;\n\n- \u25a0 market-based method: this method takes into account the contractual agreements under which the organization  sources  electricity  from  specific  sources, such  as  renewable  energy.  It  is  becoming  mandatory to provide Certificates of Origin guaranteeing that the electricity has been produced from a renewable energy source  and  fed  into  the  electricity  grid.  The  CO2 emissions  reduction  resulting  from  the  purchase  of these certificates for renewable electricity are subtracted from the total. The renewable energy rates are  communicated  by  the  suppliers.  Note  that  the electricity supply is 100% renewable for KLM.\n\n## Scope 3 - Upstream and downstream Transportation & Distribution (Categories 4 and 9)\n\nThese  categories  include  emissions  that  occur  in  the reporting year from the:\n\n- \u25a0 transportation and distribution of products purchased by the reporting company (excluding fuel and energy), between  a  company's  direct  suppliers  and  its  own operations  in  vehicles  and  facilities  not  owned  or controlled by the reporting company. (category 4);\n- \u25a0 transportation and distribution of products sold by the reporting company between the reporting company's operations and the end consumer (if not paid for by the reporting company) in vehicles and facilities not owned or controlled by the reporting company. (category 9).\n\n## Scope 3 - Upstream emissions from Conventional Aviation fuel production (Category 3)\n\nThese  emissions  are  generated  during  the  production, transportation  and  distribution  of  Conventional  Aviation Fuel.\n\nSince  2022,  the  Air  France-KLM  group  has  used  the greenhouse gas emission factor used to calculate Scope 3 emissions to align with the SBTi methodology. It is 0.80422 (former factor  used  in  2021  =  0.6448)  kg  CO2eq  per  kg  of fuel,  determined from the emission factor defined by the ICAO (89 gCO2e/MJ) for the entire life cycle of kerosene and the heating value of kerosene (44.5 MJ/kg).\n\n## Scope 1 & 3 - CO2eq emission reduction from the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Note 3)\n\nThe  CO2eq  reductions  from  the  use  of  Sustainable Aviation  Fuel  (SAF)  are  calculated  based  on  the  specific percentage CO2eq reduction for the particular SAF batch and  the  total  volume  purchased.  The  SAF  CO2  saving  is based on the information provided by the suppliers from PTDs (Post Transfer Document).\n\n## Emissions regulation - ETS (Emissions Trading System) (Note 4)\n\nThe volume of the reported mandatory carbon credits is based  on  the  annual  reporting  of  the  ETS  and  CORSIA. Free  allowances  and  trading  costs  are  excluded.  As  of 2023,  the  UK-ETS  has  been  included  in  the  total  ETS figures.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\n## Addressing the impact on the environment\n\n## Carbon credits (Note 5)\n\n- \u25a0 Mandatory: Pursuant  to  Article  147  of  the  French Climate  and  Resilience  Law,  the  Air  France  group  is required to offset 70% of its 2023 domestic emissions. This mandatory compensation scheme for the Air  France  group  applies  to  the  domestic  emissions emitted since January 1, 2022. The scope of mandatory compensations  is  gradually  increasing  starting  from 50% of domestic emissions in 2022, to 70% in 2023 and 100% in 2024.\n- \u25a0 Voluntary: The  volume  of  voluntary  carbon  credits  is calculated  over  the  calendar  year.  Voluntary  carbon offsetting of CO2 paid for by customers is not included. The  carbon  credits  are  purchased  by  KLM.  These carbon credits are Gold Standard or VERRA certified.\n- \u25a0 Customer: The  volume  of  voluntary  carbon  credits  is calculated  based  on  the  calendar  year.  This  concerns the voluntary CO2 compensation paid by customers via KLM programs.\n\n## Flight operations\n\n## Consumption of conventional aviation fuel\n\nThis is the actual conventional aviation fuel consumption for  each  flight.  It  includes  the  fuel  consumption  for  the use of APUs (Auxiliary Power Units).\n\n## Consumption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nThis  is  the  quantity  of  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel  (SAF) purchased during the reporting period.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions - NO x low altitude\n\nThe methodology used to calculate low-altitude emissions (i.e. below 3,000 feet) is common to Air France and KLM. It is based on the LTO (Landing-Take Off) cycle and  on  engine  data  communicated  by  the  ICAO (International  Civil  Aviation  Organization).  The  taxiing time considered is the actual taxiing time, which is more precise  than  the  standard  values  recommended  by  the ICAO  methodology.  Note  that,  since  the  actual  taxiing time  is  not  available  for  Transavia  France,  the  standard ICAO values have been used for this subsidiary.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions - SO 2 low altitude\n\nNote:  the  'low  altitude'  and  'LTO'  for  Landing-Take  Off cycle  denominations  are  equivalent.  The  calculation  of the SO2 emissions from flight operations is based on the average  sulfur  content  (level  provided  by  the  SMCA company for Air France and AFS for KLM), in charge of Jet Fuel  logistics  at  CDG  and  AMS)  of  the  fuel  loaded, respectively,  on  the  Amsterdam  and  Paris  platforms which is applied, respectively, to all fuel used during the year by KLM and its subsidiaries, and by Air France and its subsidiaries.  KLM  used  the  N-1  emission  factor  for calculating the non-carbon emissions related to SO2 LTO.\n\n## Acoustic impact\n\nThe  acoustic  impact  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group  is measured  according  to  the  eligibility  of  its  fleet  in operation for ICAO noise chapters. The indicator evaluates the  percentage  of  aircraft  according  to  their  margin eligible under chapters 4 or 14 (the 2 most efficient noise levels  for  jet  aircraft  to  date).  Until  and  including  2022, administrative  aircraft  noise  certification  was  used  to calculate this. Starting in 2023, eligibility for certification is used  for  the  calculation,  as  this  is  deemed  to  be  even closer to the real noise impact. The flights concerned are under  the  commercial  codes  AF,  KL,  TO,  HV  and  MP, operated, franchised and chartered, with the exception of code shares .\n\n## New-generation aircraft\n\nThe  indicator  refers  to  the  share  of  new-generation aircraft in the Air France-KLM group. According to the EU taxonomy, the following aircraft are considered to be the new-generation  of  aircraft:  A320neo  (319  and  321),  A350 (900 and 1000), A350F, A220 (100 and 300) A330 (800 and 900), 737 MAX, 787, 777X, E195-E2 (and E190-E2).\n\n## Ground operations\n\n## Consumption - Electricity (of which renewable)\n\nThis  is  the  total  volume  of  electricity  used  in  MWh.  For KLM the volume of renewable electricity is based on the purchase  of  EU  Certificates  of  Origin  coming  from  wind energy.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Fuel\n\nThe total  volume of  fuel  used  for  the  ground  operations includes:\n\n- \u25a0 aviation fuel for testing engines;\n- \u25a0 non-road  diesel  fuel  for  a  portion  of  the  Air  France runway equipment;\n- \u25a0 gasoline,  diesel  and  GTL  for  the  Ground  Support Equipment (GSE);\n- \u25a0 HVO 100: Hydro treated Vegetable Oil, a biofuel diesel for Ground Support Equipment certified.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Natural gas\n\nThe total quantity of natural gas is mainly used for heating buildings,  maintenance  hangars  and  cargo  warehouses. The conversion factor for the quantity of gas used is based on  the  characteristics  of  the  gas  specific  to  France  and The Netherlands.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Steam/other heating/cooling (of which renewable)\n\nThis  includes  superheated  and  iced  water  for  climate comfort.  For  Air  France,  superheated  and  iced  water  is supplied  by  ADP  (A\u00e9roports  de  Paris)  at  the  Orly  and Roissy sites. The KLM facilities do not consume this type of energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  water  used  on  board  the  aircraft  is  not included.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions - NO x\n\nThe  NOx  emissions  related  to  engine  testing  are calculated  based  on  a  methodology  similar  to  the  one used for  the  Flight  Operations,  which  reflects  the  actual testing  conditions.  Other  sources  of  NOx  include  the combustion of the fuel used by ground support vehicles and runway equipment. For Air France, the calculation is based  on  the  European  standards  EURO  1  to  6  for  light and  heavy  vehicles,  and  Stage  I  to  IV  for  diesel  engines (European Directive 97/68/EC for non-road mobile machinery), setting the emission limits based on engine power. For KLM, the NOx emissions from gas installations and  vehicles  are  determined  by  direct  measurements, from manufacturer data or external databases.\n\n## Waste - Non-hazardous industrial waste and percentage recycled\n\nNon-hazardous  waste  is  monitored  and  reported  by specialized  waste  management  providers.  KLM's  scope includes  KLM  Catering  Services  (a  KLM  subsidiary)  and therefore Catering  waste,  unlike  Air  France  which subtracts  this  activity.  The  percentage  of  non-hazardous\n\nwaste  recycled  covers  all  waste  sorted  separately  for recycling.  The  percentage  of  recycling  does  not  cover waste incinerated with energy recovery (EURAL code R1).\n\nNon-hazardous recycled waste is the quantity of recycled non-hazardous industrial waste including processing and reuse  (recycling)  and  chemical/physical  processing.  It does not include incineration with energy recovery.\n\nTransavia  France  waste  (services  included  in  the  rent)  is not included in the waste data. However, this represents an insignificant volume (less than 1% of the total tonnage).\n\n## Waste - Hazardous industrial waste and percentage recovered\n\nHazardous industrial waste is monitored and reported by specialized  waste  management  service  providers.  When the quantity of hazardous waste has not been communicated by the service providers at the end of the reporting  period,  the  quantity  mentioned  on  the  slip leaving  the  site  is  taken  into  account.  However,  this quantity  is  estimated  to  be  marginal.  The  recovery  of hazardous  waste  complies  with  European  regulations. The  percentage  of  recovery  is  the  ratio  of  hazardous industrial  waste  incinerated  with  energy  recovery  and recycled  (codes  R1  to  R13)  to  total  hazardous  industrial waste.",

Customer  satisfaction  is  notably  measured  through  the Net Promoter Score (NPS), the reference indicator driving customer recommendations. Performance indicators and tools have been developed to track the results daily.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is above all based on their trust in the  Group's  airline  activities.  As  a  responsible  airline\n\nGroup, Air France-KLM must ensure the safety and health of its customers, employees and partners. This commitment  covers  flight  safety,  health  security,  the safety  of  the  food  services  offered  on  board  and  in  the lounges,  the  protection  of  personal  data  and  also occupational  health  and  safety  (see  also  section  4.2.3 above). The Group is also committed to facilitating access to  its  products  and  services,  particularly  for  passengers with disabilities or those with reduced mobility.\n\n| Key Performance  Indicator   | Definition                             | Companies             | 23/22 variation   | 2023 target   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Net Promoter                 | Change in the NPS (expressed as an     | Air France            | -4 pts            | Not reached   |\n| Scores (NPS)                 | annual average) of Air France, KLM,    | KLM                   | +2 pts            | Not reached   |\n|                              | Transavia (France and the Netherlands) |                       |                   |               |\n|                              | Achievement of the 2023 target         | Transavia Netherlands | -3 pts            | Not reached   |\n\nPerimeter: Scope: Air France, KLM, Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands.\n\nThe  Net  Promoter  Score  (or  NPS)  is  a  recommendation indicator given by customers to the products and services of  Air  France,  KLM  and  Transavia  (France  and  The Netherlands)  in  their  capacity  as  airlines,  ranging  from 0  to  10  (0  corresponding  to  'I  will  definitely  not recommend' and 10 to 'I will definitively recommend'. It corresponds to the difference between the percentage of promoter customers (scores 9 and 10) and the percentage of  customers  critical  of  the  brand  (scores  0  to  6).  This concerns  the  response  to  the  first  question  asked  in Air  France-KLM's  e-Score  online  customer  satisfaction questionnaire:  'Based  on  your  opinion  and  experience, how  likely  are  you  to  recommend  Air  France/KLM/ Transavia to your friends/colleagues?'. For each brand, the indicator  measured  is  the  annual  change  in  the  NPS (calculated  as  an  annual  average).  Note  that,  since  they are reported via two different measurement tools, the Net Promoter  Scores  for  Transavia  France  and  Transavia Netherlands cannot be consolidated.\n\nFor  each  brand,  whether  or  not  the  annual  target  has been achieved is also indicated.\n\nThe Air France NPS target was not achieved in 2023 due to  various  operational  difficulties  generating  delays  and irregularities  which  were  the  main  causes  of  customer dissatisfaction  impacting  the  NPS  (ATC  strikes  and congestion, increased unavailability of aircraft due to the global  shortage  of  spare  parts  and  delayed  deliveries  of new  aircraft,  handling  of  connecting  passengers  and baggage). In addition to the actions described in section 1.5, to manage these difficulties Air France implemented a number of initiatives: a common task force with A\u00e9roport de  Paris  to  solve  baggage  sorting  problems,  additional baggage sorter  capacity  in  peak  periods,  anticipation  of maintenance part orders, increased wet leasing particularly for medium-haul flights, an increased number of spare aircraft. In parallel, the airline maintained an even greater focus on handling the disruption for its customers, and on communication and information.\n\nThe  KLM  NPS  target  was  not  achieved  this  year  due  to various operational difficulties (e.g. staff shortages, baggage  handling  and  fleet  maintenance).  To  manage these  difficulties,  the  focus  was  on  seamless  airport processes.  To  deal  with  service  disruption,  KLM  will increase  its focus  on  assisting  customers  and  on communications and information. Besides process improvements,  KLM  continues  to  invest  in  on-board comfort (new World Business class seats, new Premium Comfort cabin, Economy class seats and WiFi) to improve the customer experience.\n\nFor 2024, Air France has decided, in addition to the overall Air France 2024 NPS target, to conduct an NPS per haul cabins  and,  in  each  case,  to  look  at  the  NPS  without Perceived  Service  Failure  (to  measure  the  pure  level  of satisfaction regarding our product and services), the NPS with Perceived Service Failure (to measure how situations are handled by operations and crew) and the percentage of service failure.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  received  awards  and recognition for its commitment to providing high-quality, sustainable  and  customer-oriented  services,  which  has earned the trust of its customers.\n\nIn 2023, Air France  was  certified  for  the  second consecutive  year  as  a  5-star  airline  in  the  official  2024 APEX airline ratings.\n\nAir France once again stood out for the quality of the inflight  travel  experience,  recognizing  its  cabin  comfort, catering,  in-flight  entertainment,  connectivity  services and excellent cabin service.\n\nThis ranking is based on the independent rating of more than  one  million  flights  by  passengers  from  nearly  600 airlines  worldwide,  with  scores  ranging  from  1  to  5  stars according  to  even  more  demanding  criteria  than  in previous years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is key to retaining  the  trust  of  both  customers  and  staff,  and imperative for the long-term viability of its operations and of air transportation.\n\nWithin the context of a complex  and  changing environment,  the  Group  strives  to  maintain  the  highest level  of  Flight  Safety  thanks  to  its  Safety  Management System  and  by  supporting  its  Flight  Safety  players through specific measures.\n\nAll the Group's activities are subject to numerous checks and certifications; in particular, via the supervisory actions carried  out  by  the  Civil  Aviation  Authorities  in  each country and via the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose Operational Safety Audit (IATA Operational Safety Audit - IOSA) is a benchmark within the industry.\n\nAir France's and KLM's IOSA certifications are continuously  renewed  following  on-site  audits  and Air  France  carried  out  its  most  recent  renewal  audit  in November 2022; with the next one planned end 2024. In 2022, IATA launched a new, risk-based approach to further improve its IOSA program. As a first mover, KLM took part in  this  audit  approach  in  November  2022.  Based  on  the outcome,  the  KLM  IOSA  registration  was  renewed  until March 2025.\n\nSee also section 3.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\nTo achieve the highest possible standard of Flight Safety, each airline updates and reinforces its Safety Management System (SMS), which concretely defines the modalities in place to manage aviation risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management of Flight Safety risks\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  use  the  evaluation  method  for operational risks recommended by the European Aviation Safety Agency. They have deployed this method in all the operational entities  and  at  all  levels  of  the  business.  The management  of  Flight  Safety  risks,  notably  through systems  compiling  flight  parameters  and  situation\n\nreports,  enables  threats  to  be  identified,  risks  to  be evaluated, the implementation of remedial measures and the monitoring of the results obtained.\n\nFurther, it enables proactive management of the risks to maintain them below the level that is deemed acceptable to  the  responsible  management.  The  management  of flight  safety  risks  is  monitored  by  the  Corporate  Safety Department.  An  internal  quality  assurance  procedure continuously  evaluates  the  proper  functioning  of  Flight Safety Risk Management. To this end, both Air France and KLM have decided to invest in new software tools for the management of safety data. These software tools concern the  Flight  Data  Analysis  of  each  flight  with  a  system providing capabilities  such  as  the  possibility  for  pilots  to review their own flights. It also includes the management of all the Safety reports (dealing with flight safety, health at work, food safety, security, environmental risk, etc.).\n\nAir  France  is  developing  synergies  between  an  array  of progress-oriented  and  risk  management  approaches  Flight Safety, Health & Safety in the Workplace, Customer Service Quality, Operational Performance, Environmental & Sustainable Development, Food Safety & Hygiene. This quality-based approach is the vector for the steering and management  of  the  businesses,  aimed  at  a  continuous improvement in results.\n\nKLM deploys a similar approach. The company is building on  the  best  safety  and  security  practices  through  its Safety Management System (SMS), a working environment  of  continuous  learning  and  improvement, and  independent  oversight  of  the  four  safety  domains: operational, occupational, environmental  safety  and operational  security.  KLM  thus  continuously  aims  to improve its industry-leading, risk and performance-based Safety Management System in which risk-based decisions can be taken by the responsible management at all levels within  KLM.  The  SMS  is  outlined  in  KLM's  Safety Management  System  manual  (SMM)  and  has  been approved by the Dutch Civil Aviation Authorities as part of the Air Operator Certificate.\n\nAir  France  and  KLM's  Safety  Culture  programs,  which include promotion, communication, training and learning interventions, are embedded  in  the  companies  to enhance safety awareness and the relevant safe attitude and behavior at all levels.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nCustomer trust\n\nThe  international  cooperation  framework,  via  notably participation in the work of the International Air Transport Association  (IATA)  and  the  Flight  Safety  Foundation, allows  information  exchange  about  Flight  Safety  and  to learn about the best industry standards. This cooperation enables  synergies  to  be  generated  within  the  SkyTeam alliance  and  the  sharing  of  information  between  the partner airlines.\n\n## Governance\n\nFlight Safety Committees, chaired by the Executive VicePresidents responsible for the operational entities (Safety Action  Groups),  meet  every  quarter  within  Air  France. Their  task  is  to  approve  the  action  plans  established  to apply  the  orientations  set  by  the  companies,  the outcomes of inquiries and the results of supervisory acts.\n\nThese committees are also tasked with sharing information on the emergence of new Flight Safety issues originating  from  feedback  or  risk  analysis,  by  ensuring that the resources and action plans in place are adapted to the issues.\n\nFlight Safety Committee meetings are held twice a year at the level of each company, to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing action plans.\n\nOther  committees  are  held  at  higher  frequencies.  Every two weeks a safety review committee headed by the EVP Safety  analyses  and  reviews  the  main  safety  events  to launch shortand medium-term actions. Other committees  covering  Flight  Data  Analysis  and  Systemic analysis are held as well as a monthly meeting between the  businesses  Safety  Managers  and  the  EVP  of  Safety who manages the Safety Management System.\n\nAt KLM, the Corporate Safety Committee within the KLM Board  of  Directors  meets  every  quarter  to  analyze  the Safety  Indicators.  In  2023,  KLM  maintained  its  focus  on Occupational  Safety  hazards  by  further  updating  the overall  Occupational  Safety  Policies  to  provide  structure for  the  required  mitigating  action.  Safety  Action  Groups (SAGs), chaired by the Nominated Persons and/or Heads of Divisions are in place across the company with, at the highest  level,  the  weekly  Corporate  Safety  Action  Group chaired by the COO and Accountable Manager. The SAGs decide  on  the  safety  action  plans  during  meetings  held either weekly or fortnightly.\n\nTo improve safety around Schiphol Airport, joint safety risk assessments are carried out and the resulting mitigating actions  are  taken.  This  is  done  in  cooperation  with  the aviation industry stakeholders at Schiphol Airport, like the airport  authorities  and  Dutch  Air  Traffic  Control.  These activities  fall  under  the  umbrella  of  the  common  sector Integrated Safety Management  System,  a  unique collaboration between the aviation players at the airport which was established in 2018.\n\nFurthermore, since Flight Safety is an absolute priority for Air  France-KLM,  the  Board  of  Directors  conducts  an annual  review  of  the  Flight  Safety  indicators  (KPIs)  and results, and the measures in place to mitigate the impact of the risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developing a safety culture\n\nBuilding a company-wide culture of the prerequisite for a safety awareness across all the operations is a gradual yet ongoing  approach  aimed  at  raising  the  ambition  of  the airlines in the Air France-KLM group. Vocational training is a cornerstone of this culture and thus primarily considers the skills and expertise to be acquired in matters of safety: safety training for pilots and cabin crews, and training for the maintenance professions and ground operations.\n\nThe  quintessential  idea  that  concerns  all  employees  is  a comprehensive  safety  awareness  and  a  safe  working environment,  both  physical  and  mental/social.  Everyone working in the Air France-KLM group should feel safe and free  to  report  mistakes  and  incidents,  even  those  for which  they  themselves  are  responsible.  By  embracing  a 'Just  Culture'  we  learn,  develop  and  improve  on  a permanent basis.\n\nAir France and KLM are further embedding safety in the attitude  of  every  employee  and  the  execution  of  every function by making safety awareness an integral part of every onboarding and cross-boarding program.\n\nAir  France  has  set  itself  the  objective  of  developing  its safety  culture  through  the  Safety  Attitude  program, launched  at  the  end  of  2018.  The  ambition  of  Safety Attitude  is  to  always  strengthen  the  company's  safety performance and promote industry best practices.\n\nThe Safety Attitude program began with a benchmarking study of five companies, completed by a diagnostic phase, conducted by an independent organization. 22,500  employees  from  all  the  Air  France  professions responded to a questionnaire and over 600 people were interviewed. This in-depth diagnosis enabled the identification  of  the  areas  of  work  that  will  enable  the federation  of  all  employees  around  a  common  Safety Culture  as  close  to  operations  as  possible,  based  on transparency  and  trust.  In  2020,  despite  the  crisis,  the Executive  Committee  reaffirmed  its  determination  to pursue  the  project  by  implementing  the  first  concrete actions, in particular the introduction of field visits for the entire  line  management.  The  action  plan  has  been developed with contributions from all the departments to maintain  a  culture  of  transparency,  simplification  and respect  for  procedures,  the  evaluation  of  non-technical skills and inter-business exchanges\n\nIn 2021, Safety Leadership training courses were deployed from  the  Executive  Committee  down  to  the  middle management  level,  addressing  important  subjects  such as the just culture and arbitration.\n\nIn  2022,  other  major  actions  were  launched,  such  as  the definition  of  rescue  procedures  and  'safety  moments' during  all  briefings  and  meetings.  To  this  end,  a  threeyear  program  of  concrete  actions  adapted  to  each business line has been structured: mobilization of the line management,  a  culture  of  transparency,  respect  of  the procedures,  evaluation  of  non-technical  competencies and exchange between the professions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A number of Safety training courses were also either  maintained  or  created  to  continue  the  safety culture improvement for the mid management.\n\nIn  the  fall  of  2023,  a  new  safety  and  security  training program was launched within KLM, which is mandatory training  for  the  onboarding  of  all  newly-hired  staff members.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nIn  late  October  2023,  based  on  the  IATA  and  ICAO definition,  Air  France  experienced  one  major  ground safety accident involving damage to an aircraft due to a collision with another aircraft passing behind.\n\nDuring the same period KLM experienced one non-fatal accident  and  five  serious  incidents.  All  of  these  were processed  through  the  Safety  Management  System  to facilitate  event-  and  risk-analysis,  and  an  investigation into  the  possibilities  for  improvement  and  the  learning potential.\n\nThe rate of reporting of Flight Safety events by staff was above  target,  contributing  to  the  proper  functioning  of the Safety Management System.\n\nThe Flight Safety network teams are mobilized to analyze the signals coming from the Safety Management System and to take the appropriate action.\n\nThe  reporting  of  safety  events  and  concerns  by  staff members is paramount for the proper functioning of any SMS.  Within  KLM  the  newly-introduced  reporting  app 'See it,  Say  it  (SiSi)',  has  enabled  an  increase  in  reported events thus providing an even clearer safety picture. Every report  is  assessed  for  its  contribution  to  the  KLM  risk profile.  After  assessment of the event, a follow-up action plan in terms of analysis or investigation may be decided.\n\n## Operational measures to address the impact of climate change\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFor  air  transportation,  the  impacts  of  climate  change could have consequences for the routes and destinations served.  In  particular,  the  more  frequent  occurrence  of extreme  climate  events  could  affect  the  safety  of  flight operations  and  service  continuity  (re-routing,  flight cancellations  and  delays,  etc.)  causing  disruption  for customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nSince they are present across all continents, the Group's airlines  already  operate  safely  in  all  weather  conditions. They  have  thus  already  deployed  the  procedures  and resources  to  ensure  operations  in  extreme  climate conditions. Air France, KLM and Transavia have developed special training programs for employees on the management of emergency situations.\n\nAir France-KLM has developed policies and procedures applicable in the event of any emergency in the form of regional, site or unit level emergency response teams. These  procedures  cover  all  the  activities  and  sites  of the Group worldwide Identified managers are responsible for preparedness, response and investigation in case of emergency events.\n\nThe  airlines  also  work  in  cooperation  with  airports  to ensure safe operational and passenger handling conditions and, in such circumstances, deploy commercial measures to enable passengers to defer their travel should they so wish, or change their destinations.\n\nLastly,  the  size  of  the  Air  France-KLM  network,  with services  balanced  between  the  different  continents  and the flexibility  linked  to  fleet  composition,  are  all  valuable assets  when  it  comes  to  minimizing  the  economic  and commercial consequences of these impacts and adapting flight schedules to market requirements.\n\n## Food safety\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe Air France-KLM group is committed to guaranteeing food  services  that  are  safe  for  its  customers  and  flight crews.\n\nAs the years go by the relevant regulations are becoming increasingly  exacting.  This  is  why  food  safety  is  a  key priority  for  the  Group.  Air  France  and  KLM  both  deploy quality-control procedures to fulfil these requirements. In Air France, since September 1, 2022, the Corporate MultiRisk  Management  department  has  been  responsible  for Food  Safety  so  as  to  take  advantage  of  synergies  with Flight Safety.\n\nThis new  organization, which includes several of Air France's risk areas, will make it possible to share best practices  to  improve  risk  management.  Air  France manages food risks using a management system that has been  tried  and  tested  for  several  years.  In  2022,  KLM launched  a  food  safety  awareness  campaign  within  the In-flight Services community.",

Risk  analysis using the HACCP method is carried out at every stage of the  operational  processes.  Control  measures  are  defined to  prevent  risks.  They  are  deployed  by  food  safety specialists  in  each  of  the  relevant  entities:  procurement, air  operations, ground services, maintenance, operations, international stations, logistics and flight products. These coordinators  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  these measures  are  implemented  and  applied  within  the different  business  lines,  and  for  reporting  back  on  their functioning together with the related action plans.\n\n## KLM\n\nFood safety is ensured among the various parties in the food  distribution  chain.  Catering  companies  have  their HACCP  programs  and  undergo  unannounced  audits  at least once a year by an external company, specializing in food safety in airline catering. The water quality on board is assured by international quality checks through sample collection  by  the  Schiphol  laboratory.  Within  In-flight Services,  crew  members  are  trained  using  e-learning modules  and  industry  best  practices.  In  the  operational field,  specific  procedures  are  in  place  to  immediately contain food incidents and ensure that the highest quality standard is delivered internationally.\n\nBoth  Air  France  and  KLM  have  implemented  quality control  procedures  and  monitoring  programs  to  ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nFood safety audits are carried out at caterers at least once a year. These on-site food safety audits are unannounced and are carried out by specially-trained auditors (outsourced  or  in-house  audits).  The  audits  verify  the application of good hygiene practices in compliance with QSAI (quality and safety alliance in-flight services) for food processing, based on HACCP (hazard analysis and critical control points) principles.\n\nIn addition, all food suppliers are listed according to very strict specifications. Microbiological controls, water analyses and temperature controls are carried out by an internal laboratory for KLM and by an external laboratory for Air France, both of which are ISO 17025 certified.\n\nThe  data  from  the  monitoring  processes  are  regularly monitored  through  indicators and decision-making committees to ensure the effectiveness of the provisions in place relating to Food Safety.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nIn  addition  to  compliance  with  the  HACCP  Principles  & Application Guidelines, Air France is the first airline in the world to have attained ISO 22000 certification. An annual audit  carried  out  by  an  external  body  verifies  that  the management  system  complies  with  the  standard  and with the regulatory requirements. In 2023, the ISO 22000 certificate was renewed.\n\nInternal audits are also realized based on a three-year plan across all the relevant business lines.\n\nAt Air France, every week, critical events are analyzed and followed up by specific committees.\n\nA  series  of  key  indicators,  one  for  each  operational process, are used to monitor the performance of the three operational processes Any malfunctioning flagged, notably, by flight crews or customers, is also studied to be able to implement remedial and/or preventive measures. Throughout  the  year,  several  meetings  of  in-house steering  bodies  are  held,  enabling  the  monitoring  of current events in this area and  the  tracking  of performance via indicators and action plans, with a view to ensuring a continuous improvement.\n\n## Animal safety during transportation\n\nAt  Air  France-KLM,  we  recognize  the  importance  of animal  welfare  and  are  committed  to  ensuring  the  safe and humane transportation of animals. We adhere to the strict guidelines set forth by regulatory agencies and work closely  with  animal  welfare  organizations  to  ensure  our policies  and  procedures  are  in  line  with  industry  best practices.

As  a  consequence,  the  European  Data Protection Board (EDPB) recommended the\n\nperformance  of  Data  Transfer  Impact  Assessments (DTIA)  and  the  use  of  new  models  of  standard contractual clauses for these transfers. To comply with the requirements for transferring personal data, a new comprehensive  GDPR-contracting  process  has  been created;\n\n- \u25a0 within the Group's Passenger Commercial organization and  airline  customer  domains,  a  Data  Protection Committee was created to focus on customer privacyrelated  matters  to  strengthen  the  execution  of  the Data Privacy activities. This framework will also be used to  manage  the  new  organization  and  governance  of the Flying Blue program. A joint controller agreement has  been  formalized  between  Air  France,  KLM  and Flying  Blue  Miles,  the  new  operating  affiliate  of Air France-KLM that will hold the trademark and most of  the  commercial  partner  contracts  related  to  the Flying Blue loyalty program;\n- \u25a0 Air France's focus was on cooperating with the French Data  Protection  Authority  (CNIL)  on  thematic  topics, and on improving data protection awareness;\n- \u25a0 KLM's efforts to enhance its Data Protection governance  systems  were  intensified.  A  new  training program for employees was developed as part of the annual compliance and awareness program. Moreover, the  mandatory  Register  of  Processing  Activities  and the data breach process saw further reinforcement.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThe overall effectiveness of the Data Protection management system is assessed through the steering of an  internal  network  of  business  privacy  correspondents (first level controls), the internal control systems implemented  (second  level  controls)  and  a  dedicated Internal Audit program (third level control). This framework  is  subject  to  a  continuous  improvement process.  In  parallel,  the  Data  Protection  Officer  monitors the application and compliance  with  the  privacy legislation.\n\nRisks related to Data Protection are periodically assessed within  the  various  business  activities  of  the  Air  FranceKLM  group  and  integrated  into the overall risk management and control system.\n\nGiven  the  increasing  significance  of  these  risks  in conjunction with cybersecurity threats, the protection of personal  data  is  becoming  more  important.  This  and, more generally. data privacy, is an absolute imperative for the Air France-KLM group.\n\nSee  also  section  3.1.3  'Risks  relating  to  the  Group's processes'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Providing the appropriate  assistance  can  be  complex  due  to  the differences  between  the  EU  and  US  regulations.  In  the United  States,  the  responsibility  for  providing  assistance falls solely to the airline while, in the European Union, the airport authority is responsible for end-to-end assistance. Customers are advised to transmit PDRM information to the  airline  48  hours  before  departure,  which  will  be forwarded  to  the  airport  authority  36  hours  prior  to departure.  At  Paris-CDG,  Paris  A\u00e9roport  (ADP  Group) oversees special assistance for Air France passengers via its Gimap  service  providers.  At  Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport,  PWD  assistance  is  supplied  by  Axxicom  Airport Caddy.  Lastly,  the  communication  channels  are  kept updated  to  help  customers  comply  with  all  the  travel conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\nAir  France's  dedicated  assistance  service  for  passengers with  reduced  mobility,  Saphir  ( Service  d'Assistance  aux Personnes  Handicap\u00e9es  pour  les  Informations  et  la R\u00e9servation ),  provides tailored services such as facilitated booking procedures, airport assistance, baggage assistance  and  special  equipment  on  board  (raisable armrests).  Saphir  fielded  around  75,000  calls  in  2023: telephone and online services enable ticket bookings and the  provision  of  the  appropriate  assistance.  A  telephone assistance service dedicated to hearing-impaired customers is also available. Saphir is specifically aimed at customers  'whose  mobility  is  reduced,  when  using transport, due to any physical disability (sensory or motor, permanent or temporary) or any handicap or intellectual deficiency,  or  any  other  cause  of  disability,  or  age,  and whose  situation  requires  appropriate  attention  and adaptation to their particular needs of the service made\n\navailable to all passengers' (definition of the Regulation of the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  July  5, 2006).  It  is  available  from  mainland  France,  the  French overseas  departments  (Cayenne,  Fort-de-France,  Pointe\u00e0-Pitre, Reunion), and 19 other countries. Every member of the Saphir team has been trained by a doctor specializing in disability.\n\nAir  France  has  partnered  with  multiple  associations  and national  and  European  bodies  dedicated  to  disability  to improve  services.  KLM  Cares  facilitates  the  organization and  booking  of  flights  for  people  with  disabilities  or mobility issues. At the airport and on board, KLM provides adapted facilities and equipment to ensure a comfortable and  enjoyable  journey.  Air  France  and  KLM  cabin  crews are  trained  in  the  assistance  needs  of  the  customers concerned and received specific instructions to deal with the public health crisis. All of them ensure the appropriate assistance  on  board.  The  mobilized  crew  group  alone numbers  some  24  members  as  part  of  a  'Viva  Engage' team. Commercial agents and LSF (French sign language)-qualified  crew  members  wear  identification pins for easy recognition.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThere  are  more  people  with  disabilities  or  reduced mobility  traveling  on  the  Group's  flights  every  year.  In 2023,  around  710,000  Air  France  and  470,000  KLM assistance requests were  handled.  Air  France  has organized  meetings  with  disabled  employees  to  gather feedback  and  improve  services,  in  particular  better information before and during the trip for customers and staff  to  foster  a  caring  relationship.  Other  initiatives include  redesigning  Air  France  and  KLM  website  pages for disabled customers to facilitate access to information for  their  journeys  and  sending  information  adapted  to their  type  of  disability.  Awareness  workshops  on  the appropriate language and gestures for disabled customers,  along  with  computer  tools  to  facilitate  care, have been created for staff on flights and on the ground.",

It  has\n\n## 4.5.1 The Air France-KLM Principles\n\n## 4.5.1.1 Background and objectives\n\nIn  July  2020,  the  Air  France-KLM  group  published  the Air  France-KLM  Principles  which  set  out  the  values  and fundamental rights within the Group.\n\nThe  Air France-KLM  Principles  were  developed  in cooperation  with  the  European  Works  Council  and  staff representatives.\n\nThese  are  regularly  reviewed  to  ensure  these  are  up  to date.  The  Air  France-KLM  Principles  reaffirm  to  all employees  the  Air  France-KLM  group's  commitment  to fostering a climate of mutual trust, respect, transparency and confidentiality, and to promoting a work environment where  health,  safety  and  quality  of  life  are  key  priorities without compromise.\n\n## 4.5.1.2 Scope and content\n\nThey include the commitments in respect of diversity and inclusion, health and safety, working conditions including training and development of skills, remuneration, working hours, freedom of association, social dialogue, combating modern slavery and human trafficking, protection of the environment  and  local  communities,  privacy  and  digital ethics,  combating  corruption,  fraud  and  market  abuse, compliance  with  embargo,  trade  sanctions  and  export control  rules,  and  competition  laws,  and  relations  with third parties.\n\nincorporated these ten principles into its strategy, policies and  procedures,  and  actively  promotes  them  to  its partners  and  suppliers.  The  last  communication  on progress was published on May 30, 2022.\n\nThe importance of respecting ethical principles in day-today  business  activities  is  reiterated  in  a  number  of documents.  Some  of  these  documents  apply  to  all employees  irrespective  of  their  positions,  locations  and activities,  such  as  the  Air  France-KLM  Principles  and  the anti-corruption  Code  of  Conduct.  This  documentation gives rise to regular communication, awareness campaigns and training programs.\n\nIn addition, and  without  prejudice  to  the  abovementioned  documentation,  other  documents  may  be dedicated to:\n\n- \u25a0 certain  legal  entities  so  as  to  comply  with  the applicable local laws or internal regulations;\n- \u25a0 specific functions  (such  as  the  Charter  for  the Procurement  domain  or  the  Code  of  Ethics  for  the Finance domain).\n\nThey also remind employees of the speak-up policies and reporting tools to ensure that incidents can be investigated and remedied.\n\nThey serve as a shared foundation for all the companies within  the  Air  France-KLM  group  and  support  new initiatives,  procedures,  rules,  and  Codes  of  Conduct,  and are  used  in  building  training  material  on  compliance domains for the employees of the Air France-KLM group.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  Principles  apply  to  all  employees within the Air France-KLM group, including those working part time and on temporary contracts.\n\nAll  employees  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group  may  access these Air France-KLM Principles through their respective intranets and the Air France-KLM corporate website.\n\nThese  Air  France-KLM  Principles  also  apply  to  all Air France-KLM stakeholders, irrespective of their nature, and  the  Air  France-KLM  group  encourages  all  its customers,  shareholders,  business  partners  and  local communities  to  respect  them (1) . To this end, the Air  France-KLM  group  publicly  communicates  on  the Air France-KLM  Principles  on  its  corporate  website (https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/our-commitments/ people-culture) and the principles and commitments are embedded  in  specific  documentation  applicable  to  the Air  France-KLM  supply  chain  (such  as  in  the  Supplier Sustainable  Code  of  Conduct)  and  in  the  provisions  of contract  templates  to  be  used  when  entering  into commercial relationships with business partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The  Compliance  department, which  is  part  of  the  Corporate  Secretary's  Office  and  is headed by the VP Group Compliance Officer, is in charge of  anti-corruption  and  business  ethics,  personal  data protection and trade compliance. In coordination with the airlines' and subsidiaries' compliance teams, the Air France-KLM  Compliance  department  is  notably responsible for defining the compliance programs for the Air France-KLM  group,  assisting  the  businesses  in deploying  them  and  monitoring  their  effectiveness  as part  of  a  continuous  improvement  process.  It  provides regular  updates  to  the  Air  France-KLM  Sustainable Development  and  Compliance  Committee  (see  sections 2.3.2 and 3.3.1).\n\nThe  compliance  teams  are  supported  by  a  network  of compliance  coordinators  appointed  in  the  activities  or departments and subsidiaries. Depending on the type of business transaction envisaged and the complexity of the activities  exercised  within  the  departments  and  entities, compliance experts and coordinators facilitate compliance with specific legislation and the roll-out of the relevant elements of the compliance program.\n\nThe  compliance  activities  are  based  on  compliance programs per  domain,  executed  within  the  context  of  a formalized  framework  and  in  line  with  the  applicable legislation. The compliance programs include policies, risk mapping,  awareness  and  training,  controls,  reporting mechanisms and control frameworks, and are subject to audits by the internal audit team.\n\n## 4.5.2.2 Respect of human rights\n\n## a) Within the Air France-KLM group\n\nHuman rights are the foundation for social, economic and cultural  cohesion  within  each  company  and  across  the Air France-KLM group. Every employee of Air France-KLM has  the  right  to  working  conditions  that  protect  their health,  safety  and  dignity,  and  guarantee  a  social dialogue.\n\nWithin the framework of its activities, the Air France-KLM group  has  identified  the  risk  factors  relating  to  human rights. The measures put in place to mitigate these risks fall  into  a  number  of  different  categories:  health  and safety of individuals, equal opportunity, achieving a better work/life  balance  and  data  protection  procedures  to protect  the  personal  data  of  customers  and  employees (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6.3). The French entities of the Air  France-KLM  group  are  required  to  implement  all measures necessary to ensure the safety and protection of the physical and mental health of workers in terms of instructions,  training,  materials  and  tools,  protection equipment,  organization  of  working  conditions  and interactions  to  prevent  harassment  etc.  pursuant  to French law (article L4121-1 to 5 of the French labor Code), failing  which any failure may lead to criminal liability. All entities  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group  apply  security  and safety  principles  which  may  even  be  reinforced  by  the\n\napplicable local regulations of the country of registration of such entities.\n\nAir France has carried out awareness-raising actions for its employees on human trafficking, to help them identify atrisk  situations  and  take  action  against  this  form  of international organized crime, comparable with modernday  slavery.  Whether  it  is  trafficking  for  the  purpose  of forced labor or crime, sexual exploitation, illegal adoption or  forced  marriage,  child  soldiers,  organ  trafficking  or other forms of human exploitation, the ground staff and flight  crews  should  be  able  to  recognize  behavior  that may seem abnormal or concerning and, in the event of suspected human trafficking, report the event as soon as possible and in accordance with the internal instructions. These actions were initiated in 2019.\n\n## b) With third parties\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  relationships  with  suppliers  and subcontractors,  the  Air  France-KLM  group  is  committed to  ensuring  that  the  fundamental  principles  and  social rights are properly respected, everywhere in the world.\n\nSuppliers  are  requested  to  accept  and  comply  with  a Supplier  Sustainable  Code  of  Conduct  based  on  the  ten Principles  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  or  to comply with their own Code of Conduct provided that its terms and conditions are as stringent as the ones in the Air  France-KLM  Supplier  Sustainability  Code  of  Conduct (see sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3). They are also asked to verify such commitment within their own supply chain.\n\nThe Compliance and Procurement domains contribute to the regular review and  updating  of  the  Supplier Sustainability  Code  of  Conduct  to  ensure  its  alignment with  the  applicable  regulations,  notably  the  French Sapin 2 Act and the French law on the Duty of Vigilance which  sets  forth  a  monitoring  obligation  concerning contracting partners respectively with respect to probity and integrity and to vigilance with regard to human and social  rights,  the  environment  and  sustainability  within the supply chain.\n\nBefore  entering  into  any  undertakings  and  during commercial  relationships  with  customers,  suppliers  and intermediaries,  the  Air  France-KLM  group  ensures  that the compliance and fair business conduct rules are duly respected  through  a  third-party  evaluation  process  in accordance with the Air France-KLM policy on third party selection and management.\n\n## 4.5.2.3 Prevention of corruption\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  is  committed  to  conducting business with loyalty, fairness, transparency, honesty and integrity in the strict respect of the anti-corruption laws in all  the  countries  where  its  entities  are  registered  and operate.\n\nThis commitment guides its social and ethical policy and is  embedded in its Corporate Purpose, as the prevention of and fight against corruption is the basis for responsible and sustainable business around the world.",

The Air France-KLM group regularly reviews and  updates  its  internal  documentation  to  take  into account  changes  in  legislation  and  recent  case  law,  but also the result of risk mapping and any reported incidents.\n\nFollowing the publication of the latest Recommendations from  the  French  Anti-corruption  Agency  ('AFA'),  in December  2022  the  Air  France-KLM  group  updated  its anti-corruption manual which has since become the AntiCorruption  Code  of  Conduct.  Six  policies  were  added  to this  Code  covering  the  topics  of  gifts  and  hospitality, conflicts of interest, facilitation payments,  lobbying, sponsoring and patronage, and third parties.\n\nThese documents are available on the Air France and KLM intranets and the anti-corruption Code of Conduct is also available on the Air France-KLM group corporate website (https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/group/values).\n\nAn  anti-corruption  e-learning  campaign  was  realized between  December  2022  and  March  2023,  with  an  elearning module in both French and English. The content is  based  on  examples  of  cases  arising  from  alerts,  cases\n\nencountered  in  practice  and  the  results  of  bribery  risk mapping.  The  aim  is  to  explain  the  applicable  legal framework,  the  associated  sanctions  and  the  rules stipulated in the updated anti-corruption documentation with  a  quiz  to  check  that  the  internal  rules  have  been properly understood.\n\nIn addition to this e-learning module, a comprehensive inclass training campaign was designed with the support of an  external  service  provider  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated training program for the Top Management and (ii) plan a training  program  for  employees  with  the  highest  risk  of exposure  involving  three  hours  of  classroom  sessions based on a 'train the trainers' approach with the support of the compliance and legal teams to be rolled out in 2023 and 2024.\n\nAt the end of April 2023, the realization rate for the anticorruption  e-learning  for  the  selected  panel  was  96%. Awareness  is  also  reinforced  through,  for  example, information  meetings  and  discussions,  improved  access to compliance documents and regular communication by the Top Management.\n\nSee also section 3.1.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\n| Key Performance Indicators                                     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                             | 2022  results   | 2023 results   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Completion rate of the e-learning  on prevention of corruption | Number of employees having completed the entire  training program as of December 31 of the relevant  year divided by the total number of employees invited  to undertake this training | 85%             | 96%            |\n\nScope: Target group of Air France-KLM group compulsory panel of employees.\n\nTraining is mandatory for the target group of employees. The  latter  is  selected  based  on  a  functional  level  (i.e. executives  or  managers)  or  exposure  to  bribery  risk according  to  the  results  of  the  bribery  risk  mapping performed  within  the  organization  (i.e.  the  Sales  and Procurement teams).\n\nThe  indicator  measured  is  the  number  of  employees having  completed  the  entire  training  program  as  of December 31, divided by the total number of employees invited to undertake this training.\n\nThe Air France-KLM group has selected a service provider to  implement  a  digital  compliance  tool  which  will  also facilitate  the  deployment  and  monitoring  of  the  anticorruption program within the Air France-KLM group. This tool should be deployed over the course of 2024.\n\n## 4.5.2.4 Prevention of anti-competitive practices\n\nThe  prevention  of  anti-competitive  behavior  is  an important factor in honest and fair business practice. It is crucial  to  prevent  unfair  practices  since  unethical  or inappropriate  behavior  can  have  significant  detrimental consequences, both financial and in terms of reputational damage.\n\nIn terms of anti-competitive practices, the Air France-KLM group is developing its policy aimed at the prevention of anti-competitive acts by circulating to staff a Competition Law  Compliance  Manual.  This  manual  is  regularly reviewed and updated.\n\nA competition law e-learning module was developed inhouse  and  rolled  out  between  December  14,  2021  and March 15, 2022 to a significant number of Air France-KLM group employees, to remind them of the competition law principles and the risks incurred.\n\nIn addition to this e-learning module, the competition law team carries out dedicated training sessions with certain categories of staff.\n\nSee also section 3.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\n## 4.5.2.5 Compliance with embargoes, trade sanctions and export controls legislation\n\nThe Air France and KLM Trade Compliance departments are responsible for defining and managing the compliance program, and for ensuring and facilitating its implementation and adherence, so as to ensure maximum compliance with customs, trade sanctions and export control legislation applicable to the Air France-KLM group's activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  review  the  need  for  the  request  and renewal  of  export  licenses  by  product  category,  partner and  country  (dual  use  goods,  military  goods,  explosives and  ozone  depleting  products,  etc.)  and  complete or review  compliance  questionnaires  issued  by  the Air France-KLM group stakeholders (banks, insurers, etc.).\n\nThe Trade Compliance Officers ensure the monitoring of the existing export control framework.\n\nWithin the Engineering & Maintenance, Cargo, Procurement  and  Treasury  domains,  customers  and suppliers  are  screened  before  onboarding  and  on  an ongoing  basis.  A  more  exhaustive  third-party  due diligence  screening  procedure  is  being  drafted  with  an extended compliance scope, for implementation in 2024.\n\nTraining and awareness-raising is a major priority for the Air France-KLM group. Export control e-learning modules are  pushed  to  the  relevant  cargo  and  engineering  and maintenance  staff  on  a  regular  basis.  A  trade  sanctions e -learning program applicable to a broader target group has also been deployed within KLM.\n\n## 4.5.2.6 Personal Data Protection\n\nWhether for passenger bookings, flight schedule management  or  aircraft  maintenance,  etc.,  information systems  are  at  the  heart  of  all  of  Air France-KLM's activities. For the Air France-KLM group, the protection of personal data is a key element in the trust granted by its customers and employees.\n\nSince  the  Air  France-KLM  group  is  well  aware  that  the protection  of  private  lives  and  personal  data  is  an increasingly  sensitive  subject,  it  places  this  issue  at  the heart  of  its  priorities  and  ensures  the  highest  level  of regulatory compliance.\n\nThe  Data  Privacy  Officers  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group entities  are  in  charge  of  ensuring  the  European  General Data  Protection  Regulation  through  the  set  up  of processes for Data Privacy governance, the management of  data  compliance breaches and training as part of the annual  compliance  program  for  this  domain.  Last  year, the  focus  was  on  the  compliance  of  personal  data transfers outside the European Economic Area, after the invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the Privacy Shield in the 'Schrems IT' case.\n\nFor more details, see section 4.4.2.\n\n## 4.5.2.7 Speak up policy and whistleblower procedures\n\nAll employees in the entities of the Air France-KLM group are encouraged to discuss any compliance concerns with their line managers. They can also contact a Compliance Officer or compliance coordinator directly. Employees also have the option to report an incident via the whistleblower mechanism. Both KLM and Air France have implemented  and  regularly  review  and  update  their speak-up policies and procedures to collect and manage internal and external alerts so as to comply with the latest regulations  in  force.  Air  France  has  also  changed  its reporting  tool  to  increase  the  number  of  languages  for the reporting of incidents and facilitate the management of alerts, especially if they are done anonymously.\n\nThese  whistleblower  procedures  also  include  the  option to report any corruption issues or serious incidents linked to  the  duty  of  vigilance  (human  rights,  fundamental freedoms, health and safety, environment) in all areas of activity,  pursuant  to  the  regulation  in  force  via  secured channels  which  ensure  the  strict  confidentiality  of  the alert and  identity  of  the  relevant  employees.  The associated procedure gives guidance on how to proceed and  guarantees  that  no  sanctions  will  be  taken  against employees reporting any such incidents in good faith, as provided under the applicable law.\n\nIncidents reported by employees according to the abovementioned procedures are investigated and the appropriate corrective actions are implemented.\n\n## 4.5.2.8 Tax strategy\n\nTax  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Finance  function  within Air  France  and  KLM  and  supports  Air  France-KLM's corporate  strategy.  As  such  the  Air  France-KLM  group's tax  strategy  is  aligned  with  the  business  strategy, ambitions and values of the Group. We want to act fairly, transparently and with integrity towards all our stakeholders. The tax strategy is driven by demonstrating the commitment  to  comply  with  legislation and explaining Air France-KLM's approach to tax.\n\n## Tax principles\n\nAir France-KLM bases its approach to tax on a set of three key principles: Compliance,  Transparency  and  Risk Management.\n\n## Compliance\n\nAir  France-KLM  recognizes  the  important  role  fiscal compliance  plays  in  its  strategy  and  undertakes  to  act with integrity and transparency in all tax matters and to prevent  tax  evasion.  The  Company  is  committed  to complying with the letter, the intent and the spirit of the tax  legislation,  and  the  local  and  international  laws (including bilateral tax treaties, OECD and UN guidelines) of  the  countries  in  which  it  operates  and  to  paying  the right amount of tax at the right time.",

All  information  is  recorded  and reported in a fair, timely, and accurate manner following good business practices, applicable accounting standards and local tax laws.\n\nThe  Air  France  and  KLM  tax  departments  are  fully involved  in  sustainable  development  issues  in  order  to secure  the  different  Group  projects  (Trip  and  Tree,  SAF Corporate and SAF Cargo) and to comply with French and EU obligations in this respect (Fitfor55).\n\n## Transparency\n\nMutual respect, transparency and trust drive the Air  France-KLM's  relationships  with  the  tax  authorities and  other  relevant  external  stakeholders  all  around  the world.\n\nAir France-KLM seeks to establish and maintain an open and  constructive  dialogue  with  the  tax  authorities  and other  government  bodies.  The  Group  participates  in  the development of tax policies by contributing constructive inputs to public consultations.\n\nThe  aim  is  to  proactively  deal  with  disputed  taxation matters, and avoid unnecessary challenges and disputes to achieve certainty wherever possible.\n\nIn  this  regard,  the  Group  has  reinforced  its  relationship with  both  tax  administrations  through  the  following initiatives:\n\n- \u25a0 on  March  14,  2019,  a  fiscal  partnership  was  signed between  the  French  tax  authorities  and  Air  FranceKLM, the consolidating entity of the French tax group. This partnership is aimed at improving the relationship with  the  French  tax  authorities  within  the  framework of the day-to-day operations and ongoing tax audits;\n- \u25a0 in  addition,  in  2023,  Air  France  was  audited  by  the French  Customs  Administration  which  led  to  the renewal of its Organisme \u00c9conomique Agr\u00e9\u00e9 certification (OEA)  for  the  third  time  in  a  row.  This qualification  allows  the  company  to  benefit  from facilitated tax and custom regimes. This also confirms the relationship of trust between the company and the international customs administrations with very limited customs risks;\n- \u25a0 on  the  Dutch  side,  KLM  has  maintained  a  long-term relationship with the Dutch tax authorities. KLM is one of  the  top  100  companies  in  the  Netherlands  to  have entered  into  an  individual  tax  monitoring  plan  (ITP) with  the  Dutch  tax  authorities.  Following  this  ITP approach,  the  tax  authorities  test  the  level  of  the monitoring  measures  (tax  control  framework)  KLM maintains  to  recognize  and  manage  its  key  tax  risks. Ultimately this approach enables the tax authorities to adapt their control measures for KLM more effectively.\n\nSince 2022 KLM has produced an annual Tax Transparency  and  Contribution  Report  as  developed  by the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (known as VNO NCW). The tax governance code not only includes the relevant tax codes and principles, but is also more ambitious with regard to a) the view that tax is not only a cost factor but also a contribution to society, b) that tax rules must be interpreted in accordance with the spirit of the law, c) the avoidance of the use of tax havens and d) transparency, especially on taxes paid and collected.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's aim is to take sustainable tax positions which are  long-term  in  nature,  in  support  of  the  business operations.\n\nIt only  uses  business  structures  that  are  driven  by commercial considerations, are aligned with its business activity and have genuine substance. It does not look for schemes  that  might  be  deemed  improper  at  the  fiscal level or are intended to avoid paying taxes.\n\nAir France-KLM conducts its operations with a minimum level  of  risk  with  respect  to  tax  matters  and  as  such applies the anti-tax-avoidance rules within the framework of  the  European Directive (EU) 2016-1164 transposed into the French and Dutch tax legislation.\n\nThe European mandatory disclosure regime for potentially aggressive  international  tax  arrangements  came  into effect on July 1, 2020 (DAC6 Directive, EU 2018/822 of May 25, 2018). Both Air France and KLM's tax departments have reviewed the compliance  reporting obligations the businesses are potentially facing under the new Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR) in relation to certain cross-border arrangements. No such arrangements have been identified.\n\nConsidering  the  OECD  GloBE  rules  agreement  dated October  8,  2021  and  the  Pillar  2  EU  Directive  (Dir. UE 2022/2523 of December 14, 2022), the Group will comply with the Pillar 2 rules from January 1, 2024.\n\nThe Tax Affairs departments  in France and The Netherlands seek to anticipate and reduce the tax risks to their  lowest  possible  level.  They  ensure  that  reasonable care  applies  in  relation  to  all  the  Group's  processes  that could materially affect compliance with the tax obligations  and  are  particularly  vigilant  concerning  the application of the rules combating fraud and tax evasion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scope: suppliers under contract with Air France and KLM, monitored under ARIBA, and scored by the CSR rating agency EcoVadis or an equivalent body. Within the framework of its supplier risk policy, Air France-KLM has its suppliers evaluated and takes into account their sustainable development performance. In the event of an elevated or severe risk, suppliers must be assessed  by  the  CSR  rating  agency  EcoVadis  or  an  equivalent  body  on  the  following  four  themes:  environmental,  social,  ethical  and responsible purchasing. All other suppliers are invited to carry out this evaluation on a voluntary basis. The indicator measured is the number of suppliers evaluated by EcoVadis or an equivalent body (end December of the reference year). Suppliers considered compliant are those with a score equal to or greater than 35 over the last three years.\n\n## 4.6.1 Local development\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nDirectly and indirectly, the Group's activities contribute to economic  development  and  create  value  at  their  hubs around  Amsterdam  and  Paris,  and  at  national  level  in France  and  The  Netherlands.  These  hubs  offer  multiple connection opportunities in Europe and with the rest of the  world,  and  are  part  of  an  extensive,  high-quality network that generates an attractive business environment.  According  to  an  Opinionway  survey  of international investors carried out in 2019, the presence of a hub offering direct and frequent international connections is the second most important criterion when choosing a location. The Group serves over 300  destinations  in  over  100  countries  and  its  economic impact extends beyond its hubs.\n\nWith 91% of the Group's employees based in France and The Netherlands, Air France-KLM is a significant contributor to direct job creation in the regions around its two  main  hubs.  The  Group's  activities  also  generate numerous  indirect  and  induced  jobs:  assistance  and catering in the outstations, cleaning and sub-contracted services required for the operation of an aircraft.\n\nThe hubs create highly attractive business environments while airport proximity leads to the development of other activities (hotels, conferences,  company  show-rooms, commercial  and  marketing  functions,  business  services and activities linked to innovation).\n\nAs  the  number  one  air  operator  carrying  international tourists visiting France, Air France-KLM  makes  a significant  contribution  towards  promoting  France  and The Netherlands as destinations, and to the development of tourism.\n\nKLM's extensive network has contributed to making The Netherlands  an  attractive  location  for  both  Dutch  and international  companies.  The  Air  France  group,  with operations  at  30  French  airports  in  2023  (in  mainland France and overseas), reinforces the appeal of the regions and contributes to the growth in local activity.\n\nHistorically,  the  Group  has  also  played  an  active  role  in promoting international development, particularly through its support of NGOs and projects sponsored by its own employees.",

The  Group  also  promotes  innovation  and working  with  start-ups  via  its  involvement  in  initiatives such  as  the  creation  of  an  innovation  counter,  and participation in special business incubators. On December  7,  2023,  a  special  event  was  held  with  the theme of CSR innovation. The event showcased innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups, the sheltered sector, and universities.\n\nAt local level, Air France and KLM are involved in various initiatives and  local  bodies  to  promote  sustainable development and build human  capital and the attractiveness  of  the  territories around  their  hubs. Air  France  is  working  in  cooperation  with  local  officials and  companies  as  a  member  of  the  Board  of  the  ' Club des  Acteurs  du  Grand  Roissy '.  This  association  aims  to foster  harmonious  and  balanced  development  of  the Grand  Roissy  area,  in  synergy  with  the  airport  platform, and to promote public transport, housing and infrastructure projects that are vital to the development of this region.\n\n## Creating social impact\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  support  initiatives  enabling  the development of skills, the vocational integration of young people and the social inclusion of vulnerable individuals. This also includes promoting access to training leading to professions  in  the  airline  industry,  through  numerous associations and educational programs for young people.\n\nAir  France  is  a  founder  member  and  partner  of  four associations involved in information and training programs on aviation careers (AirEmploi, Jeremy, AFMA\u00e9, and Engineers for Schools). The company is also a partner of  two  associations, 'Nos  Quartiers  ont  du  Talent '  and 'Article 1', to which Air France employees' volunteers offer mentoring  for  socially  disadvantaged  young  people. Air  France is also a founder member of ' Tous en Stage ', an association that organizes multi-company internships for  secondary  school  students  in  the  areas  where  the company  operates  (mainland  France,  French  overseas departments and young people with disabilities).\n\nThe  Air  France  group  promotes  gender  diversity  and combats  stereotypes  in  technical  aviation  careers  by supporting initiatives aimed  at promoting gender balance.  This  is  demonstrated  through  the  charter 'Feminizing  the  aeronautics  and  space  professions'  and the ' Elles bougent ' association.\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  continue  to  support  workers  with disabilities  by  using  companies  in  the  sheltered  and adapted  sector  for  multiple  projects  (e.g.  the  upkeep  of green  spaces  at  some  sites,  shipment  of  packages  of uniforms,  packaging  of  headphones  used  on  board, laundering  of  on-board  linen)  and  by  entrusting  them with critical services (four sheltered sector suppliers work with the Air France-KLM IT department).\n\nSince  its  launch,  4,928  Air  France  employees  have registered  on  the  ' Mon  Engagement  citoyen' platform testifying  to  the  interest  generated.  In  total,  more  than 1,160  employees have taken up at least one challenge or carried out a volunteer action.\n\nAir  France  and  KLM  contribute  to  local  communities  by supporting economic initiatives and educational programs,  while  also  encouraging  their  employees  to volunteer  and  address  social  and  environmental  issues. These  initiatives  like,  for  example,  Sodesi,  Luchtvaart College Schiphol collaboration and the Vendredi volunteer partnership  are  outlined  in  section  4.2.1 'Working Conditions and Employee Engagement'.\n\n## Social partnerships\n\nThe Air France-KLM group partners with local and global Non-Governmental  Organizations  to  increase  its  reach and broader positive impact.\n\nAir  France  provides  practical  support  to  development projects  through  three  long-standing  partnerships:  the Air  France Foundation, Acting for Life and Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n\nThe Air France Foundation has adapted its projects while pursuing  its  primary  objective:  supporting  children  and youth,  as  well  as  humanitarian  sponsorship.  Long-term projects  on  the  themes  of  education  and  integration  for sick,  disabled  and  vulnerable  children  are  being  pursued and  which  now  include  environmental  awareness  issues. The Foundation finances educational projects contributing to fostering new  kinds  of  behavior  and  increased understanding  of  climate  issues,  together  with  training and  awareness-raising  projects  on  sustainable  practices respecting  natural  resources.  In  2023,  the  Air  France Foundation supported 36 projects (12 projects for environmental  education,  30  projects  for  children  in difficulty  and  six  projects  for  sick  or  disabled  children)  in 22  countries  with  46,000  beneficiaries.  Among  these projects,  eight  concern  France,  with  7,450  beneficiaries across the national territory. The Friends of the Air France Foundation network mobilizes more than 4,800 employees around different volunteering, skills-sharing and donationbased initiatives.\n\nThe Humanitarian Patronage Service supports 16 medical NGOs  working  with  children.  In  2023,  455  tickets  were issued  for  medical  teams  and  the  repatriation  of  sick children.  In  addition,  free  excess  baggage  fees  were donated  to  16  NGO  partners  for  the  transportation  of medical and emergency aid equipment, i.e. over 60 pieces of baggage.\n\nActing for Life, of which Air France has been a partner for more than 40 years, was involved in 17 projects in Africa and  Latin  America.  In  2023,  three  new  projects  were launched.  Acting  for  Life  works  to  promote  sustainable territorial economic and social development.\n\nIn 2023, thanks to the financial support and transportation facilities  donated  by  Air  France,  the  emergency  aid organization Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res accompanied 954 sick children on the airline's flights and shipped nearly 6,000 packages (35 tons) of medicines and minor medical supplies  to  19  destinations  to  the  benefit  of  26  different associations.  In  addition,  the  Air  France-KLM  Flying  Blue loyalty  program  enables Aviation  Sans  Fronti\u00e8res to benefit  from  numerous  Miles,  thereby  reducing  the transportation  costs  incurred  in  accompanying  sick children.  There  are  many  active  and  retired  Air  France employees amongst the Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res teams of volunteers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  initiative,  supported  by Transavia  Netherlands  employees,  organizes  holidays  for young people between the ages of 13 and 20 years who are  unable  to  enjoy  a  'normal'  holiday  due  to  illness  or difficult circumstances. Transavia Netherlands also works closely with JINC, an organization that arranges activities for children from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds. Transavia Netherlands employees  are invited  and  encouraged  to  actively  participate  in  these initiatives  during  which  children  notably  visit  companies to  gain  valuable  insight  into  the  working  world  and  its functioning,  and  become  familiar  with  the  concept  of networking.  These  initiatives  illustrate  the  Transavia Netherlands  conviction  that  'Everybody  deserves  to  be seen' and contribute to a more inclusive society. Transavia Netherlands  utilizes  an  internal  social  impact  platform available on  the  intranet so that employees  can contribute  to  other  local  charities  through  time  or financial means, or even start their own initiatives towards environmental  or  social  causes  which  other  employees can further support.\n\nAdditionally,  Transavia  Netherlands  also  presents  an annual Peter Legro award, a competition for small Dutch charities,  in  which  the  year's  winner  receives  a  financial prize  (as  voted  for  by  Transavia  Netherlands  employees) and all charities benefit from the additional exposure.\n\nFor over a decade, Transavia France has been supporting the Louis Carlesimo association, enabling sick children to travel on  its flights. Every  year,  between  50  and 80 children have the opportunity to travel to Lapland and meet Father Christmas on the outbound flight as part of a magical and unforgettable moment with the airline.\n\nTransavia France also supports men combating diseases via  its  commitment  to  associations  like Les  Hommes de l'Air . In  2023,  special  flights  were  organized  to  raise customer awareness and highlight the association.\n\nSince  2019,  Transavia  France  has  fostered  diversity  by supporting Personn'Ailes, an LGBT association. Every year, special flights are organized in the colors of the rainbow to  share  a  common  vision  of  diversity  and  inclusion.  On May 17, 2022, Transavia France organized special flights to raise awareness of homophobia, transphobia and biphobia.\n\nKLM works together with selected partners to protect the environment  and  preserve  cultural  heritage.  In  addition, KLM  supports  a  number  of  large  institutions  that  assist children in need. One of these is Wings of Support, which was founded by KLM and Martinair staff, and runs projects that  provide  shelter,  education  and  medical  care  for children  in  need  worldwide.  KLM  is  also  engaged  in several partnerships that aim to preserve cultural heritage and,  more  generally,  offer  support  to  arts  and  cultural initiatives. Examples include the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam,  the  Royal  Concertgebouw  Orchestra  and leading museums and theaters in the Netherlands.\n\nLastly,  Air  France-KLM  customers  who  are  members  of the  Flying  Blue  (FB)  loyalty  program  are  offered  the opportunity to donate their Miles to 19 NGOs selected by Air France and KLM, including WWF, the Ocean Cleanup, Close the Gap, the Red Cross, UNICEF, Wings of Support and  Giro555.  In  2023,  almost  350  million  Miles  were donated by FB members.\n\n## Results and performance\n\n## National and regional economic impact\n\nEconomic  impact  in  France,  according  to  an  EM Strasbourg Management School research report published in early 2020 on the basis of 2019 figures (preCovid-19):\n\n- \u25a0 \u20ac40  billion  positive  economic  impact  attributable  to the  Air  France-KLM  group's  activity,  representing 1.6% of French GDP;\n- \u25a0 475,000 FTE (Full Time Equivalent) jobs depend on the Group's activity;\n- \u25a0 for every job created by the Group, 8.7 jobs are created in the French economy;\n- \u25a0 for every euro invested, the Group generates two euros in the national economy;\n- \u25a0 the Air France-KLM group's activity directly generates \u20ac3.6 billion (including the taxes and social contributions paid by the Group and its employees);\n- \u25a0 Air  France  is  a  leading  private  sector  employer  in  the \u00cele-de-France, with almost 230,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs in France;\n- \u25a0 at the end of 2022, the KLM group was one of the five largest  private  sector  employers  in  The  Netherlands., accounting for more than 31,000 jobs.\n\nAn updated study will be published in 2024.\n\n## Contribution to the sheltered and adapted sector\n\nIn 2023, Air France signed its twelfth three-year agreement  on  jobs  and  the  maintained  employment  of persons with disabilities.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  this  agreement,  one  of  the commitments concerns reaffirmed support for partnerships  with  the  companies  of  the  sheltered  and adapted sector.\n\nAir France also cooperates with associations and companies  in  the  sheltered  sector  on  multiple  projects representing,  in  2023,  approximately  \u20ac17.4  million  of  the Group's  procurement  (e.g.  supplies  of  carrier  bags  and hygiene  and  amenity  products  for  passengers,  laundry, maintenance  of  printers  and  scanners,  maintenance  of industrial  equipment).  Air  France  maintains  long-term partnership  relations,  thus  enabling  these  companies  to develop  in  a  sustainable  context.  Since  the  2000s, Air France  has  been  developing  one  of  the  most important  support  initiatives  in  the  national  territory  for workers  with  disabilities  by  using  the  STPA (Secteur  du Travail Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 et Adapt \u00e9) for multiple projects.\n\n## Contribution to community projects\n\nIn 2023, Air France-KLM  allocated  \u20ac6.8  million  to supporting  NGOs  and  other  social  and  environmental initiatives.  In  2023,  KLM  allocated  \u20ac591,000  to  support various NGOs  and  other  social  and  environmental initiatives.",

Air France-KLM Procurement department  supports  the  Group's  sustainability  strategy by  implementing a sourcing process that aims to select more sustainable products, services and business partners  that  align  with  its  Environmental,  Social,  and Governance  (ESG)  ambitions.  Procurement  department recognizes  that  it  has  a  significant  impact  on  the sustainability  performance  of  its  supplier  base  and  can play  a  crucial  role  in  the  shift  towards  supply  chain transparency and Net Zero emissions.\n\nThe  procurement  department  plays  a  crucial  role  in Air France-KLM's  sustainability  efforts,  particularly  in reducing  its  carbon  footprint.  Fuel  purchasing  accounts for  approximately  40%  of  the  company's  expenditure, with  a  strong  focus  on  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel  (SAF) procurement.  Additionally,  the  company  explores  other opportunities for responsible purchasing, including aircraft  maintenance  and  components,  airport  handling, cargo trucking and onboard products.\n\nThe  foundation  of  the  Group's  sustainable  procurement strategy  is  a  risk-based  approach.  The  procurement department  actively  screens  its  suppliers  and  identifies Sustainability High-Risk Suppliers and Critical Suppliers as the  Group's  primary  focus  in  its  commitment  to  supply chain due diligence. Critical Suppliers are those on which the  company  relies  heavily  for  its  business  continuity, while Sustainability High-Risk Suppliers are those associated  with  elevated  ESG  risk  levels,  including environmental, societal and ethical factors.\n\nTo  mitigate  and  avoid  risks,  Sustainability  High-Risk Suppliers  are  required  to  conduct  assessments  of  their ESG performance. The procurement department increasingly  engages  with  Critical  Suppliers  to  do  the same. In conjunction with the mandatory signature of the Air France-KLM Supplier (Sustainability) Code of Conduct (sCoC),  these  targeted  assessments  constitute  the  basic compliance that the Group expects from its suppliers. The procurement  department  encourages  all  suppliers  to conduct  such  assessments  on  a  voluntary  basis  and  go beyond  (legal)  compliance  to  promote  supply-chain transparency.\n\nAir France-KLM's procurement department aims to make sustainable procurement  more  than  a  box-ticking exercise  and  actively  seeks  to  engage  with  suppliers  as sustainable business partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\n## Focusing on scope 3 emissions: purchased goods and services\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group's  Scope  3  mapping  exercise  revealed that  a  significant  portion  of  the  company's  Scope  3 emissions  are  due  to  Category  1  'purchased  goods  and services',  primarily  related  to  jet  fuel  procurement.  The Air France-KLM group has reported on Scope 3 for its 1 jet fuel purchases  for  several years. The  other  main contributors  to  this  Category  1  are  road  haulage  in support of Air France-KLM cargo operations (Road Feeder Services RFS), in-flight catering and aircraft components.\n\nThe knowledge and data gathered during the 2023 Scope 3 pilots will be used to develop Air France-KLM's Scope 3 roadmap in 2024 and to set a Scope 3 target for 2025.\n\n## Responsible procurement embedded in the sourcing process\n\nAir France-KLM has embedded a responsible procurement policy in its sourcing process to ensure that sustainability considerations are taken into account when selecting suppliers. Given the wide range of products and services, and the diverse nature of suppliers, this policy is implemented at both a generic and specific level.\n\n- \u25a0 During the supplier registration process, Procurement sends  a  questionnaire  to  suppliers  to  assess  their commitment to sustainability. Suppliers are required to sign the Air France-KLM Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct  or  to  have  signed  up  for  the  UN  Global Compact. This is a mandatory step, as outlined in our Sustainable Procurement policy. In addition, suppliers are  asked  if  they  have  completed  an  EcoVadis assessment or are willing to do so.\n- \u25a0 The  Supplier  Sustainability  Code  of  Conduct  can  be included as an appendix to a contract, either a Master Service  Agreement  or  another.  Tender  documents include criteria enabling the evaluation of the environmental impact of the product or service, which is  considered  during  the  evaluation  of  the  different supplier  proposals.  These  criteria  will  vary  depending on  the  product  or  service  that  is  purchased  and  may include  but  are  not  limited  to:  the  distance  of  the delivery  or  travel;  the  option  of  electrically-powered machinery, vehicles, and the source of the energy used; CO2 emissions, environmental footprint in general; the weight of products that are fitted or used onboard and thus the impact on Scope 1 emissions.\n- \u25a0 In addition, assessments on the total cost of ownership cost  and  life  cycle  analysis  are  increasingly  used  in procurement, although these are not standard practice for all the products and services purchased. In 2023, a pilot was conducted with Engineering and Maintenance  (E&M)  component  services  to  factor  in CO2  as  part  of  a  Total  Cost  of  Ownership  (TCO) approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our sustainable procurement policy is published on the public supplier portal to ensure transparency  and  accountability.  https://procurement. airfranceklm.com/procurement/en/pageStandard/home page.html.\n\n## Supplier screening and assessment\n\nTo  manage  and  verify  the  sustainability  of  our  supplier base,  we  use  the  services  of  EcoVadis.  This  evidencebased  online  platform  provides  supplier  sustainability ratings  that  enable  the  Air  France-KLM  Procurement department  to  assess  the  ESG  performance  of  its suppliers worldwide.\n\nSuppliers  are  screened  using  a  risk  mapping  system based on our procurement categories, which links these categories  to  the  UN  ISIC  categories  and  their  ESG  risk levels. Suppliers that are identified as having an elevated sustainability risk level are required  to  conduct  a sustainability assessment with EcoVadis.\n\nThe  sustainability  assessments  cover  four  key  themes: Environment, Labor and Human Rights, Business Ethics, and Sustainable Procurement. Air France-KLM maintains a compliance  threshold  in  terms  of  a  minimum assessment  score  that  our  targeted  suppliers  must achieve to qualify as a sustainable business partner.\n\nVendors  that  score  below  the  required  minimum  are requested  to  implement  a  corrective  action  plan  and undergo a re-assessment that results in a compliant score within one year.\n\n## Buyer engagement\n\nBuyer  engagement  is  critical  for  Air  France-KLM  to achieve  its  ESG  ambitions  and  commitments.  All  buyers must sign a Code of Ethics that outlines the ethical rules they  must  follow  when  dealing  with  suppliers.  In compliance  with  anti-bribery  legislation,  buyers  are required to undergo anti-corruption/ethics training every other year.\n\nThe  role  of  the  buyer  is  evolving,  with  sustainability requirements being integrated into the sourcing process. To support this transformation, the Procurement Academy  was  launched  in  2021,  offering  online  training courses  for  buyers  and  other  procurement  staff.  The training covers various sustainability topics, and there are onboarding  modules  for  new  buyers.  This  reflects  the priority  placed  on  sustainability  by  procurement  and supports  the  objective  of  incorporating  sustainability further into sourcing.\n\nAs  public  demands  on  the  aviation  industry  grow, procurement  must  stay  on  top  of  the  rapidly-changing developments in sustainability. The Procurement department  is  encouraged  to  attend  workshops  and training on various sustainability topics, such as EcoVadis, Climate Fresk, Carbon Disclosure Project, circular plastics\n\nand  upcoming  regulatory  changes  such  as  CSRD  and CSDDD. The Procurement department also hosts regular sustainable procurement awareness sessions and training on  request.  Sustainability  news  and  specific  news  about sustainability  in  procurement  are  shared  in  a  monthly Air France-KLM newsletter, called Newsfeed.\n\nTo  ensure  the  alignment  of  the  processes,  policies  and execution, bi-monthly meetings of the combined Dutch/ French procurement teams are held. As new regulations and  legislation  impact  procurement,  the  Group  must adapt  its  policies  and  report  on  the  related  policies  and results.  It  is  crucial  to  continue  to  prioritize  sustainability in procurement  and  empower  buyers  to  make  a difference.\n\n## Driving responsible supplier engagement\n\nThe Air France-KLM Procurement department recognizes the importance of supplier engagement in achieving the Group's ESG goals. To drive responsible supplier engagement, the following initiatives have been implemented:\n\n- \u25a0 Sustainable  procurement  standards:  In  May  2023, Air  France-KLM  joined  forces  with  other  airlines  to launch the Sustainable Airlines Initiative (SAI). Together with  EcoVadis,  the  member  airlines  aim  to  introduce similar  standards  for  responsible  procurement.  The initiative  will  increase  supply  chain  transparency  and support  the  transition  of  the  airline  industry  towards sustainability;\n- \u25a0 Carbon  Disclosure  Project  (CDP)  Climate  Module Assessment:  A  selected  group  of  the  108  highest greenhouse gas emitting suppliers have been asked to do a Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) climate module assessment. This assessment helps to understand our suppliers'  environmental  impact  and  identify  areas where Air France-KLM and suppliers can work together to reduce the carbon footprint;\n- \u25a0 Sustainable  Flight  Challenge:  As  also  discussed  in chapter 4.3.1 paragraph 'Engaging our Customers and Partners'.  Over  200  different  suppliers  supported  the challenge, providing circular on-board products, lightweight materials,  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel  (SAF), IT  solutions,  and  more  to  reduce  the  environmental footprint of a flight. At the awards ceremony in Atlanta on October 3 and 4, 2023, Air France won several prizes, including  'Best  Collaboration'  for  the  Olga  project  to decarbonize  airport  activities,  'Easiest-to-Implement Solution'  for  the  autonomous  tractor,  and  'Best  R&D' for  its  study  of  non-CO2  effects  and  the  testing  of  a solution to avoid condensation trails.\n\nThrough these initiatives, the Air France-KLM Procurement department aims to work with suppliers as sustainable business partners based on mutual trust and collaboration.  By  increasing  supply  chain  transparency, promoting  sustainable procurement  standards  and driving innovation and development.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nSocietal value\n\n## Encouraging supplier diversity\n\nThe Air France-KLM Procurement department is committed  to  encouraging  supplier  diversity  through various  partnerships  and  initiatives,  as  demonstrated  by the following examples in 2023:\n\n- \u25a0 I  Am  Skyhop  Global:  This  is  the  only  women-owned crew  ground  transportation  business,  with  75%  of  the senior staff being women, and representing 20 different nationalities;\n- \u25a0 AAB In Flight: This partnership with the World Business Class  chocolate  supplier  involves  chocolate  being packaged by employees from the sheltered sector;\n- \u25a0 Dienst Justiti\u00eble Inrichtingen: This initiative involves the packaging  of  porcelain by prisoners, promoting rehabilitation and social reintegration;\n- \u25a0 Air  France-KLM  uses  companies  in  the  sheltered  and adapted  sector  that  give  priority  to  handicapped people  for  multiple  projects  (e.g.  upkeep  of  green spaces  at  some  sites,  shipment  of  packages  of uniforms,  packaging  of  headphones  used  on  board, laundering of on -board linen) and by entrusting them with highly -critical services.\n\nBy  encouraging  supplier  diversity,  the  Air  France-KLM Procurement  department  aims  to  promote  social  and cultural inclusion and support disadvantaged groups.\n\n## On board catering\n\nThe Air France-KLM Procurement department recognizes the  environmental  impact  of  on-board  catering  and continues  to  focus  on  catering  products  and  related materials  to  load,  serve  and  preserve  meals  on  board, such  as  trays,  cutlery,  trolleys  and  packaging.  These products  have  a  multidimensional  sustainability  impact, and  weight  is  a  specific  issue  in  aviation,  leading  to additional emissions during flights. There are times when straightforward sustainability considerations on the ground  may  not  apply  in  the  air.  To  address  these challenges, KLM In-flight Services Procurement department uses a Life Cycle Analysis approach to make well-founded  sourcing  decisions,  resulting  in  visible changes such as using washable, reusable dishware and changing the packaging of salt and pepper.\n\nIn  addition  to  reducing  its  environmental  impact,  the Group  is  committed  to  offering  customers  a  more environmentally-friendly service while ensuring the choice and origin of food. Air France-KLM sources locally and seasonally, offering meat, dairy products and eggs of\n\n100% French and Dutch origin and fish from sustainable fisheries.  The  Group selects products with internationally recognized  labels  such  as  AOC/PDO  and  AB  and  is  a member of the Responsible  Soy  (RTRS)  and  Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Round Table, offering certified products such  as  MSC  and  ASC  certified  fish,  'better  life'  eggs, chicken,  and  veal,  and  UTZ-certified  coffee,  tea  and chocolate.  Hot  dishes  served  in  the  Economy  and Premium  Economy  classes  have  an  A  or  B  Nutri-Score, and  dishes  for  babies  and  children  are  exclusively composed of organically grown food.\n\nIn line with the societal trend towards plant-based diets, Servair  offers  a  choice  of  casserole  dish  with  or  without animal  protein  for  hot  meals.  In  2022,  Servair  produced vegetarian  services  for  all  classes  on  Air  France  flights, unless otherwise requested by passengers. Since January 2018,  all  egg  supplies  have  come  from  free-range  hens, and by 2025, suppliers have committed to stop producing or buying eggs from battery hens. In 2022, the supply rate of egg products from non-battery hens was 8% and 100% of shell eggs were from free-range hens. Servair has also committed  to  sourcing  broiler  chicken  from  farms  and slaughterhouses that meet all the criteria of the European Chicken  commitment  for  all  the  European  activities  by 2026,  with  at  least  20%  of  these  volumes  coming  from farms  guaranteeing  access  to  the  open  air  or  a  winter garden for airline catering in France.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nBy  2023,  the  Air  France-KLM  Procurement  department had  made  significant  progress  on  engaging  with  its existing suppliers, with 79% of all Air France-KLM suppliers now having signed the Supplier Code of Conduct, up from 53% last year. Additionally, the total number of companies evaluated  and  assessed  by  EcoVadis  was  431  in  2023, exceeding  the  target  of  392.  For  2024,  the  aim  is  to surpass  the  growth  for  our  EcoVadis  portfolio  that  was achieved in 2023.\n\nAir  France-KLM  Procurement's  sustainable  procurement initiatives testify to the Group's commitment  to responsible  sourcing  and  supplier  engagement,  which have  resulted  in  increased  supplier  participation  and evaluation.  By  maintaining  an  ongoing  dialogue  with suppliers  and  requiring  them  to  uphold  the  Supplier Sustainability  Code  of  Conduct,  the  Air  France-KLM Procurement  department  aims  to  drive  positive  change across its supply chain and achieve its sustainability goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As required by the Act, the Air France-KLM group has  also  implemented  measures  concerning  its  supply chain  through  the  updating  of  its  Supplier  Sustainable Code of Conduct in 2023 and is improving the suppliers' evaluation process using a risk-based approach (through a  screening  tool,  a  questionnaire,  a  third  party  due diligence  procedure  and  an  assessment  by  external providers such as EcoVadis).\n\n## Identification and regular risk evaluation procedures\n\nThe  identification  and  evaluation  of  the  various  risks relating to the duty of vigilance are part of the overall risk management process established within the Air FranceKLM  group.  As  a  facilitator  of  risk  management,  Group Internal  Audit  regularly  evaluates  the  risk  management process and its conclusions are the subject of presentations  to  the  Air  France-KLM  Group  Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group's  overall  sub-contracting management system applies to all risk areas. It is based on contract reviews, compliance monitoring and supervisory  acts  such  as  audits,  inspections  and  checks, carried  out  internally  by  the  sub-contractors  themselves where  appropriate  or  with  external  providers  (as  part  of the EcoVadis screening on social rights, the environment and sustainable procurement).\n\nEvery  year,  the  Group  conducts  a  review  of  the  nonfinancial  risks  generated  by  its  activities.  This  analysis verifies  the  relevance  and  comprehensiveness  of  the measures  and  action  plans  aimed  at  the  effective prevention,  control  and  mitigation  of  the  non-financial risks deemed to be the most material.\n\nSee  also  Chapter  3  'Risks  and  risk  management'  and section 4.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities for building long-term relationships'.\n\n## Measures deployed to prevent and mitigate the risks and monitoring mechanisms\n\nThe Air France-KLM group's policy enshrines the respect of  fundamental  rights  as  established  in  the  leading\n\ninternational  principles:  the  Universal  Declaration  of Human  Rights,  the  International  Labor  Organization's (ILO)  Declaration  on  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights at Work, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) guiding principles.\n\nAir  France-KLM  has  been  a  signatory  of  the  United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and is committed to respecting and promoting its ten Principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. This undertaking  is reaffirmed each  year  by  the Air  France-KLM  group's  top  management  bodies.  The Air France-KLM group requests its suppliers to respect the same standards themselves and within their own supply chain.\n\nThe  duty  of  vigilance  is  a  multi-risk  approach.  The management of risks is at the heart of the steering of the Air  France-KLM  group's  business  activities,  based  on  a rationale  of  prevention  and  homogeneous management via common methods and tools.\n\n## Human rights and fundamental liberties\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  Principles  published  in  July  2020 reaffirm the Group's commitment to fostering a climate of mutual  trust  and  respect  amongst  staff  and  ensuring  a safe  working  environment.  The  Group  undertakes  to apply the labor legislation of the European Union and its Member  States  and  all  national  collective  agreements, and to respect the exercise of trade union rights in all the relevant countries. The Group  also undertakes to scrupulously  respect  human  rights,  oppose  child  and forced labor, apply laws and ask its service providers and suppliers to uphold these principles.\n\nIn  view  of  its  organization,  the  Group  delegates  to  its subsidiaries the responsibility of respecting and promoting the content of these commitments locally, in the  respect  of  the  national  provisions  and  legislation specific to each country.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  also  sections  4.2  'Human Resources'  and  4.5.2  'Organization  and  key  elements  of ethics and compliance programs'.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nFor  Air  France-KLM,  the  health  and  safety  of  both customers and staff is an absolute priority.\n\nFlight  Safety  is  paramount  for  the  Group.  It  is  key  to retaining  the  trust  of  customers  and  imperative  for  the long-term  viability  of  its  operations.  All  the  Group's operations  are  the  subject  of  multiple  checks  and certifications, and comply with extremely strict norms and the highest standards in the industry.\n\nEach Group airline deploys a Safety Management System, which is integral to their business organizations, processes and corporate cultures.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  Chapter  3  'Risks  and  risk management' and section 4.4 'Customer trust'.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRA -FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT\n\nSocietal value\n\nSafeguarding  health  and  safety  in  the  workplace  is  a human  priority  to  which  the  Group  responds  by preventing vocational  risks  and  improving  the  quality  of life in the workplace.\n\nFor more information, see section 4.2 'Human resources'.\n\nThe Group must guarantee its customers and flight crew safe catering services and, to this end, has implemented a Food  Hygiene  and  Safety  process  to  respond  to  the regulatory  requirements  linked  to  the  preparation  and supply of meals.\n\nFor more information, see section 4.4 'Customer trust'.\n\n## Environment\n\nAir  France-KLM's  Climate  Action  Plan  sets  forth  the Group's  strategy  and  the  main  priorities  in  terms  of reducing its impact on climate change. In November 2019, the  Group  unveiled  its  global  strategy  through  to  2025, based on environmental sustainability.\n\nThe  Air  France  and  KLM  Environmental  Management Systems  (EMS)  aim  to  prevent  and  mitigate  the environmental impacts of their operations. These Environmental  Management  Systems  have  ISO  14001 certification  and  internal  and  external  audits  enable  the verification of their effective deployment.\n\nIn 2019, the Group adopted the format recommended by the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)  for  the  management  of  financial  risks  linked  to climate change (TCFD concordance table, section 4.1.1).\n\nFor  more  information,  see  section  4.3  'Addressing  the impact on the Environment'.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nIn its relations with  sub-contractors  and  suppliers, Air  France-KLM  ensures  that  the  fundamental  social rights  and  principles,  and  environmental  protection provisions,  are  properly  respected  everywhere  in  the world.\n\nA  supplier  selection  process  has  been  implemented  to respond  to  the  duty  of  vigilance  requirements.  To  this end,  Air  France-KLM's  Procurement  function  provides awareness-raising  training  on  these  risks.  A  compliance training  program  for  new  members of  the  Procurement teams of Air France and KLM was carried out in 2022.\n\nA risk-mapping process is in place with, for each segment and procurement domain, an evaluation of the environmental,  social  and  ethical  risks.  Risks  are  also evaluated by country.\n\nFor all new contracts or contract renewals, the signature of  the  Supplier  Sustainability  Code  of  Conduct  or  an equivalent commitment covering the four areas (environment, social, ethical and supply chain) is mandatory and is included in the contract's appendix. In case of deviation, the legal department or the Compliance Officer may be called on to provide guidance.\n\nIn  the  segments  most  exposed  to  risks,  suppliers  are asked  to  submit  an  evaluation  of  their  sustainability performance, carried out by a specialized organization or the  equivalent.  It  is  mandatory  for  this  evaluation  to address  four  areas:  environment,  social,  ethics,  supply chain.  The  'Supplier  supply  chain'  section  provides visibility for tier 2 suppliers.\n\nSuppliers failing to reach an acceptable level are required to put in place a remedial action plan. Independent in-situ audits may also be triggered.\n\nIndependently  of  the  level  of  risk,  all  suppliers  are encouraged to have their CSR performance evaluated.\n\nIn  2023,  at  the  Group's  request,  431  suppliers  had  their sustainability performance evaluated.\n\n## Listening to stakeholders and whistle blower mechanism\n\nOn  a  regular  basis,  Air  France-KLM  realizes  a  new materiality analysis by questioning a representative panel of  internal  and  external  stakeholders.  The  comparison of these results with those of the analysis carried out in 2019 enabled confirmation of the relevance of Air France-KLM's strategic choices in the light of the issues deemed to be priorities  for  its  activities  and  the  expectations  of  its stakeholders.\n\nSeveral processes enable the Group to regularly evaluate the perception of its stakeholders and to understand the related  risks.  The  Group  also  has  a  number  of  feedback channels  in  place  enabling  stakeholders  (particularly employees, customers and local residents around airports) to communicate any complaints.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  section  4.1.2  'Identification  of the key priorities for building long-term relationships'.\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  updated  the  scope  of  its speak-up policies, internal whistle-blower procedures and mechanisms to enable employees to report any situations arising  within  the  scope  of  the  applicable  legislation, including the Act of March 27, 2017, relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  also  section  4.5  'Ethics  and compliance'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\n## Year ended December 31 st 2023\n\nTo the annual general meeting,\n\nIn  our  capacity  as  Statutory  Auditor  of  your  company, (hereinafter the 'Entity') appointed as independent third party, and  accredited  by  the  French  Accreditation Committee  (COFRAC)  under  number  3-1884 (1) ,  we  have undertaken  a  limited  assurance  engagement  on  the historical  information  (observed  or  extrapolated)  in  the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared in accordance with the entity's procedures (hereinafter the \"Guidelines\"),  for  the  year  ended  December  31 st , 2023 (hereinafter, the \"Information\"  and  the  \"Statement\" respectively),  presented  in  the  Group's  management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles  L.  225  102-1,  R.  225-105  and  R.  225-105-1  of  the French Commercial Code ( code de commerc e).\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  entity,  we  also  performed  work designed  to  express  a  reasonable  assurance  conclusion on  the  information  selected  by  the  entity  and  identified by the sign \u221a.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased  on  the  procedures  we  performed  as  described under  the  \"Nature  and  scope  of  procedures\"  paragraph and the evidence we obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial  statement  is  not  prepared  in  accordance with  the  applicable  regulatory  provisions  and  that  the Information,  taken  as  a  whole,  is  not  presented  fairly  in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Reasonable assurance conclusion on a selection of non-financial information\n\nIn our opinion, the information selected by the entity and identified  with  the  symbol \u221a in the Statement has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Comment\n\nWithout  modifying  our  conclusion  and  in  accordance with Article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following comment:\n\n- \u25a0 as  explained  in  section  \"4.1.2  Identification  of  the  key priorities  for  building  long-term  relationships\",  as  part of  the  update  of  its  risk  identification  and  ranking process,  the  entity  has  identified  the  new  following risks  \"Affordability  of  services\",  \"Corporate  culture  and ESG  Values\",  \"Political  engagement  and  lobbying activities\"  and  \"Transparency  with  Stakeholders\",  for which policies will be developed in 2024.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe  absence  of  a  commonly  used  generally  accepted reporting framework  or  of a significant body  of established  practices  on  which  to  draw  to  evaluate  and measure  the  Information  allows  for  different, but acceptable,  measurement  techniques  that  can  affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently,  the  Information  needs  to  be  read  and understood together with the Guidelines, summarized in the Statement and available on the Entity's website or on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Inherent limitations in preparing the Information\n\nThe  Information  may  be  subject  to  uncertainty  inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality  of  external  data  used.  Some  information  is sensitive to the choice of methodology  and  the assumptions  or  estimates  used  for  its  preparation  and presented in the Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  variation  is explained  by  the  combined  effect  of  the  Group's capacity  growth  (ASK  9.5%)  and  the  decline  in  the average  price  of  jet  fuel  over  the  year  (Jet  CIF  NWE -19.4%),  while  the  effect  of  fuel  hedging  was  neutral, unlike  the  previous  year  when  it  was  largely  positive (+968 million dollars);\n- \u25a0 sustainable aviation fuel: these expenses correspond to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) purchased in particular under the French SAF incorporation mandate and the SAF  contracts  made  to  corporate  customers  for  their passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  increase  in  demand from these customers is the main reason for the rise in expenses;\n- \u25a0 CO2 quotas: these expenses correspond to purchases of CO2 emission quotas,  and  are  rising  due  to  increased capacity and higher quota prices;\n- \u25a0 chartering  costs:  the  costs  incurred  in  leasing  aircraft capacity from other airlines.  The  costs  have  increased significantly in 2023 (+42.4%) in order to meet demand;\n- \u25a0 landing  fees  and  en-route  charges:  these  costs  are incurred  for  air  navigation  services  and  the  use  of airports.  Their  increase  relative  to  2023  (+11.6%)  is slightly  higher  than  that  of  the  capacity  produced  by the  Group,  due  to  fare  increases  applied  at  certain airports;\n- \u25a0 catering  costs:  these  costs  comprise  the  services supplied  on  board  the  Air  France-KLM  group's  own aircraft. They increased by 15.1% compared to last year, due to capacity increases and inflationary pressures;\n- \u25a0 handling charges and other operating costs: principally cover aircraft handling on the ground and the cost of passenger  care  for  the  Group  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, third-party  customers.  The  increase  in  these  costs (+15.4%) is mainly explained by the increase in capacity and by inflationary pressures;\n- \u25a0 aircraft  maintenance costs: they include maintenance procurement and consumption for the Group's aircraft and for the third-party activity; their increase is linked to the increase in internal and third-party activities;\n- \u25a0 commercial and distribution costs: these costs increased  by  16.0%,  significantly  more  than  capacity due  to  a  base  effect  as  marketing  costs  had  been extremely  limited  in  2022,  and  higher  credit  card commissions linked to higher ticket prices;\n- \u25a0 other  external  expenses  principally  comprise  rental charges,  telecommunications  costs,  insurance  and fees.  Their  level,  increased  by  considerably  less  than capacity thanks to cost saving initiatives.\n\nSalaries and related costs were up by 18.7% to \u20ac8.7 billion versus \u20ac7.3 billion in 2022.\n\nThis  variation  is  explained  firstly  by  the  various  salary measures  allocated  to  all  employee  categories  in  a context of high inflation, but also in France by the end of the Long-Term Partial Activity (APLD) at the end of 2022, added to that, the increase in activity for flight crews. In addition,  the  capital  increase  reserved  for  employees carried out at the end of 2023 generated 35 million euros in personnel costs.\n\nTaxes  other  than  income  taxes  stood  at  \u20ac164  million  in 2023 versus \u20ac156 million in 2022, up by 5.1%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAs  used  herein,  the  term  'Air  France-KLM'  refers  to Air France-KLM SA, a limited liability company organized under French law. The term 'Group' is represented by the economic definition of Air France-KLM and its subsidiaries. The Group is headquartered in France and is one of the largest airlines in the world.\n\nThe  Group's  core  business  is  network  activities  which includes  passenger  transportation  on  scheduled  flights and  cargo  activities.  The  Group's  activities  also  include aeronautics maintenance, leisure passenger transportation (Transavia)  and  other  air-transport-related activities.\n\nThe limited company Air France-KLM, domiciled at 7, rue du cirque 75008 Paris - France, is the parent company of the  Air  France-KLM  Group.  Air  France-KLM  is  listed  for trading in Paris (Euronext) and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\nThe  presentation  currency  used  in  the  Group's  financial statements  is  the  Euro,  which  is  also  Air  France-KLM's functional currency.\n\n## 1.1 Accounting principles\n\n## Accounting principles and policies used for the consolidated financial statements\n\nPursuant to the European Regulation 1606-2002 of July 19, 2002,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the Air  France-KLM  group  as  of  December  31,  2023  were established in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as adopted by the European Union on the date these consolidated financial statements were established.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  28,  2024  and submitted to the Annual General Meeting for its approval on 5 June 2024.\n\n## Change in accounting principles\n\n## IFRS standards which are applicable on a mandatory basis to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## Amendments to IAS1 'Presentation of Financial Statements'\n\nThese  amendments  'Disclosure  of  Material  Accounting Policy Information' aim to identify the useful information that  need  to  be  provided  to  users  regarding  the accounting principles. The main change is to disclose the material  accounting  policy  information  instead  of  the 'significant' accounting policies.\n\nInformation  on  the  accounting  policies  are  material  if, when  you  consider  it in conjunction with other information in the financial  statements  of  the  entity,  we can reasonably expect it  will  influence  the  decisions  the mains  users of general purpose of the financial statements will take based on these financial statements.\n\nThe Group carried out a review of the financial statements and the notes to make sure that the material accounting policies are correctly presented.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors'\n\nThese amendments 'Definition of Accounting Estimates' aim  to  facilitate  the  distinction  between  accounting policies  and  accounting  estimates.  However,  they  focus exclusively  on  accounting  estimates  now  defined  as 'monetary  amounts  in  the  financial  statements  that  are subject to measurement uncertainty'.\n\nThe main material judgements and accounting estimates are  described  in  note  1.2  'Material  judgements  and accounting estimates'.\n\n## OECD Pillar Two model rules\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  is  within  the  scope  of  the OECD  Pillar  Two  model  rules.  Pillar  Two  legislation  was enacted  in  France,  the  jurisdiction  in  which  Air  FranceKLM  is  incorporated,  and  has  come  into  effect  from January  1,  2024.  Since  the  Pillar  Two  legislation  was  not effective at the reporting date, the Group has no related current tax exposure. The Group applies the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendment to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.\n\nDue  to  the  complexities  in  applying  the  legislation  and calculating GloBE income, the quantitative impact of the enacted  legislation  is  not  yet  reasonably  estimable. Although  the  effective  tax  rate  is  below  15%  in  certain jurisdictions,  the  group  might  not  be  exposed  to  paying Pillar Two income taxes due to adjustments asked in the legislation (such as ignoring recognition or derecognition of deferred tax assets) which give rise to different effective tax  rates  compared  to  those  calculated  in  accordance with IAS 12.\n\nThe Group is currently evaluating how the legislation will apply to its operations and and expects OECD guidelines specific to the international air transport industry. In this regard,  the  group  expects  that  almost  all  the  Group jurisdictions will benefit from the transitional safe harbor provisions in the coming years and beyond the transition period,  the  Group  doesn't  expect  to  be  significantly exposed to top-up tax expenses.\n\n## Other amendments or IFRS standards\n\nThe  mandatory  amendments  or  IFRS  standards  for  the financial  statements  2023,  which  are  not  mentioned  in this  paragraph  are  considered  as  non  applicable  or without significant impact on the Air France-KLM Group financial statements.\n\n## IFRS standards applicable in the future\n\nThe impact of the application of standards and applications respectively published by IASB (International Accounting  Standards  Board)  and  IFRS  IC  (International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee) not yet effective  as  of  December  31,  2023  is expected to be non significant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  companies  over  which  the  Group exercises  control  are  fully  consolidated.  An  entity  is controlled when the Group has power over it, is exposed or  has  rights  to  variable  returns  from  its  involvement  in this entity, and has the ability to use its power to influence the  amounts  of  these  returns.  The  determination  of control  takes  into  account  the  existence  of  potential\n\nvoting rights if they are substantive, meaning they can be exercised  in  time  when  decisions  about  the  relevant activities of the entity need to be taken.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  are  included  in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control begins until the date this control ceases.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented within equity and on the income  statement  separately  from  Group stockholders'  equity  and  the  Group's  net  income,  under the line 'non-controlling interests'.\n\nThe  effects  of  a  buyout  of  non-controlling  interests  in  a subsidiary already controlled by the Group and divestment  of  a  percentage  interest  without  loss  of control are recognized in equity.\n\nIn  a  partial  disposal  resulting  in  loss  of  control,  the retained equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the date of loss of control. The gain or loss on the disposal will include the effect of this re-measurement and the gain or loss  on  the  sale  of  the  equity  interest,  including  all  the items initially recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit and loss.\n\n## Interest in associates and joint ventures\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  11  'Joint  Arrangements',  the Group  applies  the  equity  method  to  partnerships  over which  it  exercises  control  jointly  with  one  or  more partners. Control is considered to be joint when decisions about the relevant activities of the partnership require the unanimous  consent  of  the  Group  and  the  other  parties with whom control is shared.\n\nIn cases of a joint activity, the Group recognizes assets and liabilities  in  proportion  to  its  rights  and  obligations regarding the entity.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 28 'Investments in Associates and Joint  Ventures',  companies  in  which  the  Group  has  the ability  to  exercise  significant  influence  over  financial  and operating  policy  decisions  are  also  accounted  for  using the  equity  method.  The  ability  to  exercise  significant influence  is  presumed  to  exist  when  the  Group  holds more than 20% of the voting rights.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Group's share  in  the  net  result  of  associates  and  joint  ventures from the date the ability to exercise significant influence begins  until  the  date  it  ceases,  adjusted  for  any impairment loss of net investment.\n\nThe Group's share of losses of an associate exceeding the value  of  the  Group's  interest  and  net  investment  (longterm receivables for which no reimbursement  is scheduled  or  likely)  in  this  entity  are  not  accounted  for, unless the Group has:\n\n- \u25a0 incurred contractual obligations to recover losses; or\n- \u25a0 made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nAny surplus in investment cost over the Group's share in the  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and contingent  liabilities  of  the  associate  company  on  the date  of  acquisition  is  accounted  for  as  goodwill  and included in the book value of the investment accounted for using the equity method.",

Profits  and  losses  resulting  from  intra-Group transactions are also eliminated.\n\nGains and losses realized on internal sales with associates and  jointly-controlled  entities  are  eliminated,  to  the extent of the Group's interest in the entity, providing there is no impairment.\n\n## Translation of foreign companies' financial statements\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  foreign  subsidiaries  are translated into euros on the following basis:\n\n- \u25a0 except  for  the  equity  for  which  historical  prices  are applied,  balance  sheet  items  are  converted  on  the basis of the foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the closing date;\n- \u25a0 the income statement and the statement of cash flows are  converted  on  the  basis  of  the  average  foreign currency exchange rates for the period;\n- \u25a0 the resulting foreign currency exchange adjustment is recorded in the 'Translation adjustments' item within equity;\n- \u25a0 goodwill  is  converted  into  euros  using  the  foreign exchange rate in effect at the closing date.\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign  currency  transactions  are  translated  using  the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  rate  in  effect  at  the closing date.\n\nNon-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in foreign currencies assessed on a historical cost basis are translated using the rate in effect at the transaction date or the hedging rate, when applicable.\n\nThe corresponding exchange rate differences are recorded in the income statement. Changes in fair value of  the  hedging  instruments  are  recorded  using  the accounting treatment described in Note 35 'Financial risk management'.\n\n## 1.4 Alternative performance measures\n\nEBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization):  by  excluding  the  main  line  of  the  income statement  which  does  not  involve  cash  disbursement ('Amortization, depreciation and provision') from income from  current  operations,  EBITDA  provides  a  simple\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nindicator  of  the  cash  generated  by  the  Group's  current operational  activities.  It  is  thus  commonly  used  for  the calculation of the financial coverage and enterprise value ratios (see 'Consolidated income statement').\n\nOperating  free  cash  flow: this  corresponds  to  the  net cash flow from operating activities net of the purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, plus the  proceeds  on  the  disposal  of  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets. It does not include the other cash  flows  linked  to  investment  operations, particularly investments in subsidiaries and other financial assets and net cash flow from the operating activities of discontinued  operations  (see  Note  37.1  'Operating  free cash flow').\n\nOperating free cash flow adjusted: this  corresponds  to operating free cash flow net of the payment of lease debts (see Note 37.1 'Operating free cash flow').\n\nDistinction  between  income  from  current  operation and  income  from  operating  activities: the  Group considers  it  relevant  to  the  understanding  of  its  financial performance to present in the income statement a subtotal within the 'income from operating activities'. This subtotal, entitled 'Income from current operations', excludes unusual elements  that  do  not  have  predictive  value  due  to  their nature, frequency and/or materiality, as defined in recommendation No. 2020-01 from the France's accounting standards authority.\n\nSuch elements are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 sales of aircraft equipment and significant disposals of other assets;\n- \u25a0 accelerated aircraft phase-out;\n- \u25a0 income from the disposal of subsidiaries and affiliates;\n- \u25a0 restructuring costs when they are significant;\n- \u25a0 modification of pension plans;\n- \u25a0 significant  and  infrequent  elements  such  as  the recognition  of  badwill  in  the  income  statement,  the recording  of  an  impairment  loss  on  goodwill  and significant provisions for litigation.\n\nNet debt: this corresponds to the amount of the Group's financial liabilities less net cash (see Note 32 'Net debt').\n\nFinancial liabilities include:\n\n- \u25a0 current  and  non-current  financial  liabilities  (excluding accrued interests);\n- \u25a0 current and non-current lease debt (excluding accrued interests);\n- \u25a0 deposits related to financial liabilities and lease debt;\n- \u25a0 derivatives impact on debt.\n\n## Net cash include:\n\n- \u25a0 cash and cash equivalents;\n- \u25a0 marketable securities over 3 months;\n- \u25a0 nonds investments;\n- \u25a0 Bank overdraft.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Attitudes  towards  the  acceptability  of  air  transport  are evolving both at the political level and in society at large. France  and  the  Netherlands  have  implemented  policies aimed  at  ensuring  the  transition  to  a  carbon-neutral society by 2050, in line with the European Union's strategy in  this  domain,  reflected  in  the  commitments  made  by Air  France  as  part  of  France's  Strat\u00e9gie  Nationale  Bas Carbone (SNBC) and by KLM to the Dutch government.\n\nThe Air France-KLM Group and its airlines intend to be key players in the sustainable transformation of their activities, and aim to take a leading role and influence in the decarbonization of air transport.\n\nAir  France-KLM  plays  an  active  role  in  advancing  the ambition  of  Net  Zero  emissions  by  2050  as  an  industry, and is committed to science-based targets in line with the SBTi  criteria  approved  in  November  2022.  The  Group's environmental efforts are summarized in a Climate Action Plan, with the objective of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% in  2030  compared  to  2019,  in  particular  by  progressively incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and investing in  the  renewal  of  the  Group's  fleet  for  new  generation aircraft emitting up to 25% less CO2 per passanger km.\n\nAir  France-KLM  assesses  its  extra-financial  performance on  a  regular  basis.  In  2023,  the  Group  is  included  in  the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI Europe), and the Ecovadis  rating  agency  awarded  Air  France-KLM  a  Gold medal,  while  the  CDP  awarded  the  Group  a  B  rating (C rating in 2022) for the Climate Change questionnaire.\n\nFurthermore,  to  objectify  its  ESG  performance  and improve  its  strategy  and  practices,  Air  France-KLM proactively  sought  an  independent  ESG  rating  from Standard and Poor's, becoming the first airline group to be  evaluated  through  an  ESG  rating  on  request,  and remains the only airline group to publish its ESG rating. In 2023,  Standard  &  Poor's  (S&P)  Global  Ratings  awarded Air France-KLM an ESG rating of 65/100. This rating places the  Group  in  a  good  position  among  players  in  the  air transport  industry  for  managing  its  significant  exposure to environmental challenges. In conclusion, S&P considers that  the  Air  France-KLM  Group  is  well  prepared  to manage the ESG risks airlines are facing in the short and medium term.\n\nThe  Group's  financial statements  integrate  climate change  and  sustainability  issues  in  various  items  as described below.\n\n## 2.1 Valuation of assets and consideration of environmental risks and commitments\n\nThe  impact  of  climate  change  has  been  taken  into account in preparing the Group's financial statements for the  year  ending  December  31,  2023.  In  order  to  identify the  physical  and  transitional  climate-related  risks  to which  the  Group  is  exposed,  a  climate  scenario  analysis was carried out.  However, the physical risks  identified  in this  way  were  not  considered  likely  to  have  a  significant impact  on  operational  continuity,  given  the  Group's balanced network between the different continents and the  flexibility  of  its  fleet,  which  minimizes  the  economic consequences of extreme weather events.\n\nThe impacts of expected or probable regulatory changes are included in the Air France-KLM group's five-year plan, notably:\n\n- \u25a0 the  rising  cost  of  carbon  credits  and  CO2  offsetting under  European  (EU-ETS)  and  international  (CORSIA) mechanisms;\n- \u25a0 the  increasing  trajectory  of  sustainable  aviation  fuel (\"SAF\") incorporation;\n- \u25a0 the Group's ability to pass on additional costs in ticket prices;\n- \u25a0 the  acceptability  of  air  transport  and  its  effect  on demand reflected in the long term growth rate of its activity;\n- \u25a0 the  investments  and  depreciation  linked  to  the  fleet renewal plan, in line with the CO2 emission reduction targets validated by SBTi.\n\nThese  elements  are  consequently  taken  into  account  in the  assumptions  used  to  test  the  recoverable  value  of assets (see Note 21 'Impairment').\n\nIn  2023,  the  environmental  impacts  have  not  led  to  the recognition of any impairment or accelerated depreciation of the Group's assets.\n\n## 2.2 Sustainable investments and financings\n\n## 2.2.1 Fleet modernization\n\nThe  Air  France-KLM  group  has  committed  to  reduce  its CO2  emissions  per  passenger  km  by  30%  by  2030 compared to  2019.  Currently,  one  of  the  most  impactful ways to reduce the carbon footprint is to invest in a more fuel-efficient  fleet.  The  Group  is  focusing  on  simplifying and  rationalizing  its  fleet  to  make  it  more  competitive. The  Group's  transformation  is  therefore  continuing  with the phase in of more modern, high-performance aircraft with  a  significantly  lower  environmental  impact  and  a reduced noise footprint.",

        "page_content": "The renewal of the Group's airline fleet for new generation aircraft, that are up to 25% more efficient in terms of fuel consumption and therefore CO2 emissions, and generate less  noise,  resulted  in  capital  expenditures  on  aircraft equipment amounting to \u20ac1,738 million as of December  31,  2023  (\u20ac1,332  million  as  of  December  31, 2022) (see Note 18 'Capital expenditures').\n\nPursuing its fleet renewal plan, the Group will continue to receive  new  generation  aircraft  over  the  next  few  years, with the aim of having 80% of its fleet composed of new generation aircraft by 2030  (see Note  38  'Flight equipment orders').\n\n## 2.2.2 Other investments\n\nThe  decarbonization  of  the  Group's  activities  is  also reflected  in  investments  in  materials  and  equipment designed to reduce its environmental footprint.\n\nIn  order  to  adapt  its  business  to  climate  change  and  in particular to achieve the objective of net zero emission for ground operations by 2030, the Air France-KLM Group is pursuing  a  sustainable  investment  policy  and  is  notably investing  in  fully  electric  ramp  equipment  (vehicles, tractors and  loading equipment)  and  the  energy renovation of its buildings.\n\nThese  investments  represented  \u20ac134  million  as  of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac52 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## 2.2.3 Sustainable financings\n\nTo support its investments, the Air France-KLM Group has entered  into  secured  financing  agreements  integrating sustainable  development  issues,  through  which  the Group  and  its  airlines  benefit  from  more  advantageous financing  conditions  if  it  achieves  targets  related  to  the reduction of its  greenhouse gas emissions, fleet renewal and the incorporation of sustainable aviation fuels (\"SAF\").\n\nOn January 9, 2023, Air France-KLM issued sustainabilitylinked  bonds  for  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac1  billion  (see  Note 31.2.2 \"Sustainability-linked bonds\").\n\nOn April 18, 2023 Air France-KLM, Air France and KLM have signed two ESG ('Environmental, Social and Governance') KPI-Linked Revolving Credit Facilities ('RCF') with a pool of  internation  financial  institutions,  for  a  total  amount  of \u20ac2.2 billion (see Note 31.7 'Credit lines').\n\nTo  support  their  investments  in  new-generation  aircraft, Air  France  and  KLM  have  also  entered  into  financing contracts with specific clauses linked to compliance with environmental  criteria.  These  financings  amount  for \u20ac640 million as of December 31, 2023, booked in the line 'Other debt' in the Group's balance sheet (see Note 31.4 'Other debt').\n\n## 2.3 Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) Greenhouse gas emission rights and CO 2 compensation\n\n## 2.3.1 Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)\n\nAs  part  of  its  decarbonization  objectives,  the  Air  FranceKLM  group  has  developed  a  progressive  and  proactive sustainable  aviation  fuel  (SAF)  purchasing  policy,  aiming to  incorporate  at  least  10%  SAF  by  2030,  above  and beyond its regulatory obligations.\n\nSAF expenses amounted  for \u20ac172 million as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac57 million as of December 31, 2022) (see Note 7 'External expenses').\n\nTo cover the additional costs incurred by SAF purchases, the Air France-KLM group introduced a specific surcharge on tickets departing from France and the Netherlands on January  1,  2022.  In  addition,  voluntary  contribution mechanisms enable the Group's customers to contribute financially  to  the  supply  and  use  of  SAF  beyond  the regulatory  incorporation.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the total  amount  collected  in  respect  of  the  surcharge  and voluntary contributions represented \u20ac134 million (\u20ac48 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\nIn  order  to  secure  its  future  purchases  of  sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Air France-KLM  signed  several contracts with the suppliers Nest\u00e9, DG Fuels and SkyNRG for  the  supply  of  2.35  million  tons  of  SAF  between  2024 and 2036 (see Note 39.1 \"Commitments made\").\n\nOn  November  10,  2023, Air France-KLM invested \u20ac4  million  in  DG  Fuels  to  support  the  construction  of DG Fuels' first U.S.-based plant specializing in sustainable aviation  fuel  (SAF),  offering  the  Group  an  option  to purchase  up  to  75,000  tonnes  of  SAF  per  year  over  a period of several years starting in 2029, in addition to the long-term purchase agreement entered into by Air France-KLM and DG Fuels in 2022.\n\n## 2.3.2 Greenhouse gas emission rights and CO 2 compensation\n\nSince  January  1,  2012,  airlines  have  been  subject  to  the Emission  Trading  Scheme  (EU-ETS)  regulations  for  all flights  to  or  from  the  European  Economic  Area,  as described in Note 25 'Other assets' and Note 35.4 'Carbon credit  risk'.  As  such,  the  Group  must  purchase  CO2 allowances, in addition to the free allowances, to offset its emissions.\n\nSince January 1, 2020, Air France has also been offsetting all  its  customers'  CO2  emissions  on  French  domestic routes,  in  line  with  French  regulations,  by  purchasing credits  representing  carbon  offsetting  from  approved partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  value  of  the  CO2 quotas  related  to  the  EU-ETS  program  and  to  the offsetting of emissions on French domestic flights in the Group's balance sheet amounted to \u20ac395 million d'euros (\u20ac214 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\nTo  meet  its  obligation  to  surrender  the  allowances corresponding to its emissions, the Group recorded a net expense  of  \u20ac203  million  as  of  December  31,  2023 (\u20ac141  million  as  of  December  31,  2022)  corresponding  to the best estimates of its emissions for the year 2023 (see Note  3  \"Restatement  of  the  2022  financial  statements\" and Note 7 'External expenses').\n\nThe  obligation  to  surrender  allowances,  valued  at acquisition  cost  for  rights  acquired  (including  free allowances)  and  at  market  value  for  rights  yet  to  be acquired, is recorded as provisions in the Group's balance sheet. These  'provisions  for  CO2  quota  surrenders'\n\namounted  for  \u20ac213  million  as  of  December  31,  2023 (\u20ac142  million  as  of  December  31,  2022)  (see  Note  30 'Return obligation liability and provision for leased aircraft and other provisions').\n\nFinally, the Group has hedging instruments for its future purchases  of  CO2  quotas  for  a  nominal  amount  of \u20ac12  million  as  of  December  31,  2023  (\u20ac106  million  as  of December 31, 2022) (see Note 35.4 'Carbon credit risk' and Note 28.5 'Derivatives instruments reserves').\n\n## 2.4 Management compensation\n\nThe  performance  criteria  taken  into  account  for  the calculation of both  annual  and  long-term  variable management compensation (see Note 40.1 'Transactions with  the  principal  executives')  include  non-financial indicators  linked  related  to  sustainable  development, notably the compliance with the decarbonization roadmap and the reduction of CO2 emission.\n\n## NOTE 3 RESTATEMENT OF THE 2022 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSince  January  1,  2012,  airlines  have  been  subject  to  the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) regulations for all flights to or from the European Economic Area.\n\nAdditionally,  since  January  1,  2020,  Air  France  has  been compensating all the CO2 emissions of its customers on the French domestic routes.\n\nUntil  December  31,  2022  and  as  described  in  Note  4.23 'Emission  Trading  Scheme'  of  the  notes  to  the  2022 consolidated financial statements, the Group recognized for the CO2 emissions compensation scheme:\n\n- \u25a0 on  the  assets  side,  free  CO2  quotas  allocated  by  the State  and  the  ones  purchased  on  the  market  to compensate  emissions  as  unamortized  intangible assets. Their acquisition was disclosed in the investing activities of the consolidated cash flow statement;\n- \u25a0 in  the  income  statement,  an  expense  to  cover  its obligation  to  surrender  rights  corresponding  to  its emissions  of  the  period  within  the  'Other  current operating  income  and  expenses'  of  the  consolidated income  statement.  This  non-monetary  expense  was restated under within the 'other non-monetary items' in the cash flow statement  without  impacting operating cash flows;\n- \u25a0 on  the  liabilities  side,  a  provision  to  cover  the  cost  of quotas to be surrendered in respect of emissions made at the closing date.\n\nAs  from  January  1,  2023  and  in  the  absence  of  IFRS standards  or  interpretations  governing  ETS  accounting and  considering  CO2  quotas  as  an  operating  expense linked  to  fuel  expenses,  the  Group  considers  that  the operating  cash  flow  is  the  most  representative  of  this outflow.  The  Group  therefore  decided  to  adjust  its accounting treatment as described below:\n\n- \u25a0 free  CO2  quotas  allocated  by  the  State  and  the  ones purchased  on  the  market  recognized  as  intangible assets will now be disclosed in the line 'other assets' of the  consolidated  balance  sheet  and  as  an  operating cash flow in the consolidated cash flow statement;\n- \u25a0 the  expense  corresponding  to  the  obligation  to surrender quotas of the period will be integrated in the 'external expenses' of the consolidated income statement;\n- \u25a0 the obligation to surrender rights valued at acquisition cost for acquired rights - including free quotas - and at market  price  for  rights  not  yet  acquired  remains  a provision on the liability side.\n\nThis  change  has  been  applied  retrospectively  to  the financial  information  disclosed  in  the  prior  periods  in accordance  with  IAS  8  'Accounting  Policies,  Changes  in Accounting Estimates and Errors'.",

This financing is linked to the Company's target to reduce its jet fuel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per revenue tonne kilometer (RTK) by 10% by 2025, compared to  a  2019  baseline,  as  part  of  its  2030  SBTi  approved objective.\n\nThe emission is composed of two tranches:\n\n- \u25a0 a \u20ac500 million with a maturity as of May 31, 2026 and a coupon of 7.250%; and\n- \u25a0 a \u20ac500 million with a maturity as of May 31, 2028 and a coupon of 8.125%.\n\nIt has  been  accounted  for  in  non-current  financial liabilities in balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Early repayment of \u20ac2.5 billion of the bank loan guaranteed by the French State ('PGE')\n\nOn  March  15,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  has  fully  repaid  the remaining \u20ac2.5 billion from its initial \u20ac4 billion Bank loan guaranteed  by  the  French  State,  granted  during  the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nTo do so, the Group used the proceeds of \u20ac1 billion from Sustainability-linked bonds issued and \u20ac1.5 billion available cash.\n\n## Evolution of perpetual subordinated bonds owned by the French State and end of the French State aid scheme\n\nRespectively,  on  March  17,  2023  and  April  19,  2023, Air  France-KLM  has  repaid  the  full  amount  of  the outstanding  French  State  perpetual  bonds,  under  the terms of temporary framework related to Covid-19 aid, for \u20ac320  million and  \u20ac317  million  (including accrued coupons).\n\nThe Group has also paid the required compensation of the French State for the shares subscribed in April 2021, for an amount of \u20ac90 million.\n\nConcurrently,  the  Group  has  refinanced  \u20ac320  million  on March 17, 2023 and \u20ac407 million on April 19, 2023 through the issuances of new French State perpetual hybrid bonds as  an  approved  compensation  aid  to  Air  France  for damages  incurred  as  a  result  of  Covid-19  between March 17 and June 30, 2020. These new perpetual bonds with no 'bans' attached contain similar financial conditions as the ones repaid at the same date, with noncall  date  and  interest  rate  step-up  postponed  by  an additional two years (March 2029).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Paris Court of Appeals ruled on May 12, 2021, referring Airbus and Air France to the Criminal Court. The criminal trial took place from October 10 to December 8,  2022  at  the  Paris  Criminal  Court.  After  an  acquittal  by the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office,  the  Court  issued  a judgment  of  acquittal  on  April  17,  2023,  based  on  the absence of a causal link between the faults found and the accident. On April 27, 2023, the Public Prosecutor's Office appeals against the acquittal of Airbus and Air France.\n\nThe appeal should take place in 12 to 18 months starting from the appeal date.\n\n## Signature of two Revolving Credit Facilities ('RCF') linked to ESG KPIs for a total amount of \u20ac2.2 billion\n\nOn  April  18,  2023,  Air  France-KLM,  Air  France  and  KLM have  signed  two  ESG  ('Environmental,  Social  and Governance') KPI-Linked Revolving Credit Facilities ('RCF')  with  a  pool  of  international  financial  institutions, for a total amount of \u20ac2.2 billion.\n\nFor  each  facility,  a  set  of  ESG  linked  Key  Performance Indicators  are  embedded  in  the  financing  cost.  These indicators are in line with Air France-KLM and its airlines' commitment to sustainable development and a gradual decarbonization  of  activities.  The  two  RCFs  include  a financing cost margin adjustment mechanism (upward or downward) conditional to the independent achievement of  these  dedicated  Indicators  (reduction  of  the  unit  CO2 emission,  increase  of  the  share  of  Sustainable  Aviation Fuel, among others).\n\n## Air France-KLM and Air France\n\nAir  France-KLM  and  Air  France  as  combined  borrower signed a \u20ac1.2 billion Sustainability-Linked RCF.\n\nThis new facility has an initial 2026 maturity, includes two one-year extension options.\n\n## KLM\n\nKLM signed a ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)  KPI-linked  Revolving  Credit  Facility  for  an amount of \u20ac1 billion.\n\nThis  new  facility,  with  an  initial  2027  maturity,  includes two one-year extension options.\n\nThis facility replaces the remaining direct loan granted to KLM  by  the  Dutch  State  and  the  existing  credit  facility guaranteed  by  the  Dutch  State,  both  which  were cancelled  by  KLM.  This  transaction  has  enabled  KLM  to exit the Dutch State aid scheme definitively.\n\n## Agreement between Air France-KLM and Apollo Global Management related to a financing of \u20ac500 million\n\nAs  of  July  14,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  and  Apollo  Global Management  have  signed  a  definitive  agreement  for Apollo-managed funds and entities to raise a \u20ac500 million financing  into  an  operating  affiliate  of  Air  France  that owns  a  pool  of  components  dedicated  to  Air  France's Engineering and Maintenance activities.\n\nThis perpetual bond has been accounted for in equity. The accounting  scheme  is  detailed  in  the  Note  28.6  'Noncontrolling interests'.\n\nThe accrued interests as of December 31, 2023 amount to \u20ac15 million.\n\n## Air France-KLM reverse share split and share capital reduction\n\nAs  of  August  31,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  completed  the reverse  share  split  of  all  outstanding  shares  of  the Company and the capital  reduction  by  reduction  of  the nominal value of each share, as decided by the Board of Directors at its meeting on July 4, 2023 and in accordance with  the  36 th and  37 th extraordinary  resolutions  of  the Combined General Meeting of June 7, 2023.\n\nThese  transactions  resulted  in  two  steps,  without  equity impact:\n\n## Reverse share split\n\nThe reverse share split resulted in the allocation of 1 new ordinary  share  with  a  par  value  of  \u20ac10  for  10  existing ordinary shares with a par value of \u20ac1, and in a division by 10 of the number of outstanding shares. The reverse share split  transactions  took  place  on  July  31,  2023,  with  an exchange  period  open  from  that  date  until  August  31, 2023 included.\n\n## Share capital reduction\n\nOn  August  31,  2023,  the  par  value  of  each  share  in  the Company was reduced from \u20ac10 to \u20ac1, i.e. a reduction of \u20ac9 per share. The amount of this share capital reduction has been allocated to the \"share premium\" account. After the  share  capital  reduction,  the  new  shares'  par  value  is identical  to  the  par  value  of  shares  (before  the  reverse share split).\n\nAfter  the  transaction,  the  Company's  share  capital  was standing  at  \u20ac257,053,613  divided  into  257,053,613  shares with a par value of \u20ac1 each.\n\n## Order for 50 Airbus A350 family aircraft with purchase rights for 40 additional aircraft\n\nAs  of  September  25,  2023,  the  Air  France-KLM  group announced that it plans to place a landmark aircraft order to pursue the renewal and rationalization of its long-haul fleet.",

        "page_content": "This Group order was confirmed in January 2024 and will involve  33  A350-900  and  11  A350-1000  in  addition  to  the 6 A350-900 already confirmed in July 2023.\n\nThe  first  deliveries  are  expected  as  from  2026  and  will continue until 2030. It is a scalable order as it offers to the Group the flexibility to allocate the aircrafts to its different airlines  according  to  the  market  trends  and  to  the  local regulatory framework.\n\n## Air France-KLM to team up with SAS AB through equity and commercial cooperation\n\nAs of October 3, 2023, Air France-KLM has been selected by SAS AB's Board of Directors as the winning bidder in SAS's exit financing solicitation process, collectively with a consortium.\n\nAir France-KLM could take up to a maximum 19.9% noncontrolling  stake  in  the  share  capital  of  the  reorganized SAS AB.\n\nThe  Consortium's  investment  proposal  remains  to  be finalized and  is  subject  to  certain  conditions  and regulatory  approvals  including,  but  not  limited  to, approval  by  the  European  Commission,  the  US  court overseeing the Chapter 11 reorganization and, in respect of SAS AB, the Swedish court.\n\nShould  this  transaction  be  approved  and  all  the  other conditions (including regulatory clearances and cancellation of all  existing  shares  of  stock  of  SAS  AB)  be satisfied, the Consortium, together with the Danish State, would invest USD 1.175 billion of which USD 475 million in common  shares  and  USD  700  million  in  the  form  of secured convertible bonds.\n\nAir  France-KLM's  investment  would  represent  a  total  of USD  144.5  million,  of  which  USD  109.5  million  would  be invested in common shares and USD 35 million would be provided in the form of secured convertible bonds.\n\nAt  this  stage,  as  of  December,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  has paid a deposit amounting to \u20ac13 million, included in the net cash flow used in investing activities.\n\n## Global employee share purchase plan\n\nWithin the framework of the 34 th and  35 th resolutions  of the Annual General Meeting of June 7, 2023, on October 23, 2023, the Air France-KLM group launched \"Partners for the future\",  an  employee share purchase plan offered to around 75.000 eligible employees in around 20 countries.\n\nEligible  employees  were  able  to  subscribe  at  a  30% discounted  price  with  the  benefit  of  a  matching contribution from  the  Air  France-KLM  group.  The proposed shares could not exceed 3% of Air France-KLM's share capital.\n\nOn December 21, 2023, following this operation, 5,716,256 new  shares  with  a  value  of  one  euro  each  were  issued, increasing  the  share  capital  from  257,053,613  euros  to 262,769,869 euros.\n\nThe capital  increase  breaks  down  into  into  \u20ac6  million  in share capital and \u20ac29 million in additional paid in capital. In  addition,  in  accordance  with  IFRS2,  an  expense  of 31  million  euros  (excluding  social  security  charges)  was\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nrecognized in salaries and related costs, with a counterpart in shareholders equity.\n\n## Air France's domestic offer from Paris adaptation plan by 2026\n\nOn October 18 th ,  2023, Air France Group has presented to the  employees  representative  committee  an  adaptation plan  on  domestic  flights  from  Paris  by  summer  2026. Air  France  will  operate  all  domestic  and  international flights  from Paris-Charles de Gaulle hub. Only the public service delegation on Air France's routes to/from Corsica, remain assured from Paris-Orly.\n\nTransavia would be the Air France Group's leading airline departing from Paris-Orly airport.\n\nEven  if  the  reduction  in  the  number  of  employees  is limited  to  domestic  stations  (given  the  redeployment  of part  of  the  flights  currently  operated  from  Paris-Orly  to Paris-Charles de Gaulle), all Orly-based employees affected by the project will be offered a position at Roissy (given  the  resource  requirements  of  the  Hub  in  Roissy) and,  as  far  as  possible,  at  Orly.  The  management  has proposed a restructuring scheme 'Rupture Conventionnelle  Collective'  integrating  an  end-of-career scheme, so that each employee, on a voluntary basis, can benefit from a choice for the future. This agreement was signed  by  majority  vote  by  the  employee  representative bodies on February 9, 2024. According to the agreement's calendar, employees' choices will be collected as from the fourth quarter of 2024; consequently the number and the individual situation of the candidates are not yet known at the moment.\n\nNegotiations concerning the reallocation of premises will take place in 2024 and 2025.\n\nOn the basis mentioned above, no restructuring costs or revised amortization period have been recognized in the financial statements as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Agreement between Air France-KLM and Apollo Global Management related to a financing of \u20ac1.5 billion financing\n\nOn November 30, 2023, Air France-KLM and Apollo Global Management  have  finalized,  based  on  a  financing agreement  signed  on  October  26,  2023,  the  following transaction for a total amount of \u20ac1.5 billion.\n\nA  dedicated  operating  affiliate  of  Air  France-KLM  holds the  trademark  and  most  of  the  commercial  partners contracts  related  to  Air  France  and  KLM's  joint  loyalty program (Flying Blue). The affiliate becomes the exclusive issuer of miles for the airlines of the Group and partners.\n\nUnder  the  agreement,  Apollo-managed  funds  subscribe to  perpetual  bonds  issued  by  this  dedicated  operating affiliate. The financing is non-dilutive to shareholders. The structure  is  similar  to  two  previous  financings  raised  by Air France on its pool of spare engines in July 2022 and its maintenance  activity  components  in  July  2023  (See paragraph 'Agreement between Air France-KLM and Apollo Global Management related to a financing of \u20ac500 million').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The parties have agreed to amend the existing lockup on CMA CGM shares in  Air  France-KLM's  capital,  which  will now be effective until February 28, 2025. The parties have agreed that CMA CGM will step down from the Air FranceKLM Board of Directors on March 31, 2024.\n\n## Sales of KLM Equipment Service B.V.\n\nOn  February,  1  2024,  KLM  sold  its  100%  subsidiary  KLM Equipment Services B.V. to a third party, TCR international N.V.,  Belgium  (TCR).  Under  the  agreement,  KLM  will become a TCR customer for the maintenance and lease of ground operations equipment at Schiphol, while TCR will be  responsible  for  investments  in  ground  operations equipment.  The  sale  has  no  material  impact  on  the Group's revenue and balance sheet.\n\n## NOTE 5 CHANGE IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE\n\nNo significant acquisitions or disposals took place during 2023 and 2022.\n\n## NOTE 6 INFORMATION BY ACTIVITY AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREA\n\n## Business segments (Note 6.1)\n\nThe  segment  information  is  prepared  on  the  basis  of internal management  data  communicated  to  the Executive  Committee,  the  Group's  principal  operational decision-making body.\n\nThe Group is organized around the following segments:\n\n- \u25a0 Network: The  revenues  for  this  segment,  which includes  the  Passenger  and  Cargo  network,  primarily come  from  passenger  transportation  services  on scheduled  flights  with  the  Group's  airline  code (excluding  Transavia),  including  flights  operated  by other airlines under code-share agreements. They also include  code-share  revenues,  revenues  from  excess baggage and airport services supplied by the Group to third-party  airlines  and  services  linked  to  IT  systems. Network revenues also include freight carried on flights operated  under  the  codes  of  the  airlines  within  the Group  and  flights  operated  by  other  partner  airlines under  code-share  agreements.  Other  cargo  revenues are derived principally from the sale of cargo capacity to third parties and the transportation of shipments on behalf of the Group by other airlines;\n- \u25a0 Maintenance: Maintenance  operating  revenues  are generated  through  maintenance  services  provided  to other airlines and customers worldwide;\n\n- \u25a0 Transavia: The revenues from this segment come from the 'leisure' activity realized by Transavia;\n- \u25a0 Other: The  revenues  from  this  segment  come  from various  services  provided  by  the  Group  and  not covered by the three segments mentioned above.\n\nThe  results  of  the  business  segments  are  those  that  are either  directly  attributable  or  that  can  be  allocated  on  a reasonable  basis  to  these  business  segments.  Amounts allocated to business segments mainly correspond to the EBITDA,  current  operating  income  and  to  the  income from  operating  activities.  Other  elements  of  the  income statement are presented in the 'non-allocated' column.\n\nInter-segment  transactions  are  evaluated  based  on normal market conditions.\n\n## Geographical segments (Note 6.2)\n\n## Activity by origin of sales area (Note 6.2.1)\n\nGroup  external  sales  by  origin  of  sale  are  broken  down into four geographical areas:\n\n- \u25a0 France, including French overseas departments;\n- \u25a0 Benelux, including Dutch Caribbean & Suriname;\n- \u25a0 Europe (excluding France and Benelux);\n- \u25a0 Rest of the world.",

The recognition of the revenue known as 'ticket breakage' is deferred until the transportation date initially foreseen.\n\nThe  Group  applies  the  exemption  provided  by  IFRS  15  which  allows  the  balance  of  the  outstanding  transactions  to remain unspecified as well as their planned recognition date for the performance obligations related to contracts with an initial term set at one year or less. If the tickets are not used, the performance obligations related to passenger and freight transportation effectively expire within one year.\n\nPursuant  to  the  European  Union's  Regulation  EC  261,  the  Group  compensates  passengers  in  the  event  of  denied boarding  and  for  flight  cancellations  or  long  delays.  This  compensation  is  booked  as  contra  revenue.  The  Group recognizes a corresponding amount in liabilities for future refunds to passengers. The determination of this liability for future refunds relies on a statistical approach.\n\nPassenger  ticket  taxes  calculated  on  ticket  sales  are  collected  by  the  Group  to  be  paid  to  the  airport  authorities. Therefore, they do not correspond to revenue. Taxes are recorded as a liability until such time as they are paid to the relevant airport authority as a function of the chargeability conditions (on ticket issuance or transportation).\n\nThe Group considers that the company that issues the airway bill acts as principal since the latter has control over the achievement of the performance obligation. When the Group issues freight airway bills for its goods carried by another carrier (airline company or road carrier), the Group acts as principal. Therefore, at the time of transportation the Group recognizes as revenue the amount invoiced to the customer in its entirety as well as the chartering costs invoiced by the other carrier for the service provision.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe main types of contracts with customers identified within the Group are mainly:\n\n## \u25a0 sales of maintenance and support contracts (Power by the hour contracts)\n\nSome maintenance and support contracts cover the airworthiness of engines, equipment or airframes, an airframe being an aircraft without engines and equipment. The invoicing of these contracts is based on the number of flight hours or landings of the goods concerned by these contracts.\n\nThe different services included within each of these contracts consist of a unique performance obligation due to the existing interdependence between the services within the execution of these contracts.\n\nRevenue from maintenance and support services is recognized on a percentage of completion basis, based on the costs incurred, if they can be reliably measured, plus the expected margin.\n\nThe transfer of the control of these services is performed continuously, As long as the margin on the contract cannot be measured in a reliable manner, the revenue will only be recognized at the level of the costs incurred.\n\nForecast margins on the contracts are assessed through the forecast future cash flows that take into account the obligations and factors inherent to the contracts as well as other internal parameters to the contract selected using historical and/or forecast data.\n\nThese  forecast  margins  are  regularly  reviewed.  If  necessary,  provisions  are  recorded  as  soon  as  any  losses  on completion of contracts are identified.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n- \u25a0 Caribbean,  West  Indies,  French  Guyana  and  Indian Ocean;\n- \u25a0 Africa (excluding North Africa), Middle East;\n- \u25a0 North America, Mexico;\n- \u25a0 South America (excluding Mexico);\n- \u25a0 Asia and New Caledonia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Inversely, any revenue that has been recognized but not yet invoiced is recorded under assets (invoice to be issued) on the balance sheet at the accounting year end.\n\n## \u25a0 sales of spare parts repair and labor - Time & Material contracts\n\nThese services which relate to engines, equipment or airframes, an airframe being an aircraft without engines and equipment, are generally short term.\n\nThey consist of a unique performance obligation. The revenue is recognized as costs are incurred.\n\n## \u25a0 third-party procurement\n\nWhen the Group serves as a broker between its suppliers and end customers, the Group acts as an agent and hence, recognizes the margin that results from this operation as revenue.\n\n## 6.1 Information by business segment\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2023\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                                     | Network   | Maintenance   | Transavia   | Other   | Non- allocated   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------|------------------|---------|\n| Total sales                                                         | 25,661    | 4,242         | 2,640       | 263     | -                | 32,806  |\n| Intersegment sales                                                  | (25)      | (2,530)       | (2)         | (232)   | -                | (2,789) |\n| External sales                                                      | 25,636    | 1,712         | 2,638       | 31      | -                | 30,017  |\n| Other revenues                                                      | -         | -             | -           | -       | 2                | 2       |\n| Revenues from ordinary activities                                   | 25,636    | 1,712         | 2,638       | 31      | 2                | 30,019  |\n| EBITDA                                                              | 3,659     | 405           | 152         | (8)     | -                | 4,208   |\n| Income from current operations                                      | 1,693     | 150           | (97)        | (34)    | -                | 1,712   |\n| Income from operating activities                                    | 1,681     | 150           | (96)        | (58)    | -                | 1,677   |\n| Share of profits (losses) of associates                             | 2         | 3             | -           | 2       | -                | 7       |\n| Net cost of financial debt and other  financial income and expenses | -         | -             | -           | -       | (530)            | (530)   |\n| Income taxes                                                        | -         | -             | -           | -       | (164)            | (164)   |\n| NET INCOME                                                          | 1,683     | 153           | (96)        | (56)    | (694)            | 990     |\n| TOTAL ASSETS                                                        | 16,572    | 4,806         | 2,069       | 1,121   | 9,922            | 34,490  |\n| Segment liabilities                                                 | 10,629    | 1,789         | 1,700       | 3       | 6,224            | 20,345  |\n| Financial liabilities, lease debts, bank  overdrafts and equity     | -         | -             | -           | -       | 14,145           | 14,145  |\n| TOTAL LIABILITIES                                                   | 10,629    | 1,789         | 1,700       | 3       | 20,369           | 34,490  |\n| Purchase of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets    | 2,534     | 811           | 203         | 3       | -                | 3,551   |\n| Depreciation and amortization  for the period                       | (2,029)   | (294)         | (283)       | (25)    | -                | (2,631) |\n| Other non-monetary items                                            | 70        | (6)           | (2)         | (104)   | (29)             | (71)    |\n\nThe  non-allocated  assets,  amounting  to  \u20ac9.9  billion, comprise  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  \u20ac6.2  billion  (see Note 26), other financial assets of \u20ac2.6 billion (see Note 22),\n\ndeferred tax of \u20ac0.7 billion (see Note 13.4), income taxes of \u20ac0.1 billion (see Note 25) and derivatives financial assets of \u20ac0.3 billion (see Note 35).",

Since this  multi-employer  plan  is  assimilated  with  a  French State  plan,  it  is  accounted  for  as  a  defined  contribution plan in 'pension costs on defined contribution plans'.\n\n## Payment linked with shares\n\nThe payment linked with shares amounts to \u20ac35 million including social charges. It mainly relates to the employee share ownership plan offered to all Air France-KLM group employees  (see  Note  4.1  Significant  events  occurring during the period).\n\n## Wages and salaries, and social contributions\n\nFollowing the impact of the Covid-19 public health crisis, starting  from  March  23,  2020  Air  France  and  its  main subsidiaries implemented  part-time  activity for its employees.

They are recognized only to the extend that it is probable that a sufficiently precise future taxable profit will be generated at the level of the taxable entity. Deferred tax assets relating to tax losses are capitalized on the basis of the prospects of recoverability arising from the budget and mid-term plans prepared by the Group. The assumptions used are the same that the ones used for the impairment test.\n\nThe tax expense reported in the income statement comprises the current tax expense (or income) and the deferred tax expense (or income).\n\nThe tax rates used to measure deferred taxes are the ones enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nNet deferred tax balances are determined on the basis of each entity's tax position.\n\nTaxes payable and/or deferred are recognized in the income statement for the period, unless they are generated by a transaction or event recorded directly in equity. In such cases, they are recorded directly in equity.\n\n## Impact of the Contribution on Added Value of Enterprises\n\nThe  CAVE  (Contribution  on  Added  Value  of  Enterprises/ Cotisation  sur  la  Valeur  Ajout\u00e9e  des  Entreprises -  CVAE)  is calculated by the application of a tax rate to the added value generated by the company during the year. As the added value is a net amount of income and expenses, the CAVE meets the definition of a tax on profits as set out in IAS 12.2. Consequently, the expense relating to the CAVE is presented under the line 'Income taxes'.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u25a0 an  unrealized  gain  of  \u20ac9  million  on  the  net  debt, mainly composed of a loss of \u20ac(11) million on US Dollar, a  gain  of  \u20ac62  million  on  Japanese  Yen  and  a  loss  of \u20ac(24) million on Swiss Franc;\n- \u25a0 a  loss  of  \u20ac(35)  million  on  other  assets  and  liabilities mainly due to US dollars on the working capital.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  foreign  exchange  loss included  mainly  an  unrealized  currency  loss  of  \u20ac(158) million composed of:\n\n- \u25a0 a  loss  of  \u20ac(182)  million  on  return  obligation  liabilities and provisions on aircraft in US dollars;\n- \u25a0 a  gain  of  \u20ac5  million  on  the  financial  liabilities,  mainly composed of a loss of \u20ac(41) million on US Dollar and a gain of \u20ac53 million on Japanese Yen.\n\n## Undiscounting of provision\n\nThe  rate  used  to  undiscount  the  long  term  return obligation  liability  and  provision  for  leased  aircraft  and other provisions non current is 5.5% in 2023 against 3.6% in 2022 (see Note 30.1.1 'Return obligation liability and provision on leased aircraft').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period. However, the amount of fiscal  loss  recoverable  each  year  is  limited  to  50%  of  the profit  for  the  period  beyond  the  first  million  euros.  The Group limits its recoverability horizon on the deferred tax losses of the French fiscal group to a period of five years, consistent with its strategic plan.\n\nIn  view of the medium and long-term outlook, the fiscal group has recognized deferred tax assets for an amount\n\nof \u20ac361 million as of December 31, 2023. The deferred tax assets  position  for  tax  losses  was  therefore  increased  to \u20ac707  million  (versus  \u20ac346  million  as  of  December  31, 2022), including 56 million in equity (see Note 13.2).\n\n## Dutch fiscal group\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tax rate is 25.8% in 2023. Tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period. However, the amount of fiscal loss recoverable each year is limited to 50% of the profit for the period beyond the first million euros.\n\nThe results of the period allowed the use of deferred tax losses and deductible financial interests. The deferred tax asset  position  for  tax  losses  and  deductible  financial interests was therefore increased to \u20ac332 million (versus \u20ac403 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## 13.2 Deferred tax recorded in equity (equity holders of Air France-KLM)\n\n## Period from January 1 to December 31\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Coupons on perpetual                                                        | 56     | 3      |\n| Other comprehensive income that will be reclassified to profit and loss     | 30     | 34     |\n| Other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit and loss | (2)    | (41)   |\n| Equity instruments                                                          | -      | 2      |\n| Pensions                                                                    | (2)    | (43)   |\n| TOTAL                                                                       | 84     | (7)    |",

As  of December 31, 2022, it amounted to \u20ac 346 million with a basis  of  \u20ac1,340  million.  The  deferred  taxes  increase  on fiscal losses is explained by forecasts of future tax profits.\n\nThe total deferred-tax position of the French fiscal group stands at a net asset of \u20ac465 million (\u20ac323 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## Dutch fiscal group\n\nThe Dutch fiscal group recognized \u20ac332 million deferred taxes  on  fiscal  losses  with  a  basis  of  \u20ac1,287million  as  of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, it amounted to  \u20ac403  million  with  a  basis  of  \u20ac1,562  million.  This reduction  is  due  to  the  consumption  over  the  period  of deferred taxes on tax losses and deductible interest.\n\nThe total  deferred  tax  position  of  the  Dutch  fiscal  group stands at a net asset of \u20ac216 million (versus a \u20ac373 million net liability as of December 31, 2022).",

It is translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or, if applicable, at the hedging price assigned to it. Manufacturers' discounts, if any, are deducted from the value of the related asset.\n\nAircraft are depreciated using the straight-line method over their average estimated useful life which is between 20 and 25 years for all types of aircraft except in specific cases.\n\nDuring the operating cycle, and when establishing fleet replacement plans, the Group reviews whether the amortizable base or the useful life should be adjusted and, if necessary, determines whether a residual value should be recognized and the useful life adapted.\n\nAny major aircraft airframe and engine overhaul including parts with limited useful lives are treated as a separate asset component with the cost capitalized and are amortized on the basis of production units which can be the number of flight  hours  for  airframe  potentials  or  the  number  of  flight  cycles  for  engines  over  the  period  between  the  date  of acquisition and the next major overhaul.\n\nThe other maintenance costs which do not extend the useful life or do not increase the value of the asset are recorded as expenses when it occurs.\n\nAircraft  spare  parts  (maintenance  business)  which  enable  the  use  of  the  fleet  are  recorded  as  fixed  assets  and  are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated residual lifetime of the aircraft/engine type on the world market. The useful life is limited to a maximum of 30 years.\n\n## Other property, plant and equipment\n\nOther property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives as follows:\n\n| Buildings             | 20 to 50 years   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Fixtures and fittings | 8 to 20 years    |\n| Flight simulators     | 10 to 20 years   |\n| Equipment and tooling | 3 to 15 years    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are incremental costs which would not have been incurred if the contract had not been concluded;\n- \u25a0 estimated costs for the restoration and dismantling of the leased asset according to the terms of the contract in accordance with IFRIC 1. At the date of the initial recognition of the right-of-use asset, the lessee adds to these costs, the discounted amount of the restoration and dismantling costs contractually agreed through a return obligation liability  or  provision  as  described  in  Note 30.  These  costs  also  include  maintenance obligations with regard to the engines and airframes.\n\nFollowing the initial recognition, the right-of-use asset must be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying assets (lease term for the rental component, flight hours for the component relating to engine maintenance or on a straightline basis for the component relating to the airframe until the date of the next major overhaul).\n\n## Measurement of the lease debt\n\nAt  the  commencement  date,  the  lease  debt  is  recognized  for  an  amount  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the  lease payments over the lease term.\n\nAmounts involved in the measurement of the lease debt are:\n\n- \u25a0 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments; meaning that even if they are variable in form, they are insubstance unavoidable);\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  'real  estate'  and  'other  assets'  lease  debt  is  measured  using  the  debt  marginal  rate  at  the commencement date of the contract.\n\nIn addition, the lease debt may be remeasured in the following situations:\n\n- \u25a0 change in the lease term;\n- \u25a0 modification related to the assessment of the reasonably certain nature (or not) of the exercise of an option;\n- \u25a0 remeasurement linked to the residual value guarantees;\n- \u25a0 adjustment to the rates and indices according to which the rents are calculated when rent adjustments occur.\n\n## Types of capitalized lease contracts\n\n## 'Aircraft' lease contracts\n\nFor the aircraft lease contracts fulfilling the capitalization criteria defined by IFRS 16, the lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period of each contract except in cases where the Group is reasonably certain of exercising the renewal options contractually foreseen. For example, this may be the case if substantial cabin customization has taken place whereas the residual lease term is significantly shorter than the useful life of the cabins. The accounting treatment of the maintenance obligations related to leased aircraft is outlined in Note 30.\n\nAircraft lease contracts concluded by the Group do not include guaranteed value clauses for leased assets.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease debt corresponds, for each aircraft, to the implicit interest rate induced by the contractual elements and residual market values. This rate is easy to calculate due to the availability of current and future data concerning the value of aircraft. It is recalculated on each contract renewal (prolongation). The implied rate of the contract is the discount rate that gives the aggregated present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value. This present value should be equal to the sum of the fair value of the leased asset and any initial direct costs of the lessor.\n\nSince most of the aircraft lease contracts are denominated in US dollars, starting from January 1, 2018 the Group put in place a cash flow hedge for its US dollar revenues via the lease debt in US dollars. Consequently, the revaluation of the Group's debt at the closing rate is accounted for in 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\n## 'Real-estate' lease contracts\n\nBased  on  its  analysis,  the  Group  has  identified  lease  contracts  according  to  the  standard  concerning  surface  areas rented in its hubs, lease contracts on buildings dedicated to the maintenance business, customized lounges in airports other than hubs and lease contracts on office buildings. The lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period, with most of the contracts not including renewal options.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security and in a similar economic environment. This rate is achieved by the addition of the interest rate on government bonds and the credit spread. The coupon on government bonds  is  specific  to  the  location,  currency,  period  and  maturity.  The  definition  of  the  spread  curve  is  based  upon reference points, each point consisting of asset financing on assets other than aircraft.\n\n## 'Other-assets' lease contracts\n\nThe  main  lease  contracts  identified  correspond  to  company  cars,  pools  of  spare  parts  and  engines.  The  lease  term corresponds to the non-terminable period. Most of the contracts do not provide renewal options. The discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature debt. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset  over  a  similar  term,  with  a  similar  security  and  in  a  similar  economic  environment  (for  the  method  used  to determine the incremental borrowing rate, see the 'Real estate lease contracts' paragraph above).",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n## Types of non-capitalized lease contracts\n\nThe Group uses the two exemptions foreseen by IFRS 16 allowing for non-recognition in the balance sheet: short-term lease contracts and lease contracts for which the underlying assets have a low value.\n\n## Short duration lease contracts\n\nThese are contracts whose duration is equal to or less than 12 months. Within the Group, they mainly relate to leases of:\n\n- \u25a0 surface areas in our hubs with a reciprocal notice-period equal to or less than 12 months;\n- \u25a0 accommodations for expatriates with a notice period equal to or less than 12 months;\n- \u25a0 spare engines for a duration equal to or less than 12 months.\n\n## Low value lease contracts\n\nLow-value lease contracts concern assets with a value equal to or less than US$5,000. Within the Group, these include, notably, lease contracts on printers, tablets, laptops and mobile phones.\n\n## Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nThe  Group  qualifies  as  sale  and  leaseback  transactions,  operations  which  lead  to  a  sale  according  to  IFRS  15.  More specifically, a sale is considered as such if there is no repurchase option on the goods at the end of the lease term. The results of the leaseback transactions are presented in Note 11 'Sales of aircraft equipment and other non -current income and expenses'.\n\n## Transactions deemed to be a sale\n\nIf the sale by the vendor-lessee is qualified as a sale according to IFRS 15, the vendor-lessee must: (i) de-recognize the underlying asset, (ii) recognize a right-of-use asset equal to the retained portion of the net carrying amount of the asset sold.\n\n## Transaction not deemed to be a sale\n\nIf  the sale by the vendor-lessee is not qualified as a sale according to IFRS 15, the vendor-lessee maintains the goods transferred on its balance sheet and recognizes a financial liability equal to the disposal price (received from the buyerlessor).\n\nThe table below presents the right-of-use assets per category:\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)      | Aircraft   | Maintenance   | Land & Real  Estate   | Others   | Total   |\n|----------------------|------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------|---------|\n| NET VALUE            |            |               |                       |          |         |\n| January 1, 2022      | 2,476      | 1,898         | 608                   | 166      | 5,148   |\n| New contracts        | 742        | 299           | 71                    | 13       | 1,125   |\n| Change in contracts  | 155        | (114)         | 41                    | -        | 82      |\n| Disposals            | -          | (2)           | -                     | -        | (2)     |\n| Reclassification     | (6)        | 526           | -                     | (117)    | 403     |\n| Currency translation | -          | -             | (1)                   | -        | (1)     |\n| Amortization         | (616)      | (431)         | (120)                 | (15)     | (1,182) |\n| Others               | -          | (145)         | -                     | -        | (145)   |\n| December 31, 2022    | 2,751      | 2,031         | 599                   | 47       | 5,428   |\n| New contracts        | 834        | 401           | 86                    | 26       | 1,347   |\n| Change in contracts  | 183        | (168)         | 36                    | 5        | 56      |\n| Disposals            | -          | (1)           | -                     | -        | (1)     |\n| Reclassification     | (3)        | 471           | -                     | -        | 468     |\n| Amortization         | (627)      | (435)         | (130)                 | (16)     | (1,208) |\n| Others               | -          | (134)         | -                     | -        | (134)   |\n| December 31, 2023    | 3,138      | 2,165         | 591                   | 62       | 5,956   |\n\nThe line 'Others' includes mainly movements of the return obligation liability following aircrafts restitution (see Note 30).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

On conclusion of this transaction, the operational control of Servair was transferred to Gategroup  in  application  of  the  governance  planned  in the agreements between Air France and Gategroup.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This resulted in the sale by Air France Finance, on May 31, 2021, of 15% of Servair shares for \u20ac71 million. The second tranche of 15% is classified in assets held for sale (see Note 27 'Assets held for sale'), pending payment over several years. The remaining 20% were revalued accordingly  to  the  IFRS  10  standard  at  their  fair  value based  on  the  transaction  value  in  the  line  'equity affiliates'.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Servair  group  remains consolidated  according  to  the  equity  method,  as  it  has been the case since December 31, 2016.\n\n## NOTE 21 IMPAIRMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  36  'Impairment  of  Assets',  tangible  fixed  assets,  intangible  assets,  right-of-use  assets  and goodwill are tested for depreciation if there is an indication of impairment, and those with an indefinite useful life are tested at least once a year.\n\nFor  this  test,  the  Group  deems  the  recoverable  value  of  the  asset  to  be  the  higher  of  the  market  value  less  cost  of disposal and its value in use. The latter is determined according to the discounted future cash-flow method, estimated based  on  budgetary  assumptions  approved  by  management,  using  an  actuarial  rate  which  corresponds  to  the weighted average cost of the Group's capital and a growth rate which reflects the market.\n\nRevenues (network, leisure and maintenance), costs and investments forecasts are based on reasonable hypotheses and  are  the  management's  best  estimates.  They  are  subject  to  the  uncertainties  prevailing  at  the  time  the  test  is performed.\n\nThe depreciation tests are carried out individually for each asset, except for those assets to which it is not possible to attach independent cash flows. In this case, these assets are regrouped within the CGU to which they belong and it is this which is tested. The CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments: network, maintenance, leisure and others which are homogeneous asset groups whose use generates identifiable cash inflows.\n\nWhen the  recoverable  value  of  an  asset  or  CGU  is  inferior  to  its  net  book  value,  an  impairment  is  recognized.  The impairment of a CGU is charged in the first instance to goodwill, the remainder being charged to the other assets which comprise the CGU, prorated to their net book value.\n\nNo  indication  of  impairment  has  been  identified.  Given the  existence  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with indefinite  useful  lives,  an  impairment  test  has  been carried  out,  in  accordance  with  IAS  36,  in  order  to  verify that the net assets of the cash-generating units (CGUs) do not  exceed  their  recoverable  amount.  The  test  is performed based on the values as of September 30 for the annual closing.\n\nThe  Group  monitors  any  significant  changes  that  could affect this calculation in the last quarter.\n\nThe  Group's  CGUs  correspond  to  the  Group's  business segments  (see Note 6.1 \"Information by business segment\"). Their carrying amounts break down as follows:\n\n| As of September, 30               | Network   | Network   | Maintenance   | Maintenance   | Transavia   | Transavia   | Other/Non allocated   | Other/Non allocated   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)                   | 2023      | 2022      | 2023          | 2022          | 2023        | 2022        | 2023                  | 2022                  |\n| Segment assets                    | 16,912    | 16,440    | 4,986         | 4,249         | 2,095       | 1,831       | 9,855                 | 12,043                |\n| Segment liabilities               | (11,835)  | (11,983)  | (1,989)       | (1,985)       | (1,787)     | (1,574)     | (18,237)              | (19,021)              |\n| NET SEGMENT ASSETS  (LIABILITIES) | 5,077     | 4,457     | 2,997         | 2,264         | 308         | 257         | (8,382)               | (6,978)               |\n\nThe net result from airline catering is mainly impacted by the Servair operating loss. However, the total fair value of the  Group's  34.9%  equity  interest  in  the  Servair  Group, including the put option recorded in the balance sheet in the  lines  other  derivatives  and  assets  held  for  sale, remains unchanged.\n\n## Other\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  equity  affiliates linked  to  the  Group's  other  businesses  are  mainly  jointventure  partnerships  entered  into  by  the  Group  in  the airport business. The localizations of the activities and the interest percentages in these partnerships are presented in Note 42.2.",

The new generation aircraft will represent 80% of the fleet in 2030.\n\nThe last two elements mentioned above, combined with eco-piloting, contribute  significantly to the Group's objective of reducing its CO2 emissions per passenger km by 30% in 2030 compared to 2019, and are consistent with the trajectory validated by SBTi in November 2022.\n\nCO2  quotas  prices  and  sustainable  aviation  fuel  prices (network and Transavia) are as follows:\n\n| As of December 31                                  | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| CO2 quotas price  (EUR/ton)                        | 90     | 94     | 97     | 101    | 105    |\n| Sustainable aviation fuel price  (USD/metric tons) | 2,164  | 2,762  | 2,686  | 2,593  | 2,529  |\n\nBeyond this period, the Group uses the long-term growth and current operating margin assumptions shown in the table below.

The  results  are  identical  for  the sensitivity tests performed:\n\n- \u25a0 with a WACC 50 bps higher associated with a 50 bps decrease in the long-term growth rate;\n- \u25a0 with  a  50  bps  increase  in  WACC  associated  with  a 50 bps decrease in target current operating margins.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For publicly-traded securities, the fair value is considered to be the market price at the closing date. For non-quoted securities, the valuation is made on the basis of the financial statements of the entity.\n\nThe valuation of equity instruments is either in fair value through the income statement or in fair value through other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u25a0 when the instrument is deemed to be a cash investment, i.e. it is held for the purposes of monetary transactions, its revaluations are recorded in 'Other financial income and expenses';\n- \u25a0 when the instrument is deemed to be a business investment, i.e. it is held for strategic reasons (as it mainly consists of investments in companies whose activity is very close to that of the Group), its revaluations are recorded in 'Other comprehensive income' non-recyclable. Dividends are recorded in the income statement.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial assets include financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (French mutual funds such as SICAV, FCP, certificates, etc.) that the Group intends to sell in the near term to realize a capital gain, or that are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments managed collectively and for which there is evidence of a practice of short-term profit taking. They are classified in the balance sheet as other current financial assets.\n\n| As of December 31                                | 2023                                             | 2023                                             | 2023                                             | 2022                                             | 2022                                             | 2022                                             |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                  | Current                                          | Non-current                                      | Of which:  pledged or  secured                   | Current                                          | Non-current                                      | Of which:  pledged or  secured                   |\n| EQUITY INSTRUMENTS \u207d \u00b9 \u207e                         |                                                  |                                                  |                                                  |                                                  |                                                  |                                                  |\n| Equity instruments at fair  value through OCI    | -

These costs include the direct and indirect production costs incurred under normal operating conditions.\n\nInventories are valued on a weighted average basis.\n\nThe  net  realizable  value  of  the  inventories  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\n| As of December 31 (in \u20ac millions)   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Aeronautical spare parts            | 889    | 801    |\n| Other supplies                      | 192    | 151    |\n| Work in progress                    | 27     | 23     |\n| Gross value                         | 1,108  | 975    |\n| Opening valuation allowance         | (252)  | (262)  |\n| Charge to allowance                 | (16)   | (27)   |\n| Use of allowance                    | 13     | 36     |\n| Currency translation adjustment     | -      | (1)    |\n| Reclassification                    | -      | 2      |\n| Closing valuation allowance         | (255)  | (252)  |\n| NET VALUE                           | 853    | 723    |\n\ncommit to repaying the bank directly on each payment date.

The  Group  therefore  decided  to  adjust  its  accounting  treatment  as described below:\n\n- \u25a0 free CO2 quotas allocated by the State and the ones purchased on the market recognized as intangible assets will now be disclosed in the line 'other assets' of the consolidated balance sheet and as an operating cash flow in the consolidated cash flow statement. These assets cannot be amortized;\n- \u25a0 the expense corresponding to the obligation to surrender quotas of the period will be integrated in the 'external expenses' of the consolidated income statement;\n- \u25a0 the  obligation  to  surrender  rights  valued  at  acquisition  cost  for  acquired  rights  -  including  free  quotas  -  and  at market price for rights not yet acquired remains a provision on the liability side.\n\nWhen the quotas corresponding to the actual emissions are returned to the State, the provision is cleared in exchange of the returned assets.\n\n| As of December 31                        | 2023    | 2023        | 2022 restated (1)   | 2022 restated (1)   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)                          | Current | Non-current | Current             | Non-current         |\n| Suppliers with debit balances            | 223     | -           | 97                  | -                   |\n| State receivables (including tax credit) | 162     | -           | 115                 | -                   |\n| CO2 quotas                               | 242     | 153         | 136                 | 78                  |\n| Prepaid expenses                         | 262     | -           | 229                 | -                   |\n| Other debtors                            | 236     | -           | 407                 | -                   |\n| Gross value                              | 1,125   | 153         | 984                 | 78                  |\n| Opening valuation allowance              | (5)     | -           | (8)                 | -                   |\n| Use of allowance                         | -       | -           | 3                   | -                   |\n| Closing valuation allowance              | (5)     | -           | (5)                 | -                   |\n| TOTAL                                    | 1,120   | 153         | 979                 | 78                  |\n\n- (1) See Note 3 of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net of issuance fees, the  proceeds  amounted  to  \u20ac2,196  million  (of  which \u20ac1,551  million  subscribed  in  cash).  Following  settlement and delivery of the Rights Issue of the capital increase on June  16,  2022,  the  share  capital  of  Air  France-KLM  was increased to 2,570,536,136 shares with a nominal value of \u20ac1 each.\n\nThe French State, participated on an irreducible basis to the full extent of its rights, corresponding  to  a subscription  of  551,404,728  New  Shares.  Its  shareholding remained  unchanged.  This  subscription  was  carried  out by way of offsetting a portion of the subordinated notes issued in April 2021.\n\nThe  Dutch  State  participated  on  an  irreducible  basis  to the full extent of its rights, corresponding  to  a subscription of 180,000,000 New Shares. Its shareholding remained unchanged.\n\nCMA CGM became a new shareholder with a subscription of 231,348,252 New Shares on an irreducible basis (via the exercise  of  the  preferential  subscription  rights  acquired from China Eastern Airlines, Delta Airlines, FCPEs and the market), corresponding to 9.0 percent of the Company's capital following the capital increase.",

        "page_content": "China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines participated in the  Rights  Issue  on  a  cash-neutral  basis,  subscribing  to 58,763,343  and  35,873,772  New  Shares  respectively  by using the net proceeds from selling part of their rights to CMA CGM. This brought their respective shareholdings to 4.7  percent  and  2.9  percent  of  the  Company's  share capital.\n\nFollowing this capital increase, in order to ensure that the rights  of  the  OCEANE  bondholders  are  maintained  in accordance  with  the  applicable  legal  and  regulatory provisions and the terms and conditions of the OCEANE bonds, the conversion/exchange ratio has been adjusted as  from  June  16,  2022  from  a  parity  of  1  Air  France-KLM share  per  OCEANE  bond  to  a  parity  of  1.783  Air  FranceKLM share per OCEANE bond.\n\nAs of August 31, 2023, Air France-KLM carried out a reverse stock-split of all the Company's outstanding shares, with the  concomitant  recognition  of  a  capital  reduction impacting share capital by \u20ac(2,314) million and additional paid-in capital by \u20ac2,314 million (see Note 4.1 'Significant events occurring during the period').\n\nOn  December  21,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  carried  out  a capital  increase  reserved  for  employees  of  5,716,256  fully paid-up shares, with a par value of \u20ac1, increasing capital by \u20ac6 million and additional paid-in capital by \u20ac29 million.\n\nThus  as  of  December  31,  2023,  the  issued  capital  of Air France-KLM  comprised  262,769,869  fully  paid-up shares with a par value of \u20ac1 and the share capital of the Air France-KLM group amounts to \u20ac263 million.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nTaking  into  account  these  transactions,  at  December  31, 2023, additional paid-in capital stands at \u20ac7,560 million.\n\nEach share is entitled to one vote. However, since April 3, 2016,  shareholders  who  have  owned  their  shares  for  at least two years have benefited from double voting rights.\n\nThe new shares are immediately entitled to double voting rights, provided they have been held in registered form, if at the date of the reverse stock-split each of the old shares from  which  they  were  issued  was  entitled  to  double voting  rights.  In  the  event  of  a  reverse  split  of  existing shares  that  have  been  held  in  registered  form  since different dates, the period used to determine the double voting rights of the new shares is deemed to begin on the most recent date on which the existing shares were held in registered form.\n\n## Authorized stock\n\nThe  Combined  General  Meeting  of  June  7,  2023 authorized  the  Board  of  Directors,  for  a  period  of  26 months from the date of the Meeting of June 7, 2023 (i.e. until  August  7,  2025),  to  issue  shares  and/or  other securities giving immediate or future access to the capital of Air France-KLM and/or to carry out capital increases by offering  to  qualified  investors  or  a  restricted  circle  of investors.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  available  balance  of  these authorizations  is  approximately  \u20ac128,5  million,  following capital transactions carried out during the year.\n\n## Breakdown of the share capital and voting rights\n\nThe breakdown of the share capital and voting rights is as follows:\n\n|                                 | Number of shares   | Number of shares   |   % of capital |   % of capital | % of voting rights   |   % of voting rights |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| As of December 31               | 2023               | 2022               |         2023   |         2022   | 2023                 |               2022   |\n| French State                    | 73,520,630         | 735,206,304        |           28   |           28.6 | 28.4                 |                 28.5 |\n| Dutch State                     | 24,000,000         | 240,000,000        |            9.1 |            9.3 | 10.3                 |                 10.7 |\n| CMA CGM                         | 23,134,825         | 231,348,252        |            8.8 |            9   | 8.0                  |                  8.3 |\n| China Eastern Airlines          | 12,023,544         | 120,235,442        |            4.6 |            4.7 | 6.3                  |                  5.6 |\n| Employees and former  employees | 8,461,524          | 30,024,610         |            3.2 |            1.2 | 3.4                  |                  1.6 |\n| Delta Air Lines                 | 7,340,118          | 73,401,182         |            2.8 |            2.9 | 3.8                  |                  4   |\n| SPAAK (1)                       | 2,241,065          | 22,410,656         |            0.8 |            0.9 | 1.0                  |                  1   |\n| Treasury shares                 | 143,608            | 1,208,005          |            0.1 |            0.1 | -                    |                  0.1 |\n| Other                           | 111,904,555        | 1,116,701,685      |           42.6 |           43.3 | 38.8                 |                 40.2 |\n| TOTAL                           | 262,769,869        | 2,570,536,136      |          100   |          100   | 100                  |                100   |\n\nThe line 'Employees and former employees' includes the shares held by employees and former employees identified in the ' Fonds Communs de Placement d'Entreprise (FCPE)'.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, all securities have been issued and paid up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The issue consisted of three perpetual tranches, each with a nominal value of \u20ac1 billion, a coupon of 7%, 7.25%  and  7.5%,  and  a  call  option  at  4,  5  and  6  years respectively.\n\nThis transaction resulted in the reclassification of 3 billion euros from \"financial liabilities\" to shareholders' equity.\n\nOn April 20, 2022, the Group paid accrued interest on the perpetual  subordinated  notes  held  by  the  French government  for  a  total  of  \u20ac218  million,  including \u20ac151 million in respect of accrued interest to December 31, 2021 and \u20ac67 million in respect of accrued interest at the date of payment.\n\nOn  June  16,  2022,  following  the  completion  of  the Air France-KLM group's capital increase, the subordinated perpetual  notes  held  by  the  French  State  were  partially redeemed  for  a  total  of  \u20ac1,649  million,  including \u20ac1,631  million  in  par  value  and  \u20ac18  million  in  accrued coupons.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, the proceeds of Apollo's investment were used to redeem \u20ac487 million in par value, plus \u20ac10 million in accrued interest to that date.\n\nOn December 9, 2022, a nominal amount of \u20ac287 million plus  accrued  interest  to  that  date  of  \u20ac14  million  was repaid with the proceeds of the subordinated bond issue.\n\nFinally,  on  March  17  and  April  19,  2023  respectively, Air France-KLM redeemed the balance of the subordinated  notes  held  by  the  French  State  under  the temporary framework linked to Covid-19, for an amount of \u20ac320  million and  \u20ac317  million  (including accrued coupons).  The  Group  also  paid  the  French  State  the compensation required for the shares subscribed in April 2021, in the amount of \u20ac90 million.\n\nThis  transaction  enables  Air  France  and  Air  France-KLM S.A. to exit the French state aid scheme.\n\n## 28.3.2 2023 perpetual super -subordinated bonds\n\nConcurrently with the redemption of the supersubordinated  notes  (refer  to  Note  28.3.1  '2021  perpetual super -subordinated bonds'), the Group refinanced \u20ac320  million  on  March  17,  2023  and  \u20ac407  million  on April  19,  2023  by  issuing  new  perpetual  subordinated notes  with  the  French  State  qualified  as  compensatory\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\naid, for Air France, for the damage suffered as a result of Covid-19 between March 17 and June 30, 2020.\n\nThese  new  unconstrained  subordinated  notes  carry similar  financial  conditions  to  those  redeemed  on  the same  day,  with  a  deferred  call  date  and  interest  rate increase of a further two years (i.e. March 2029).\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the balance of accrued interest on subordinated notes totaled \u20ac42 million.\n\n## 28.3.3 Last-rank indefinite subordinated bond convertible into new shares and/or existing shares\n\nOn November 16, 2022, Air France-KLM group issued lastrank indefinite subordinated bonds, convertible into new shares  and/or  existing  shares,  for  a  nominal  amount  of \u20ac301 million, net of issuance costs.\n\nThe bonds had been issued at par with a nominal value per  bond  of  \u20ac100,000  and  with  a  conversion/exchange premium  of  22.5%  over  the  reference  Air  France-KLM share price.\n\nFrom the issue date until November 23, 2025, the bonds bear interest at a nominal rate of 6.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. From November 23, 2025, the bonds will  bear  interest  at  a  rate  equal  to  1,300  basis  points above  the  applicable  3-year  Euro  Mid-Swap  rate  as reference  rate,  subject  to  review  every  three  years thereafter. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears.\n\nThe bonds are for an indefinite period, and the Air FranceKLM group may, at its option, redeem all the bonds early at  par  plus  interest,  for  the  first  time  on  November  23, 2025,  or  over  the  period  from  December  14,  2024  to November  23,  2025  if  certain  conditions  linked  to  the Air France-KLM share price are met.\n\nBondholders  may  exercise  their  conversion/exchange right at any time until November 10, 2025. The conversion/ exchange  ratio  was  initially  65,496.4632  Air  France-KLM shares per bond at December 31, 2022.\n\nHowever, following the reverse stock-split and by decision of the Chief Executive Officer, the conversion ratio of the last-ranking  perpetual  subordinated  bonds,  convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares, has been adjusted and amounts to 6 549,6463 Air FranceKLM shares per bond.\n\nLastly,  the  coupon  paid  during  the  year  amounted  to \u20ac20  million,  and  at  December  31,  2023,  the  balance  of accrued coupon totaled \u20ac2 million.\n\nFor details of deeply subordinated notes included in \"Noncontrolling interests\", see Note 28.6.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  commitments  are covered either by insurance or pension funds or by provisions recorded on the balance sheet as and when rights are acquired by employees.\n\nThe Group recognizes all its pension costs (defined contribution and defined benefit) in recurring operating income under 'personnel costs'. Changes in plans with a material impact are reported under 'Other non current income and expenses'. Plan curtailments, when linked to restructuring, are also presented under 'Other non current income and expenses'.\n\nThe Group recognizes in other comprehensive income all actuarial gains and losses on post employment plans, the difference between actual and expected return on pension assets, and the impact of any asset ceiling. When a definedbenefit pension plan is converted to a defined-contribution pension plan or closed, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to other reserves.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  long  term  benefit  plans  (mainly  long  services  awards)  are  recognized  in  the  income statement.\n\n## Pension Assets\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, taking into account the financial conditions, the pension plan in the United Kingdom is in a surplus  situation  according  to  IAS19  for  an  amount  of \u20ac45 million (\u20ac39 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\nGiven  the  plan  settlement,  the  agreement  with  the trustees and the application of IFRIC14, this surplus is fully recognised  in  the  balance  sheet.

The  specific  characteristics  of the plans (benefit formulas, funding policies and types of assets held) vary according to the regulations and laws in the  particular  countries  in  which  the  employees  are located.\n\n## Air France pension plan (CRAF) - France\n\nThe  employees  covered  by  this  plan  are  the  Air  France Ground Staff affiliated to the CRAF until December 31, 1992.\n\nThe participants receive, or will receive on retirement, an additional pension paid monthly or a lump sum based on the monthly annuity and definitively calculated based on the data known as of December 31, 1992 and expressed in the  form  of  points.  The  value  of  each  point  is  adjusted every  year  based  on  the  weighted  increases  seen  in  the CNAV  and  AGIRC-ARRCO  schemes  over  the  last  twelve months.\n\nUntil 2009, the CRAF had the legal form of a supplementary pension  institution  (pursuant  to  the  ' Code  de  S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale ').  With  this  status,  the  CRAF  was  responsible,  on behalf of the Air France ground staff employed in France, for managing the pension plan resulting from the merging of  the  Air  France  ground  staff  plan  with  the  mandatory pension plan for the private sector.\n\nFollowing the 2003 law on pension reform foreseeing the disappearance of supplementary pension institutions as of December 31, 2009, the CRAF's Board of Directors opted to\n\ntransform it into an institution managing supplementary pensions. The CRAF is now responsible for the administrative  functions  linked  to  the  plan.  The  pension rights  were  not  amended  by  this  reform.  Air  France  is directly responsible for the pension obligations.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2009,  all  the  funds  managed  by  the CRAF had been transferred to two insurance companies. On December 31, 2012, one of the insurance contracts was terminated  and  its  funds  were  transferred  to  the  other, which thus became the only insurer.\n\nThis  guarantees  a  capital  of  17  per  cent  equal  to  the amount  of  capital  invested  in  units  of  account  in  its collective fund, this percentage being automatically set to increase  over  time.  The  annual  payments  made  by Air France to the insurance company are governed by the agreement  signed  with  the  employee  representative bodies  on  December  14,  2009.  The  minimum  annual payment  defined  by  this  agreement  amounts  to \u20ac32.5 million as long as the life annuity guaranteed by the insurer  does  not  reach  85  per  cent  of  the  benefits payments for this plan without future revaluations. If the value  of  the  funds  falls  below  50  per  cent  of  the  total obligations calculated for funding purposes, Air France is required  to  make  an  additional  payment  to  achieve  a minimum 50 per cent coverage rate.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  coverage  of  liabilities  by reserves is 61 per cent in 2023 (59 per cent in 2022).\n\nThe  funds  are  invested  in  bonds,  equities  and  general assets  of  the  insurance  company.  Studies  of  assets/ liabilities allocation are carried out regularly, to verify the relevance of the investment strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Air France end of service benefit plan (ICS) - France\n\nPursuant  to  French  regulations  and  the  company agreements,  every  employee  receives  an  end  of  service indemnity on retirement.\n\nIn France, this indemnity depends on the number of years of  service,  the  professional  category  of  the  employee (flight deck  crew,  cabin  crew,  ground  staff,  agent, technician and executive) and, in some cases, on the age of  the  employee  at  retirement.  There  is  no  mandatory minimum funding requirement for this scheme.\n\nOn retirement, employees consequently receive an end of service indemnity based on their final salaries over the last twelve-months  and  on  their  seniority.  The  indemnity  is only payable to employees on their retirement date.\n\nAir  France  has  nevertheless  signed  contracts  with  three insurance  companies  to  partly  pre-finance  the  plan. Air  France  has  sole  responsibility  for  payment  of  the indemnities, but remains free to make payments to these insurance companies.\n\nThe relevant outsourced funds are invested in bonds and equities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the two French plans presented above represented a respective 67 per cent (67 in 2022 as well) of the Group's defined benefit obligation and 46 per cent  (45  per  cent  in  2022)  of  the  Group's  pension  plan assets.\n\n## 29.2 Description of the actuarial assumptions and related sensitivities\n\nActuarial valuations of the Group's benefit obligation were made as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nThese calculations include:\n\n- \u25a0 assumptions on staff turnover and the life expectancy of the plan beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 assumptions on salary and pension increases;\n- \u25a0 assumptions  on  retirement  ages  varying  from  50  to 68 years depending on the localization and applicable laws;\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u25a0 inflation  rates  determined  with  reference  to  the inflation  swaps  applied  to  the  Group's  cash  flows  and based on the duration of the schemes:\n\n| As of December 31                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Euro zone -                         |        |        |\n| Duration 10 to 15 years             | 2.20%  | 2.55%  |\n| United Kingdom -  Duration 20 years | 3.15%  | 3.35%  |\n\n- \u25a0 discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations.\n\nThe discount rates for the different geographical areas are thus  determined  based  on  the  duration  of  each  plan, taking into account the average trend in interest rates on investment grade bonds, observed on the main available indices. In some countries, where the market in this type of  bond  is  not  sufficiently  broad,  the  discount  rate  is determined with reference to government bonds. Most of the  Group's  benefit  obligations  are  located  in  the  Euro zone  and  in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  the  discount rates used are as follows:\n\n| As of December 31                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Euro zone -                         |        |        |\n| Duration 10 to 15 years             | 3.20%  | 3.80%  |\n| United Kingdom -  Duration 20 years | 4.60%  | 4.80%  |\n\nThe  duration  rates  presented  concern  mainly  plans located in France and the United Kingdom:\n\n- \u25a0 discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the service cost. Since January 1, 2017, by using adequate flows, the Group has refined its calculations on  the  discount  rate  used  for  the  service-cost calculation. As of December 31, 2023, in the euro zone and in the United Kingdom, the discount rates used to calculate the service cost is equal to the rates used to discount the liabilities;\n- \u25a0 on  average,  the  main  assumptions  used  to  value  the liabilities are summarized below;\n- \u00b7 the rate of salary increase is 3.79% for the Group as of December 31, 2023 against 4.04% as of December 31, 2022,\n- \u00b7 the rate of pension increase is 2.53% for the Group as of December 31, 2023 against 2.74% as of December 31, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The constitution of these return obligation liabilities and provisions  depends  on  the  type  of  maintenance  obligations  to  fulfill  before  returning  these  aircraft  to  the  lessors: overhaul and restoration work, airframe and engine potential reconstitution as well as the replacement of limited life parts.\n\nRestitutions  liabilities  and  provisions  for  leased  aircrafts  are  revalued  each  year  to  take  account  of  changes  in  the discount rate. This discount rate is determined using free interest rate assumptions, plus a spread on risky debt.\n\nThe effect of undiscounting and translation of foreign currency denominated restitution liabilities and provisions are recognized in 'other financial income and expenses' (see Note 12 'Cost of financial debt and other financial income and expenses').\n\n## Overhaul and restoration works (not depending on aircraft utilization)\n\nCosts resulting from work required to be performed just before returning aircraft to the lessors, such as painting of the shell or aircraft overhaul ('C Check') are recognized as provisions as of the inception of the contract in accordance with IFRC1. The counterpart of these provisions is booked as a complement through the initial book value of the aircraft rightof-use assets. This complement to the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term.\n\n## Airframe and engine potentials reconstitution (depending on the utilization of the aircraft and its engines)\n\nIn accordance with IFRC1, the airframe and the engine potentials as well as the limited life parts are recognized as a complement to  the  right-of-use  assets  since  they  are  considered  as  fully-fledged  components,  as  distinct  from  the physical  components which are the engine and the airframe. These components are the counterparts of the return obligation  liability,  recognized  in  its  totality  at  the  inception  of  the  contract.  When  maintenance  events  aimed  at reconstituting these potentials or replacing the limited life parts take place, the costs incurred are capitalized. These potentials and the limited life parts are depreciated over the period of use of the underlying assets (flight hours for the engine potentials component, straight-line for the airframe potentials component and cycles for the limited life parts).\n\n## Provisions for CO 2 quota surrenders\n\nPlease refer to the accounting principles in Note 25 'Other assets'.\n\n## Others provisions\n\nThe Group recognizes a provision in the balance sheet when it has an existing legal or implicit obligation to a third party as  a  result  of  a  past  event,  and  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the obligation. The amounts recorded as provisions are discounted when the effect of the passage of time is material. The effect of the time value of money is presented as a component of 'Other financial income and expenses'.\n\nA  provision  for  onerous  contracts  is  recognised  when  the  unavoidable  costs  of  meeting  the  contractual  obligations exceed the expected economic benefits. Within the Group, the issue of onerous contracts is limited to the Maintenance business.\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognized once the Group has established a detailed and formalized restructuring plan which has been announced to the parties concerned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such provisions are created when the Group estimates, in the context  of  tax  audits,  that  the  tax  authorities  may challenge a tax position taken by the Group or one of its subsidiaries.\n\nIn  the  normal course of its activities, the Air France-KLM Group,  its  subsidiaries  Air  France  and  KLM  (and  their subsidiaries)  are  involved  in  litigation  cases,  some  of which may be significant.\n\n## 30.1.4 Litigation concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nAir France, KLM and Martinair, a wholly-owned subsidiary of  KLM  since  January  1,  2009,  have  been  involved,  since February  2006,  with  up  to  twenty-five  other  airlines  in investigations  initiated  by  the  antitrust  authorities  in several  countries,  with  respect  to  allegations  of  anticompetitive  agreements  or  concerted  actions  in  the  air freight industry.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, most of these investigations had been terminated following the entry into plea agreements between the three companies of the Group and the appropriate competition authorities, providing for the  payment  of  settlement  amounts  or  fines,  with  the exception  of  the  proceeding  initiated  by  the  European Commission which is still pending.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  decision  of  the  European  Commission  of 2010  against  eleven  air  cargo  carriers,  including  the companies of  the  Group,  Air  France,  KLM  and  Martinair, was annulled by the General Court of the European Union on December 16, 2015 because it contained a contradiction regarding the exact scope of the practices\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nsanctioned. On March 17, 2017, the European Commission issued a new decision against the aforementioned cargo carriers, including Air France, KLM and Martinair. The total amount of fines imposed in respect of this decision at the Air France-KLM group level was \u20ac339 million. This amount was slightly reduced by \u20ac15.4 million as compared to the initial  decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical  reasons.  On  May  29  and  30,  2017,  the  Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The hearings before the General Court took place on June and July 2019.\n\nThe  decision  from  the  General  Court  in  March  2022 confirmed  the  fines  against  Air  France-KLM  group companies. The Group companies appealed in June 2022 to  the  European  Union  Court  of  Justice  and  are  still waiting  for  hearing  dates.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the Group has maintained a provision of \u20ac361 million covering the total amount of these fines (and including interests).\n\n## 30.1.5 Case brought against KLM by (former) Martinair pilots\n\nIn  2015,  a  case  was  brought  against  KLM  by  152  (former) Martinair airline pilots, hereafter called 'Vrachtvliegers'. In 2016 and 2018, the District Court and Court of Appeal ruled in  favor  of  KLM  and  rejected  all  claims  of  plaintiffs.  In November  2019,  however,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled against KLM on the basis of lack of sufficient motivation and  referred  the  case  to  another  Court  of  appeal.  On June 8, 2021, this Court of appeal rendered its judgment in favor  of  the  plaintiffs,  the  former  Martinair  pilots,  ruling that  the  transfer  of  the  cargo  department  qualifies  as  a transfer of undertaking.\n\nAccording to the ruling the rights and obligations under the employment  contracts  of 116 Martinair pilots automatically transfer to KLM as per January 1, 2014. The Court  of  Appeal  rejected  the  plaintiffs'  claim  to  also transfer the rights regarding seniority accrued  at Martinair.\n\nVrachtvliegers  filed  complaints  on  August  8,  2021  at  the Supreme  Court  claiming  that  the  rights  regarding seniority accrued at Martinair should transfer to KLM. On June 24, 2022, the General Attorney has given the advice to  the  Supreme  Court  that  the  complaints  should  be rejected.  On  January  20,  2023,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled that this claim is denied, except for one part of the verdict. The  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  the  motivations  was  not conclusive on the item that seniority does not transfer in case of redundancy.\n\nThe  pilots  also  started  a  new  court  case  about  the implementation by KLM of the 'transfer of undertaking'. The hearing took place on November 15, 2023. The Court rendered  a  decision  on  January  11,  2024,  in  which  all claims have been declined except that seniority built up within Martinair should be respected in case of dismissal (which is in line with current law).\n\nIn 2022, KLM had booked a provision for a total amount of \u20ac22 million, unchanged in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group companies  and  the  other  airlines  involved  in  these lawsuits continue to vigorously oppose these civil claims.\n\n## 30.2.2 Other litigations\n\n## Rio-Paris AF447 flight\n\nOn March 28, 2011, Air France and Airbus were indicted for manslaughter of the 228 victims who died in the crash of the AF447 Rio-Paris flight on June 1, 2009.\n\nThe  investigating  judges  of  the  Court  of  First  Instance ruled in favor of Air France and Airbus by issuing an order dismissing the case on September 4, 2019.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office and most of the civil parties (including  the  Pilots'  associations  and  unions)  appealed this  decision.  The  Paris  Court  of  Appeals  ruled  on  May  12, 2021, referring Airbus and Air France to the Criminal Court. The  criminal  trial took place from  October  10  to December  8,  2022  at  Paris  Criminal  Court.  After  an acquittal by the Public Prosecutor's Office, the Court issued a  judgment  of  acquittal  on  April  17,  2023,  based  on  the absence of a causal link between the faults found and the accident.  On  April  27,  2023,  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office appeals against the acquittal of Airbus and Air France.\n\nThe appeal should take place in 12 to 18 months starting from the appeal date.\n\n## Litigations on State Aid\n\nIn 2020, the implementation of the measures to reinforce the  Group's  liquidity  (a  loan  guaranteed  by  the  French State  (PGE)  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac4  billion  and  a  \u20ac3  billion loan  from  the  French  State,  together  with  a  revolving credit  facility  of  \u20ac2.4  billion  guaranteed  by  the  Dutch State  and  a  \u20ac1  billion  loan  from  the  Dutch  State),  were approved by the European Commission under the State Aid  rules  (decisions  of  May  4,  2020,  annulled  on December  20,  2023  by  the  General  Court  the  European Union, and July 13, 2020 annulled on May 19, 2021 by the General Court of the European Union for failure to state reasons  and  replaced  by  another  positive  Commission decision  of  July  16,  2021  correcting  this  failure  also annulled on February 7, 2024).\n\nOn April 6, 2021, the Group announced the first part of its overall recapitalization plan. Certain measures in this plan contained  State  Aid  (so-called  'Covid-19  recapitalization\" program)  which  were  accordingly  notified  by  the  French authorities  to  the  European  Commission,  the  latter approving them in its decision of April 5, 2021 (annulled on December 20, 2023 by the General Court of the European Union). This decision made the approval of the measures subject to a number of commitments undertaken by the French  State  and  leading  notably  to  the  allocation  by Air  France  of  landing  and  take-off  slots  to  a  designated third-party  carrier  at  Orly  airport.  Other  undertakings  by the  French  State  were  also  imposed  to  the  Group companies (to  the  exception  of  KLM  and  its  subsidiaries) within  the  framework  of  the  European  Commission's Temporary Framework for State Aid (such as restrictions on acquisitions, share buybacks and dividend payments) and could  have  an  impact  on  the  Group's  activities.  All  these constraints  have  disappeared  since  the  full  repayment  of this recapitalization aid on April 19, 2023. Only the provision concerning  slots  at  Orly  is  still  being  implemented  in accordance with the Commission's decision.\n\nLike  most  most  of  the  decisions  with  respect  to  airlines receiving State Aid in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, the European  Commission's  decisions  granting  support measures  to  Air  France  and  KLM  have  been  subject  to annulment proceedings brought by Ryanair. On December  20,  2023  and  February  7,  2024,  the  General Court of the European Union annulled the decisions of the European  Commission  which  had  approved  the  above mentioned support measures, respectively for (i) \u20ac7 billion euros of liquidity measures granted by the French State to Air France in May 2020 and \u20ac3.6 billion of recapitalization measures granted by the French State to Air France and Air France-KLM S.A. in 2021, and (ii) \u20ac0.9 billion in liquidity measures granted to KLM by the Dutch State in 2020.\n\nUntil a final decision or judgment is obtained, there is still uncertainty as to the legal and financial consequences of the annulment of decisions to grant state aid. However, all the aid granted has already been repaid in full compliance with  the  constraints  linked  (commitments,  behavioral measures, application of interest)  to  the  applicable  legal framework.",

        "page_content": "The potential indirect consequences of the cancellation of the  above  mentioned  state  aids  could  include  in particular, the demand for illegality interest.\n\nIn order to protect its interests, the Air France-KLM group intends to lodge an appeal against the judgments of the General Court annulling the above mentioned decisions. At  the  date  of  this  report,  the  European  Commission  is expected  to  lodge  an  appeal.  However,  as  it  has  been done in similar cases, the European Commission may also decide,  if  necessary,  to  initiate  a  formal  examination procedure,  during  which  the  Group  will  defend  its interests to the best of its ability.\n\n## NOTE 31 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## Convertible bonds\n\nConvertible bonds are deemed to be financial instruments comprising two components: a bond component recorded as debt and a stock component recorded in equity. The bond component is equal to the discounted value of all the coupons due on the bond at the rate of a simple bond that would have been issued at the same time as the convertible bond. The value of the stock component recorded in the Group's equity is calculated by the difference between this value and the bond's nominal value at issuance.\n\nThe difference between the financial expense recorded and the amounts effectively paid out is added, at each closing date,  to  the  amount  of  the  debt  component  so  that,  at  maturity,  the  amount  to  be  repaid  if  there  is  no  conversion equals the redemption price.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nBorrowings and financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value. Subsequent to the initial measurement, they are recorded:\n\n- \u25a0 at their net book value for bonds;\n- \u25a0 based  on  amortized  cost  calculated  using  the  effective  interest  rate  for  the  other  financial  liabilities.  Under  this principle, any redemption and issue premiums, as well as issue costs, are recorded as debt in the balance sheet and amortized as financial income or expense over the life of the loans using the effective interest method.\n\n| As of December 31                           |        | 2023         | 2023    | 2023   | 2022         | 2022    | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|---------|--------|--------------|---------|--------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)                             | Notes  | Non  current | Current | Total  | Non  current | Current | Total  |\n| Perpetual subordinated loan in Yen          | 31.1.1 | 128          | -       | 128    | 142          | -       | 142    |\n| Perpetual subordinated loan in Swiss francs | 31.1.2 | 405          | -       | 405    | 381          | -       | 381    |\n| OCEANE (convertible bonds)                  | 31.2.1 | -            | 498     | 498    | 487          | -       | 487    |\n| Sustainability-linked bonds                 | 31.2.2 | 1,000        | -       | 1,000  | -            | -       | -      |\n| Plain vanilla Bonds                         | 31.2.3 | 1,381        | 300     | 1,681  | 1,686        | -       | 1,686  |\n| Debt on leases with bargain option          |        | 3,475        | 418     | 3,893  | 3,163        | 496     | 3,659  |\n| Loan guaranteed by the French state         | 31.3   | -            | -       | -      | 2,606        | -       | 2,606  |\n| Other financial liabilities                 | 31.4   | 1,148        | 330     | 1,478  | 1,191        | 293     | 1,484  |\n| Accrued interest                            |        | 1            | 118     | 119    | 1            | 107     | 108    |\n| TOTAL - FINANCIAL LIABILITIES               |        | 7,538        | 1,664   | 9,202  | 9,657        | 896     | 10,553 |\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  points  set  out  in  paragraphs 30.1 and 30.2, the company is not aware of any litigation, governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings of which the issuer is aware, which are pending or which it is threatened with) which may have or  have  recently  had  a  material  effect  on  the  company's financial position, results of operations, assets or profitability,  for  a  period  covering at least the last twelve months.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 31.1.2 KLM perpetual subordinated debt in Swiss Francs\n\nThe  perpetual  subordinated  bond  debt  in  Swiss  Francs (CHF) was issued by KLM in two tranches, one in 1985 and one  in  1986.  The  initial  nominal  amount  for  these  two perpetual bonds combined was CHF 500 million.\n\nOver  the  years,  KLM  has  proceeded  with  several  partial buy back transactions to partially redeem the debt. As a result, the  total amount  now  outstanding  is  CHF 375 million, i.e. \u20ac405 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nConcerning the tranche issued in 1985, KLM is entitled to early  redeem  at  Par  the  then-prevailing  outstanding residual amount on each tenth anniversary of the interest payment  date.  The  next  'call  date'  is  February  12,  2025. The  coupon  reset  date  is  fully  aligned  with  the  above mentioned frequency.  If  the  call  option  is  not  exercised, the  next  coupon  reset  date  is  February  12,  2025.  The current outstanding coupon is 0.75% per annum.\n\nConcerning the tranche issued in 1986, the KLM Group is entitled to early redeem the outstanding residual nominal amount  at  Par  on  each  fifth  anniversary  of  the  interest payment date. The next 'call date' is May 15, 2026. The call price  amount  in  2001  was  101.75%  of  the  notional  face value, and thereafter with a premium declining by 0.25% on  each  fifth  anniversary  of  the  interest  payment  date. From May 15, 2036, the amount of early redemption will thus be set at 100% of the residual Par. The debt is subject to the payment of a coupon of 5.75% per annum.\n\nThe  two  CHF  perpetual  bond  debts  are  ranked  'pari passu'  with  the  JPY  perpetual  loan  debt  and  are subordinated to all other existing and future debt at KLM.\n\n## 31.2 Bonds\n\n## 31.2.1 OCEANE\n\nOn March 20, 2019, Air France-KLM issued 27,901,785 bonds convertible  and/or  exchangeable  for  new  or  existing Air  France-KLM  shares  (OCEANE)  with  a  maturity  date fixed  at  March  25,  2026  for  a  total  nominal  amount  of \u20ac500 million. Each bond has a nominal value of \u20ac17.92. The annual coupon amounts to 0.125%. The conversion period of  these  bonds  runs  from  May  4,  2019  to  the  seventh working day preceding the normal or early reimbursement date. The conversion ratio is one share for one bond.\n\nRepayment at par, plus accrued interest, will be possible on  March  25,  2024  at  the  request  of  the  bond  holders. Air  France-KLM  can  enforce  the  cash  reimbursement  of these  bonds  by  exercising  a  call  option  running  from\n\nApril  15,  2022  if  the  share  price  exceeds  130%  of  the nominal,  i.e.  \u20ac23.29,  encouraging  OCEANE  bond  holders to convert their bonds into Air France-KLM shares.\n\nUpon  issue  of  these  convertible  bonds,  Air  France-KLM recorded  a  debt  of  \u20ac446  million,  corresponding  to  the present value of future payments of interest and nominal discounted  at  the  rate  of  a  similar  bond  without  a conversion  option.  The  option  value,  calculated  by deducting this debt value from the total nominal amount of the issue (i.e. \u20ac500 million), was recorded in equity.\n\nFollowing  the  realization  of  the  capital  increase  of Air France-KLM group on June 16, 2022, to ensure that the rights  of  the  OCEANE  bond  holders  are  maintained  in accordance  with  the  applicable  legal  and  regulatory provisions and the terms and conditions of the OCEANE bonds, the conversion/exchange ratio has been adjusted as  from  June  16,  2022  from  a  parity  of  1  Air  France-KLM share  per  OCEANE  bond  to  a  parity  of  1.783  Air  FranceKLM  share  per  OCEANE  bond  (see  Note  4.1  'Significant events occurring during the period').\n\nThis  operation  had  no  impact  on  the  value  recorded under financial liabilities.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  debt  value  amount  to \u20ac498 million.\n\n## 31.2.2 Sustainability-linked bonds\n\nOn  January  9,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  has  placed  its  first sustainability-linked  bonds,  for  a  nominal  amount  of \u20ac1 billion, linked to the Company's target to reduce its jet fuel  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  per  revenue  tonne kilometer  (RTK)  by  10%  by  2025,  compared  to  a  2019 baseline, as part of its 2030 SBTi approved objective.\n\nThe emission is composed of two tranches:\n\n- \u25a0 a \u20ac500 million with a maturity as of May 31, 2026 and a coupon of 7.250%; and\n- \u25a0 a \u20ac500 million with a maturity as of May 31, 2028 and a coupon of 8.125%.\n\nIt has  been  accounted  for  in  non  current  financial liabilities in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  following  conditions  apply  in  the  event  of  non achievement by the Group of the target of decreasing by 10% its jet fuel greenhouse gas emission by 2025:\n\n- \u25a0 Tranch 1, a 0.75% step up on the coupon to be paid at the maturity date;\n- \u25a0 Tranch 2, a 0.375% step up on the coupon to be paid each year from May 31, 2026 to the maturity date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  repayment generated  a  net  positive  impact  of  \u20ac10  million  in financial  income.  It  comprises  an  expense  of  \u20ac(96) million  in  respect  of  the  guarantee  contractually  due, recognized in the \"Interest on financial liabilities\"  line, and income of \u20ac106 million, linked to the application of the  amortized  cost  methodology  at  the  effective interest rate, recognized in the \"Other non-cash items\" line  (see  Note  12  \"Cost  of  financial  debt  and  other financial income and expenses\").\n- \u25a0 a  \u20ac3  billion  shareholder  loan  granted  by  the  French State to Air France-KLM, with a four year maturity and two consecutive one year extension options exercisable by Air France-KLM.\n- The company has undertaken not to pay any dividends until these loans have been fully repaid.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, the \u20ac3 billion direct loan granted by the  French  State  to  Air  France  via  Air  France-KLM  at the  end  of  May  2020,  was  converted  into  super subordinated  bonds  of  the  same  nominal  amount, allowing the Group to improve its equity by \u20ac3 billion without  impacting  cash  flow,  while  increasing  the\n\nflexibility  of  its  debt  repayment  profile.  This  issue  was made up of three tranches with perpetual maturities of a nominal amount of \u20ac1 billion each, each with a first redemption option (call) at 4, 5 and 6 years respectively.\n\nMovements in deeply subordinated notes are described in Note 28.3 'Perpetual'.\n\n## Financial support package of \u20ac3.4 billion backed by the Dutch State\n\nOn  June  25,  2020,  the  Dutch  State,  the  Air  France-KLM group  and  KLM  have  finalized  an  agreement  on  a financial  support  mechanism  supported  by  the  Dutch State for an amount of \u20ac3.4 billion. This financial support package included two loans for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- \u25a0 a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4 billion, 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State and with a maturity of 5 years;\n- \u25a0 a direct loan of \u20ac1 billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM,  with  a  maturity  of  5.5  years.  This  loan  is subordinated to the new revolving credit facility.\n\nBoth the revolving credit facility and the direct loan were drawn down simultaneously on a pro rata basis.\n\nThe main conditions associated with the direct State loan were  linked  to  manageable  cost  improvements,  the airline  becoming  more  sustainable  and  the  restored performance  and  competitiveness  of  KLM,  including  a comprehensive  restructuring  plan  and  contributions made by employees.\n\nKLM had undertaken to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until these two loans had been repaid in full.\n\nRespectively,  on  May  3  and  June  3,  2022,  KLM  repaid \u20ac311  million  and  \u20ac354  million  under  its  credit  line guaranteed by the Dutch State. Upon completion of the transaction, the full credit line has been repaid.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, KLM repaid in full the loan guaranteed by the Dutch State for \u20ac277 million.",

This  program  enables  members  to acquire Miles as they fly with Air France, KLM and airline partners and from transactions with non-airline partners (credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies). These Miles entitle members to a range of benefits such as free flights with Air France, KLM and their airline partners or other free services with non-airline partners.\n\nMiles are considered as separate elements of a sale of a ticket with multiple elements and one part of the price of the initial sale of the ticket is allocated to these Miles and deferred until the Group's commitments relating to these Miles have been met.\n\nThe deferred amount due in relation to the acquisition of Miles by members is estimated:\n\n- \u25a0 according to the fair value of the Miles, defined as the amount for which the benefits could be sold separately;\n- \u25a0 after  taking  into  account  the  redemption  rate,  corresponding  to  the  probability  that  the  Miles  will  be  used  by members, using a statistical method.\n\nWith regard to the re-invoicing of Miles between the partners in the program, the margins realized on sales of these Miles are recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\nWithin Air-France-KLM, there are two loyalty programs: Flying Blue and BlueBiz. For those two programs, the amount recognized in liabilities is as follows:\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Flying Blue       |    802 |    792 |\n| BlueBiz           |     97 |    108 |\n| TOTAL             |    899 |    900 |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 the deferred revenues relating to Flying  Blue  miles  loyalty  program  expected  to  be  used amount  to  \u20ac802  million,  after  taking  into  account  a redemption rate.\n\nThe redemption of this debt, without taking into account future accruals, is estimated over a 5-year horizon.\n\nThe  breakdown  of  the  Flying  Blue  program  is  the following:\n\n## Flying Blue - Deferred revenues\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| As of January 1   | 792    | 794    |\n| Accumulation      | 419    | 337    |\n| Redemption        | (409)  | (339)  |\n| As of December 31 | 802    | 792    |\n\n## NOTE 34 OTHER LIABILITIES\n\n| As of December 31            | 2023    | 2023        | 2022    | 2022        |\n|------------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)              | Current | Non-current | Current | Non-current |\n| Tax liabilities              | 412     | 637         | 451     | 854         |\n| Airlines taxes               | 908     | -           | 780     | -           |\n| Employee-related liabilities | 1,991   | 597         | 1,175   | 1,335       |\n| Liabilities on fixed assets  | 56      | 7           | 55      | -           |\n| Deferred income              | 919     | 32          | 877     | 34          |\n| Prepayments received         | 464     | -           | 412     | -           |\n| Other                        | 252     | 103         | 307     | 120         |\n| TOTAL                        | 5,002   | 1,376       | 4,057   | 2,343       |\n\nNon-current deferred income mainly relates to long-term contracts in the maintenance business.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 35 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the risks incurred on shares, exchange rates, changes of interest rates or fuel prices and ETS (Emission Trading Scheme).\n\nForward currency contracts and options are used to hedge exposure to exchange rates.\n\nThe Group also uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Most of the swaps traded convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.\n\nThe exposure to fuel risk is hedged by swaps or options on jet fuel, diesel or Brent.\n\nFinally, the risk related to the ETS is hedged by forwards.\n\nMost of these derivatives are classified as hedging instruments if the derivative is eligible as a hedging instrument and if the hedging relationships are documented as required by IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'.\n\nThese derivative instruments are recorded on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at their fair value adjusted for the market value of the Group's credit risk (DVA) and the credit risk of the counterparty (CVA). The method of accounting for changes in fair value depends on the classification of the derivative instruments.\n\nThere are three classifications:\n\n## \u25a0 derivatives classified as fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded through the income statement and offset within the limit of its effective portion against the changes in the fair value of the underlying item (asset, liability or firm commitment), which are also recognized through the income statement;\n\n## \u25a0 derivatives classified as cash flow hedge\n\nChanges in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion and are reclassified  as  income  when  the  hedged  element  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  is  recorded  as  financial income or losses until the termination of the derivative. When the termination occurs, the residual ineffective portion is recycled on the hedged item;\n\n## \u25a0 derivatives classified as trading\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as financial income or losses.\n\nFor options, only the intrinsic risk can be hedged. The time value is excluded as it is considered as a cost of hedging. The change in fair value of the option time value is recognized in other comprehensive income in so far as it relates to the hedged item. When the latter occurs (if the hedged item is transaction related), the change in fair value is then recycled and impacts the hedged item or is amortized over the hedging period (if the hedged item is time-related).\n\nThe  difference  in  time  value  between  non-aligned  structured  options  and  the  related  'vanilla'  ('aligned')  options  is recognized in the profit and loss account.\n\nRegarding  forward  contracts,  only  the  spot  component  is  considered  as  a  hedging  instrument,  since  the  forward element is considered as a hedging cost and accounted for similarly to the option time value.\n\nThe currency swap basis spread is also excluded from the hedging instrument and considered to be a hedging cost.\n\n## Non-current derivative financial assets\n\nThe  Group  considers  that  the  change  in  credit  risk  on  the  non-current  derivative  financial  assets  since  their  initial recognition is limited due to the current selection criteria (e.g. type of instrument, counterparty rating, maturity). The impairment recorded by the Group consists of the expect credit loss over the 12 months following the closing date.\n\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are booked as of the transaction date.\n\nThe aim of the Air France-KLM group's risk management strategy is to reduce its exposure to such risks. Market risk coordination and management is the responsibility of the Risk Management Committee (RMC) which is composed of the Chief Financial Officer of Air France-KLM, and the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, head of Financial Operations of Air France-KLM, and the Chief Financial Officers of Air France and of KLM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

A sharp increase in the oil price can have a very material  negative  impact  on  the  profitability  of  airlines, particularly if the economic environment does not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies. Similarly, a sharp decline  in  fuel  prices  is  favorable  for  airline  profitability. However, the way in which airlines pass on a sharp fall in the  fuel  price  in  their  fares  is  a  factor  of  significant uncertainty.\n\nIn addition to fare adjustments and permanent efforts to reduce fuel consumption, the Group has implemented a policy of systematically hedging the fuel price risk.\n\nThe hedging strategy:\n\n- \u25a0 sets the time span of the hedges;\n- \u25a0 sets  the  target  hedging  ratios  to  be  reached  for  the coming quarters;\n\nIn  respect  of  the  application  of  IFRS  9,  hedging  by component is applied. Since the Group's fuel procurement  is  strongly  correlated  to  the  Jet  Kerosene Cargoes CIF NWE Index, components specific to this fuel risk are used (Brent ICE, Gasoil ICE, Jet CIF NWE) to align the  fuel  hedging  accounting  and  the  Group's  risk management policy more effectively.\n\nIn a  context  of  high  volatility  and  tension  in  the commodity  market  due  to  the  geopolitical  events  since 2022,  the  Air  France-KLM  group  has  incorporated  new hedging instruments on crack spreads in order to better cover  the  risk  associated  with  the  decoupling  between indices  reflecting  the  price  of  crude  oil  (Brent  ice)  and indices reflecting the price of refined products (Gasoil ICE and Jet CIF NEW).\n\nThe  fuel  hedging  policy,  prevailing  since  February  2021, has been updated and became effective during the first quarter  of  2024.  From  a  rolling  12-month  period,  it  has been extended to cover 18 months. The hedging portfolio will represent 68% of annual consumption.\n\n- \u25a0 the  hedging  uses  simple  futures  or  option-based instruments,  eligible  for  hedging  pursuant  to  the accounting standards in force.\n\nThe Group's commitments on Brent, Gas Oil and Jet CIF are presented below, at their nominal value:\n\n| As of December 31, 2023             |                                   |                                   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   |                                   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)                     | Nominal                           | Maturity  below  1 year           | 1-2  years                         | 2-3  years                         | 3-4  years                         | 4-5  years                         | +5  years                          | Fair  value                       |\n| CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS   | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS  | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS  | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS  | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS  | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS  | CASH FLOW HEDGING OPERATING FLOWS |\n| Forward purchases                   | 261                               | 251                               | 10                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (4)                               |\n| Options                             | 2,320                             | 2,274                             | 46                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (59)                              |\n| Sub-total                           | 2,581                             | 2,525                             | 56                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (63)                              |\n| Receivables/payables on fuel hedges | -                                 | -                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (2)                               |\n| TOTAL                               | 2,581                             | 2,525                             | 56                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (65)                              |\n| Price after hedge USD/Metric Tons   | -                                 | 964                               | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                 |\n\nThe price after hedge of the total fuel expenses is equal to the market price, to which unitary into-plane costs and hedge results have been added.

A  100  basis  point  variation  (increase  or  decrease)  in interest rates would have an impact of \u20ac20 million on the financial  income  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023 versus \u20ac40 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## 35.3 Exchange rate risk\n\nMost  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group's  revenues  are generated in euros. However, because of its international activities,  the  Group  incurs  a  foreign  exchange  risk.  The principal  exposure  relates  to  the  US  dollar.  Since  the expenditure  on  items  such  as  fuel  and  components exceeds the amount of revenues in dollars, the Group is a net  buyer  of  US  dollars.  As  a  result,  any  significant appreciation in the dollar against the euro could result in a negative impact on the Group's financial results.\n\nOn the other hand, Air France-KLM group is a net seller of other currencies, the level of revenues in these currencies exceeding  its  expenditure.  This  exposure  is  far  less significant than on the US dollar. As a result, any significant decline in these currencies against the euro would have a negative effect on the Group's financial results.\n\nThe  management  of  the  Group's  exchange  rate  risk  is carried out based on the forecasted net exposure for each currency. Currencies which are highly correlated to the US dollar are aggregated with the US dollar exposure.\n\nFor each currency hedged, the time span of the hedging is  a  rolling  12  to  24-month  period,  the  first  four  quarters having more hedging than the following four.\n\nAircrafts  are  mostly  paid  for  in  US  dollars,  meaning  that the  Group  is  exposed  to  an  appreciation  in  the  dollar relative  to  the  euro  in  terms  of  its  investments  in  flight equipment.  The  hedging  strategy  provides  the  gradual implementation  of  hedging  between  the  aircrafts  order date and their delivery.\n\nThe  exchange  rate  risk  on  the  Group's  financial  debt  is limited.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  82%  of  the  Group's financial debt, after taking  into  account  derivative instruments, was euro-denominated, thereby significantly reducing the risk of currency fluctuation on the debt. The exchange  rate  risk  on  debt  denominated  in  other currencies mostly concerns the Yen for 8%, the US dollar for 6% and the Swiss franc for 4% (see note 31.6).\n\nSince  the  application  of  IFRS  16  by  the  Group  as  of January  1,  2018,  the  aircraft  operating  leases,  which  are mostly denominated in US dollars, have been recognized in  the  Group's  debt.  This  debt  is  recognized  as  hedge  of future  operating  revenues  in  USD.  For  airlines  not generating  US  dollar  revenues,  US  dollar-denominated assets and currency hedges are in place to mitigate this exchange rate risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  such,  it  fully  complies  with regulatory  measures  to  reduce  carbon  emissions  (see Note 25). These include the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which has been in force at European level since 2012 for aviation. The European  institutions have confirmed the intra-European scope of the EU-ETS, thus reinforcing  CORSIA's  future  role  in  defining  clearing solutions for international flights.\n\nThey  have  also  programmed  the  gradual  end  of allowances allocated free of charge to air operators. From 2026  onwards,  this  new  measure  will  require  the Air France-KLM  group  to  purchase  emission  rights (credits) for all its flights to and from the European Union (intra-European flights).\n\nTo minimize the consequences  of the necessary strengthening  of  the  European  carbon  market  and  the gradual increase in the price of credits, Air France-KLM is responding through a proactive financial policy based on the purchase of forward credits.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group has hedged its future purchases of CO2 quotas as follows:\n\n| As of December 31, 2023              |         | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   |             |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|\n| (In \u20ac millions)                      | Nominal | Maturity  below 1  year            | 1-2  years                         | 2-3  years                         | 3-4  years                         | 4-5  years                         | +5  years                          | Fair  value |\n| Operating flows as cash flow hedging | 12      | 12                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (3)         |\n| Forwards                             | 12      | 12                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (3)         |\n| TOTAL                                | 12      | 12                                 | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  | (3)         |\n\n| As of December 31, 2022              |         | Maturity      | Maturity   | Maturity   | Maturities between 1 and 5 years   | Maturity   | Maturity   |             |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|---------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| (In \u20ac millions)                      | Nominal | below 1  year | 1-2  years | 2-3  years | 3-4  years                         | 4-5  years | +5  years  | Fair  value |\n| Operating flows as cash flow hedging | 106     | 106           | -          | -          | -                                  | -          | -          | 13          |\n| Forwards                             | 106     | 106           | -          | -          | -                                  | -          | -          | 13          |\n| TOTAL                                | 106     | 106           | -          | -          | -                                  | -          | -          | 13          |\n\n## 35.5 Counterpart risk\n\nThe transactions involving potential counterparty risk are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 financial investments measured at fair market value;\n- \u25a0 derivative instruments measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 trade receivables: risk limited due to the large number and geographical diversity of the customers.\n\nCounterparty  risk  linked  to  financial  investments  and derivative instruments is managed by the Risk Management  Committee  which  establishes  limits  by counterparty  based  on  the  quality  of  their  financial position.\n\nIn  order  to  assess  financial  position  of  its  counterparties, the Group relies on their financial data, as well as on any public information providing analysis on those. Regarding mutual funds (OPCVM) the risk is considered as negligible thanks  to  large  diversification  and  regulatory  provisions applicable to these supports. The RMC also monitors the trend  in  the  respective  proportion  each  counterparty represents of the overall hedging portfolio (fuel, currency and interest rate) and investments. The positions of both Air France and KLM, together with those of the Air FranceKLM  parent  company,  are  taken  into  account  in  the assessment  of  the  overall  exposure.  Any  exceeding  of  a limit immediately  results  in  the  implementation  of corrective measures.\n\nGOL,  an  important  partner  of  Air  France-KLM  group, registered at Chapter  11. Consequently,  the  Group monitors the situation. However, given that GOL is still in operation, risk assessments show that this is likely to have a minor impact.",

The fair values are classified using a scale which reflects the nature of the market data used to make the valuations.\n\nThis scale has three levels of fair value:\n\n- \u25a0 Level 1: Fair value calculated from the exchange rate/price quoted on an active market for identical instruments;\n- \u25a0 Level 2: Fair value calculated from valuation methods based on observable data such as the prices of similar assets and liabilities or scopes quoted on an active market;\n- \u25a0 Level 3: Fair value calculated from valuation methods which rely completely or partly on non observable data such as market prices from an inactive market or valuation based on multiples for non listed stocks.\n\nThe Group's financial assets and liabilities are broken down into the three classification levels as follows:\n\n|                                    |       | Level 1 - quoted   | Level 1 - quoted   | Level 2 - internal  modeling using   | Level 2 - internal  modeling using   | Level 3 - internal  modeling using  non-observable  factors   | Level 3 - internal  modeling using  non-observable  factors   |       |       |\n|------------------------------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| As of December 31                  |       |                    |                    |                                      |                                      |                                                               |                                                               |       |       |\n| (In \u20ac millions)                    | Notes | 2023               | 2022               | 2023                                 | 2022                                 | 2023                                                          | 2022                                                          | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Equity instruments                 | 22    | 33                 | 38                 | 19                                   | 7                                    | -                                                             | -                                                             | 52    | 45    |\n| Debt instruments                   | 22    | 1,002              | 981                | 1,061                                | 402                                  | -                                                             | -                                                             | 2,063 | 1,383 |\n| Derivative instruments assets      | 35    | -                  | -                  | 270                                  | 589                                  | -                                                             | -                                                             | 270   | 589   |\n| Cash equivalents                   | 26    | -                  | -                  | 4,337                                | 5,238                                | -                                                             | -                                                             | 4,337 | 5,238 |\n| Cash in hand                       | 26    | 1,857              | 1,388              | -                                    | -                                    | -                                                             | -                                                             | 1,857 | 1,388 |\n| TOTAL ASSETS                       |       | 2,892              | 5,225              | 5,687                                | 3,418                                | -                                                             | -                                                             | 8,579 | 8,643 |\n| Derivative instruments liabilities | 35    | -                  | -                  | (195)                                | (104)                                | -                                                             | -                                                             | (195) | (104) |\n| Bank overdrafts                    | 26    | (13)               | (3)                | -                                    | -                                    | -                                                             | -                                                             | (13)  | (3)   |\n| TOTAL LIABILITIES                  |       | (13)               | (3)                | (195)                                | (104)                                | -                                                             | -                                                             | (208) | (107) |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders.  This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in  accordance  with,  French  law  and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## For the year ended December 31, 2023\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Air France-KLM S.A.,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by your  Annual  General  Meetings,  we  have  audited  the accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of Air France-KLM S.A. for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial  position  of  the  Group  as  at  December  31,  2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further described in the Statutory Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence  requirements  of  the  French  Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from  January  1,  2023  to  the  date  of  our  report  and specifically  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit services  referred  to  in  Article  5(1)  of  Regulation  (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw your attention to the matter set out in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements entitled \"Restatement  of  the  2022  financial  statements\",  which describes a change in accounting method regarding the accounting  treatment  of  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions trading  scheme  and  its  impact  on  the  consolidated financial  statements.  Our  opinion  is  not  modified  in respect of this matter.\n\n## Justification of Assessments Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821-53 and  R.821-180  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (code  de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of  the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate  opinion  on  specific  items  of  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recoverability of flight equipment assets (Notes 2, 17, 19 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n## Risk identified\n\nFlight equipment  and  aircraft  right  of  use  assets amounted to \u20ac11.5 billion and \u20ac5.3 billion respectively as of December  31,  2023.  As  indicated  in  the  Note  17  to  the consolidated  financial  statements,  during  the  operating cycle, and when establishing fleet replacement plans, the Group reviews whether the amortizable base or the useful life  of  the  assets  should  be  adjusted  and,  if  necessary, determines whether a residual value should be recognized and the useful life adapted.\n\nMoreover,  in  accordance  with  IAS  36  'Impairment  of Assets',  and  as  specified  in  Note  21  to  the  consolidated financial  statements,  property,  plant  and  equipment, intangible  assets,  right-of-use  assets  and  goodwill  are tested  for  impairment  if  there  is  an  indication  of impairment,  and  at  least  once  a  year  for  goodwill  and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. Assets that cannot be directly  linked  to  independent  cash  flows  are grouped  together  into  Cash  Generating  Units  (CGU)  to perform the impairment test. The Group concluded that the CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments the Network, Maintenance and Transavia activities.",

These assumptions include the discounted  cash  flows  derived  from  the  5-year  budget figures  prepared  by  Management  and  validated  by  the Board of Directors, the discount rate corresponding to the weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  and  the  growth  rates reflecting  assumptions  relating  to  mid-  and  long-term business  development.  Such  cash  flows  also  reflect  the Group's environmental objectives as well as the impacts related  to  expected  or  probable  regulatory  changes  in terms  of  environment  (modernization  of  the  fleet, increase in the cost of carbon credits, CO2 compensation, development of sustainable aviation fuel 'SAF').\n\nAs  indicated  in  Note  2  to  the  consolidated  financial statements,  the  Group's  environmental  objectives  have not  led  to  the  recognition  of  any  impairment  or acceleration of depreciation on its assets.\n\nWe considered the valuation of those assets to be a key audit matter in light of their significant amount and of the high  degree  of  judgment  and  estimates  required  by Management to determine their recoverable value.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe assessed  the  procedures  and  controls  implemented by the Group to determine and review the useful lives of flight  equipment  assets  and  assessing  their  consistency with the Group's environmental objectives.\n\nAlso, we assessed the procedures and controls implemented to identify indicators of impairment, and for the  purpose  of  the  impairment  test,  calculate  the  book value of non-current assets by CGU and determine their recoverable amount. We tested the key controls used by the Group in the design process of the assets' impairment test.\n\n## Our work also included:\n\n- a) assessing whether the methodology used by Management  complies with current accounting standards  (IAS  36),  including  validating  the  CGU independence  and  consistency  criteria  as  well  as  the frequency of impairment tests;\n- b) reconciling the book value of the non-current assets of each  CGU  with  the  accounting  balances  and  the corresponding allocation;\n- c) verifying (i) the  cash  flow  projections  with  the Management-approved 5-year plan, (ii) the intermediate  period  and  perpetual  growth  rates,  as well as (iii) profit margin rates used;\n- d) assessing  the  consistency  of  discount  rate  calculation assumptions with external market information;\n- e) assessing the consistency of the assumptions with the Group's  environmental  objectives  and  the  impacts related to expected or probable regulatory changes in terms of environment;\n- f) assessing the sensitivity scenarios retained by Management  by  verifying  arithmetic  accuracy  of sensitivity  calculations  based  on  WACC,  perpetual growth rate and long-term profitability;\n- g) reviewing  the  calculation  of  the  enterprise  value performed  by  Management  from  Air  France-KLM's market  capitalization  to  corroborate  the  impairment test based on value in use.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided  in  Notes  2,  17,  19  and  21  to  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax assets of the French tax group (Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n## Risk identified\n\nDeferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards are only recognized if their recovery is probable.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  a  net  deferred  tax  asset amounting  to  \u20ac698  million  is  recognized  in  the consolidated  balance  sheet  for  the  Group.  The  amount comprises \u20ac707 million of deferred tax assets relating to tax  loss  carryforwards  for  the  French  tax  consolidation group  as  presented  in  Note  13.4  to  the  consolidated financial  statements.  These  deferred  tax  assets  are recognized based on their likelihood of recovery pursuant to the medium-term budgets and plans prepared by the Group,  as  well  as  the  reversal  of  taxable  temporary differences available.\n\nAs  presented  in  Note  13.1  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the recovery period for the deferred tax assets of the French tax consolidation group is five years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, unrecognized deferred tax assets relating  to  tax  loss  carryforwards  of  the  French  tax consolidation group amounts to \u20ac2.9 billion as presented in Note 13.5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe  identified  deferred  tax  assets  related  to  French  tax loss  carryforwards  as  a  key  audit  matter  given  their significant  amount  and  the  high  degree  of  judgments and estimates made by the Group to assess the validity of the related deferred tax assets recognized.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These rates are determined by the Air France-KLM Group based  on  historical  data  taken  from  the  information systems  and  adjusted  for  non  -  recurring  and  specific events that could impact passenger behavior.\n\nWe  considered  the  recognition  of  deferred  revenue  on ticket  sales  to  be  a  key  audit  matter  due  to  the importance of the Group judgement in determining the recognition assumptions.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe assessed  the  procedures  and  controls  implemented by  the  Group  to  determine  the  statistical  rates  of 'Deferred revenue on ticket sales\".\n\nOur procedures primarily consisted in:\n\n- a) assessing  the  appropriateness  of  the  methodology adopted by the Group;\n- b) corroborating the historical databases with the databases used;\n- c) verifying the statistical rate calculation;\n- d) evaluating and analyzing the impact of the adjustments  made  for  non-recurring  and  specific events related to the Covid crisis;\n- e) analyzing  the  ageing  of  deferred  revenue  on  ticket sales  presented  in  liabilities  on  the  consolidated balance  sheet  to  assess  the  appropriateness  of  the revenue recognized in the period.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  specific  verifications required by laws and  regulations  of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its  fair  presentation and  its  consistency  with  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nWe attest  that  the  consolidated  non-financial  statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (code  de  commerce) , is  included  in  the  Group's management report, it being specified that, in accordance with  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  823-10  of  this  Code,  we have  verified  neither  the  fair  presentation  nor  the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the  information  contained  therein  and  this  information must be reported by an independent third party.",

As it  relates  to  consolidated  financial  statements,  our  work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended  to  be  included  in  the  annual  financial  report complies,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the  European single electronic format.\n\nDue  to  the  technical  limitations  inherent  in  the  macrotagging  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with the European single electronic format, it is possible that the content of certain tags in the notes to the financial statements may not be rendered identically to the consolidated financial statements attached to this report.\n\nWe ave  no  responsibility  to  verify  that  the  consolidated financial  statements  that  will  ultimately  be  included  by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF  are  in  agreement  with  those  on  which  we  have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe  were  appointed  as  statutory  auditors  of  Air  FranceKLM  S.A.  by  the  Annual  General  Meetings  held  on September 25, 2002 for KPMG S.A. and on May 25, 2022 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  KPMG  S.A.  was  in  the 22 nd year of total uninterrupted  engagement  and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in the 2 nd year.\n\nManagement is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  and  for such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  it  is expected to liquidate the Company  or  to  cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of internal  control  and  risks  management  systems  and where  applicable,  its internal audit, regarding  the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our  objective  is to obtain reasonable assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate, they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risk of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal control;\n- b) obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- c) evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- d) assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause  the  Company  to  cease  to  continue  as  a  going concern.  If  the  statutory  auditor  concludes  that  a material  uncertainty  exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or,\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, March 01, 2024\n\n## KPMG S.A.\n\n- if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or  inadequate,  to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- e) evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- f) obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements  and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe  submit  to  the  Audit  Committee  a  report  which includes  in  particular  a  description  of  the  scope  of  the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we  have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore  the  key  audit  matters,  that  we  are  required  to describe in this audit report.\n\nWe  also  provide the Audit Committee  with  the declaration  provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU) No  537/2014,  confirming  our  independence  within  the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set  in  particular  by  Articles  L.  821-27  to  L.  821-34  of  the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors.  Where  appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine, March 01, 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nThe statutory auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson\n\nEric Dupr\u00e9\n\nPhilippe Vincent\n\nAm\u00e9lie Jeudi de Grissac\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner",

        "page_content": "## 5.5.3 Notes\n\nThe  following  information  constitutes  the  notes  to  the financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2023. It is an integral part of the financial statements.\n\nAir  France-KLM  SA,  a  public  limited  company  (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme)  with  registered  office  at  7,  rue  du  Cirque, 75008 Paris, is the parent company of the Air France-KLM group.  It  is  listed  for  trading  in  Paris  (Euronext)  and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\n## 1. Accounting policies and procedures\n\nGenerally accepted  accounting  policies have been applied,  consistent  with  the  prudence  principle  and  in accordance  with  the  legal  and  regulatory  provisions applicable in France and to the base assumptions whose aim is to provide a true and faithful representation of the company:\n\n- \u25a0 going concern;\n- \u25a0 consistent accounting methods from year to year;\n- \u25a0 independence of financial periods;\n- \u25a0 and in accordance with the general rules for establishing and presenting annual financial statements.\n\nThe  basic  method  used  to  value  items  recorded  in  the financial statements is the historical cost method.\n\n## Value in use of its equity investments\n\nIn  the  current  context,  the  company  has  paid  particular attention to the value in use of its equity investments.\n\n## The main accounting methods used are the following:\n\n## \u25a0 Long-term investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are presented on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost net of impairment,  if  any.  A  provision  for  impairment  is recorded as soon as the fair value, which corresponds to  the  value  in  use,  falls  below  the  acquisition  value. The fair value of securities is determined by taking into account the share of shareholders' equity, the outlook for profitability and the stock market values that can be used as a reference.\n\nTransfer  taxes,  fees  or  commissions  and  legal  fees related  to  the  acquisition  of  securities  are  expensed, according to the option offered by the regulations.\n\nTreasury  shares  not  allocated  to  employees  or  to  a capital decrease are booked in long-term investments. They are shown at the lower of their acquisition cost or fair  value.  The  fair  value  is  determined  based  on  the average market price for the last month of the financial year. Impairment tests on future cash flows have been performed, based on assumptions that are identical to those of the consolidated financial statements;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u25a0 Trade receivables\n\nTrade  receivables  are  valued  at  their  nominal  value. They are valued on a case-by-case basis and a provision is set up as required based on the assessed risks;\n\n## \u25a0 Provisions\n\nThe  company  recognizes  a  provision  when  there  is  a legal or constructive obligation to a third party that will result  in  an  outflow  of  resources  and  can  be  reliably estimated. The amounts recognized as provisions take into  account  the  timing  of  disbursements  and  are discounted  where  appropriate.  The  effect  of  the passage  of  time  is  recognized  in  financial  income  or expense;\n\n## \u25a0 Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities are shown on the balance sheet at the lower of their acquisition cost and their market value. In the case of listed shares, this market value is determined based on the market price at  the  end  of the financial year.\n\nTreasury shares invested as part of a liquidity agreement are valued at the lower of their acquisition price and fair value. The fair value is determined based on the last month average market price at the end of the financial year.\n\nNegotiable debt securities (certificates of deposits, and bills issued by financial companies) are booked at their acquisition cost. Interest is booked as financial income, on a-prorata temporis basis;\n\n## \u25a0 Foreign currency transactions\n\nOperating expense and income transactions in foreign currencies  are  recognized  at  the  average  exchange rate for each relevant month by approximating the rate on the day of the transaction.\n\nTrade payable and receivable in foreign currencies are valued  at  the  exchange  rate  in  effect  at  end  year closing.\n\nUnrealized  losses  and  gains  are  recognized  as  assets and  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet.  Provisions  are established  for  unrealized  losses,  except  for  the following cases:\n\n- \u00b7 transactions  where  the  currency  and  the  term contribute  to  an  overall  positive  currency  position and,\n- \u00b7 currency hedging contracts concerning the payment of future investment deliveries;\n\n## \u25a0 Debts\n\nDebts are valued at their nominal amount. The debt in foreign  currency  is  valued  at  the  closing  rate  Euro/ Dollar;\n\n## \u25a0 Financial instruments\n\nFinancial  derivative  instruments  are  used  to  reduce exposure to interest rates risk and to foreign exchange. They are over the counter instruments with first class counterpart. Group management policy bans subscription of trading instruments;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Significant events of the period\n\n## Sustainability-linked bonds, for a total amount of \u20ac1 billion\n\nOn  January  9,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  has  placed  its  first sustainability-linked  bonds,  for  a  nominal  amount  of \u20ac1 billion. This financing is linked to the Company's target to reduce its jet fuel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per revenue tonne kilometer (RTK) by 10% by 2025, compared to  a  2019  baseline,  as  part  of  its  2030  SBTi  approved objective.\n\nThe emission is composed of two tranches:\n\n- \u25a0 a \u20ac500 million with a maturity as of May 31, 2026 and a coupon of 7.250%; and\n- \u25a0 a \u20ac500 million with a maturity as of May 31, 2028 and a coupon of 8.125%.\n\nIt  has  been  accounted  for  in  financial  debts  in  balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Early repayment of \u20ac2.5 billion of the bank loan guaranteed by the French State ('PGE')\n\nOn  March  15,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  has  fully  repaid  the remaining \u20ac2.5 billion from its initial \u20ac4 billion Bank loan guaranteed  by  the  French  State,  granted  during  the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nTo do so, the Group used the proceeds of \u20ac1 billion from Sustainability-linked bonds issued and \u20ac1.5 billion available cash.\n\n## Signature of two Revolving Credit Facilities ('RCF') linked to ESG KPIs for a total amount of \u20ac2.2 billion\n\nOn  April  18,  2023,  Air  France-KLM,  Air  France  and  KLM have  signed  two  ESG  ('Environmental,  Social  and Governance') KPI-Linked Revolving Credit Facilities ('RCF')  with  a  pool  of  international  financial  institutions, for a total amount of \u20ac2.2 billion.\n\nFor  each  facility,  a  set  of  ESG  linked  Key  Performance Indicators are embedded in the financing cost.\n\nThese  indicators  are  in  line  with  Air  France-KLM  and  its airlines'  commitment  to  sustainable  development  and  a gradual  decarbonization  of  activities.  The  two  RCFs include a financing cost margin adjustment mechanism (upward  or  downward)  conditional  to  the  independent achievement of these dedicated Indicators (reduction  of the unit CO2 emission, increase of the share of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, among others).\n\n## Air France-KLM and Air France\n\nAir  France-KLM  and  Air  France  as  combined  borrower signed a \u20ac1.2 billion Sustainability-Linked RCF.\n\nThis new facility has an initial 2026 maturity, includes two one-year extension options.\n\n## Air France-KLM reverse share split and share capital reduction\n\nAs  of  August  31,  2023,  Air  France-KLM  completed  the reverse  share  split  of  all  outstanding  shares  of  the Company and the capital  reduction  by  reduction  of  the nominal value of each share, as decided by the Board of Directors at its meeting on July 4, 2023 and in accordance with  the  36 th and  37 th extraordinary  resolutions  of  the Combined General Meeting of June 7, 2023.\n\nThese  transactions  resulted  in  two  steps,  without  equity impact:\n\n## Reverse share split\n\nThe reverse share split resulted in the allocation of 1 new ordinary  share  with  a  par  value  of  \u20ac10  for  10  existing ordinary shares with a par value of \u20ac1, and in a division by 10 of the number of outstanding shares. The reverse share split  transactions  took  place  on  July  31,  2023,  with  an exchange  period  open  from  that  date  until  August  31, 2023 included.\n\n## Share capital reduction\n\nOn  August  31,  2023,  the  par  value  of  each  share  in  the Company was reduced from \u20ac10 to \u20ac1, i.e. a reduction of \u20ac9 per share. The amount of this share capital reduction has been allocated to the \"share premium\" account. After the  share  capital  reduction,  the  new  shares'  par  value  is identical  to  the  par  value  of  shares  (before  the  reverse share split).\n\nAfter  the  transaction,  the  Company's  share  capital  was standing  at  \u20ac257,053,613  divided  into  257,053,613  shares with a par value of \u20ac1 each.\n\n## Global employee share purchase plan\n\nWithin the framework of the 34 th and  35 th resolutions  of the Annual General Meeting of June 7, 2023, on October 23, 2023, the Air France-KLM group launched \"Partners for the future\",  an  employee share purchase plan offered to around 75.000 eligible employees in around 20 countries.\n\nEligible  employees  were  able  to  subscribe  at  a  30% discounted  price  with  the  benefit  of  a  matching contribution from  the  Air  France-KLM  group.  The proposed shares could not exceed 3% of Air France-KLM's share capital.\n\nOn December 21, 2023, following this operation, 5,716,256 new  shares  with  a  value  of  one  euro  each  were  issued, increasing  the  share  capital  from  257,053,613  euros  to 262,769,869 euros.\n\nThe capital  increase  breaks  down  into  into  \u20ac6  million  in share capital and \u20ac29 million in additional paid in capital.",

The  consolidation  scope,  for which  Air  France-KLM  is  the  parent  company,  mainly includes Air France, HOP! and Transavia France Companies.\n\nThe tax consolidation agreement is based on the so-called neutrality  method  and  puts  each  member  company  of the tax group in the situation in which it would have been in without consolidation.\n\nAir  France-KLM  has  a  tax  losses  carried  forward  of \u20ac1  026  million.  The  Group's  cumulative  tax  losses,  which can be carried forward indefinitely, amount to \u20ac14 133 million.\n\nThe  subsidiaries  recording  a  net  earning,  generated  a bonus of 140 million euros in 2023, compared to a bonus of 23 million euros in 2022.",

Commitments\n\n## KLM shares\n\nDuring  the  business  combination  of  the  Air  France  and KLM groups, the Dutch government undertook to reduce its  stake  in  KLM  proportionally  to  any  reduction  by  the French  government  of  its  stake  in  Air  France-KLM's capital. To this end, the Dutch government had to sell its cumulative  preferred  shares  to  Air  France-KLM  or  to  a Dutch  foundation  in  the  name  of  and  on  behalf  of Air  France-KLM,  if  the  transfer  had  occurred  during  the first three years following the business combination.\n\nIn the latter case, the foundation would have issue, to the benefit of Air France-KLM, share certificates corresponding  to  the  cumulative  A  preferred  shares transferred  to  the  foundation.  These  share  certificates would  have  conferred  to  Air  France-KLM  all  of  the economic  rights  attached  to  the  said  shares,  the  voting rights attached to the said shares being exercised by the foundation until Air France exchanges  the  share certificates against the said shares.\n\nAt the end of the initial three-year period, Air France-KM had the option to exchange the share certificates against the  cumulative  A  preferred  shares,  which  it  could  hold directly.  As  Air  France-KLM  decided  in  2007  to  maintain SAK I and SAK II foundations, Air France-KLM did not carry out  this  exchange.  Furthermore,  Air  France-KLM  can decide to dissolute the foundations at any time and at its sole discretion.\n\nMoreover, the Dutch government has the right to sell to Air  France-KLM  at  any  time  as  many  cumulative  A preferred shares as it wants.\n\nAfter  the  sale  of  5,103,885  shares  to  Air  France-KLM  in April  2005  for  \u20ac11.6  million,  the  acquisition  price  of  the 3,708,615  cumulative  A  preferred  shares  still  held  by  the Dutch  government  amounts  to  \u20ac8.4  million  (i.e.  a  unit price of \u20ac2.27 per cumulative A preferred share, which has to be paid pro rata during any sale or transfer under the conditions above).\n\n## Hedges\n\nThe December 18, 2016, $145 million bond is fully hedged by a cross currency swap. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value  of  this  derivative  instrument  is  \u20ac(5)  million  (see Note 12.2).\n\n## Other\n\nSince  January  2009,  Air  France-KLM  has  acted  as  a guarantor for Air France Company within the framework of its commitments to A\u00e9roport de Paris in respect of civil leases. This guarantee has been renewed in July 2014 and more  recently  on  23  September  2019  for  a  period  of 5  years.  The  guarantee  is  now  expressly  limited  to \u20ac19 million (and, cumulatively, at a maximum of 3 months' rent per contract).\n\nAir  France-KLM  guarantees  the  payment  by  Transavia Holland to a lessor, of outstanding operational leases until 2028 for an amount of $104 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Litigation\n\n## Litigation concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nAir  France-KLM,  as  parent  company  of  Air  France,  KLM and Martinair, is involved, since February 2006, with up to twenty-five other airlines in investigations initiated by the antitrust  authorities  in  several  countries,  with  respect  to allegations  of  anti-competitive  agreements  or  concerted actions in the air freight industry.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, most of these investigations had been terminated following the entry into plea agreements between the three companies of the Group and the appropriate competition authorities, providing for the  payment  of  settlement  amounts  or  fines,  with  the exception  of  the  proceedings  initiated  by  the  European Commission, and by the Swiss antitrust authority, which are still pending.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  decision  of  the  European  Commission  of 2010  against  eleven  air  cargo  carriers,  including  the companies of  the  Group,  Air  France,  KLM  and  Martinair, was annulled by the General Court of the European Union on December 16, 2015 because it contained a contradiction regarding the exact scope of the practices sanctioned. On March 17, 2017, the European Commission issued a new decision against the aforementioned cargo carriers, including Air France, KLM and Martinair. The total amount of fines imposed in respect of this decision at the Air France-KLM group level was \u20ac339 million. This amount was slightly reduced by \u20ac15.4 million as compared to the initial  decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical  reasons.  On  May  29  and  30,  2017,  the  Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The hearings before the General Court took place on June and July 2019.\n\nDecision from the General Court in March 2022 confirmed the  fines  against  Air  France-KLM  group  companies.  The Group companies appealed in June 2022 to the European Union Court of Justice. Hearings are planned in Q2 2024 for Air France, KLM and Martinair. The Group has maintained a provision covering the total amount of these fines.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total amount of provisions in connection with proceedings, which have yet to give rise to definitive decisions amounts to \u20ac361 million.\n\nThose provisions are booked by each airlines and do not have any impact in the financial statements of Air FranceKLM.\n\n## 19. Contingent liabilities\n\nThe  Group  is  involved  in  governmental,  judicial  and arbitration procedures for which in some cases provisions have  not  been  recorded  in  the  financial  statements  in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.\n\nIndeed, with respect to some cases the Group is not in a position  at  this  stage  in  these  procedures,  to  give  a reliable  estimate  of  the  potential  loss  that  could  be incurred in connection with these disputes.\n\nMoreover, the group believes that any additional disclosed information  could  be  harmful  to  our  legal  position procedures.\n\n## Litigations concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nFollowing  the  initiation  of  various  investigations  by  the competition  authorities  in  2006  and  the  European Commission  decision  in  2010,  several  collective  and individual  actions  were  brought  by  forwarders  and  airfreight shippers in the civil courts against Air France, KLM and Martinair, and other cargo operators, in a number of civil jurisdictions.\n\nUnder these civil lawsuits, shippers and freight forwarders are claiming for damages to compensate alleged higher prices due to alleged competition law infringement.\n\nFor Air France, KLM and Martinair, certain civil claims are still pending in the Netherlands and in Norway. The Group companies  and  the  other  airlines  involved  in  these lawsuits continue to vigorously oppose these civil claims.\n\n## Litigations on State Aid\n\nIn 2020, the implementation of the measures to reinforce the  Group's  liquidity  (a  loan  guaranteed  by  the  French State  (PGE)  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac4  billion  and  a  \u20ac3  billion loan  from  the  French  State,  together  with  a  revolving credit  facility  of  \u20ac2.4  billion  guaranteed  by  the  Dutch State  and  a  \u20ac1  billion  loan  from  the  Dutch  State),  were approved by the European Commission under the State Aid rules (decisions of May 4, 2020, annulled on December 20,  2023  by  the  General  Court  the  European  Union,  and July  13,  2020  annulled  on  May  19,  2021  by  the  General Court of  the  European  Union  for  failure  to  state  reasons and replaced by another positive Commission decision of July  16,  2021  correcting  this  failure  also  annulled  on February 7, 2024).",

        "page_content": "On April 6, 2021, the Group announced the first part of its overall recapitalization plan. Certain measures in this plan contained  State  Aid  (so-called  'Covid-19  recapitalization\" program) which were accordingly notified by the French authorities  to  the  European  Commission,  the  latter approving them in its decision of April 5, 2021 (annulled on December 20, 2023 by the General Court of the European Union). This decision made the approval of the measures subject to a number of commitments undertaken by the French  State  and  leading  notably  to  the  allocation  by Air  France  of  landing  and  take-off  slots  to  a  designated third-party  carrier  at  Orly  airport.  Other  undertakings  by the  French  State  were  also  imposed  to  the  Group companies (to the exception of KLM and its subsidiaries) within  the  framework  of  the  European  Commission's Temporary Framework for State Aid (such as restrictions on acquisitions, share buybacks and dividend payments) and  could  have  an  impact  on  the  Group's  activities.  All these constraints have  disappeared  since  the  full repayment of this recapitalization aid on April 19, 2023 (see \"Mitigation  plan\"  below).  Only  the  provision  concerning slots at Orly is still being implemented in accordance with the Commission's decision.\n\nLike  most  most  of  the  decisions  with  respect  to  airlines receiving State Aid in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, the European  Commission's  decisions  granting  support measures  to  Air  France  and  KLM  have  been  subject  to annulment proceedings brought by Ryanair. On December  20,  2023  and  February  7,  2024,  the  General Court of the European Union annulled the decisions of the European  Commission  which  had  approved  the  above mentioned support measures, respectively for (i) \u20ac7 billion euros of liquidity measures granted by the French State to Air France in May 2020 and \u20ac3.6 billion of recapitalization measures granted by the French State to Air France and Air France-KLM S.A. in 2021, and (ii) \u20ac0.9 billion in liquidity measures granted to KLM by the Dutch State in 2020.\n\nUntil a final decision or judgment is obtained, there is still uncertainty as to the legal and financial consequences of the annulment of decisions to grant state aid. However, all the aid granted has already been repaid in full compliance with  the  constraints  linked  (commitments,  behavioral measures, application of interest)  to  the  applicable  legal framework.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n## Statutory financial statements\n\nThe potential indirect consequences of the cancellation of the  above  mentioned  State  aids  could  include  in particular, the demand for illegality interest.\n\nIn  order  to  protect  its  interests,  the  Group  intends  to lodge  an  appeal  against  the  judgments  of  the  General Court  annulling  the  above  mentioned  decisions.  At  the date of this report, the European Commission is expected to  lodge  an  appeal.  However,  as  it  has  been  done  in similar cases, the European Commission may also decide, if  necessary,  to  initiate  a  formal  examination  procedure, during  which  the  Group  will  defend  its  interests  to  the best of its ability.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  points  set  out  in  paragraphs 30.1 and 30.2, the company is not aware of any litigation, governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings of which the issuer is aware, which are pending or which it is threatened with) which may have or  have  recently  had  a  material  effect  on  the  company's financial position, results of operations, assets or profitability,  for  a  period  covering at least the last twelve months.\n\n## 20.  Subsequent events\n\n## Evolution in the commercial cooperation in air cargo between Air France-KLM and CMA CGM\n\nAir France-KLM and CMA CGM have decided to terminate the  agreements  signed  in  May  2022  with  effect  from March  31,  2024  as  the  tight  regulatory  environment  in certain important markets has prevented the cooperation from working in an optimal way.\n\nAir France-KLM and CMA CGM have begun discussions on new  terms  and  conditions  of  a  commercial  relation  to operate independently from March 31, 2024 onwards.\n\nCMA CGM remains a core shareholder in Air France-KLM. The parties have agreed to amend the existing lockup on CMA CGM shares in  Air  France-KLM's  capital,  which  will now be effective until February 28, 2025. The parties have agreed that CMA CGM will step down from the Air FranceKLM Board of Directors on March 31, 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## For the year ended December 31, 2023\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Air France-KLM S.A.,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by your  Annual  General  Meetings,  we  have  audited  the accompanying  financial  statements  of  Air  France-KLM S.A. for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  give  a  true  and fair  view  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  and  of  the  financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023 and of the  results  of  its  operations  for  the  year  then  ended  in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further described  in  the Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for the  Audit  of  the  Financial  Statements section  of  our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence  requirements  of  the  French  Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from  January  1,  2023  to  the  date  of  our  report  and specifically  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit services  referred  to  in  Article  5(1)  of  Regulation  (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821-53 and  R.821-180  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (code  de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of equity investments and related receivables (Notes 1, 10 and 15 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  equity  investment  and  related receivables amounts to a net value of \u20ac9.8 billion out of total  assets  of  \u20ac12.3  billion.  Equity  investments  are recorded at their acquisition cost net of any impairment, based on their fair value taking into account their share of shareholders'  equity,  profitability  outlook  and  reference stock market values.\n\nThe fair value estimate of these investments in subsidiaries  requires  Management  to  exercise  judgment in its choice of items considered according to the nature of the investments concerned. Such items may correspond  to  historical  items  (shareholders'  equity)  or forecast  items  (cash  flows  and  profitability  outlook) particularly sensitive given the current context which has uncertainty  due  to  the  geopolitical  and  economic environment and the increasing impact of ESG considerations.\n\nWe  considered  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of equity  investment  and  related  receivables  to  be  a  key audit matter in light of their significant amount and of the high  degree  of  judgment  and  estimates  required  by Management to determine their recoverable value.\n\n## Our response\n\nTo  assess  the  reasonableness  of  estimated  fair  values  of equity investments, based on the information communicated to us, our procedures mainly consisted in verifying  that  the  estimate  of  the  values  determined  by Management were based on an appropriate justification of the valuation method and figures used, and according to the investments concerned:\n\n- a) For  valuations  based  on  historical  items:  verifying  that the  shareholders'  equity  used  is  consistent  with  the financial statements of the entities audited or subjected to analytical procedures and that any equity adjustments have been appropriately documented; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material  misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate, they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n## Statutory Auditors' report on the financial statements\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (code  de  commerce) ,  our  statutory  audit  does  not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor  exercises  professional  judgment  throughout  the audit and furthermore:\n\n- a) identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and  performs  audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- b) obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- c) evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by management in the financial statements;\n- d) assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## Annual General Shareholders' Meeting for the approval of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023\n\n## In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Air France-KLM S.A.  (hereinafter  the  'Company'), we hereby report to you on related party agreements.\n\nIt  is  our  responsibility to report to shareholders, based on the  information  provided  to  us,  on  the  main  terms  and conditions of the agreements that have been disclosed to us  or  that  we  may  have  identified  as  part  of  our engagement, as well as the reasons given as to why they are  beneficial  for  the  Company,  without  commenting  on their relevance or substance or identifying any undisclosed agreements. Under the provisions of Article R. 225-31 of the French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce ),  it  is  the responsibility  of  the  shareholders  to  determine  whether the agreements are appropriate and should be approved.\n\nWhere  applicable,  it  is  also  our  responsibility  to  provide shareholders  with  the  information  required  by  Article R. 225-31 of the French Commercial Code in relation to the implementation  during  the  year  of  agreements  already approved by the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nWe performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in France to such engagements. These procedures consisted in verifying that the information given to us is consistent with the underlying documents.\n\n## Agreements to be submitted for the approval of the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting\n\n## Agreements authorized and entered into during the year\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  L.  225-40  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  we  were  informed  of  the  following agreements entered into during the year and authorized in advance by the Board of Directors during the year.\n\nRepurchases of a fraction of the Undated Deeply Subordinated Notes and subscription to new Undated Deeply Subordinated Notes for a total amount of \u20ac727,800,000\n\n## Persons concerned\n\n- \u25a0 The French State, a shareholder owning more than 10% of voting rights;\n- \u25a0 Mr. Pascal Bouchiat and Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli, both  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the Company, appointed by the Annual General Shareholders'  Meeting  as  proposed  by  the  French State;\n- \u25a0 Ms.  St\u00e9phanie  Besnier,  director  representing  the French  State  appointed  by  ministerial  order  until  her resignation on March 15, 2023;\n- \u25a0 Ms.  May  Gicquel,  director  representing  the  French State appointed by ministerial order on March 15, 2023, replacing Mrs. St\u00e9phanie Besnier, until her resignation on October 9, 2023;\n- \u25a0 Ms.  C\u00e9line  Fornaro,  director  representing  the  French State  appointed  by  ministerial  order  on  October  9, 2023, replacing Ms. May Gicquel.\n\n## Nature, purpose and conditions\n\nAs part of the Group's recapitalization plan announced on April  6,  2021,  Air  France-KLM  entered  into  a  subscription agreement on April 20, 2021 relating to the issue by the Company and the subscription by the French Republic of undated deeply subordinated notes in the total amount of  \u20ac3  billion  composed  of  three  \u20ac1  billion  tranches redeemable, respectively, in April  2025  (the  'NR4  Deeply Subordinated  Notes'),  April  2026  (the  'NR5  Deeply Subordinated  Notes')  and  April  2027  (the  'NR6  Deeply Subordinated Notes') (together the 'Deeply Subordinated Notes'). Following the various repurchases and redemptions  realized  in  2022,  only  the  NR6  Deeply Subordinated Notes remained outstanding, representing a principal amount of \u20ac595,000,000, i.e. 5,950 NR6 Deeply Subordinated Notes whose repurchase was carried out in full on March 17, 2023 and April 19, 2023.\n\nThe  recapitalization  aid  also  included  the  subscription  by the French State, simultaneously with the subscription to the Undated Deeply Subordinated Notes, to \u20ac593 million in shares  as  part  of  the  Company's  capital  increase  of approximately \u20ac1.04 billion in April 2021 (the 'State Shares 2021' and, with the TSS French State, the 'Recapitalization').\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  objective  of  full  repayment  of  the Recapitalization aid, in two stages on March 17, 2023 and April  19, 2023,  the  Company  repurchased  the  NR6 Undated  Deeply  Subordinated  Notes  remaining  in circulation. These repurchases were carried out subject to the  subscription  by  the  French  State  of  new  Deeply Subordinated  Notes  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac320,400,000  on March 17, 2023 (the 'Subordinated Notes March 2023') and \u20ac407,400,000 on April 19, 2023 (the 'Subordinated Notes April  2023'  and,  together  with  the  Subordinated  Notes March  2023,  the  'Subordinated  Notes  2023')  (it  being specified  that  the  Subordinated  Notes  April  2023  will  be assimilated  to  the  Subordinated  Notes  March  2023  from March 17, 2024).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  repurchase  offer  concluded  on  April  19, 2023 was further increased by the Exit Amount due by the Company  to  the  French  State  in  accordance  with  the rules  provided  for  in  the  Temporary  Framework  and  the decision to grant Covid aid (Decision SA.59913).\n\nThe  repurchases  were  carried  out  subject  to  the subscription by the French State to the Super Subordinated Notes 2023 corresponding to the amounts provided for in the repurchase offers, i.e. a total of around \u20ac727,800,000. This subscription was carried out following approval  by  the  European  Commission,  on  February  16, 2023,  of  a  compensation  aid  from  the  French  State without  any  bans  for  the  benefit  of  Air  France-KLM  and Air France.\n\nNo  Undated  Deeply  Subordinated  Notes  have  been outstanding since April 19, 2023.\n\nAmendment to the subscription agreement entered into on May 22, 2022 between Air France-KLM and CMA CGM\n\n## Persons concerned\n\n- \u25a0 CMA CGM, a shareholder of the Company with 8.0% of the voting rights; and\n- \u25a0 Mr. Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, director appointed by the Annual General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  the  Company  on May 24, 2022 as proposed by CMA CGM.\n\n## Nature, purpose and conditions\n\nOn May 22, 2022, Air France-KLM (the 'Company') entered into  a  subscription  agreement  in  the  context  of  the conclusion  of  a  long-term  strategic  partnership  in  air freight with the company CMA CGM, a shareholder of the Company with 9% of  its  share  capital  (the  'Subscription Agreement').\n\nIn  effect,  in  February  2023,  Mr.  Rodolphe  Saad\u00e9,  a  Board director of the Company, had announced his intention to be  replaced  as  a  Board  director  by  the  company  CMA CGM.  On  April  19,  2023,  the  Company  concluded  an amendment to the Subscription Agreement.\n\nConsequently, on April 19, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the signature by the Company of an Amendment to the Subscription Agreement allowing the nomination by CMA CGM of a legal person.\n\nThe  other  provisions  of  the  Subscription  Agreement remain unchanged.\n\n## Reasons why the agreement is beneficial for the Company\n\nThe objective of the conclusion of the amendment to the Subscription Agreement was to ensure the continuity of the cooperation between Air France-KLM and CMA CGM by ensuring  the  possibility for CMA  CGM  to  be represented within the Company's Board of Directors by a natural or a legal person.\n\nApart  from  the  impact  on  the  composition  of  the Company's  Board  of  Directors,  this  amendment  has  no other  impact  on  the  Company's  business  and  the  longterm strategic partnership in air freight with the company CMA CGM.\n\nTermination of the financial settlement waiver agreement relating to the jointventure agreement with China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd.\n\n## Persons concerned\n\n- \u25a0 China Eastern Airlines Co Ltd. (\"China Eastern Airlines\"), a shareholder with 6.3% of the voting rights; and\n- \u25a0 Mr.  Jian  Wang,  director  appointed  by  the  Annual General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  as  proposed  by  China Eastern Airlines.",

The Term  Sheet  provides  notably  for  the  termination  of  the commercial  cooperation  agreement  entered  into  on December 9, 2022 between the Parties (the 'Cooperation Agreement) and the ancillary agreements relating to their cooperation  in  the  air  freight  sector  (the  'Ancillary Agreements').\n\nThe Term Sheet provides for the terms and conditions of the  termination  of  the  Cooperation  Agreement  and  the Ancillary Agreements and notably:\n\n- i. the termination of the Cooperation  Agreement, effective March 30, 2024;\n- ii. the termination of the dry and wet lease agreements, effective January 16, 2024;\n- iii.  the  termination  of  the  Ancillary  Agreements,  effective March 30, 2024;\n- iv.  the  payment  of  the  various  amounts  due  by  each  of the  Parties  to  the  other  under  all  the  agreements relating  to  the  cooperation  in  the  air  freight  activities (with  the  exception  of  certain  operational  costs) resulting in a global final payment by the Company to CMA CGM of \u20ac20,000,000;\n- v.  the waiver by the Parties of any recourse against each other in respect of the commercial cooperation in the air freight activities;

and\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORT\n\n- \u25a0 Mr. Ramon Fernandez, permanent representative GMA CGM,  co-opted  as  director  on  April  19,  2023  by  the Board  and  whose  co-optation  was  ratified  by  the Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2023.\n\n## Nature, purpose and conditions\n\nOn  May  22,  2022,  Air  France-KLM  entered  into  a subscription  agreement  in  the  context  of  a  long-term strategic partnership in air freight with the company CMA CGM, a shareholder of the Company with 9% of its share capital (as modified by the Amendments of November 28, 2022 and April 19, 2023, the 'Subscription Agreement').\n\nOn January 15,  2024,  and  as  outlined  in  Section  I  above, the Company entered into a term sheet ('White Cargo Term Sheet') with Air France, KLM, CMA CGM, CMA CGM Air  Cargo  and  CMA  CGM  Air  Cargo  9,  setting  forth  the terms  and  conditions  for  the  termination  of  the commercial  cooperation  agreement  entered  into  on December 9, 2022 and the ancillary agreements relating to their air freight activities effective March 30, 2024.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  termination  of  the  commercial cooperation, on January 15, 2024, the parties also agreed on an Amendment to the Subscription Agreement which henceforth that CMA CGM's lock-up undertaking to retain all the shares in the Company subscribed by CMA CGM in the rights  issue  by  the  Company  announced on May 24, 2022,  initially  due  to  expire  upon  termination  of  the commercial cooperation agreement or on June 15, 2025 (in the case of all the Company's shares subscribed by CMA CGM in the rights issue and on June 15, 2028 in the case of 50%  of  such  shares),  will  be  modified  and  will  expire  on February 28, 2025, and will no longer be conditional on the existence  of  the  commercial  cooperation  agreement between the Company and CMA CGM.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Amendment  to  the  Subscription Agreement provides that CMA CGM will no longer have a representative on the Company's Board of Directors from March  31,  2024  under  the  Subscription  Agreement  as amended  by  the  Amendment  to  the  Subscription Agreement.\n\nThe  Amendment  to  the  Subscription  Agreement  will however not change the standstill commitment provided for under  the  Subscription  Agreement,  which  thus continues to apply.\n\n## Reasons why the agreement is beneficial for the Company\n\nApart  from  the  impact  on  the  composition  of  the Company's  Board  of  Directors.  the  conclusion  of  the Amendment to the Subscription Agreement enables the continuity, until February 28, 2025, of CMA CGM's lock-up undertaking on the Company's shares subscribed by CMA CGM in the rights issue announced by the Company on May 24, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Board  will  assess  the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\n## The Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, March 28, 2024\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine, March 28, 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson\n\n\u00c9ric Dupr\u00e9\n\nPhilippe Vincent\n\nAm\u00e9lie Jeudi de Grissac\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner\n\nPartner",

If a unanimous decision cannot be reached by the three Board directors in the  Board  of  Directors  for  each  of  the  Dutch Foundations, no resolution may be passed by the Board of the relevant Foundation, which consequently cannot then vote on the relevant resolutions in the KLM Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAmongst  the  three  Board  directors  for  each  of  the foundations,  one  member  is  appointed  by  Air  FranceKLM, one by KLM and the third, acting in the capacity of Chair  of  the  Foundation,  is  appointed  by  the  first  two directors,  it  being  specified  that  the  majority  of  the members of the Boards of Directors of each Foundation, including the Chair, must be Dutch residents.\n\n## Unilateral termination option for Air France-KLM at any time\n\nInitially  incorporated  in  2004  for  a  three-year  period,  the two SAK I and SAK II foundations were however extended for an unlimited period by a 2007 agreement. Nevertheless,  this  agreement  provides  that  Air  FranceKLM may, at  any  time  as  of  May  6,  2007  and  at  its  sole discretion, terminate  this  administered  shareholding structure  for  KLM  shares  through  SAK  I  and  SAK  II  and proceed  to  regroup  the  economic  and  voting  rights attached  to  the  KLM  shares,  thereby  holding  93.84%  of KLM's voting rights.\n\n## 6.3.2 Agreements with the Dutch State\n\nTo  enable  the  completion  of  the  business  combination and safeguard KLM's traffic  rights,  airline  status  and  the scale of its network and operations at Schiphol, Air France and KLM entered into the following agreements with the Dutch State.\n\n## Agreement for the acquisition of cumulative preference A shares held by the Dutch State\n\nOn October 16, 2003, Air France, KLM and the Dutch State signed an agreement pursuant to which the Dutch State agreed to decrease its interest in KLM proportionately to any  reduction  by  the  French  State  of  its  stake  in Air  France-KLM.  To  this  end,  the  Dutch  State  will  sell  its cumulative preferential A shares to Air France-KLM or to\n\nSAK  I  on  behalf  of  Air  France-KLM  as  long  as  this foundation  is  maintained.  In  such  case,  SAK  I  will  issue share  certificates  to  the  benefit  of  Air  France-KLM corresponding  to  the  cumulative  preferential  A  shares transferred  to  SAK  I.  These  share  certificates  confer  to Air  France-KLM  the  economic  right  attached  to  the transferred cumulative preferential A shares, i.e. a right to a dividend,  the  corresponding  voting  rights  being exercised by SAK I until the share certificates have been exchanged by Air France-KLM against the said shares.\n\nIn March 2005, pursuant to the agreement, 5,103,885 cumulative preference A shares were transferred by the Dutch State to SAK I on behalf of Air France-KLM, which received, in return, SAK I share certificates.",

In  addition,  Air  France-KLM  is  free  to  decide  to dissolve  the  foundations  at  any  time  and  at  its  sole discretion.\n\nFurthermore, the Dutch State benefits from the right to transfer,  at  any  time,  as  many  cumulative  preferential  A shares as it wishes to Air France-KLM.\n\nThese agreements relating to the cumulative preferential A shares remain in force.\n\n## Option for the Dutch State to subscribe for preferential KLM B shares\n\nThis option granted to the Dutch State lapsed in May 2010.\n\n## Assurances given to the Dutch State\n\n## Nature and duration of the assurances unilateral termination option\n\nWithin the framework of the 2004 business combination, Air France and KLM granted the Dutch State, for an initial eight-year  period  starting  from  the  completion  of  the business  combination  (i.e.  expiring  in  2012),  various assurances as  to  KLM's  airline  status,  its  air  services  and the  scale  of  its  passenger  and  cargo  operations  at Schiphol airport with a view to maintaining the quality of KLM's network at Schiphol which, according to the Dutch State, is of public interest, while at the same time taking into  account  the  interests  of  the  Air  France-KLM  group and its shareholders (the 'Assurances').\n\nIn return for these Assurances, the Dutch State undertook to take the importance of KLM's activities at Schiphol into consideration  when  defining  its  civil  aviation  policy. Furthermore, the Dutch State agreed to:\n\n- \u25a0 maintain the existing portfolio of traffic rights granted to KLM, other than those that have not been used by KLM over a cumulative period of twelve months;\n- \u25a0 continue  to  review  any  future  request  submitted  by KLM for the allocation of new traffic rights on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.\n\nPursuant to an agreement entered into on May 25, 2010, the  Dutch  State,  Air  France-KLM  and  KLM  agreed  to extend the Assurances given to the Dutch State, with the exclusion,  however,  of  an  assurance  foreseeing  that  the combined  growth  should  not  negatively  impact  KLM's operations in the passenger and cargo segment, beyond May 5, 2012 for an indefinite period, subject to Air France-\n\nKLM's  right  to  terminate  these  Assurances,  at  its  sole discretion, with  prior  notice  of  nine  months.  This agreement  was  confirmed  by  a  meeting  between,  inter alia,  the  Minister  for  Transportation  of  the  Netherlands, the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Air  FranceKLM and the President of the Management Board of KLM which took place on March 12, 2015.\n\n## Mechanism to ensure compliance with the Assurances\n\nAir France and KLM set up a Dutch foundation, known as the  KLM  Assurances  Foundation  (Stichting  Assurances KLM  -  duration  extended  in  2010)  to  facilitate  the provision  of  binding  advice  ( bindend  advise ) on  the interpretation  of  the  Assurances  granted  to  the  Dutch State  (the  'Advice').  These  advices  are  issued  by  a  KLM Assurances  Foundation  Committee  in  the  event  that  a decision  taken  by  the  KLM  Supervisory  Board,  KLM Management Board or Air France-KLM Board of Directors is  considered to be in conflict with the Assurances given to the Dutch State.\n\nWhen giving its Advice, the KLM Assurances Foundation must act in the best interests of KLM, the Air France-KLM group and its shareholders.\n\nThe Committee is composed of three members:\n\n- \u25a0 one member appointed by Air France-KLM;\n- \u25a0 one member appointed by the Dutch State; and\n- \u25a0 one  member  jointly  appointed  by  the  first  two members as well  as  by  a  Board  member  of  the  KLM Assurances Foundation appointed by KLM who is not a Committee  member;  it  being  specified  that  the member  appointed  by  Air  France-KLM  has  a  double voting right for the appointment  of  the  third Committee member.\n\nThe  filing  of  a  case  with  the  Foundation's  Committee relating to a decision taken by the KLM Supervisory Board, the KLM Management Board or the Air France-KLM Board of  Directors  can  be  made  by  the  Dutch  State  only  in relation to the Assurances given to it.\n\nIf  the  KLM  Assurances  Foundation  Committee  issues  an Advice  indicating  that  the  decision  submitted  to  it contravenes the Assurances given to the Dutch State, the KLM Supervisory Board, the KLM Management Board or the Air France-KLM Board of Directors will be required to cancel  or  amend  its  decision  as  soon  as  possible  and nullify  the  effects  of  any  measure  taken  in  connection with  the  said  decision,  in  accordance  with  the  issued Advice.  The  Committee's  decisions  are  adopted  by majority vote of its members.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, no Advice had been rendered by the KLM Assurances Foundation Committee.\n\n## 6.3.3 Assurances given to KLM\n\nThe assurances granted to KLM have been null and void since May 6, 2009.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

A  fourth  treaty, the  Rome  Convention  (1952),  covers  damage  caused  to third parties on the ground.\n\n## Freedoms of the air\n\nUnder a bilateral  treaty,  an  air  carrier  has  freedoms  that allow it  to  operate  in  the  air  space  and  the  territory  of  a State other than its State of origin. These eight freedoms are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 1 st freedom  -  A  carrier  that  leaves  from  its  State  of origin has the right to overfly the air space of a foreign State;\n- \u25a0 2 nd freedom  -  A  carrier  that  leaves  from  its  State  of origin has the right to make a technical layover without unloading or loading passengers in a foreign State. This freedom is the 'transit right';\n- \u25a0 3 rd freedom  -  A  carrier  that  leaves  from  its  State  of origin has the right to unload passengers from its State of origin in a foreign State;\n- \u25a0 4 th freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has  the  right  to  load  passengers  in  this  foreign  State and unload them in its State of origin;\n- \u25a0 5 th freedom  -  A  carrier  that  leaves  from  its  State  of origin has the right to unload and load passengers in two successive foreign States;\n- \u25a0 6 th freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has  the  right  to  load  passengers  in  that  State  and unload  them  in  its  State  of  origin,  then  in  another foreign State;\n- \u25a0 7 th freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in that State to unload them in another foreign State, without going through its State of origin;\n- \u25a0 8 th freedom  -  A  carrier  that  leaves  from  its  State  of origin  has  the  right  to  load  passengers  in  a  foreign State,  to  unload  them  in  another  city  in  this  same foreign State.\n\n## The Chicago Convention (1944)\n\nThe  Convention  relating  to  international  civil  aviation, known  as  the  Chicago  Convention,  sets  out  the  legal, regulatory  and  technical  rules  governing  commercial aviation and its Member State signatories are required to implement  a  common  legal  framework  governing  their domestic air space and their relations with one another.\n\nSigned  on  December  7,  1944,  the  Chicago  Convention established  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization (ICAO)  as  the  instrument  of  cooperation  between  the 193 signatory States in all areas of civil aviation.\n\n## The Montreal Convention (1999)\n\nThe Montreal Convention of May 1999, ratified to date by 136 States, aims  to provide better protection for passengers  suffering  damages.  This  convention  entered into  force  on  June  28,  2004.  It  is  based  on  several fundamental  provisions,  notably  the  principle  of  the unlimited liability of air transport companies in the event of  physical  injury  with  the  implementation  of  a  two-tier system:\n\n- \u25a0 a  first  tier  that  sets  an  objective  liability  for  the  air transport  company  of  up  to  128,821  Special  Drawing Rights (SDR);\n- \u25a0 a second tier, based on a presumption of fault for the air  transport  company,  for  which  the  airline  may  be exempt if it proves that it or its agents or officials have not  been  negligent  in  any  way  or  that  the  damages result exclusively from the acts of a third party.\n\n## The Rome Convention (1952)\n\nThe  Rome  Convention,  signed  in  1952,  covers  damages caused to third parties on the ground by foreign aircraft. This  convention  has  not  been  ratified  by  France,  the Netherlands  or  the  United  States.  The  ICAO's  legal commission  is  currently  involved  in  a  major  initiative  to redraft the wording which would facilitate its ratification by  making  a  distinction  between  everyday  risk  and terrorist risk.\n\nThe Convention intended to replace the Rome Convention, relating to compensation for damage caused to  third  parties  following  acts  of  unlawful  interference with  aircraft,  signed  in  Montreal  on  May  2,  2009  by thirteen  States,  for  the  most  part  African,  is  still  not applicable.  It  has  only  been  ratified  by  three  of  the  35 States required for its entry into force.",

        "page_content": "## OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## The Tokyo Convention (1963)\n\nThe  Tokyo  Convention,  in  force  since  December  4,  1969, sets out the principles and establishes the procedures for handling  offenses  against  penal  law  (except  those  of  a political nature and based on racial or religious discrimination)  and  acts  endangering  the  safety  of  the aircraft or that of the persons and property on board.\n\nOne  of  the  specific characteristics of this Tokyo Convention  is  that  it  recognizes  certain  powers  and immunities  of  aircraft  commanders,  exonerating  them, under certain conditions, from responsibility for any harm potentially caused  to individuals committing  such unlawful acts.\n\nThe  Tokyo  Convention  (ratified  by  France  in  1970)  is currently the subject of a revision process within the ICAO.\n\n## 6.4.2  European legislation\n\n## Single European air space\n\nFor  aviation  the  EEA  internal  market  (UE+,  Norway/ Iceland/Liechtenstein)  was  effectively  finalized  on  April  1, 1997, by common legislation that creates a homogeneous regulatory  situation  for  all  European  carriers.  Since  then all EU airlines may freely operate between any point in the EU and, in particular, perform cabotage operations within this  single  European  air  space.  This  legislation  also  lays down the requirements that Community air carriers must comply  with  in  order  to  start  or  continue  operations, principally they must be owned and effectively controlled by Member States and/or nationals of Member States, and their  principal  place  of  business  must  be  located  in  a Member State. These nationals can not act as a front for a beneficial  owner  who  is  not  a  citizen  of  an  EU  Member State. The existence of this legislation eliminated the need for  bilateral  agreements  between  EU  Member  States.  It does not prevent EU Member States from participating in ICAO,  nor  does  it  conflict  with  the  principles  and regulations of the Chicago Convention.\n\n## Open Skies agreements between Europe and third-party countries\n\nBased on mandates issued by the Council of Ministers, the European  Union  and  its  Member  States  have  signed  air transport  agreements  with  the  following  third-party countries:\n\n- \u25a0 United States: the agreement signed in April 2007 was amended by a protocol of June 2010 enabling, notably, European airlines  to  operate  an  unlimited  number  of flights,  aircraft  and  routes  to  the  United  States  from any  European  airport  with  the  freedom  to  set  prices, and to operate their services within the framework of cooperation agreements with partners of their choice. This  agreement  does  not  change  the  US  rules  on ownership and control and, similarly, cabotage remains forbidden;\n- \u25a0 Canada: the  agreement  signed  in  December  2009 offers EC carriers similar opportunities to those figuring in  the  agreement  with  the  United  States  and  also includes the same restrictions;\n\nA Protocol to amend the Tokyo Convention was adopted in Montreal on April 4, 2014. It gathered the minimum of 22 ratifications required for its entry into force and is thus applicable in the States having ratified it. It was ratified by France at the beginning of 2021.\n\nThe  Montreal  Protocol  expands  the  jurisdiction  by recognizing,  under  certain  conditions,  the  jurisdiction  of the State of Landing and the State of the Operator over offenses  and  acts  committed  on  board  aircraft.  The establishment  of  such  jurisdiction  over  offenses  is mandatory  if  the  criteria  stipulated  in  the  Protocol  are respected. Furthermore, the Protocol grants legal recognition  and  some  protections  to  in-flight  security officers. It also contains provisions covering matters such as  intra-State  coordination,  due  process  of  law  and  fair treatment.\n\n- \u25a0 European Union neighboring countries: the agreement  signed  with  Morocco  in  December  2006 was  the  first  in  a  series  of  agreements  signed  with European  Union  neighboring  countries:  Georgia  and Jordan  in  December  2010,  Moldavia  in  June  2012  and Israel  in  June  2013.  These  agreements  foresee  the liberalization  of  bilateral  air  relations  subject  to  the relevant  countries  adopting  the  EU  aviation-related acquis;\n- \u25a0 Balkan  States  (Albania,  Bosnia,  Macedonia,  UNMIK, Montenegro,  Serbia): the agreement  signed  in June 2006 aims to create a common air space. At the end  of  transition  periods  that  vary  by  country,  the Balkan  airlines  will  benefit  in  Europe  from  the  same traffic  rights  as  EC  airlines.  At  this  stage,  only  the 3 rd and 4 th freedom rights have been liberalized;\n- \u25a0 Qatar: the agreement signed in October 2021 aims, by 2024 and at the end of a gradual increase in 3 and 4 freedom traffic rights varying per country, to liberalize access  to  the  EU  market  for  Qatari  carriers.  In  return Qatari  carriers  are  bound  by  provisions  aimed  at guaranteeing their financial transparency and establishing a fair competition framework.;\n- \u25a0 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations): the agreement signed in October 2022 is the world's first block-to-block  agreement  to  allow  ASEAN  and  EU airlines  to  operate  an  unlimited  number  of  flights between  the  two  regions  (3  and  4  freedom  traffic rights).  In  addition,  airlines  from  each  country  in  one block  will  be  allowed  to  offer  up  to  seven  weekly passenger services and an unlimited number of cargo services  to  each  country  in  the  other  block  under 5 th freedom traffic rights, via any third country or to any third country beyond. Note that Malaysia has an opt-in arrangement  postponing  the  application  of  the agreement as far as it is concerned.\n\nIn  April  2002,  the  European  Union  also  signed  an  air transport  agreement  with  Switzerland  giving  Swiss carriers, which are assimilated with EU carriers, access to all  the  intra-Community  rights  with  the  exception  of cabotage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The aims as outlined in the work programs of the European Commission are to reinforce the competitiveness  of  European  Community  airlines  while insisting on the need to reduce the air transport industry's environmental  impact  and  offer  a  high  degree  of passenger protection (1) .\n\nThe principal  positive  measures  consist  of  establishing  a legal  framework  favoring  fair  competition  between  EU and  third-party  carriers,  the  effective  implementation  of the Single European  Sky  and  a  commitment  to developing biofuels.\n\nThe  European  Commission  also  proposed  a  series  of measures known as the 'Better Airports' package, aimed at  reducing  the  cost  of  infrastructure  use  within  the European Union.\n\nThe  latter  initiatives  have  only  very  partially  come  to fruition  due  to  persistent  disagreements  within  the European  institutions.  The  last  European  Commission Aviation Strategy published on December 7, 2015 included measures aimed at sustaining the competitiveness of EU airlines, such as the revision of (then) Reg. 868/2004 (now Reg. 712/2019) and  the  broader  Foreign  Subsidies Regulation.  These  regulations  have  been  adopted,  but have not yet been put to a test.\n\n## European Green Deal and 'Fit For 55' legislative package\n\nOn July  14,  2021,  the  European  Commission  presented  a package  of  15  draft  legislative  proposals  aimed  at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. These  draft  proposals  include  six  which  directly  impact the aviation sector and are of interest to the Air FranceKLM group:\n\n- \u25a0 ReFuel  EU  Aviation  sets  an  increasing  mandatory minimum  percentage for the incorporation of sustainable aviation fuel for  flights  on  departure  from all EU airports between 2025 and 2050;\n- \u25a0 the  revised  EU-ETS  Directive  aims  to  phase  out  free quotas for airlines in the EU Carbon Market;\n- \u25a0 the  Energy  Tax  Directive  aims  to  implement  a  tax  on fuel and remove the current exemption for aviation;\n- \u25a0 the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is targeting the introduction of a Carbon Tariff on imported goods and  services,  and  envisages  its  extension  to  airline operations over the medium term;\n- \u25a0 the RED directive on renewable energies establishes a list  of  raw  materials  (Annex  IX)  that  are  considered  to be  sustainable.  The  ReFuel  regulation  refers,  in particular,  to  this  list  of  raw  materials.  A  revision  of Annex IX by delegated act is currently being discussed and  the  final  adoption  of  this  revision  is  expected within the next few months;\n- \u25a0 the  Net  Zero  Industry  Act  (NZIA)  sets  targets  for  the deployment of certain net-zero technologies in Europe. These  include,  in  particular,  production  technologies for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).\n\nThe Air France-KLM group's teams are closely monitoring the progress of this legislative package in liaison with all the stakeholders. They are also contributing to the various consultations  launched  by  the  European  Commission, and  to  the  discussions  concerning  the  setting  of  new greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  targets  by  2040, which affects the transport sector in general.\n\n## 6.4.3  Other legal aspects of Air France-KLM's activities\n\nAccess to the main international airports is subject to the prior  allocation  of  time  slots.  A  European  Regulation covers  access  to  most  so-called  coordinated  European airports (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam, etc.). Elsewhere in the world, the allocation of slots is generally done on the basis of recommendations issued  by  IATA  in  a  Worldwide  Slot  Guidelines  reference document.  Countries  nonetheless  retain  sovereignty  for defining  the  modalities  of  slot  allocation  and  may  apply rules that differ slightly from the IATA recommendations (e.g. China, Japan, United States, Dubai, etc.).\n\nFor  airports  within  the  European  Union,  each  Member State  with  coordinated  airports  under  its  responsibility, after consulting the airlines that regularly use the airports concerned,  their  representative  organizations  and  the airport  authorities,  must  designate  a  coordinator  or  an entity to be responsible for the allocation of slots and the monitoring of their use. Such individuals or entities must have  specialized  knowledge  of  coordinating  aircraft routes for air transport companies.\n\nSlots  are  allotted  twice  a  year  by  the  designated  airport coordinator,  at  the  same  time  as  the  airline  flight schedules for the relevant IATA season.",

        "page_content": "## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe allocation procedure is as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 airlines file their slot applications with the coordinator five months prior to the beginning of each season;\n- \u25a0 the  coordinator  first  allocates  slots  to  airlines  that already  had  slots  the  previous  season  (known  as grandfather rights) for past operations;\n- \u25a0 a pool  is  then  created  that  regroups,  for  each coordination  period,  all  the  available  slots,  whether they are newly created, unused, abandoned by a carrier or have become available for any other reason;\n- \u25a0 finally, the coordinator allocates half of the pooled slots to  newcomers  and  the  other  half  to  the  other operators.\n\nSince  slots  are  first  allocated  to  existing  long-standing operators, and given the expansion plans of all the airlines, requests  for  new  slots  are  rarely  satisfied  at  saturated airports.\n\nAt the end of this preliminary allocation (pre-coordination) process,  a  conference  attended  by  virtually  all  airport coordinators  and  airlines  is  organized  in  order  to  enable the airlines to:\n\n- \u25a0 simultaneously coordinate the slots they are allocated on different airports so that when they operate flights between  two  coordinated  airports  they  are  granted compatible slots by each of them; and\n- \u25a0 exchange  slots  among  themselves  in  the  event  that the slots originally allocated by the airport coordinators are unsatisfactory.\n\nWithin the framework of the public health crisis linked to Covid-19,  Regulation  No.95/93  was  amended  for  the period from March 1, 2020 to October 24, 2020 to enable slots allocated for this period to be considered as having been  operated  by  the  air  carrier  to  which  they  were initially  granted.  On  October  14,  2020,  in  view  of  the continuing public health crisis and the weak demand for air  transportation  in  the  coming  months,  the  European Commission  decided  to  extend  this  exception  from  the requirement to the whole Winter scheduling season, i.e. until  March  27,  2021.  A  series  of  further  amendments  to the  Regulation  enabling  the  easing  of  the  conditions relating  to  the  operation  of  slots  and  covering  a  period extending  until  October  28,  2023  were  successively adopted between February 16, 2021 and October 19, 2022 (see  also  paragraph  3.1.2.5  'Loss  of  flight  slots  or  lack  of access to flight slots').\n\n## Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\nSee section 3.1.2.7.\n\n## Framework for State aid within the context of the public health crisis\n\nIn  March  2020,  the  European  Commission  adopted  a Temporary  Framework  to  enable  Member  States  to  use the full flexibility foreseen under State Aid rules to support the economy and companies facing the consequences of the  public  health  crisis.  Recapitalization  measures  for companies by Member States were authorized within this framework  until  June  30,  2022.  The  implementation  of measures to reinforce the Air France-KLM group's liquidity (consisting  of  the  guarantee  by  the  State  of  a  \u20ac4  billion bank  loan  (PGE)  and  a  \u20ac3  billion  loan  from  the  French State, together with the guarantee by the Dutch State of a \u20ac2.4  billion  revolving  credit  facility  and  a  \u20ac1  billion  loan from the Dutch State) was submitted for prior approval to the European Commission pursuant to the rules on State Aid, applying the aforementioned Temporary Framework. Similarly, the capital-strengthening measures in which the French  State  participated  during  2021  (\u20ac593  million  of shares  subscribed  during  the  capital  increase  and subscription  to  \u20ac3  billion  of  Deeply  Subordinated  Notes) were  the  subject  of  prior  approval  by  the  European Commission on April 4, 2021.\n\nOn April 6, 2021, the Group announced the first part of its overall recapitalization plan. Certain measures in this plan contained  State  Aid  (so-called  'Covid-19  recapitalization\" program) which were accordingly notified by the French authorities  to  the  European  Commission,  the  latter approving them in its decision of April 5, 2021 (annulled on December 20, 2023 by the General Court of the European Union - see below under Impact). This decision made the approval  of  the  measures  subject  to  a  number  of commitments  undertaken  by  the  French  State  (see section  1.2.5  above)  and  leading  notably  to  the  allocation by Air France of landing and take-off slots to a designated third-party  carrier  at  Orly  airport.  Other  undertakings  by the  French  State  were  also  imposed  on  the  Group companies (with the exception of KLM and its subsidiaries) within  the  framework  of  the  European  Commission's Temporary Framework for State Aid (such as restrictions on  acquisitions,  share  buybacks  and  dividend  payments) and  could  have  an  impact  on  the  Group's  activities.  All these constraints have disappeared since the full repayment of this recapitalization aid on April 19, 2023 (see \"Mitigation  plan\"  below).  Only  the  provision  concerning slots at Orly is still being implemented in accordance with the Commission's decision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",
