With the successful spino/ff and listing of our generics and biosimilars division Sandoz on the SIX Swiss Exchange in October, we concluded a major part of the portfolio transformation, which started 10 years ago and entailed the divestiture of several non-core businesses as well as the establishment of new therapy and technology platforms.\n\nThe portfolio changes are integral to our strategy, which aims  to  position  Novartis  in  highly  innovative  and fast-growing areas of healthcare, while focusing our organizational and operational structure. The shift from taking a broad market approach to going deep into select medical areas to achieve category leadership is set to guide our strategy in the future and is designed to spur sales and profit growth and create sustainable shareholder value.\n\nWe are confident that our strategic direction and our operational setup allow us to navigate the current market environment, which is characterized by a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical situation that is putting pressure on healthcare systems and is leading to major policy shifts. Our ability to adapt demonstrates the resilience of our business and our capacity to seize emerging opportunities.\n\nHaving introduced more than 40 new molecular entities into the market over the last two decades, we are among the world's most innovative pharmaceutical companies. By strengthening our expertise in specialized sectors, such as radioligand and RNA-based therapies, we can stay at the forefront of the rapid technological advances in our industry and di/fferentiate ourselves from our competitors.\n\nTo maintain this momentum, we will continue to invest substantial funds into research and development to create breakthrough therapies. Our executive leadership team has set in place a robust structure to fast-track our activities across our therapeutic areas and enable smooth project transitions between units.\n\nWe also continue to make progress on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities. We made substantial investments to reduce our environmental footprint and renewed our commitment toward the creation of more equitable healthcare systems. We also made significant investments to advance our portfolio of potential treatments for neglected tropical diseases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the same time, we continued e/fforts to reinforce integrity across our organization and foster a business culture in which ethics and compliance take center stage. The Board of Directors will continue to focus on this area as we recognize that trust, in addition to leadership in innovation and further performance improvement, is vital for building stronger partnerships with healthcare stakeholders around the world and helping to create more resilient and equitable healthcare systems.\n\nI thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend increase of 3% to CHF 3.30 at the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJoerg Reinhardt Chair of the Board of Directors",

With the Sandoz spin-o/ff largely completing the multiyear transformation of our company, we are now completely dedicated to bringing innovative medicines to the world.\n\nAs we enter this new era, our very strong financial and research and development (R&D) performance in 2023 underscores the benefits of our focused strategy and the progress we are making in creating value for shareholders and society.\n\nWe continued to show leadership in oncology, with strong growth for Kisqali and Pluvicto and important data readouts that show the potential to bring these medicines to broader patient populations in early breast cancer and in earlier lines of treatment for advanced prostate cancer, respectively.\n\nOther standout performers include Entresto , our treatment for heart failure and hypertension that has now reached more than 2 million patients in the US, and Kesimpta , our treatment for multiple sclerosis that almost doubled in sales from the previous year and has now reached more than 85 000 patients across 87 countries.\n\nAt the same time, we are investing to meet rising demand for our medicines and ensure we can deliver our treatments to people who need them. During the year, we opened a new radioligand therapy (RLT) facility in the US that helped us more than double weekly production capacity of Pluvicto in the market. We also opened an RLT facility in Spain and announced plans for new facilities in China and Japan.\n\nWe also achieved major innovation milestones that show the strength of our R&D pipeline and potential for future growth.  One major highlight was the approval of iptacopan to treat a rare blood disorder-the first of what we hope to be many approved indications for this molecule, which was discovered and developed by Novartis.\n\nOur pipeline was further strengthened by the acquisition of Chinook Therapeutics, which added two promising Phase III assets for IgA nephropathy. Together with iptacopan, these assets give us the potential to o/ffer a trio of di/fferentiated therapies for this rare, complement-mediated kidney disease.\n\nGoing forward, we're continuing to focus on improving our R&D performance and prioritization by fostering more streamlined collaboration between our research, development and commercial teams. We're also investing in artificial intelligence to accelerate R&D while putting in place guardrails for the ethical use of this rapidly developing technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside these achievements, we continued to deliver on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments to broaden access to our innovative medicines, tackle major global health challenges, advance gender equity, and reduce our impact on the environment.\n\nCulture continues to be foundational to our work, and I'm grateful for the ongoing commitment of our employees whose passion and dedication are driving our performance. This year, we largely completed the organizational transformation announced in 2022, helping to set a simpler structure for Novartis with streamlined processes and more agile decision-making.\n\nOur strong financial performance gives us confidence that our renewed strategy and simplified structure are enabling results, with 10% growth in sales (cc) and 18% growth in core operating income (cc).\n\nI'm filled with optimism for what's to come. The past year has shown the strength of our company and set a robust foundation for growth. Looking ahead, we aim to build on this momentum and bring the same dedication to innovation and excellence to create value for patients, for society, and for our shareholders.\n\nSincerely,\n\nVas Narasimhan Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n<!-- image -->",

You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Annual Report and in other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in or to maintain an investment in any Novartis securities. Our business, as well as our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and share price, could be materially adversely a/ffected by any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently considered material.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Key products and commercial priorities\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to deliver key commercial priorities and successfully launch new products\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business and to replace revenue and income lost to generic, biosimilar and other competition depends heavily on the commercial success of our new or existing key products. The commercial success of these products could be impacted at any time by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products, changes in the  prescribing  habits  of  healthcare  professionals, slower than expected post-launch adoption, unexpected side e/ffects or safety signals, supply chain issues or other product shortages, pricing pressure, regulatory proceedings, changes in labeling, loss of intellectual property protection, and global pandemics. In addition, our revenue and margins could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of new products.\n\nHealthcare professionals, patients and payers may choose competitor products instead of ours for various reasons, including if they perceive them to be better in terms of e/fficacy, safety, cost, convenience or other reasons. The commercial success of our key products and launches in the face of increasing competition requires significant attention, management focus and resource allocation. Such competition could significantly a/ffect the revenue from our products and our results of operations. This impact could also be compounded to the extent that such competition results in us making significant additional investments in research and development, marketing or sales.\n\nFurthermore, from time to time, we reassess how our business is organized to ensure we have the optimal structure with which to execute our strategy. An inability to successfully implement new organizational structures and operating models could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Research and development\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to successfully prioritize, integrate and execute our research and development programs for new products or new indications for existing products\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe engage in extensive and costly research and development  activities,  both  through  our  own  internal resources and through collaborations with third parties, in an e/ffort to identify and develop new products and new indications for existing products that address unmet, ever-changing medical needs, while ensuring commercial viability and success.

        "page_content": "advantage of new and potentially disruptive technologies, including cell, gene and radioligand therapies, depends in significant part on the success of these e/fforts.\n\nFailure to successfully develop our pipeline products is typically the result of the inherent uncertainty of science, suboptimal internal execution, or both. Key elements of internal execution include our ability to prioritize our investments on our highest potential value assets, optimize the transition of assets from research to development, integrate externally acquired assets in an e/fficient way, and execute the steps in our drug development process that enable our assets to be approved and reimbursed in a timely manner to positively impact clinical practice. We invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to achieve our goals, operate our business and reduce the time, e/ffort and expense associated with identifying, developing and commercializing new products. Our investments in new and disruptive technologies may not ultimately achieve the intended benefits, may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. For more information, see also 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overviewResearch and development.'\n\nOur new products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing and are approved by means of a highly complex, lengthy, and expensive approval process that varies substantially from country to country and may have very specific requirements for the recruitment of patients for clinical trials. We face increasing and evolving regulatory approval and reimbursement requirements. Additionally, if we fail to successfully progress late-stage assets and the core elements of drug development for key programs, this could have a negative impact on the development of our product pipeline, and ultimately on the success of our business and our financial results.\n\nAnother issue we face is the increasing challenge to adequately recruit a su/fficient number of patients in the US for clinical trials due to the cost and e/ffort associated with expanding our operations for the recruitment of patients into such trials. As a result, we may be unable to develop the necessary clinical evidence to support the desired indications and product profile for a particular disease that is needed to drive clinical adoption of our new products, and thereby achieve the full potential of our assets (also known as the 'target product profile'). Similarly, the post-approval regulatory burden has also increased. These requirements make the maintenance of regulatory approvals for our products increasingly expensive, and further heighten the risk of recalls, product withdrawals, changes to product specifications, loss of market share, and loss of revenue and profitability.\n\nThe  clinical  testing,  regulatory  processes  and post-approval activities described above become more di/fficult during pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during periods of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. This is due to challenges related to recruiting, enrolling and treating patients in clinical trials, as well as ensuring the supply of trial materials. For a further description of the research and development of, and approval processes for, our products, see 'Research and\n\ndevelopment' and 'Regulation' under 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview.'\n\nFurthermore, our research and development activities must be conducted in an ethical and compliant manner. Among other things, we are concerned with patient safety (both pre- and post-product approval), data privacy, current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, data integrity, the fair treatment of patients, diversity and inclusion in the recruitment of patients to clinical trials, and animal welfare. If we fail to properly manage such issues, we risk injury to third parties, damage to our reputation, negative financial consequences as a result of potential claims for damages, sanctions and fines, and the potential that investments in research and development activities may not bring the expected benefits to us.\n\n## Pricing, reimbursement and access\n\n## Risk description\n\nPricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing transparency and access to healthcare\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur business has continuously experienced significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products by governments, insurers and other payers. These pressures have many sources, including growth of healthcare costs as a percentage of gross domestic product; funding restrictions and policy changes; and public controversies, political debate, investigations and legal proceedings regarding pharmaceutical pricing. Pressures on pricing may negatively impact both our product pricing and the availability of our products.\n\nIn addition, we face numerous cost-containment measures imposed by governments and other payers. These include government-imposed industrywide price reductions, mandatory pricing systems, reference pricing systems, payers limiting access to treatments based on cost-benefit analyses, the importation of drugs from lower-cost countries to higher-cost countries, the shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher co-payments and co-pay accumulator programs, the limiting of physicians' ability to choose among competing medicines, the mandatory substitution of generic drugs for the patented equivalent, pressure on physicians to reduce  the  prescribing  of  patented  prescription medicines, increasing pressure on intellectual property protections, and growing requirements for increased transparency on pricing. For more information on price controls, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Price controls.'\n\nRecent trends in our external environment may have an impact on the likelihood of these pricing and reimbursement pressures occurring. Slow economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of war in certain parts of the world (which is contributing to challenges such as high energy costs and inflation) have led to an increased strain on fiscal budgets in many major economies. In addition, legislative developments such as those in the US (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act) and in Europe (e.g., the EU Joint Health Technology",

        "page_content": "Assessment and 2023 EU Pharmaceutical Legislation Update) pose potential further pressures on pricing and timelines for reimbursement in these countries. For example,  in  August  2023,  our  cardiovascular  drug Entresto was selected for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program in the US and additional Novartis products may be selected for price negotiation programs in the future. These external factors may materially a/ffect our ability to achieve value-based prices; to achieve and maintain an acceptable return on our investments in the research and development of our products; and may impact our ability to research and develop new products.\n\n## Alliances, acquisitions and divestments\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to identify, execute or realize the expected benefits from our external business opportunities\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nAs part of our strategy, we evaluate external opportunities that could strengthen our portfolio by acquiring and divesting products, entering businesses or entering into strategic alliances and collaborations. For example, in 2023, we closed the acquisitions of Chinook Therapeutics and DTx Pharma. This strategy is partly dependent on our ability to identify strategic external business opportunities, including assessing the value of the early phase companies, and to close transactions with third parties on acceptable terms and timelines.\n\nOnce the terms of a strategic transaction have been agreed with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that pre-transaction due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise during and after the transaction. Our e/fforts on such transactions can also divert management's attention from our existing businesses.\n\nAfter a transaction is closed, e/fforts to develop and commercialize acquired or licensed products, to integrate the acquired business or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. This may occur due to di/fficulties in retaining key personnel, customers and suppliers; failure to obtain marketing approval or reimbursement within expected timeframes or at all; di/fferences in corporate culture, standards, controls, processes and policies; or other factors. Transactions can also result in liabilities being incurred that were not known at the time of acquisition, or the creation of tax or accounting issues. Acquired businesses are not always in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Novartis standards, including, for example, Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or cGCP standards, which can be costly and time-consuming to remediate. Furthermore, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives within expected time frames, or at all. For more information about recent business acquisitions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions.'\n\nSimilarly, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully divest or spin o/ff businesses or other assets that we have identified for this purpose, or that any completed divestment or spin-o/ff will achieve the expected\n\nstrategic benefits, operational e/fficiencies or opportunities, or that the divestment or spin-o/ff will ultimately maximize shareholder value.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\n## Risk description\n\nExpiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protection\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nMany of our products are protected by intellectual property rights, which may provide us with exclusive rights to market those products for a limited time, and to enable our purpose of reimagining medicine by sustainably financing our research and development. However, the strength and duration of those rights can vary significantly from product to product and from country to country, and they may be successfully challenged by third parties or governmental authorities.\n\nLoss of intellectual property protection and the introduction of generic or biosimilar competition for a patented branded medicine in a country typically result in a significant reduction in net sales and operating income for the branded product. Such competition can occur after successful challenges to intellectual property rights or the regular expiration of the patent term or other intellectual property rights. Such competition can also result from the entry of generic or biosimilar versions of another medicine in the same therapeutic class as one of our drugs or in a competing therapeutic class, from a Declaration of Public Interest or the compulsory licensing of our intellectual property by governmental authorities, or as a result of a general weakening of intellectual property and governing laws in certain countries around the world. In addition, generic or biosimilar manufacturers may sometimes conduct so-called 'launches at risk' of products that are still under legal challenge for infringement, or whose patents are still under legal challenge for validity, before final resolution of legal proceedings.\n\nWe also rely in all aspects of our businesses on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, which we seek to protect through various measures, including confidentiality agreements with licensees, employees, third-party collaborators and consultants who may have had access to such information. If these agreements are breached or our other protective measures should fail, then our contractual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover our losses.\n\nWe may also be subject to assertions of intellectual property rights against our medicines by third parties. If successful, these actions may involve payment of future royalties or damages, for example for patent infringement, and may also involve injunctive relief requiring the removal of one or more dosage strengths of a product from the market (or removal of a therapeutic indication from the product's approved labeling) for a period of time or throughout the life of the asserted intellectual property right. Such damages or such an injunction may have a material impact on our operating income and net sales.\n\nIn any given year, we may experience a potentially significant impact on our net sales from products that have already lost intellectual property protections, as",

        "page_content": "well as products that may lose protection during the year. Because we may have substantially reduced marketing and research and development expenses related to products that are in their final years of exclusivity, the initial loss of protection for a product during a given year could also have an impact on our operating income for that year in an amount corresponding to a significant portion of the product's lost sales. The magnitude of the impact of generic or biosimilar competition on our income could depend on a number of factors. These include, with respect to income in a given year, the time of year at which the generic or biosimilar competitor is launched; the ease or di/fficulty of manufacturing a competitor product and obtaining regulatory approval to market it; the number of generic or biosimilar competitor products approved, including whether, in the US, a single competitor is granted an exclusive marketing period; whether an authorized generic is launched; the geographies in which generic or biosimilar competitor products are approved, including the strength of the market for generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical products in such geographies, and the comparative profitability of branded pharmaceutical products in such geographies; and our ability to successfully develop and launch new products for patients that may also o/ffset the income lost to generic or biosimilar competition. For more information on the patent and generic competition status of our products, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Intellectual property.'\n\n## Sandoz spin-o/ff\n\n## Risk description\n\nWe may not successfully achieve our goals related to our separation from Sandoz and our failure to do so may have an adverse impact on our business\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe recently completed the separation of Sandoz, our generics and biosimilars division, into a new Swiss publicly traded independent company, by way of a 100% spin-o/ff. In connection with the Sandoz separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements. These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between Novartis  and  Sandoz  going  forward,  including  with respect to the allocation of assets and liabilities between Novartis and Sandoz. The agreements also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other company for a period of time. The terms, scope and/or duration of these agreements could negatively impact our ability to pursue other strategic business interests as we will have to devote resources and capacity to fulfilling our obligations that we may prefer to direct elsewhere. If we or Sandoz are unable to satisfy our respective obligations under these agreements, we could incur losses or experience operational challenges or di/fficulties. These agreements could also lead to disputes over the performance of obligations under these agreements or the allocation of our respective resources. For example, during the term of these agreements, we may have less flexibility to optimize our biologic manufacturing for our own products (or those of other third parties). In addition, pursuant to these\n\nagreements, we will perform technical development services for Sandoz, which may involve certain proprietary know-how. While we intend to retain the personnel involved in our technical research and development and to protect our trade secrets, provision of such services might create the incremental potential for the disclosure or misuse of such proprietary know-how, particularly in connection with technology transfer at the end of such arrangements.\n\nAdditionally, we may not realize the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, or other benefits from our separation of Sandoz. We cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the Sandoz spin-o/ff will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved. In addition, we incurred one-time costs and may encounter operational ine/fficiencies in connection with the Sandoz spin-o/ff that may negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve. If we do not realize these assumed benefits, we could su/ffer a material adverse e/ffect on our financial condition.\n\nFurther, if the spin-o/ff does not generally qualify as a tax-neutral transaction for Swiss and U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our shareholders, or both, could be subject to significant tax liabilities. The spin-o/ff is intended to qualify for tax-neutral treatment for us and our shareholders for Swiss and U.S. federal income tax purposes. If, however, the spin-o/ff fails to qualify as tax-neutral for Swiss and U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our shareholders, or both, could recognize taxable gain with respect to the spin-o/ff, resulting in Swiss and U.S. income, withholding and capital gains tax consequences. In particular, if the spin-o/ff does not qualify as tax neutral for Swiss and U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders who received shares of Sandoz in the spin-o/ff as part of the separation would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares. For additional information about the potential tax consequences of the spin-o/ff, see 'Item 10.E Taxation-Tax consequences of the Sandoz spin-o/ff.'\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to meet rapidly evolving environmental, social and governance expectations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nIncreasingly, in addition to financial results, companies are being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, which can contribute to the long-term sustainability of a company's performance. An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and to meet societal expectations could result in negative impacts on our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results, and share price.\n\nTopics related to large societal changes such as social inequity, access to medicines and climate change are increasingly important to a wide range of our stakeholders. For example, a variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition,  investments  in  funds  that  specialize  in",

        "page_content": "companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in making their investment decisions. Our actions related to ESG topics may in the long-term impact our operations and ability to achieve our strategic goals, and ultimately could have a potential negative impact on the value of Novartis.\n\nWe actively manage a broad range of ESG matters, taking into consideration their expected impact on the sustainability of our business over time, and the potential impact of our business on society and the environment. We have created a Sustainability & ESG O/ffice, which, in coordination with the ESG Committee of the Executive Committee of Novartis, is tasked with developing our ESG strategy and tracking our performance against our ESG targets. However, considering the fast pace of change of external expectations, and a range of upcoming regulations, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, that the ESG standards we currently use to measure our performance against will remain the same, or that we will successfully meet society or investors' expectations. Failure to meet rapidly evolving regulatory requirements and investor and societal expectations could also result in litigation or  regulatory  actions,  which  could  have  a  material adverse impact on our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results, and share price. Additionally, external partners in our value chain that we do not control may not comply with ESG commitments and goals we set for ourselves, which may have a negative impact on our business.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Cybersecurity and data protection\n\n## Risk description\n\nCybersecurity breaches, data loss and catastrophic loss of IT systems\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe are heavily dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology (IT) systems, including internet-based systems to support our business processes. We also outsource significant parts of our IT infrastructure to third-party providers, and currently use these providers to perform business-critical IT services for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents on such networks and systems, whether our own or those of the third-party providers that we contract, and we have experienced, and may in the future experience, such cybersecurity threats and attacks. Cybersecurity threats and attacks take many forms, and the size, age and complexity of our IT systems make them potentially vulnerable to external and internal security threats; outages; malicious intrusions and attacks; cybercrimes, including state-sponsored cybercrimes; malware; misplaced data, lost data or data errors; programming or human errors; or other similar events. The risk of such threats and attacks has increased, as virtual and remote working have become more common, and sensitive data is accessed by employees\n\nworking in less secure, home-based environments. In addition, due to our reliance on third-party providers, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions, delays or outages in IT service availability due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks experienced by or caused by third-party providers. Interruptions in the service provided by these third parties could a/ffect our ability to perform critical tasks.\n\nA significant information security or other event, such as a disruption or loss of availability of one or more of our IT systems, whether managed by us or a third-party service provider, has previously and could in the future negatively impact important business processes, such as the conduct of scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of data and information to health authorities, our manufacturing and supply chain processes, our shipments to customers, our compliance with legal obligations, and communication between employees and with third parties. IT issues have previously led to, and could in the future lead to, the compromise of trade secrets or other intellectual property that could be sold and used by competitors to accelerate the development or manufacturing of competing products; the compromise of personal financial and health information; and the compromise of IT security data such as usernames, passwords and encryption keys, as well as security strategies and information about network infrastructure, which could allow unauthorized parties to gain access to additional systems or data. In addition, malfunctions in software or medical devices that make significant use of IT could lead to a risk of direct harm to patients.\n\nAlthough we have experienced some of the events described above, to date they have not had a material impact on our operations. Nonetheless, the occurrence of any of the events described above in the future could disrupt our business operations and result in enforcement actions or liability, including potential government fines and penalties, claims for damages, and shareholder litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.\n\nAny significant events of this type could require us to expend significant resources beyond those we already invest to remediate any damage, to further modify or enhance our protective measures, and to enable the continuity of our business.\n\n## Strategic technology programs implementation\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to successfully implement our IT strategy may disrupt our core business processes\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe rely on various IT systems to operate our complex global business and several of our current IT systems are reaching the end of their useful life, which could cause disruptions to our operational stability. As a result, we are implementing several companywide IT programs to replace and consolidate outdated IT systems and to simplify and standardize our processes, systems and tools, and create a unified data marketplace. Implementation and operation of these new systems involves certain risks, including the potential for a failure of the new",

Our inability to timely and successfully implement our IT strategy may prevent us from materializing the expected business benefits and could lead to business disruptions, cost ine/fficiencies and potential exposure to legal, regulatory and reputational risks as our internal controls could be negatively a/ffected. Any disruptions or malfunctions of new systems could cause critical information to be delayed, lost, defective, corrupted, or rendered inadequate or inaccessible, which could negatively impact our operations, the e/ffectiveness of our internal controls and financial condition.\n\n## Talent management\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to identify, attract, develop and retain qualified talent for critical roles\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe rely on identifying, attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, highly skilled workforce across our business and functions to achieve our objectives. If we are unable to sustain our supply of key personnel-including senior  members  of  our  scientific  and  management teams, high-quality researchers and development specialists and skilled employees with key capabilities in key markets-our ability to achieve our major business objectives may be adversely a/ffected. In addition, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted, and the diversity of our workforce may decline.\n\nThe market for skilled talent has become increasingly competitive, and we anticipate this trend will persist in the long term. We face a challenge to attract and retain top talent in several areas, including biology, immunology, chemistry, clinical development, drug manufacturing, data, digital and IT, oncology, and advanced therapy platforms (i.e., gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy and 'xRNA'). In addition, many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research centers, and government entities with significant capital are not only competing with us to attract the same skilled talent but are also aggressively pursuing our experienced talent. Furthermore, if we are unable to retain and engage key talent of companies that we acquire and integrate, we may not be able to realize the full value of these acquisitions.\n\nIn recent years, we have adopted new ways of working  that  include  location  flexibility  and  increasingly recruiting from a global pool of talent. However, the success of our business continues to depend on having employees who possess local knowledge of, and experience in, our key markets. The external talent supply is especially limited in many of the geographies that are expected to be sources of growth for us. In the United States, China and several other markets, the geographic mobility of talent is decreasing, as they find ample career opportunities available closer to home.\n\nThe risks associated with the challenging talent market will be exacerbated if we are unable to retain and e/ffectively develop employees, and to maintain an internal pipeline with critical skills, experiences, and leadership to deliver our business priorities. As a result, development, engagement, motivation, succession planning and performance rewards for our critical talent are essential to achieve our business priorities.\n\n## External partner risk management and human rights\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to maintain adequate governance and oversight over external partner relationships, and failure of external partners to meet their contractual, regulatory or other obligations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe rely on external partners for the performance of certain key business functions and services, including, among others, research and development, manufacturing operations and warehousing and distribution, certain finance functions, sales and marketing activities and data management. Some external partners, particularly those in developing countries, do not have internal compliance systems or resources comparable to ours. As a result, our investment and e/fforts in relation to external partner management include focusing on risk management and the oversight of such external partners.\n\nOur reliance on external partners poses certain risks, including the misappropriation of our intellectual property, the failure of the external partner to comply with regulatory and quality assurance requirements, the failure of the external partner to comply with environmental, anti-bribery and human rights standards and regulations, unexpected supply disruptions, breach of our agreement by the external partner, and the unexpected termination or nonrenewal of our agreement by the external partner.\n\nIn addition, governments require us, and the public expects us, to take responsibility for and report on compliance with various human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental practices, as well as other actions of our external partner contractors around the world.\n\nUltimately, if external partners fail to meet their obligations to us, we may lose our investment in the relationship with the external partners or fail to receive the expected benefits of our agreements with such external partners. While we aim to identify and assess any risk of harm to society caused by our external partners' operations, should any of these external partners fail to comply with the law or our standards, or should they otherwise act inappropriately while performing services for us, we could be held responsible for their acts, our reputation may su/ffer, and penalties could be imposed on us.\n\n## Legal, regulatory, ethics and compliance\n\n## Risk description\n\nChallenges  posed  by  evolving  legal  and  regulatory requirements, innovative and disruptive technologies, and societal expectations regarding ethical behavior",

        "page_content": "## Context and potential impact\n\nWe are subject to an extensive and complex framework of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nThe laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry and applicable to us are broad in scope, are subject to change, and have evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. For example, we have been, are currently, and may in the future be, subject to various significant legal proceedings, such as private party litigation, government investigations and law enforcement actions worldwide. These types of matters may take various forms based on evolving government enforcement and private party litigation priorities, and could include, for example, matters pertaining to: pricing; bribery and corruption; trade regulation and embargo legislation; product liability; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful discharge; antitrust and competition; securities; government benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; healthcare fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider trading; occupational health and safety; environmental regulations; tax; cyber and data security; use of technologies, including AI; data privacy; regulatory interactions; disclosure compliance; and intellectual property. Such matters can involve civil or criminal proceedings and can retroactively challenge practices previously considered to be legal.\n\nThere is also a risk that governance of our medical and patient support activities, and of our interactions with governments, public o/fficials/institutions, healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations and patient organizations may be inadequate or fail, or that we may undertake activities based on improper or inadequate scientific justification.\n\nLegal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and significant judgments sometimes occur. Consequently, we may in the future incur judgments that could involve large payments, including the potential  repayment  of  amounts  allegedly  obtained improperly, and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, such legal proceedings and investigations, even if meritless, may a/ffect our reputation, may create a risk of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the US and other countries, and may lead to civil litigation or criminal exposure. As a result, having considered all relevant factors, we have in the past and may again in the future enter into major settlements of such claims without bringing them to final legal adjudication by courts or other such bodies, despite having potentially significant defenses against them, to limit the risks they pose to our business and reputation. Such settlements may require us to pay significant sums of money and to enter into corporate integrity or similar agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for extended periods. From time to time, we may also initiate challenges to laws or regulations that we believe are illegal or unconstitutional. For example, in September 2023, we filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services because we believe the drug price-setting provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are unconstitutional and will have\n\nlong-lasting negative consequences for patients by limiting access to medicines now and in the future. The result of this and similar litigation we may pursue in the future is inherently uncertain and may negatively impact our business and reputation.\n\nFor information on significant legal matters pending against us, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 21. Provisions and other non-current liabilities' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 29. Commitments and contingent liabilities.'\n\nNew requirements may also be imposed on us due to  changing  government  and  societal  expectations regarding the healthcare industry, and acceptable corporate behavior generally. For example, we are faced with laws and regulations requiring changes in how we do business, including with respect to disclosures concerning our interactions with healthcare professionals, healthcare  organizations  and  patient  organizations. These laws and regulations include requirements that we disclose payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals and organizations, as well as information relating to the costs and prices for our products, which represent evolving standards of acceptable corporate behavior. These requirements may cause us to incur significant costs, including substantial time and additional resources, that are necessary to bring our interactions with healthcare professionals and organizations into compliance with these evolving standards.\n\nTo support our e/fforts to comply with the many requirements that impact us, we have a significant global ethics, risk and compliance program in place, and we devote substantial time and resources to e/fforts to ensure that we conduct business in a lawful manner, and in line with society's expectations. Despite our e/fforts, an actual or alleged failure to comply with the law or with heightened public expectations could lead to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance, or to other significant losses.\n\n## Manufacturing and product quality\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nThe development and manufacture of our products is complex and heavily regulated by governmental health authorities around the world. Regardless of whether our products and the related raw materials are developed and manufactured at our own manufacturing sites or by third parties, we must ensure that all development and manufacturing  processes  comply  with  regulatory requirements, as well as our own quality standards in order to deliver novel therapies while ensuring patient safety. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of products, injunctions, product recalls, failure to secure product approvals, debarment or harm to patients or our reputation.\n\nIn recent years, global health authorities have substantially intensified their scrutiny of manufacturers' compliance with regulatory requirements.

        "page_content": "failure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory  requirements,  or  with  health  authorities' expectations, may create the need to suspend clinical trials, shut down production facilities or production lines, and recall commercial products. A failure to fully comply with regulatory requirements could also lead to a delay in the approval of new products, an inability to ship or import our products, and significant penalties and reputational harm.\n\nIn addition, the technically complex manufacturing processes required to manufacture many of our products increase the risk of both production failures and product recalls, and can increase the cost of producing our goods. Some of our products require a supply of highly specialized raw materials, such as cell lines, tissue samples, bacteria, viral strains and radioisotopes. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products and products that involve advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy, and 'xRNA,' all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. For more information, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B. Business overview-Production.' As a result, even slight deviations at any point in their production processes or in the materials used have led to, and may in the future lead to, production failures or recalls.\n\n## Supply chain\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to maintain continuity of product supply\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nMany of our products are produced using technically complex manufacturing processes and require a supply of highly specialized raw materials. For some of our products and raw materials, we may rely on a single source of supply. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products, and products that involve advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy, and 'xRNA,' all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. Due to this complexity, there is a risk of production and supply of critical raw materials failures, which may result in supply interruptions or product recalls due to manufactured products not meeting required specifications.\n\nIn addition, due to the inherent complexities of our manufacturing processes and the supply chains for advanced therapy platforms, we are required to plan our production activities and purchase of materials well in advance. If we su/ffer from third-party raw material shortages, underestimate market demand for a product, or fail to accurately predict when a new product will be approved for sale, then we may not be able to produce su/fficient product to meet demand. These issues could be made worse during a pandemic, or geopolitical events, such as wars in certain parts of the world, and could lead to (i) a sudden increase in demand for selected medicinal products, resulting in the short-term unavailability of critical materials; (ii) logistical and supply challenges that may lead to our inability to ship products from one location to another due to restrictions imposed as a result of\n\na pandemic or geopolitical events and any related sanctions, which can also impact transportation and warehousing costs; or (iii) our inability to properly operate a manufacturing site due to restrictions imposed as the result of a pandemic or any issues arising from geopolitical events.\n\nOur or our suppliers' inability to manage such issues could lead to shutdowns, product shortages, or to us being entirely unable to supply products to patients for an extended period of time. Furthermore, as our products are intended to promote the health of patients, such shortages or shutdowns could endanger our reputation and have led to, and could continue to lead to, significant losses of sales revenue, potential litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.\n\n## Data privacy\n\n## Risk description\n\nNoncompliance with personal data protection laws and regulations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe operate in an environment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients and other individuals' personal information, including via social media and mobile technologies. In addition, the operation of our business requires data to flow across the borders of numerous countries in which there are di/fferent, potentially conflicting, and frequently changing, data privacy laws in e/ffect. Examples of such laws include: the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); the California Consumer Privacy Act; Brazil's General Personal Data Protection Law; and the Personal Information Protection Law in China. Such laws impose stringent requirements on how we and third parties with whom we contract collect, share, export or otherwise process personal information, and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Breaches of our systems or those of our third-party contractors, or other failures to protect the data we collect from misuse or breach by third parties, could expose such personal information to unauthorized persons.\n\nEvents involving the substantial loss of personal information, use of personal information without a legal basis, or other privacy violations could give rise to significant liability, reputational harm, damaged relationships with business partners, and potentially substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions under laws enacted or being enacted around the world. Such events could also lead to restrictions on our ability to use personal information and/or transfer personal information across country borders, which could interfere with critical business operations. In addition, there is a trend of increasing divergence of data privacy legal frameworks, not only across these frameworks but also within individual legal frameworks themselves. This divergence may constrain the implementation of global business processes and may lead to di/fferent approaches on the use of health data for scientific research, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.",

Reports of adverse  events  related  to  falsified  medicines  and increased levels of falsified medicines in the healthcare system a/ffect patient confidence in genuine medicines and in healthcare systems in general. These events could also cause us substantial reputational and financial harm, and potentially lead to litigation if the adverse event from the falsified medicine is mistakenly attributed to the genuine one. Stolen or illegally diverted medicines that are not properly stored and later sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Furthermore, there is a direct financial loss when falsified medicines replace sales of genuine medicines, or genuine medicines are recalled following the discovery of falsified products.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\n## Geopolitical developments\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of geo- and socio-political threats\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nGeopolitical tensions in various parts of the world worsened in 2023 and could continue to worsen in 2024 and beyond. Direct conflicts, including the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, an increasingly challenging economic landscape and social unrest, each have both a direct and indirect impact on the pharmaceutical industry and lead to a degree of uncertainty about the future.\n\nAs a result of ongoing geopolitical tensions, certain countries have adopted, and may in the future adopt additional, protectionist measures including the imposition of tari/ffs. Tari/ffs that are intended to shield domestic markets from foreign competition and the possibility of additional trade restrictions, such as export controls, could have a material impact on our business. If tari/ffs or export controls on pharmaceutical products or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were increased in certain parts of the world, our supply chain and flow of our products could be immediately disrupted. There is also an additional risk that aggressive monetary and fiscal policies by governments and central banks to curb inflation may prompt market-specific recessions and raise the cost-of-living, further putting pressure on pricing and cost containment for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nCollectively, unstable geo- and socio-political conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the costs and di/fficulties of\n\ninternational transactions. This could potentially impact our ability to develop and supply our products to patients in an undisrupted fashion, and further erode reimbursement mechanisms for our medicines.\n\n## Macroeconomic developments\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of macroeconomic developments\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur business may be impacted by deteriorating macroeconomic and financial conditions directly a/ffecting us, our suppliers, payers and consumers. Given that patients, in many countries, directly pay a sizable and increasing portion of their own healthcare costs, there is a risk that consumers may cut back on prescription drugs due to financial constraints.\n\nNegative macroeconomic developments may also adversely a/ffect the ability of payers, as well as our distributors, customers, suppliers, and service providers, to pay for our products, or to buy necessary inventory or raw materials, and to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Weakening growth and rising interest rates may also increase the credit risk of our counterparties. Although we make e/fforts to monitor the financial condition and liquidity of these third parties, our ability to do so is limited, and some of them may become unable to pay their bills in a timely manner or may even become insolvent. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with fiscally challenged government payers, or with third parties with substantial exposure to such payers.\n\nAt the same time, significant changes, and potential future volatility in financial markets, the consumer and business environment, the competitive landscape, and the global political and security landscape make it increasingly di/fficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings. As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook that we have given or might give may be overtaken by events or may otherwise prove to be inaccurate. Although we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenues and earnings at the time at which we give such guidance, based on then-current knowledge and conditions, there is a risk that such guidance or outlook will prove to be incorrect.\n\nAsset price corrections in financial markets may also result in lower returns on our financial investments. In addition, pricing pressures in developed markets resulting from e/fforts to reduce the cost of healthcare (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act in the US, which targets drug prices) may have a negative impact on our revenue and our net sales. In addition, inflation may have an impact on our operating costs in the form of higher prices for supplies, energy, raw materials, wages, and capital, which could reduce our net income.\n\nUncertainties around future central bank and other economic policies in the US and EU, including rising interest rates, as well as high debt levels in some countries could also impact world trade. Sudden increases in economic, currency or financial market volatility in di/fferent countries, such as appreciation of the US dollar, have also impacted, and may continue to have an unpredictable impact on our business, or results of operations,",

Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to manage physical and transition risks from climate change\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe are exposed to a broad range of climate risks such as transition risks (e.g., regulatory frameworks, carbon pricing, and the cost of and access to capital) and physical risks (e.g., heat, water scarcity, rising sea levels, and flooding from severe weather events), which could vary in magnitude and impact across di/fferent countries.\n\nClimate change has triggered, and may continue to trigger, the adoption of new regulatory requirements across the globe, as well as rapidly evolving societal expectations. To comply with such legislation and meet such expectations, we may be required to increase our investment in technology to reduce our energy use, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, legislative and regulatory action, both current and in the future, includes or could include, carbon pricing, climate risk-related disclosures, and changes in zoning or building codes to increase climate resilience. As a result, the combined impact of these transition risks could increase our direct operating costs or be passed on to us through the impact on our supply chain. As a result of these transition risks, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025, and carbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition, we are committed to achieving net zero across our value chain by 2040. Any failure to achieve these commitments in the expected time frame, or at all, could result in negative impacts on our reputation, our operations, and the price of our shares.\n\nClimate change has created, and will continue to create, physical risks to our business. Some of our production facilities that depend on the availability of significant water supplies are located in areas where fresh water is increasingly scarce. Other facilities are located in areas that, due to increasingly violent weather events, rising sea levels, or both, are increasingly at risk of substantial damage. In regions where such a risk is present, this has an impact not only on our own operations but also our distributed supply chain. Such events may result in the loss of life, increased costs, business interruptions, destruction of facilities, and disruption to healthcare systems that patients use to access our medicines.\n\n## Tax laws and developments\n\n## Risk description\n\nChanges in tax laws or their application\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur multinational operations are taxed under the laws of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws or in their application could lead to an increased risk of international tax disputes and an increase in our e/ffective tax rate, which could adversely a/ffect our financial results. The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities in di/fferent countries as to the profits to be taxed in the individual countries, including potential disputes relating to the prices our subsidiaries charge one another for intercompany transactions, known as transfer pricing. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims are largely untried and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially di/fferent from the amounts accrued.\n\nIn 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a new initiative on behalf of the G20 to minimize profit shifting by working toward a global tax framework that ensures that corporate income taxes are paid where consumption takes place, in addition to introducing a global standard on minimum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution processes. This project achieved OECD political consensus in October 2021, and the detailed principles are still under discussion by the OECD and political leaders. The OECD expects that the implementation of these new principles will begin globally in 2024. However, some countries already announced postponement to 2025 while others have not taken any implementation steps so far. Once changes to the tax laws in any jurisdiction in which we operate are enacted or substantially enacted, we will be subject to the OECD top-up tax, the aim of which is to bring the total amount of taxes paid on our profit in a given jurisdiction up to a minimum rate of 15%. In June 2023, the Swiss public voted to approve an amendment to the Swiss Constitution that provides the legal basis for the implementation of an OECD compliant minimum tax in Switzerland. In December 2023, the Swiss federal council partially implemented the OECD 15% minimum tax for the financial year 2024 in the form of a qualified domestic top-up tax (QDMTT), which will be assessed on certain qualifying profits earned by companies domiciled in Switzerland. This QDMTT will not be applied to qualifying profits earned by a company's a/ffiliates domiciled in tax jurisdictions outside of Switzerland. The timing and specific provisions of any further tax regulations remain subject to assessments in political and technical forums at both a federal and cantonal level.",

        "page_content": "Due to the ongoing discussion in many countries on the implementation and additional guidance from the OECD, the full impact of the OECD minimum tax project on our financial position, income statement and cash flows cannot currently be estimated.  On September 12, 2023, the EU Commission published two draft directives relating to international tax. The draft Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT) directive provides common rules for determining the corporate tax base for EU-based entities that are part of a group with global consolidated revenues above EUR 750 million. The BEFIT proposal includes provisions for a formula-driven allocation of profits between relevant EU member states which would then be subject to the corporate income tax rate of the respective member state. The draft transfer pricing directive aims to harmonize transfer pricing rules within the EU consistent with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. It also clarifies processes for relieving double taxation within the EU. Both draft directives require unanimous agreement among EU member states before they can be further implemented. In the US, the IRA was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA creates a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on the profits of corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeds USD 1.0 billion. The IRA also includes a one percent excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. Additionally, the IRA also contains  provisions  that  a/ffect  tax-exempt  entities, including tax credit opportunities to encourage investment in clean energy and expanded incentives for energy-e/fficient construction by tax-exempt entities.\n\nWhile we have taken steps to comply with the evolving tax initiatives of the OECD, the US and the EU, and we will continue to do so, significant uncertainties remain as to the outcome of our e/fforts.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 7. Income taxes' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 13. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.'\n\n## General risks\n\n## Indebtedness\n\n## Risk description\n\nOur indebtedness could adversely a/ffect our operations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had USD 18.4 billion of non-current financial debt, and USD 6.2 billion of current financial debt. Our current and long-term debt requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service interest and principal payments and, if interest rates rise, this amount may increase. As a result, our existing debt may limit our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to engage in transactions, or to meet other capital needs, or otherwise may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. Our debt could also limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business or industry, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy. We may also have di/fficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring\n\nnew debt on terms that we would consider to be commercially reasonable, if at all.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Risk description\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant impairment charges\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, including, in particular, substantial goodwill and other intangible assets obtained through acquisitions, including  most  recently  through  our  acquisitions  of  The Medicines Company, Endocyte, Novartis Gene Therapies, ADACAP, and Chinook Therapeutics. As a result, we may incur significant impairment charges in the future if the fair value of the intangible assets and the groupings of cash-generating units containing goodwill would be less than their carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet at any point in time.\n\nWe regularly review our intangible and tangible assets for impairment, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2023, for example, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of USD 3.0 billion.\n\nFor a detailed discussion about how we determine whether an impairment has occurred, what factors could result in an impairment, and the impact of impairment charges on our results of operations, see Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting policies' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 12. Goodwill and intangible assets.'\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rates\n\n## Risk description\n\nNegative e/ffect on financial results due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nChanges in exchange rates between the US dollar, which is our reporting currency, and other currencies can result in significant increases or decreases in our reported sales, costs and earnings as expressed in US dollars, and in the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows.\n\nIn addition to ordinary market risk, there is a risk that countries could take a/ffirmative steps that could significantly impact the value of their currencies. Such steps could include 'quantitative easing' measures and potential withdrawals by countries from common currencies. In addition, countries facing local financial di/fficulties, including countries experiencing high inflation rates, and highly indebted countries facing large capital outflows, may impose controls on the exchange of foreign currency. Currency exchange controls and sanctions could limit our ability to distribute retained earnings from our local a/ffiliates, or to pay intercompany payables due from those countries.",

        "page_content": "Despite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge against foreign currency exchange risks, as a significant portion of our earnings and expenditures are in currencies other than the US dollar, including expenditures in Swiss francs that are significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate volatility may negatively and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition, and may impact the reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and liabilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict. Furthermore, depending on the movements of particular foreign exchange rates, we may be materially adversely a/ffected at a time when the same currency movements are benefiting some of our competitors.\n\nFor more information on the e/ffects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated financial statements and on how we manage currency risk, see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.B Liquidity and capital resources-E/ffects of currency fluctuations' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 30. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Key customers\n\n## Risk description\n\nConcentration among our key customers\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nA significant portion of our global sales is made to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers, retail chains and other purchasing organizations. For example, our three most important customers globally accounted for approximately 15%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of net sales from continuing operations in 2023. The largest trade receivables outstanding were for these three customers, amounting to 17%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of the trade receivables at December 31, 2023. Historically, there has been a trend of consolidation among our customer base, which may continue in the future. As a result, we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk among our key customers. If one or more of our major customers experienced financial di/fficulties, the e/ffect on us would be considerable, and could include a substantial loss of sales and an inability to collect amounts owed to us.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of environmental liabilities\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nThe environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on us to investigate and remediate contaminated sites, including in connection with activities in the past by businesses that are no longer part of Novartis. In some cases, these remediation e/fforts may take many years. While we have set aside\n\nprovisions for known worldwide environmental liabilities that are probable and estimable, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts for which we have provided in our consolidated financial statements. If environmental contamination resulting from our facility operations, business activities or products adversely impacts third parties or if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities, including the safety of our employees and contractors, and the environmental risks, we may face substantial one-time and recurring costs and other penalties, and be required to increase our provisions for environmental liabilities. Furthermore, our headquarters and a number of our major production and research facilities are located near earthquake fault lines in Basel, Switzerland. Other major facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in various locations around the world. A major earthquake could result in loss of life, business interruptions and the destruction of our facilities. See also 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 21. Provisions and other non-current liabilities.'\n\n## Pension plans\n\n## Risk description\n\nInaccuracies in the assumptions and estimates used to calculate our pension plan and other post-employment obligations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe sponsor pension and other post-employment benefit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the discount rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pension increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants provide our management with historical statistical information, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection with these estimates.\n\nAssumptions and estimates that we use may di/ffer materially from the actual results we experience due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other factors. Depending on events, such di/fferences could have a material e/ffect on our total equity, and may require us to make additional contributions to our pension funds.\n\nFor more information on obligations under retirement and other post-employment benefit plans and underlying actuarial assumptions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 26. Post-employment benefits for employees.'",

E/ffective October 4, 2023, Sandoz was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, with a Level 1 ADR program in the United States. To comply with International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS \u00ae ) Accounting Standards as a result of the spin-o/ff, Novartis has separated the Company's reported financial data for the current and prior years into 'continuing' and 'discontinued' operations. Continuing operations comprises the retained business activities that includes our innovative",

It is approved in the EU and other countries to treat patients with certain eye conditions, including:\n- \u00b7  Adults with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration  (AMD).  Wet  AMD  develops  when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and leak blood and other fluids in the back of the eye, which damages the macula\n- \u00b7 Adults with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and/or visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema. These conditions are complications of diabetes\n- \u00b7  Adults with visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO). Retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the branch or central retinal veins, which carry blood away from the retina\n\nApproved indications vary by country. Lucentis is licensed from Genentech, and Novartis holds the rights to commercialize the product outside the US. Genentech holds the rights to commercialize Lucentis in the US. For more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 28. Transactions with related partiesRoche Holding AG.'\n\n- \u00b7 Sandostatin SC (octreotide acetate for injection) and Sandostatin LAR (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension) are somatostatin analogs approved in the US, the EU and other countries to treat:\n- \u00b7  Adults with acromegaly that is inadequately controlled by surgery or radiotherapy. Acromegaly is a chronic disease caused by the oversecretion of growth hormone\n- \u00b7  Patients with certain symptoms associated with carcinoid tumors and other types of functional gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors\n\nSandostatin LAR is also approved in the EU and other countries to treat patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors of the midgut or of unknown primary tumor origin.\n\n## Compounds in development\n\nThe following table provides an overview of key projects currently in the Confirmatory Development stage and may also describe certain projects in the Early Development stage. Projects typically enter Confirmatory Development and become the responsibility of our Development organizational unit during Phase II testing. (For more information about our drug development program, see '-Research and development-Development program.') Projects are listed in alphabetical order by compound code, or by product name where applicable. Projects include those seeking to develop potential uses of new molecular entities as well as potential additional indications or new formulations for already marketed products. The table below, entitled 'Projects removed from the development table since 2022,' highlights changes to the table entitled 'Selected development projects' from the previous year.\n\nThe year that each project entered the current phase of development refers to the year of the first patient's first visit in the first clinical trial of that phase. For projects in Phase II, the year generally refers to the first patient's first visit in the first trial in Confirmatory Development. In some cases, the first patient's first visit in a Phase II trial can occur before the Confirmatory Development stage. Prior to 2020, we reported the current phase based on the year in which the decision to enter the phase was made. To maintain continuity, we have included certain previously disclosed projects, noted below, that have not yet achieved 'first patient, first visit' in any Phase I-III study for the reported indication and route of administration. We have disclosed these projects using our previous reporting criteria.\n\nA reference to a project being in registration means that an application has been submitted to a health authority for marketing approval. Compounds and new indications in development are subject to required regulatory approvals and, in certain instances, contractual limitations. These compounds and indications are in various stages of development throughout the world. It may not be possible to obtain regulatory approval for any or all of the new compounds and new indications referred to in this Form 20-F in any country or in every country. See '-Regulation' for more information on the approval process.",

However, certain of our marketed products and development projects, such as cell and gene therapies, are administered only once. Net sales of the vast majority of our products are not subject to material changes in seasonal demand.\n\n## Production\n\nOur primary goal is to ensure the uninterrupted and timely supply of medicines that meet all product specifications and quality standards, and that are produced in the most cost-e/ffective and sustainable manner. The manufacturing of our products is highly regulated by governmental health authorities around the world, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition to regulatory requirements, many of our products involve technically complex manufacturing processes or require highly specialized raw materials.\n\nWe are continuing to integrate ADACAP manufacturing sites into our existing manufacturing and supply structure for radioligand therapies. We manufacture our products across the following technologies at facilities worldwide: large molecules, small molecules, cell and gene therapy, xRNA therapy and radioligand therapy (see also '-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment'). In addition, we generate contract manufacturing sales from biotechnology services that we provide to third parties, which we include under 'established brands' in our consolidated financial statements (see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 4. Revenues and geographic information').\n\nIn our  manufacturing  network,  we  maintain state-of-the-art processes, with quality as a priority, and require our suppliers to adhere to the same high standards we expect from our own people and processes. These processes include chemical and biological syntheses; radioisotope handling; sterile processing, including  CAR-T  cell  processing;  gene  modification  and\n\ndelivery; and formulation and packaging. We are constantly working to improve our existing manufacturing processes, develop new and innovative technologies, and review and adapt our manufacturing network to meet our needs and those of our patients and customers.\n\nWe produce raw materials for manufacturing in-house or purchase them from third-party suppliers. Where possible, we maintain multiple supply sources so that the business is not dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers. However, our ability to do so may at times be limited by regulatory or other requirements. We monitor market developments that could have an adverse e/ffect on the supply of essential materials. Our suppliers of raw materials are required to comply with applicable regulations and Novartis quality standards.\n\nBecause the manufacturing of our products is complex and highly regulated by governmental health authorities, uninterrupted supply cannot be guaranteed. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, then there could be a product recall or other disruption to our production activities. We have experienced supply interruptions for our products in the past, and there can be no assurance that supply will not be interrupted again in the future. For more information on the risks related to the manufacturing of our products, see 'Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factorsManufacturing and product quality-Inability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards.' We have implemented a global manufacturing strategy to maximize business continuity in case of such events.\n\n## Marketing and sales\n\nAlthough specific distribution patterns vary by country, Novartis generally sells its prescription drugs primarily to wholesale and retail drug distributors, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and managed healthcare providers. We reach healthcare professionals and patients in many markets and across our core therapeutic areas through  integrated  channels  including  field  force",

        "page_content": "operations,  patient  support  programs  and  Novartis-owned digital platforms.\n\nWe  have  19  607  full-time  equivalent  field  force employees, as of December 31, 2023, including supervisors and administrative personnel. These trained representatives present the therapeutic benefits and risks of our products to physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, insurance groups, managed care organizations and other healthcare professionals. In the US, Novartis advertises certain products via digital and traditional media channels, including the internet, television, newspapers and magazines. Novartis also pursues co-promotion or co-marketing opportunities as well as licensing and distribution agreements with other companies in various markets.\n\nThe marketplace for healthcare is constantly evolving. Customer groups beyond prescribers have increasing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, while patients continue to become more informed stakeholders in their healthcare decisions and look for solutions to meet their changing needs. Novartis is responding  by  adapting  our  business  practices  to  engage appropriately with patients, customer groups and other stakeholders, including by delivering innovative solutions to drive education, access and improved patient care.\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  accelerated  additional changes related to marketing and sales techniques in the healthcare industry. For example, many healthcare professionals increased their use of virtual platforms when interacting with pharmaceutical companies, and now prefer to receive information in a more convenient and personalized way. In response, Novartis is combining traditional face-to-face visits with digital and other methods of engaging healthcare professionals to improve the e/fficiency and e/ffectiveness of every interaction. We are similarly changing our approach to engaging healthcare systems, payers and other healthcare providers.\n\nThe growing number of so-called 'specialty' drugs in our portfolio, such as Cosentyx and Kesimpta , has resulted in increased engagement with specialty pharmacies. Because many of these drugs require special handling and administration, we are rolling out an international patient support program across our priority markets that serves as a central resource for onboarding, education and support to help patients navigate their healthcare.\n\nWith our radioligand therapy Pluvicto , extra steps must be taken to educate customers, in part because it can only be administered by those who are trained to handle radiopharmaceuticals. We are working to improve the customer experience by connecting patients with healthcare professionals throughout the disease management process, including awareness and engagement, treatment site onboarding, referrals and imaging, preparation and infusion, and treatment follow-up. We have established a dedicated support team, a customer relationship management platform and an order management platform as part of this e/ffort.\n\nIn the US, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest single payer for healthcare services as a result of continuing changes in healthcare economics and an aging population. In addition, both commercial and government-sponsored managed care organizations continue to be among the largest groups\n\nof payers for healthcare services in the US. In other countries, national health services are often the only significant payer for healthcare services. In an e/ffort to control prescription drug costs, almost all managed care organizations and national health services use formularies that list specific drugs that may be reimbursed and/or the level of reimbursement for each drug. Managed care organizations and national health services also use cost-benefit analyses to determine whether or not newly approved drugs will be added to a formulary and/or the level of reimbursement for that drug, and to determine whether or not to continue to reimburse existing drugs. We have dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize patient access, including formulary positions, for our products.\n\nThe trend toward consolidation among distributors and retailers of our products continues in the US and internationally, both within and across countries. This has increased  our  customers'  purchasing  leverage  and resulted in increased pricing pressure on our products. Moreover, we are exposed to increased concentration of credit risk as a result of the consolidation among our customers.\n\nDrug pricing is an increasingly prominent issue in many countries as healthcare spending continues to rise. This issue has received significant attention in the US, especially with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (please see '-Price controls' for more information). At Novartis, we are increasing our e/fforts to enable patient access through innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets. These include contract structures such as pay-over-time and outcome-based agreements.\n\nIn 2020, Novartis Gene Therapies established a novel early access program for Zolgensma . It supports early patient access through customizable options including retroactive  rebates,  deferred  payments,  installment options, outcome-based rebates, and collaborations with healthcare systems to optimize disease management. We now have more than 40 early access agreements and pay-for-performance agreements (i.e., outcome-based arrangements) in place in various markets around the world. Zolgensma is approved in 51 countries.\n\nAdditionally, in 2021 Novartis reached an agreement with the National Health Service (NHS) in England to implement a first-of-its-kind population health management approach designed to provide faster and broader access to Leqvio for certain high-risk patients with atherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease.  Novartis  has engaged in similar collaborations with other countries.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe global pharmaceutical market is highly competitive. We compete against other major international corporations that have substantial financial and other resources, as well as against smaller companies that operate regionally or nationally. Competition within the industry is intense and extends across a wide range of activities, including pricing, product characteristics, customer service, sales and marketing, and research and development.",

        "page_content": "Like other companies selling patented pharmaceuticals, Novartis faces challenges from companies selling competing patented products. Generic forms of our products may follow the expiration of intellectual property protection or regulatory exclusivities, and generic companies may also gain entry to the market through successfully challenging our intellectual property rights and exclusivities. We use appropriate, legally permissible measures to defend those rights and exclusivities (see also '-Intellectual property' below). We also may face competition from over-the-counter (OTC) products that do not require a prescription from a physician.\n\nThere is ongoing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, new entrants are looking to use their expertise to establish or expand their presence in healthcare. Technology companies, for instance, are seeking to benefit from the increasing importance of data and data management in our industry, including the use of artificial intelligence.\n\n## Research and development\n\nThe discovery and development of a new drug usually requires approximately 10 to 15 years from the initial research to bringing a drug to market. This includes approximately six to eight years from Phase I clinical trials to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a substantial risk that a therapeutic candidate will not meet the requirements to progress further. In such an event, we may be required to abandon the development of a potential therapy in which we have made a substantial investment.\n\nWe manage our research and development expenditures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our strategic priorities. We make decisions about whether or not to proceed with development projects on a project-by-project basis. These decisions are based on the project's potential to meet a significant unmet medical need or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the science underlying the project, and the potential of the project (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical development) to generate significant positive financial results for the Company. Once a management decision has been made to proceed with the development of a therapeutic candidate, the level of research and development investment required will be driven by many factors. These include the medical indications for which it is being developed, the number of indications being pursued, whether the therapeutic candidate is of a chemical or biological nature, the stage of development, and the level of evidence necessary to demonstrate clinical e/fficacy and safety.\n\n## Research program\n\nOur research and early development program is conducted by our Biomedical Research organizational unit, which is the innovation engine of Novartis. This unit is responsible for the discovery of new medicines that bring value for patients and the Company. This requires hiring and retaining highly talented employees, focusing on fundamental disease mechanisms that are relevant across di/fferent disease  areas,  continuously  improving\n\ntechnologies for drug discovery and potential therapies, working with patients to understand their diseases and the potential benefits of therapies, forming close alliances with clinical and commercial colleagues, and establishing strategic external alliances.\n\nWe have 5 511 full-time-equivalent scientists, physicians and business professionals at Biomedical Research sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; East Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California; and Emeryville, California. They contribute to research into disease areas such as cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases; neuroscience; oncology; immunology; and ophthalmology. Research at the Friedrich Miescher Institute focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and  our  Global  Health  Disease  Area  (formerly  the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases) focuses on discovering new medicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria and cryptosporidiosis. In 2023, we made the decision to discontinue our respiratory research e/fforts to further focus our resources on priority areas.\n\nAll drug candidates go through clinical trials to enable an early assessment of the safety and e/fficacy of the drug while collecting basic information on how the drug moves through the body and is tolerated, and adhering to the guidance for early clinical testing set forth by health authorities. When assessments are favorable, our Development organizational unit conducts confirmatory trials on the drug candidates to generate data that can be submitted to regulatory authorities to secure approval for patient use.\n\n## Development program\n\nOur Development unit  oversees and executes drug development activities, working collaboratively with Biomedical Research, our commercial units and other parts of the Company on our overall pipeline strategy. It includes centralized global functions such as Regulatory A/ffairs and Global Clinical Operations, and global Development Units, and has 12 723 full-time equivalent employees worldwide.\n\nThe traditional model of clinical development consists of three phases:\n\nPhase I: The first clinical trials of a new compound - generally performed in a small number of healthy human volunteers/patients (e.g., in oncology) - to assess the drug's safety profile, including the safe dosage range. These trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted, and the duration of its action. Phase II: Studies performed with patients who have the target disease, with the aim of continuing the Phase I safety assessment in a larger group, assessing the e/fficacy of the drug in the patient population, and determining the appropriate doses for further evaluation.\n\nPhase III: Large-scale studies with up to several thousand patients, which aim to establish the safety and e/fficacy of the drug in specific indications for regulatory approval. Phase III trials may also be used to compare a new drug against a current standard of care to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the new medicine.\n\nIn each of these phases, physicians monitor consenting volunteers or patients closely to assess the safety and e/fficacy of a potential new drug or indication.",

        "page_content": "Although we use this traditional model, we have tailored the development process to be simpler, more flexible and more e/fficient. This design ensures close collaboration across R&D, enabling Development teams to initiate later-stage planning in parallel with early evaluations and research teams to better support later-stage activities.\n\nOur development process consists of two stages: Early Development to build confidence in the overall properties of the compound, followed by Confirmatory Development to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients. Early development consists of both Phase I studies in healthy volunteers as well as Phase Ib and Phase II studies in patients. This work includes a careful review  of  safety  and  tolerability,  understanding  of whether the drug is modulating the target of interest, and understanding of dose response and early evidence of disease e/fficacy. Biomedical Research conducts these trials and if this evaluation is positive, the drug moves to the Confirmatory Development stage and becomes the responsibility of Development.\n\nConfirmatory Development has elements of traditional Phase II/III testing and includes trials aimed at confirming the safety and e/fficacy of the drug in the given indication, leading up to submission of a dossier to health authorities for approval. This stage can also include trials that compare the drug to the current standard of care for the disease in order to evaluate the drug's overall benefit-risk profile. Further, with new treatment approaches such as gene therapy for rare diseases, elements of Early and Confirmatory Development may be combined and su/ffice for registration under certain conditions such as high unmet medical need and clinical data showing highly favorable benefit-risk profiles. In these cases, additional post-approval studies may be required by the regulatory authorities to continue to gather important data to further support approval.\n\nThe vast amount of data that must be collected and evaluated makes clinical testing the most time-consuming and expensive part of new drug development. The next stage in the drug development process is to seek registration for the new drug. For more information, see '-Regulation.'\n\nThe Innovation Management Board (IMB), chaired by our Chief Executive O/fficer, drives our R&D portfolio strategy. The IMB endorses new early- and late-stage development projects, strategic plans and portfolio-related priorities. It oversees our drug development budget; approves major project phase transitions; and makes key decisions, such as when to submit regulatory applications to health authorities or when to discontinue projects. IMB members include representatives from the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) and senior management with expertise in di/fferent fields.\n\nTo support our R&D strategy, we are investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies that have the potential to enhance and accelerate the delivery of innovative medicines to patients. We are working with partners on scalable projects in early-stage research and in clinical development to help improve our decision-making and generate actionable insights across our core therapeutic areas-from designing new compounds to predicting drug safety and conducting clinical trials.\n\n## Alliances and acquisitions\n\nNovartis enters into business development agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to develop new products and access new markets. We license products that complement our current product line and are appropriate to our business strategy. We focus on strategic alliances and acquisition activities for key disease areas and indications that we expect to be growth drivers in the future. We review products and compounds we are considering licensing, using the same criteria that we use for our own internally discovered drugs.\n\nIn July 2023, Novartis acquired DTx Pharma Inc., a US-based, preclinical-stage biotechnology company focused on leveraging its proprietary FALCON platform to develop siRNA therapies for neuroscience indications. Its lead program, DTx-1252, targets the root cause of CMT1A - the overexpression of PMP22, a protein that causes the myelin sheath that supports and insulates nerves in the peripheral nervous system to function abnormally. The transaction also includes two additional preclinical programs for other neuroscience indications.\n\nIn August 2023, Novartis acquired Chinook Therapeutics, Inc., a US-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with two late-stage medicines in development for rare, severe chronic kidney diseases.\n\nFor more information about recent business acquisitions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions.'\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe international pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. Regulatory authorities around the world administer numerous laws and regulations regarding the testing, approval, manufacturing, importing, labeling and marketing of drugs, and review the safety and e/fficacy of pharmaceutical products. Extensive controls exist on the non-clinical and clinical development of pharmaceutical products. These regulatory requirements, and the implementation of them by local health authorities around the globe, are a major factor in determining whether a substance can be developed into a marketable product, and the amount of time and expense associated with that development.\n\nHealth authorities, including those in the US and the EU, have high standards of technical evaluation. The introduction of new pharmaceutical products generally entails a lengthy approval process. Products must be authorized or registered prior to marketing, and such authorization or registration must subsequently be maintained. In recent years, the registration process has required increased testing and documentation for the approval of new drugs, with a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction.\n\nTo register a pharmaceutical product, a registration dossier containing evidence establishing the safety, e/fficacy and quality of the product must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Generally, a therapeutic product must be registered in each country in which it will be sold. In every country, the submission of an application to a",

        "page_content": "regulatory authority does not guarantee that approval to market the product will be granted. Although the criteria for the registration of therapeutic drugs are similar in most countries, the formal structure of the necessary registration documents and the specific requirements, including risk tolerance, of the local health authorities can vary significantly from country to country. Even if a drug is registered and marketed in one country, the registration authority in another country may request additional information from the pharmaceutical company prior to registration or even reject the product. A drug may be approved for di/fferent indications in di/fferent countries.\n\nThe registration process generally takes between six months and several years, depending on the country, the quality of the data submitted, the e/fficiency of the registration authority's procedures, and the nature of the product. Many countries provide for accelerated processing of registration applications for innovative products of particular therapeutic interest. In recent years, the US and the EU have made e/fforts to harmonize registration requirements in order to achieve shorter development and registration times for medical products. However, the requirement in many countries to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement levels with government regulators and other payers can substantially extend the time until a product may finally be available to patients.\n\nThe following provides a summary of the regulatory processes in the principal markets served by our a/ffiliates:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the US, applications for drug registration are submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. The FDA regulates the testing, manufacturing, labeling and approval for marketing of pharmaceutical products intended for commercialization in the US. The FDA continues to monitor the safety of pharmaceutical products after they have been approved for sale in the US market. The pharmaceutical development and registration process is typically intensive, lengthy and rigorous. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes su/fficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, e/fficacy and quality, the company may file a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA), as applicable, for the compound. The NDA or BLA must contain all the scientific information that has been gathered about the compound. This typically includes information regarding the clinical experiences of patients tested in the drug's clinical trials. A Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) or Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) must be filed for new indications and dosage forms for a previously approved drug.\n\nOnce an application is submitted, the FDA assigns reviewers from its sta/ff, including experts in biopharmaceutics, chemistry, clinical microbiology, pharmacology/ toxicology, and statistics. After a complete review, these content experts provide written evaluations of the NDA or BLA. These recommendations are consolidated and are used by senior FDA sta/ff in its final evaluation of the NDA or BLA. Based on that final evaluation, the FDA then either approves the NDA or BLA, or provides a 'complete response' letter if the NDA or BLA application is not\n\napproved. If not approved, the letter will state the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA that need to be addressed. The company making the application must then submit an adequate response to the deficiencies in order to restart the review procedure.\n\nOnce the FDA has approved an NDA, BLA, sNDA or sBLA, the company can make the new drug available for physicians and other healthcare providers to prescribe. The drug owner must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including any cases of adverse reactions. For some medications, the FDA requires additional post-approval studies (Phase IV) to evaluate long-term e/ffects or to gather information on the use of the product under specified conditions.\n\nThroughout the life cycle of a product, the FDA requires compliance with standards relating to good laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices. The FDA also requires compliance with rules pertaining to the manner in which we may promote our products.\n\n## European Union\n\nIn the EU, there are three main procedures for application for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in more than one EU member state at the same time: the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure and the decentralized procedure. It is also possible to obtain a national authorization for products intended for commercialization in a single EU member state only. The procedure used for first authorization must continue to be followed for subsequent changes, e.g., to add an indication for a licensed product.\n\nUnder the centralized procedure, applications are made to the EMA for an authorization that is valid for the European Union (all member states). The centralized procedure is mandatory for all biotechnology products; new chemical entities in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; advanced therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue-engineered  medicines;  and  orphan  medicines (medicines for rare diseases). It is optional for other new chemical entities, innovative medicinal products, and medicines for which authorization would be in the interest of public health. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes su/fficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, e/fficacy and quality, the company may submit an application to the EMA. The EMA then receives and validates the application, and the specialized committee for human medicines, the CHMP, appoints a rapporteur and co-rapporteur to review it. They use experts from their countries to carry out the assessment but can also draw on expertise from other member states ('multinational teams'). The entire review cycle must be completed within 210 days, although there are 'clock stops' to allow the company to respond to questions set forth in the rapporteur and co-rapporteur's assessment report and agreed with the CHMP. The first clock stop is at Day 120 and the clock restarts on Day 121, when the company's complete response is received by the EMA. If there are further aspects of the dossier requiring clarification, the CHMP will issue further questions at Day 180, and may also request an oral explanation, in which case the sponsor must not only respond to the further questions but also appear before the committee to",

        "page_content": "justify its responses. On Day 210, the CHMP will take a vote to recommend the approval or non-approval of the application, and their opinion is transferred to the European Commission (EC). The final EC decision under this centralized procedure is a single decision that is applicable to all member states. This decision occurs 60 days, on average, after a positive CHMP recommendation.\n\nUnder both the mutual recognition procedure (MRP) and the decentralized procedure (DCP), the assessment is led by one member state, called the reference member state (RMS), which then liaises with other member states, known as the concerned member states. In the MRP, the company first obtains a marketing authorization in the RMS, which is then recognized by the concerned member states in 90 days. In the DCP, the application  is  done  simultaneously  in  the  RMS  and  all concerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS drafts an assessment report within 120 days. Within an additional 90 days, the concerned member states review the application and can issue objections or requests for additional information. On Day 90, each concerned member state must be assured that the product is safe and e/ffective, and that it will cause no undue risks to the public health. Once an agreement has been reached, each member state grants national marketing authorizations for the product.\n\nAfter receiving the marketing authorizations, the company must submit periodic safety reports to the relevant health authority (EMA for the centralized procedure, national health authorities for DCP or MRP). In addition, pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented and monitored, including the collection, evaluation and expedited reporting of adverse events, and updates to risk management plans. For some medications, post-approval studies (Phase IV) may be imposed to complement available data with additional data to evaluate longterm e/ffects (called a Post-Approval Safety Study, or PASS) or to gather additional e/fficacy data (called a Post-Approval E/fficacy Study, or PAES).\n\nEuropean marketing authorizations have an initial duration of five years. The holder of the marketing authorization must actively apply for its renewal after this first five-year period. As part of the renewal procedure, the competent authority performs a full benefit-risk review of the product. Should the authority conclude that the benefit-risk balance is no longer positive, the marketing authorization  can  be  suspended  or  revoked.  Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless it is determined that the product must be further monitored for safety reasons. In this case, the authority may require another renewal at 10 years. If the holder does not apply for renewal, the marketing authorization automatically lapses. Any marketing authorization that is not followed within three years of its granting by the actual placing on the market of the corresponding medicinal product ceases to be valid.\n\n## Price controls\n\nincreasing political pressure and governmental budget constraints, we expect these mechanisms to remain robust - and potentially even be strengthened - and to have a continued negative influence on the prices we are able to charge for our products.\n\n## Direct governmental e/fforts to control prices\n\nUnited States: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), signed into law in August 2022, mandates the negotiation of eligible Medicare Part B and Part D drugs; redesigned  the  Medicare  Part  D  benefit,  including  a USD 2 000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare beneficiaries; and imposed penalties for Medicare drugs that increase in price faster than the rate of inflation. Under the IRA, the US government will set Medicare prices for selected products it has defined as single-sourced small-molecule drugs that have been on the market for seven years following FDA approval as well as single-sourced biologics that have been on the market for 11 years after FDA approval.\n\nMedicare drugs with the highest total cost to the US government are being selected for the program as they become eligible. Exemptions include orphan drugs with an indication for one rare disease or condition, drugs with a total cost to the US government of less than USD 200 million, and plasma-derived drugs.\n\nThe price set by the government will be publicly available and will become e/ffective for selected drugs nine years after FDA approval for eligible small molecules and 13 years after FDA approval for eligible biologics. It will be implemented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Ten eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2026\n- \u00b7 An additional 15 eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2027\n- \u00b7 An additional 15 eligible combined Medicare Part B and Part D drugs in 2028\n- \u00b7  An additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part B and Part D drugs in 2029\n- \u00b7  An additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part B and Part D drugs each year after 2029\n\nOn August 29, 2023, the US government released the list of the first 10 drugs to be subject to the program, and Entresto was one of the selected products. Novartis has initiated the process of participating in negotiations because manufacturers that refuse to participate are subject to an excise tax of up to 95% of sales. Novartis has filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services because we believe the IRA's drug price-setting provisions are unconstitutional and will have long-lasting negative consequences for patients by limiting access to medicines now and in the future (for more information, see 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 21. Provisions and other non-current liabilities'). Novartis may also be a/ffected by other provisions of the IRA, such as price increase penalties for Medicare Part D drugs starting in 2022 and for Medicare Part B drugs in 2023, and rebates on eligible Medicare Part D sales starting in 2025.\n\nIn most of the markets where we operate, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to both direct and indirect price controls and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Due to\n\nIn addition, by December 31, 2023, 23 US states had passed legislation intended to impact pricing or requiring manufacturers to report price increases to states, with eight of these states also allowing for drug a/ffordability (i.e., price control) review boards.

        "page_content": "requirements vary by state. Many states require multiple types of reporting, including for new drug applications, new drug launches, prior notice of price increases, and quarterly or annual reporting. It is expected that state legislatures will continue to focus on drug pricing in 2024 and that similar bills will be passed in more states.\n\nEurope: In Europe, our operations are subject to significant price and marketing regulations. Many governments are introducing healthcare reforms in a further attempt to curb increasing healthcare costs. In some member states, these include reforms to permit the reimbursed use of o/ff-label medicines, despite the presence of licensed alternatives on the market. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to patients. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general in the EU, particularly with regard to prescription drugs, is intense. Increasingly strict analyses are applied when evaluating the entry of new products, and as a result, access to innovative medicines is limited based on strict cost-benefit assessments. In addition, prices for marketed products are referenced within member states and across international borders, further impacting individual EU member state pricing. Member states also collaborate to enhance pricing transparency and have started conducting joint health technology assessments, joint pricing negotiations and/or joint purchasing. As an additional control for healthcare budgets, some EU countries have passed legislation to impose further mandatory rebates for pharmaceutical products and/or financial claw-backs on the pharmaceutical industry. The calculation of these rebates and claw-backs may lack transparency in some cases and can be di/fficult to predict.\n\n## Regulations favoring generics and biosimilars\n\nIn response to rising healthcare costs, most governments and private medical care providers have established reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of more expensive brand-name pharmaceuticals by generic pharmaceuticals. All US states have generic substitution statutes. These statutes permit or require the dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive generic drug instead of an original drug. Other countries, including many European countries, have similar laws. We expect that the pressure for generic substitution will continue to increase. In addition, the US, the EU and other jurisdictions are increasingly introducing laws and regulations encouraging the development of biosimilar versions of biologic drugs, which can also be expected to have an impact on pricing.\n\n## Cross-border sales\n\nPrice controls in one country can have an impact in other countries as a result of cross-border sales. In the EU, products that we have sold to customers in countries with stringent price controls can be legally resold to customers in other EU countries at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise available in the importing country (known as parallel trade). In North America, products that we have sold to customers in Canada - which has relatively stringent price controls\n\n- are sometimes resold into the US, again at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise sold in the US. Such imports from Canada and other countries into the US are currently illegal in most states. However, six US states (Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont) have enacted laws allowing the import of pharmaceutical drugs from select foreign countries. The Secretary of the HHS must certify that each state's importation plan is safe and cost-effective before it can be implemented.\n\nWe expect that pressures on pricing will continue worldwide and will likely increase. Because of these pressures, there can be no certainty that in every instance we will be able to charge prices for a product that, in a particular country or in the aggregate, would enable us to earn an adequate return on our investment in that product.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nIntellectual property (IP) rights are essential to our business as an innovative medicines company since they protect our innovation and investments in research and development, manufacturing and marketing of our products. IP rights include patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and regulatory-based protection.\n\n## Patents\n\nAmong other things, patents may cover products themselves, including the product's active ingredient or ingredients and its formulation. Patents may cover processes for manufacturing a product, including processes for manufacturing intermediate substances used in the manufacture of the product. Patents may also cover particular uses of a product, such as its use to treat a particular disease, or its dosage regimen. In addition, patents may cover tests for certain diseases or biomarkers which can improve patient outcomes when administered with certain drugs - as well as assays, research tools and other techniques used to identify new drugs.\n\nIn the US, the EU and other countries, the law recognizes that product development and review by health authorities can take an extended period, and provides an extension of patent term for a period related to the time taken for the conduct of clinical trials and for the health authority's review. These extensions are termed patent term extensions (PTEs) for the US and supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for the EU.\n\n## United States\n\n- \u00b7  In the US, a patent issued from an application filed today will generally receive a term of 20 years from the earliest application filing date as well as potential patent term adjustments for delays in patent issuance based upon certain delays in prosecution by the United States Patent and Trademark O/ffice (USPTO). A US pharmaceutical patent may also be eligible for a PTE. The PTE may only extend the patent term for a maximum of five years, and may not extend the patent term beyond 14 years from regulatory approval. Only one patent may be extended for a product based on FDA review.",

        "page_content": "## European Union\n\n- \u00b7  Patent applications in Europe may be filed in the European Patent O/ffice (EPO) or in a particular country or countries. The term of a patent granted by the EPO or an EU country o/ffice is 20 years from the earliest application  filing  date.  Pharmaceutical  patents  can  be granted a further period of exclusivity under an SPC system. The SPCs may only extend the patent term for a maximum of five years, and may not extend the patent term beyond 15 years from the date of the first EU marketing authorization.\n\n## RDP and market exclusivity\n\nIn addition to patent protection, various countries provide regulatory-based protection, including regulatory data protection (RDP) and/or other market exclusivities, for a prescribed period of time. RDP is a distinct type of IP right providing exclusivity that precludes a potential competitor from filing a regulatory application that relies on the sponsor's clinical trial data, or that precludes the regulatory authority from approving the application for a set period of time.\n\n## United States\n\n- \u00b7  A new small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient receives five years of RDP, during which time a competitor generally may not obtain final approval of an application to the FDA based on a sponsor's clinical data.\n- \u00b7  A  new  biologic  active  pharmaceutical  ingredient receives 12 years of regulatory-based market exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug.\n- \u00b7  The FDA may also request that a sponsor conduct pediatric studies and, in exchange, it will grant an additional six-month period of pediatric market exclusivity if the sponsor makes a timely submission of the reports of the pediatric studies in response to the FDA's Written Request. The sponsor must also have a patent-based and/or regulatory-based exclusivity period for the product to which the pediatric market exclusivity is appended.\n- \u00b7  Orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) provides seven years of market exclusivity for drugs designated by the FDA as orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat rare diseases. During this period, a potential competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug for the same indication even if the competitor's application does not rely on data from the sponsor.\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7  A new pharmaceutical ingredient receives eight years of data protection, during which a competitor cannot rely on the relevant data; a further period of two years of market exclusivity, during which the data can be used to support applications for marketing authorization but a competitive product cannot be launched; and a possible one-year extension of the market exclusivity period if, during the initial eight-year data exclusivity period, the sponsor registered a new therapeutic indication with 'significant clinical benefit.'\n- \u00b7  Orphan drug exclusivity provides for 10 years of market exclusivity, during which time an application for the same or similar medicine for the same indication will\n\nnot generally be accepted or granted. Under certain circumstances, this exclusivity can be extended with a two-year pediatric extension.\n\n## Third-party patents and challenges to intellectual property\n\nThird parties can challenge our IP, including patents, patent term extensions, RDP and marketing exclusivities (such as pediatric extensions and orphan drug exclusivity), through various proceedings. For example, patents in the US can be challenged in the USPTO through various proceedings, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Post-Grant Review (PGR) proceedings. They may also be challenged through patent infringement litigation under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act or under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In the EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions in the EPO, or national patents may be challenged in national courts or national patent o/ffices. The outcomes of such challenges can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nIn addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in some circumstances a competitor may be able to market a generic version of one of our products by, for example, designing around our patents or marketing the generic product for non-patent-protected indications, or filing a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the Hatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2) application). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur the costs of conducting its own clinical trials and preparing its own regulatory application, and avoid our RDP altogether. There is a risk that some countries may seek to impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the availability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or limit the extent to which such rights may be enforced. Additionally, even though we may own, co-own or in-license patents protecting our products, and conduct freedom-to-operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless assert that one of our products infringes a thirdparty patent for which we do not have a license, seeking remedies such as monetary damages or an injunction against our continued marketing of the product.\n\nAs a result, there can be no assurance that our IP rights will protect our products or that we will be able to avoid adverse e/ffects from the loss of IP protection or from third-party patents in the future. For more information on the risks related to our IP protection, see 'Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Intellectual property-Expiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protection.'\n\n## Intellectual property protection for certain key marketed products and compounds in development\n\nWe present additional details below regarding certain IP protection in the US and the EU for certain key marketed products. For each, we identify issued, unexpired patents by their general subject matter and, in parentheses, years of expiry, if relevant, in the US and the EU. The identified patents are owned, co-owned or exclusively in-licensed by Novartis and relate to at least one dosage strength of the product or to the method of treatment or its use as it is currently approved and marketed or, in the case of a compound in development, as it is currently",

Information on such patents, where available, may be found in publicly accessible databases such as the FDA patent databases, online databases such as Espacenet\u2122 and Pat-INFORMED, and patent o/ffice registers.\n\nWe identify unexpired RDP periods and, in parentheses, years of expiry if the relevant marketing authorizations have been authorized or granted. We identify certain unexpired patent term extensions and marketing exclusivities and, in parentheses, years of expiry if they are granted; their subject matter scope may be limited and is not specified. Marketing exclusivities and patent term extensions include ODE, pediatric exclusivity (PE), PTE and SPC.\n\nIdentification of a patent in the EU refers to national patents in EU countries and/or to the national patents that have been derived from a patent granted by the EPO. In the case of the EU, identification of a patent, supplementary protection certificate, marketing exclusivity or regulatory data protection means grant, authorization and maintenance in at least one EU country. However, it could be pending, not granted, expired or found invalid in others.\n\nWe designate certain IP protection as 'pending' if such IP protection has been applied for but not granted and includes years of expiration if estimable. Such pending applications ultimately may or may not be granted.\n\nWhere relevant, we indicate whether there is current generic or biosimilar competition for one or more product versions in one or more approved indications in either the US or one or more EU countries. We identify certain enforcement actions, or ongoing challenges to the disclosed IP, including IPRs or PGRs if instituted by the USPTO, that have not been finally resolved (including appeals) unless noted. Resolution of challenges to the disclosed IP, which in the EU may involve IP in one or more EU countries, may include settlement agreements under which Novartis permits or does not permit future launch of generic versions of our products before expiration of that IP. We identify certain material terms of such settlement agreements where they could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business. In other cases, such settlement agreements may contain confidentiality obligations restricting what may be disclosed.\n\nIn the event that a product listed below does not have identified patents as described above, we provide information only on generic competition.\n\nFor additional information regarding commercial arrangements with respect to these products, see 'Key marketed products.'\n\n## Cardiovascular renal and metabolic\n\n- \u00b7 Entresto .

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\n\n## 5.A Operating results\n\nThis operating and financial review should be read together with our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (see 'Item 18. Financial  Statements').  'Item  5.  Operating  and  Financial Review and Prospects' with the sections on our compounds in development and selected development projects (see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview') constitute the Operating and Financial Review ( Lagebericht ), as defined by the Swiss Code of Obligations.\n\n## Overview\n\nNovartis is an innovative medicines company. Our purpose is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives. In September 2023, we reorganized our operations into five organizational units. These are Biomedical Research , Development , Operations, and two commercial units: US and International . Global functions support these organizational units in the execution of their work. We are engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, distribution, and commercialization and sale of innovative medicines, with a focus on the core therapeutic areas: cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; and oncology; as well as established brands. For information about this new organizational structure, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Overview.'\n\nIn 2023, Novartis completed its transformation into a pure-play innovative medicines business, with the spino/ff of Sandoz. E/ffective October 4, 2023, Sandoz was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, with a Level 1 ADR program in the United States.\n\nTo comply with IFRS Accounting Standards, as a result of the spin-o/ff, Novartis has separated the Company's consolidated financial statements for the current and prior years into 'continuing' and 'discontinued' operations. For more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting policies.'\n\nThe disclosures and commentary in this 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects' focuses on continuing operations. We also provide information on discontinued operations.\n\nContinuing operations include the retained business activities of Novartis, comprising the innovative medicines business and continued corporate activities.\n\nDiscontinued operations include the Sandoz generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars division and certain corporate activities attributable to Sandoz prior to the spino/ff up to the distribution date of October 3, 2023, and certain other expenses related to the spin-o/ff. Included\n\nin 2023 is also the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders. Sandoz operated in the o/ff-patent medicines segment and specialized in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars. The Sandoz business was organized globally into two franchises: Generics and Biosimilars.\n\nSignificant transactions are discussed in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions,' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 29. Commitments and contingent liabilities.'\n\nWith the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business, Novartis operates as a single global operating segment, as an innovative medicines company.\n\n## Our business environment\n\nProgress in science and technology raises the possibility of new types of medicines and more e/fficient drug discovery. At the same time, healthcare inequities remain entrenched around the world, while aging populations are putting pressure on healthcare systems in many countries. The major trends currently shaping our business environment include:\n\n- \u00b7 Scientific progress is opening new paths to treat disease. Rapid progress in medical science is creating opportunities for new types of treatments. These advances highlight the importance of investment in R&D, including in next-generation technologies such as radioligand therapies and gene and cell therapies.\n- \u00b7 Demand for high-quality healthcare continues to rise. Demand for medicines in areas such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and immunology continues to grow in key markets. The US and EU markets are expanding. China is growing rapidly, while spending in Japan is forecast to remain stable. To meet demand and maintain growth, companies are investing in developing new, innovative treatments.\n- \u00b7 Healthcare systems are under strain. In many countries, healthcare systems are under pressure. Healthcare professionals often feel overwhelmed and under-resourced. Sta/ff shortages have occurred in both the US and Europe. This trend began with the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are longer-term factors as well-aging and changes to lifestyle have led to a significant rise in noncommunicable illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.\n- \u00b7 The policy landscape is changing. New legislation or regulations in the US, EU and China may change how governments pay for medicines. In the US, for example, the IRA will limit price increases in Medicare to inflation and impose price controls on select drugs in the Medicare program beginning in 2026. The EU is revising the legislative framework for medicines, trying",

Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Macroeconomic developments-Impact of macroeconomic developments.'\n\n- \u00b7 Patients want more say over their treatment. Increasingly, patients want their voice to be heard in the process of developing new medicines, so that the treatments address the outcomes that matter most to them. Patients also want more say over policies that a/ffect their access to medicines and are becoming more important as data owners. As a result, companies are building patient engagement into their approachesfrom research and clinical trials to commercialization and access programs.\n- \u00b7 Health inequities remain entrenched. Billions of people around the world struggle to get the medicines and healthcare services they need. Many of the issues are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where people face the dual burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases, as well as fragile and under-resourced health systems. Health inequities also a/ffect people in higher-income countries, however, where causes are often linked to structural health system issues as well as demographic, social and economic challenges.\n- \u00b7 AI is poised to reshape the industry . Across the biopharmaceutical industry, we are beginning to realize the benefits of new technologies such as AI in automating processes and generating insights that could help us design new compounds, predict drug safety or speed up drug discovery. The extent to which companies can harness this potential will depend on their ability to aggregate and analyze large volumes of anonymized health data. See 'Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Research and development-Failure to successfully prioritize, integrate and execute our research and development programs for new products or new indications for existing products.'\n- \u00b7 Climate change threatens to widen health inequity. Climate change and nature loss continue to have an adverse e/ffect on human health, with people in LMICs disproportionately impacted. The World Health Organization forecasts approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 due to climate change, mainly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Respiratory illnesses are also on the rise due to air pollution. At the same time, health systems are aiming to build climate resilience-with 29 countries committing to net-zero carbon emissions in their health systems by 2050, according to the WHO. See  'Item  3.  Key  Information-Item  3.D  Risk\n\nfactors-Climate change-Failure to manage physical and transition risks from climate change.'\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur strategy is to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in R&D and novel access approaches. The aim of our strategy is to create long-term value-to contribute to continued advances in human health, to deliver returns to shareholders and to benefit society.\n\nWe focus on four core therapeutic areas with strong growth potential and high unmet patient needs: cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; and oncology. A focused approach enables us to build depth in these areas to find new ways to treat and cure disease, intervene earlier in chronic illnesses and improve quality of life for patients.\n\nWe focus on technology platforms where we have the depth and scale to discover, develop and commercialize therapies. These are two established platforms (chemistry and biotherapeutics) plus three newer platforms (xRNA, radioligand therapy and gene and cell therapy) that represent key sources of future growth.\n\nWe focus on our priority markets-US, Germany, China and Japan-which together account for most of the expected growth in global healthcare spending over the next five years. In the US, our ambition is to become a top-five player. In Germany we aim to retain our current position as market leader, while in China and Japan we aim to be in third position in each market. Although these are our priority geographies, we maintain a strong presence in other markets worldwide.\n\nTo support our focus areas, we have three strategic priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Deliver high-value medicines . We aim to increase growth, driven by continued strong momentum in our existing portfolio of medicines-including Entresto; Kisqali, Kesimpta, Cosentyx, Scemblix, Pluvicto and Leqvio -and key upcoming launches. Over the longer term, we expect growth will come through delivering high-value medicines that sustain and replace our existing growth drivers.\n- \u00b7 Embed operational excellence. In an increasingly competitive environment, we are simplifying processes and reducing costs to become more e/fficient and e/ffective in our decision-making and to free up resources for investment in new medicines. Our goal is to continue making attractive returns to shareholders while creating value for patients, healthcare systems and society.\n- \u00b7 Strengthen the foundations of our business . We continue to invest to strengthen the foundations of our long-term success. We have made progress in strengthening our culture to attract and retain talent, while developing artificial intelligence capabilities in R&D and building stronger trust with stakeholders and society.",

Sales growth was driven by volume growth of 16 percentage points. Generic competition had a negative impact of 4 percentage points and pricing had a negative impact of 2 percentage points. Sales in the US were USD 18.0 billion (+13%) and in the rest of the world USD 27.5 billion (+5%, +8% cc). Net sales growth was mainly driven by continued strong performance from Entresto (USD 6.0 billion, +30%, +31% cc), Kesimpta (USD 2.2 billion, +99%, +99% cc), Kisqali (USD 2.1 billion, +69%, +75% cc), Pluvicto (USD 980 million, +262%, +261% cc), partly o/ffset by generic competition mainly for Gilenya .\n\nIn the US (USD 18.0 billion, +13%), sales growth was mainly driven by Entresto , Pluvicto , Kesimpta , Kisqali , Scemblix and Leqvio , partly o/ffset by the impact of generic competition for Gilenya . In Europe (USD 15.0 billion, +4%, +4% cc), sales growth was driven by Kesimpta , Entresto , Kisqali , Cosentyx and Leqvio , partly o/ffset by increased generic competition for Lucentis and Gilenya . Emerging growth markets, which comprise all markets excluding the US, Canada, Western Europe 1 , Japan, Australia and New Zealand, grew +8% (+17% cc), includes China net sales of USD 3.3 billion (+11%, +17% cc).\n\nOperating income from continuing operations was USD 9.8 billion (+23%, +39% cc), mainly driven by higher net sales, lower restructuring charges, and income from legal matters, partly o/ffset by higher impairments and higher selling, general and administration (SG&A), and research and development (R&D) investments. Operating income margin from continuing operations was 21.5% of net sales, increasing 2.7 percentage points (+5.0 percentage points in cc).\n\nNet income from continuing operations was USD 8.6 billion (+42%, +62% cc), mainly driven by higher operating income and non-recurring favorable tax impacts. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD 4.13 (+49%, +70% cc), growing faster than net income, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\nNet cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 14.2 billion, compared with USD 13.0 billion in 2022. This increase was mainly driven by higher net income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, which were partly\n\no/ffset by higher income taxes paid, mainly due to the timing of payments.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing operations amounted to USD 13.2 billion (+9% USD), compared with USD 12.1 billion in 2022, driven by higher net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations.\n\nWe also present our core results 2 , which exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets, impairments, business acquisitions, divestments, and other significant items, including restructuring and related items, to help investors understand our underlying performance.\n\nCore operating income from continuing operations was USD 16.4 billion (+11%, +18% cc), mainly driven by higher net sales, partly o/ffset by higher SG&A and R&D investments. Core operating income margin from continuing operations was 36.0% of net sales, increasing 0.9 percentage points (+2.4 percentage points cc).\n\nCore net income from continuing operations was USD 13.4 billion (+13%, +19% cc), mainly due to higher core operating income. Core basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD 6.47 (+18%, +25% cc), growing faster than core net income from continuing operations, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\nDiscontinued operations net sales in 2023 were USD 7.4 billion, compared with USD 9.4 billion in 2022, and operating income amounted to USD 265 million, compared with USD 1.3 billion in 2022. Net income from discontinued operations in 2023 amounted to USD 6.3 billion, compared with USD 906 million in 2022, driven by the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which amounted to USD 5.9 billion.\n\nTotal Company net income amounted to USD 14.9 billion in 2023, compared with USD 7.0 billion in 2022, and basic earnings per share was USD 7.15, compared with USD 3.19 in the prior year, driven by the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders of USD 5.9 billion. Net cash flows from operating activities for the total Company amounted to USD 14.5 billion, and free cash flow amounted to USD 13.2 billion.",

For the table providing the net sales from continuing operations by core therapeutic area and established brands for 2023 and 2022, see 'Item 18. Financial statements-Note 4. Revenues and geographic information.'\n\nFor information about the approved indications for certain products described, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview- Products.'\n\n## CARDIOVASCULAR, RENAL AND METABOLIC\n\nNet sales in the cardiovascular, renal and metabolic therapeutic area were USD 6.4 billion (+34%, +36% cc), sales growth mainly driven by Entresto .\n\nEntresto (USD 6.0 billion, +30%, +31% cc) sustained robust  demand-led  growth.  In  the  US  and  Europe, Entresto penetration grew through the continued adoption of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure. In China and Japan, Entresto volume growth is fueled by heart failure as well as increased penetration in hypertension. Highlights of the year also included the approval of the pediatric indication and formulation in Europe with a 1-year extension of RDP to November 2026, and the inclusion of Entresto in the 2023 China Hypertension Treatment Guideline as a new drug category and 1 st line treatment option. In the US, Novartis is in ANDA litigation with generic manufacturers. Novartis has appealed to reverse the negative US district court decision to uphold the validity of its combination patent covering Entresto and combinations of sacubitril and valsartan, which expires in 2025 (with pediatric exclusivity). No generics have tentative or final approval in the US. Any US commercial launch of a generic Entresto product prior to the final outcome of Novartis combination patent appeal, or ongoing litigations involving other patents, may be at risk of later litigation developments.\n\nLeqvio (USD 0.4 billion, +217%, +217% cc) launch in the US and other markets is ongoing, with focus on patient  on-boarding,  removing  access  hurdles  and enhancing  medical  education.  In  July  2023,  FDA expanded the label to include primary hyperlipidemia (patients at increased risk of ASCVD) and removed four adverse reactions from the safety section and Limitations of Use. In Q3 2023, Leqvio was approved in China and in Japan and is now approved in 94 countries. Novartis obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Leqvio under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.\n\n## IMMUNOLOGY\n\nNet sales in the immunology therapeutic area reached USD 7.8 billion (+7%, +8% cc), sales growth was mainly driven by Ilaris and Cosentyx .\n\nCosentyx (USD 5.0 billion, +4%, +5% cc) continued demand growth across key regions, partly o/ffset by revenue deduction increases in the US. Ex-US sales grew +19% (cc). Since initial approval in 2015, Cosentyx has shown sustained e/fficacy and a robust safety profile, treating more than 1 million patients across six systemic inflammatory conditions. Cosentyx demonstrated durable e/fficacy and symptom improvement at 16 weeks with observed results at 52 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe  hidradenitis  suppurativa.  In  May  and\n\nOctober 2023, respectively, the European Commission and FDA approved Cosentyx as the first and only IL-17A inhibitor for hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and the first new biologic therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa in nearly a decade. Cosentyx hidradenitis suppurativa in adults is now approved in more than 60 countries worldwide.  In October 2023, FDA has approved Cosentyx intravenous formulation for the treatment of adults with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.\n\nXolair (USD 1.5 billion, ex-US +7%, +9% cc) sales grew across all regions. Following EMA positive opinion in February 2023, the Xolair SmPC was updated with long term (48 week) e/fficacy and safety data on chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) allowing continued treatment beyond 24 weeks. In November 2023, Novartis received EU approval for six new Xolair product configurations, including auto injectors and a new 300 mg strength. Novartis co-promotes Xolair with Genentech in the US and shares a portion of revenue as operating income but does not record any US sales.\n\nIlaris (USD 1.4 billion, +20%, +22% cc) sales grew across all regions. Contributors to growth include strong performance in the Periodic Fever Syndrome (PFS) and Still's disease indications (SJIA/AOSD) in the US, Europe and Japan, as well as in key markets worldwide.\n\n## NEUROSCIENCE\n\nNet sales in the neuroscience therapeutic area were USD 4.0 billion (+33%, +34% cc), sales growth was mainly driven by Kesimpta .\n\nKesimpta (USD 2.2 billion, +99%, +99% cc) sales grew across all regions mainly driven by increased demand and strong access. Kesimpta is a high e/fficacy B-cell therapy, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and an at home self-administration for a broad population of RMS patients. Kesimpta is now approved in 87 countries with more than 85,000 patients treated.\n\nZolgensma (USD 1.2 billion, -11%, -9% cc). Established markets are treating mainly incident patients. Sales declined in the US and Europe. Zolgensma is now approved in 51 countries with more than 3,700 patients treated globally through clinical trials, early access programs and in the commercial setting.\n\nMayzent (USD 0.4 billion, +10%, +10% cc) sales grew mainly in Europe. Sales continued to grow in patients with multiple sclerosis showing signs of progression despite being on other treatments.\n\nAimovig (USD 0.3 billion, ex-US, ex-Japan +22%, +21% cc) sales grew mainly in Europe, driven by increased demand in migraine prevention. Novartis commercializes Aimovig ex-US, ex-Japan, while Amgen retains all rights in the US and in Japan.\n\n## ONCOLOGY\n\nNet sales in the oncology therapeutic area were USD 13.6 billion (+22%, +23% cc), sales growth was mainly driven by Kisqali , Pluvicto , Scemblix and Promacta / Revolade .\n\nPromacta / Revolade (USD 2.3 billion, +9%, +10% cc) sales grew across all regions, driven by increased use in second-line persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line and/or second-line treatment",

Updates to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines \u00ae ) for breast cancer, released in January 2023, recommend ribociclib ( Kisqali ) as the only Category 1 Preferred CDK4/6 inhibitor for first-line treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Positive, statistically significant interim and final e/fficacy results of the iDFS analysis of the early breast cancer pivotal Phase III trial NATALEE were presented at ASCO and SABCS 2023. Additional QOL information presented at ESMO demonstrated that the addition of Ribociclib to endocrine therapy did not compromise the QOL of patients. Submission for approval in early breast cancer was completed in August to EMA and in December to the FDA. Submissions to other regulatory authorities are ongoing.\n\nTafinlar + Mekinist (USD 1.9 billion, +9%, +11% cc) sales grew mainly in the US and emerging growth markets, driven by demand in BRAF+ adjuvant melanoma and NSCLC indications, while maintaining demand in the highly competitive BRAF+ metastatic melanoma market. In addition, the tumor agnostic indication contributed to growth in the US.\n\nTasigna (USD 1.8 billion, -4%, -3% cc) sales declined mainly in Europe.\n\nJakavi (USD 1.7 billion, ex-US +10%, +12% cc) sales grew in emerging growth markets, Europe and Japan, driven by strong demand in both myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera indications. Incyte retains all rights to ruxolitinib (Jakafi \u00ae ) in the US.\n\nPluvicto (USD 1.0 billion, +262%, +261% cc) saw continued sales growth in the US. Pluvicto is the first and only radioligand therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have already been treated with other anticancer treatments (ARPI and taxane-based chemotherapy). Data from the Phase III PSMAfore trial was presented at ESMO. Pluvicto met its primary endpoint with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after treatment with androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) therapy, compared with a change in ARPI. In Q2 2023, approval was received for commercial production of Pluvicto for US patients at our radioligand manufacturing facility in Millburn, NJ and the expansion of manufacturing operations for EU commercial supply at our site in Zaragoza, Spain. In January 2024, Novartis received approval from the FDA for the commercial manufacturing of Pluvicto at state-of-the-art radioligand therapy (RLT) manufacturing facility in Indianapolis.\n\nLutathera (USD 0.6 billion, +28%, +28% cc) sales grew across all regions due to increased demand. Growth in the US was also driven by strong field execution. In Japan, growth was driven by increased demand following the transfer of the marketing authorization (MA) back\n\nto Novartis from Fujifilm Toyama Chemical. In Q3 2023, the Phase III NETTER-2 trial with Lutathera met its primary endpoint, showing Lutathera is the first radioligand therapy (RLT) to demonstrate clinically meaningful benefit in a first line setting.\n\nKymriah (USD 0.5 billion, -5%, -5% cc) sales declined in Europe and the US, partly o/ffset by growth in Japan and follicular lymphoma indication launch across markets.\n\nPiqray / Vijoice (USD 0.5 billion, +35%, +37% cc) sales grew mainly in the US, Europe and emerging growth markets. In addition to PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), Piqray is the first therapy specifically developed for the approximately 40% of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients who have a PIK3CA mutation, associated with a worse prognosis.\n\nScemblix (USD 0.4 billion, +177%, +179% cc) sales grew across all regions, demonstrating the high unmet need for e/ffective and tolerable treatment options for CML patients who have been treated with 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Scemblix has now been approved in more than 60 countries for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase who have been treated with 2 or more TKIs. In January 2024, Novartis announced that the ASC4FIRST trial met both primary endpoints, with clinically meaningful and statistically significant results vs. standard-of-care TKIs in newly diagnosed Ph+CML-CP patients while demonstrating a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Data will be presented at an upcoming medical conference and submitted to regulatory authorities in 2024.\n\nVotrient (USD 0.4 billion, -18%, -17% cc) declined due to increased competition, especially from immuno-oncology agents in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n\nAdakveo (USD 0.2 billion, +1%, 0% cc) sales grew (cc) mainly in the US, o/ffset by decline in emerging growth markets and Europe. In August 2023, European Commission  endorsed  the  CHMP's  recommendation  to revoke  the  conditional  marketing  authorization  for Adakveo . Adakveo remains approved for use by the FDA for the reduction in frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (pain crises) in adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years or older with sickle cell disease. Novartis continues to discuss the STAND study results with FDA and other health authorities globally.\n\nTabrecta (USD 0.2 billion, +16%, +16% cc) sales grew mainly in the US. Tabrecta is the first therapy approved by the FDA to specifically target metastatic NSCLC with a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) in line agnostic setting. Novartis obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Tabrecta under a license and collaboration agreement with Incyte Corporation.\n\n## ESTABLISHED BRANDS\n\nThe established brands had net sales of USD 13.6 billion (-15%, -12% cc).\n\nLucentis (USD 1.5 billion, ex-US -21%, -20% cc) sales declined in Europe, emerging growth markets and Japan due to competition.\n\nSandostatin (USD 1.3 million, +6%, +8% cc) sales grew mainly in emerging growth markets, Europe and in the US.",

The current year tax rate was favorably impacted by the e/ffect of tax benefits from the writedown of investments in subsidiaries, non-taxable net gains on unrealized foreign currency results, recognition of deferred tax assets on prior years tax loss carryforwards, non-taxable income related to legal matters, and\n\nother items including impact of tax rate changes. Excluding these impacts, the current year tax rate would have been 15.3% compared with 15.7% in the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year was mainly the result of a change in profit mix.\n\n## Net income from continuing operations\n\nNet income from continuing operations was USD 8.6 billion (+42%, +62% cc), mainly due to higher operating income from continuing operations and non-recurring favorable tax impacts.\n\n## Earnings per share from continuing operations\n\nBasic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD 4.13 (+49%, +70% cc), growing faster than net income from continuing operations, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.",

Included in 2023 is also the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable net gain on the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders of USD 5.9 billion, representing mainly the excess amount of the IFRS Accounting Standards distribution liability, which is the estimated fair value of the Sandoz business distributed to Novartis AG shareholders, over the then carrying value of Sandoz business net assets. There were no operating results for the fourth quarter 2023 following the distribution date. The prior year includes the results for the full year.\n\n## Total Company\n\nTotal Company net income amounted to USD 14.9 billion in 2023, compared with USD 7.0 billion in 2022, and basic earnings per share was USD 7.15, compared with USD 3.19 in the prior year, driven by the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz\n\n## Core net income from continuing operations\n\nCore net income from continuing operations was USD 13.4 billion (+13%, +19% cc), mainly due to higher core operating income from continuing operations.\n\n## Core earnings per share from continuing operations\n\nCore basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD 6.47 (+18%, +25% cc), growing faster than core net income from continuing operations, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\nDiscontinued operations net sales in 2023 were USD 7.4 billion, compared with USD 9.4 billion in 2022 and operating income amounted to USD 265 million compared with USD 1.3 billion in 2022.\n\nNet income from discontinued operations in 2023 amounted to USD 6.3 billion, compared with USD 906 million in 2022, driven by the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which amounted to USD 5.9 billion.\n\nFor further information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting policies; Note 2. Significant transactions-Completion of the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business through a dividend in kind distribution to Novartis AG shareholders and -Note 31. Discontinued operations.'\n\nGroup AG to Novartis AG shareholders of USD 5.9 billion. Net cash flows from operating activities for the total Company amounted to USD 14.5 billion, and free cash flow amounted to USD 13.2 billion.",

Sales growth was driven by volume growth of 13 percentage points, mainly driven by continued strong growth from Entresto , Kesimpta , Kisqali, Pluvicto and Cosentyx . Generic competition had a negative impact of 4 percentage points, mainly due to Gilenya, Afinitor/Votubia , and Gleevec/Glivec . Pricing had a negative impact of 4 percentage points. Net sales from continuing operations in the US were USD 15.9 billion (+7%) and in the rest of the world USD 26.3 billion (-6%, +4% cc).\n\nIn emerging growth markets, which comprise all markets excluding the US, Canada, Western Europe 1 , Japan, Australia and New Zealand, net sales from continuing operations were USD 10.8 billion (+2%, +9% cc), driven by China (USD 2.9 billion) growing +3% (+7% cc).\n\nOperating income from continuing operations was USD 7.9 billion (-21%, -12% cc), mainly due to higher restructuring primarily related to the implementation of the previously announced streamlined organizational model, higher impairments and lower divestment gains. Operating income margin from continuing operations was 18.8% of net sales from continuing operations, decreasing by 4.7 percentage points (-3.8 percentage points cc).\n\nNet income from continuing operations was USD 6.0 billion compared with USD 22.9 billion in the prior year, impacted by Roche income in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Roche income, net income from continuing operations declined 9% (cc). Basic earnings per share from continuing operations were USD 2.77 compared with USD 10.22 in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Roche income, basic earnings per share from continuing operations declined 7% (cc).\n\nNet cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 13.0 billion, compared with USD 13.4 billion in 2021. This decrease was mainly due to unfavorable changes in working capital and lower  dividends  from  associated  companies  (2021 included the USD 0.5 billion dividends received from our investment in Roche, which was divested in the fourth\n\nquarter of 2021), partly o/ffset by lower income taxes paid, higher interest received and favorable hedging results.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing operations amounted to USD 12.1 billion, broadly in line with USD 12.3 billion in 2021.\n\nWe also present our core results 2 , which exclude the impact of amortization, impairments, disposals, acquisitions, restructurings and other significant items, to help investors understand our underlying performance.\n\nCore operating income from continuing operations was USD 14.8 billion (+2%, +10% cc), benefiting from higher gross margin, partly o/ffset by higher research and development (R&D) investments. Core operating income margin from continuing operations was 35.1% of net sales from continuing operations, increasing by 1.2 percentage points (+1.8 percentage points cc).\n\nCore net income from continuing operations was USD 11.9 billion (-5%, +4% cc) as growth in core operating income was partly o/ffset by the loss of Roche core income. Excluding the impact of Roche core income, core net income grew from continuing operations +13% (cc).\n\nDiscontinued operations include the Sandoz generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars division and certain corporate activities attributable to Sandoz prior to the spino/ff up to the distribution date of October 3, 2023, and certain other expenses related to the spin-o/ff. Net sales of discontinued operations were USD 9.4 billion, compared with USD 9.8 billion in 2021, and operating income amounted to USD 1.3 billion, compared with USD 1.6 billion in the prior year. Net income from discontinued operations was USD 0.9 billion compared with USD 1.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nTotal Company net income amounted to USD 7.0 billion, and basic earnings per share were USD 3.19, compared with USD 10.71 in the prior year. Net cash flows from operating activities amounted to USD 14.2 billion, and free cash flow amounted to USD 13.0 billion.\n\n- 2 For an explanation of non-IFRS measures and reconciliation tables, see '-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis.'",

Financial statements-Note 4. Revenues and geographic information.'\n\n## CARDIOVASCULAR, RENAL AND METABOLIC\n\nNet sales in the cardiovascular, renal and metabolic therapeutic area were USD 4.8 billion (+34%, +40% cc), sales growth mainly driven by Entresto.\n\nEntresto (USD 4.6 billion, +31%, +37% cc) sustained robust demand-led growth, with increased patient share across all geographies. Guidelines position Entresto as the first choice RASi versus ACEi/ARB in patients with HFrEF. Entresto benefits from the adoption of guideline directed medical therapy for these patients in all geographies. In the US, Entresto benefits from being added to guidelines for patients with HFpEF (with LVEF below normal). In China, Entresto has been listed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for both HFrEF and hypertension, e/ffective January 2022. In China and Japan, Entresto volume growth is fueled by increased penetration in hypertension in addition to growth in heart failure. It is estimated that around 10 million patients are on treatment with Entresto .\n\nLeqvio (USD 0.1 billion) launch in the US and other markets is ongoing, with focus on patient on-boarding, removing access hurdles and enhancing medical education. Leqvio is the first and only small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol approved in the US and was launched in January 2022. In the US, Leqvio is covered at or near label for 76% of patients eleven months after launch. Leqvio in the US has been assigned a unique Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code (J-code) and average sales price. Leqvio is now approved in 70 countries. Novartis obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Leqvio under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.\n\n## IMMUNOLOGY\n\nNet sales in the immunology therapeutic area reached USD 7.3 billion (+1%, +7% cc), sales growth was mainly driven by Cosentyx and Ilaris .\n\nCosentyx (USD 4.8 billion, +1%, +5% cc) sales grew in emerging growth markets, Europe and Japan, partly o/ffset by decline in the US due to higher revenue deductions. In China, Cosentyx growth was fueled by increased biologic uptake and inclusion in approximately 1,900 hospital listings. Since initial approval in 2015, Cosentyx has proven its sustained e/fficacy and consistent safety profile across five systemic inflammatory conditions and has treated more than 960,000 patients worldwide.\n\nXolair (USD 1.4 billion, -4%, +6% cc) sales grew (cc) in emerging growth markets, Europe and Japan. Novartis co-promotes Xolair with Genentech in the US and shares a portion of revenue as operating income but does not record any US sales.\n\nIlaris (USD 1.1 billion, +7%, +15% cc) showed continued growth across all geographies. Contributors to growth include the adult-onset Still's disease indication, together with the other adult rheumatology indications\n\nin the US and Europe, as well as strong performance for the Periodic Fevers Syndrome indications in Japan.\n\n## NEUROSCIENCE\n\nNet sales in the neuroscience therapeutic area were USD 3.0 billion (+37%, +42% cc), sales growth (cc) mainly driven by Kesimpta .\n\nZolgensma (USD 1.4 billion, +1%, +5% cc) has been approved in 47 countries to date. As this represents most major markets, sales growth is now mainly driven by the Incident patient population where we've seen double digit growth in 2022. Access pathways are now in place in 35 countries with negotiations ongoing in additional markets.\n\nKesimpta (USD 1.1 billion, +194%, +200% cc) showed strong sales growth driven by launch momentum across all geographies. Kesimpta is a targeted B-cell therapy that can deliver powerful and sustained high e/fficacy, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and the flexibility of an at home self-administration for a broad population of RMS patients. Kesimpta is now approved in 80 countries with more than 36,000 patients treated.\n\nMayzent (USD 0.4 billion, +27%, +32% cc) sales grew across all geographies in MS patients showing signs of progression despite being on other treatments. Mayzent is the first and only oral disease-modifying therapy studied and proven to delay disease progression in a broad SPMS patient population.\n\nAimovig (USD 0.2 billion, +1%, +11% cc) sales grew in Europe and emerging growth markets. Aimovig is reimbursed in 32 markets and has been prescribed to over 759,000 patients worldwide. Earlier this year, Aimovig was submitted for approval in China.

In the prior year, the tax rate was impacted by the Roche income from associated companies (including the divestment gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Roche in December 2021), the impact of increases in uncertain tax positions and prior-year items.\n\nFor comparability, excluding these impacts, the prior year tax rate would have been 15.4% compared with 15.7% in the current year period. The increase was mainly the result of a change in profit mix.\n\n## Net income from continuing operations\n\nNet income from continuing operations was USD 6.0 billion (-74%, -70% cc), impacted by Roche income in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Roche income, net income from continuing operations declined 9% (cc).\n\n## Earnings per share from continuing operations\n\nBasic earnings per share from continuing operations were USD 2.77 compared with USD 10.22 in the prior year, mainly due to prior year Roche income.

This decrease was due to the divestment of our investment in Roche that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n## Core interest expense and other financial income and expense\n\nCore interest expense amounted to USD 800 million, broadly in line with the prior year.\n\nCore other financial income and expense amounted to an income of USD 140 million compared with an expense of USD 38 million in the prior year as higher interest income was only partly o/ffset by currency losses.\n\n## Core income taxes\n\nThe core tax rate (core taxes as a percentage of core income before tax) was 15.4%, compared with 14.5% in the prior year. For comparability, excluding Roche Income from  associated  companies  (divested  in  December 2021), the prior year core tax rate would have been 15.4%, in line with 15.4% in the current year.\n\n## Core net income from continuing operations\n\nCore net income from continuing operations was USD 11.9 billion (-5%, +4% cc) as growth in core operating income from continuing operations was partly o/ffset by the loss of Roche core income. Excluding the impact of Roche core income, core net income from continuing operations grew 13% (cc).\n\n## Core earnings per share from continuing operations\n\nCore basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD 5.48 (-2%, +6% cc), benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. Excluding the impact of Roche core income, core basic earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% (cc).",

As part of our\n\nlong-term  strategy  to  focus  Novartis  as  a  leading medicines company, we announced and/or completed several acquisitions and divestments during 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nA detailed description of significant transactions in 2023, 2022 and 2021, can be found in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions.'\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe Company's management has assessed the e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm also issued an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Both the Company's management and its independent registered public\n\naccounting firm concluded that the Company maintained, in all material respects, e/ffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. For more information, see 'Item 15. Controls and Procedures.'\n\n## Approach to risk management\n\nSee 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item  6.C  Board  practices-Corporate  governance-Information and control systems-Risk\n\nmanagement' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 30. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis\n\nNovartis uses certain non-IFRS Accounting Standards metrics when measuring performance, especially when measuring current-year results against prior periods, including core results, constant currencies and free cash flow. These are referred to by Novartis as non-IFRS measures.\n\nDespite the use of these measures by management in setting goals and measuring the Company's performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors.\n\nBecause of their non-standardized definitions, the non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS Accounting Standards\n\nmeasures) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how the Company's management assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS Accounting Standards measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\n\nAs an internal measure of Company performance, these non-IFRS measures have limitations, and the Company's performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics.",

        "page_content": "## Core results\n\nThe Company's core results - including core operating income, core net income and core earnings per share exclude fully the amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets, excluding software, net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss, impact of IAS 29 'Financial reporting in Hyperinflation Economies' to other financial income and expense, and certain acquisition- and divestment-related items. The following items that exceed a threshold of USD  25 million are also excluded: integration- and divestment-related income and expenses; divestment gains and losses; restructuring charges/releases and related items; legal-related items; impairments of property, plant and equipment, software, and financial assets, and income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a USD 25 million threshold.\n\nNovartis believes that investor understanding of the Company's performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance, since core measures exclude items that can vary significantly from year to year, they enable better comparison of business performance across years. For this same reason, Novartis uses these core measures in addition to IFRS Accounting Standards measures and other measures as important factors in assessing the Company's performance.\n\nThe following are examples of how these core measures are used:\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to monthly reports containing financial information prepared under IFRS Accounting Standards, senior management receives a monthly analysis incorporating these non-IFRS core measures.\n- \u00b7  Annual budgets are prepared for both IFRS Accounting Standard measures and non-IFRS core measures.\n\nAs an internal measure of Company performance, the core results measures have limitations, and the Company's performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics. A limitation of the core results measures is that they provide a view of the Company's operations without including all events during a period, such as the e/ffects of an acquisition, divestment, or amortization/impairments  of  purchased  intangible assets, impairments to property, plant and equipment and restructurings and related items.\n\n## Constant currencies\n\nChanges in the relative values of non-US currencies to the US dollar can a/ffect the Company's financial results and financial position. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors, including changes in sales volume, we present information about our net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency e/ffects.\n\nConstant currency calculations have the goal of eliminating two exchange rate e/ffects so that an estimate\n\ncan be made of underlying changes in the consolidated income statement excluding the impact of fluctuations in exchanges rates:\n\n- \u00b7  The impact of translating the income statements of consolidated entities from their non-USD functional currencies to USD\n- \u00b7  The impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in currencies other than their functional currency.\n\nWe calculate constant currency measures by translating the current year's foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into USD (excluding the IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' adjustments to the local currency income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies), using the average exchange rates from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year values in USD.\n\nWe use these constant currency measures in evaluating the Company's performance, since they may assist us in evaluating our ongoing performance from year to year. However, in performing our evaluation, we also consider equivalent measures of performance that are not a/ffected by changes in the relative value of currencies.\n\n## Growth rate calculation\n\nFor ease of understanding, Novartis uses a sign convention for its growth rates such that a reduction in operating expenses or losses compared with the prior year is shown as a positive growth.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nE/ffective January 1, 2023, Novartis revised its definition of free cash flow, to define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. This new definition provides a simpler performance measure focusing on core operating activities, and also excludes items that can vary significantly from year to year, thereby enabling better comparison of business performance across years. The prior year free cash flow amounts have been revised to conform with the new free cash flow definition to aid in comparability.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under IFRS Accounting Standards. Free cash flow is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of the Company's ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is a measure of the net cash generated that is available for investment in strategic opportunities, returning to shareholders and for debt repayment. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, which means it should not be interpreted as a measure determined under IFRS Accounting Standards.",

Company liquidity, financial debts and net debt.'\n\n## EBITDA\n\nNovartis defines earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as operating income, excluding depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets, amortization of intangible assets, and net impairments of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and of intangible assets.\n\n056\n\n005\n\n665\n\n653\n\n633\n\n149\n\n802\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                     | 2023   |   2022 | 2021       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Operating income from   continuing operations                                                      | 9 769  |      7 | 946 10     |\n| Depreciation of property,   plant and equipment                                                    | 916    |    967 | 1          |\n| Depreciation of     right-of-use assets                                                            | 259    |    267 | 279        |\n| Amortization of intangible   assets                                                                | 3      |      3 | 960 760 3  |\n| Impairments of property,   plant and equipment, right-of-use  assets and intangible assets, net  1 | 3  142 |      1 | 711 648    |\n| EBITDA from continuing   operations                                                                | 18     |     14 | 046 651 15 |\n| Operating income from   discontinued operations                                                    | 265    |      1 | 251 1      |\n| Depreciation of property,   plant and equipment                                                    | 144    |    196 | 203        |\n| Depreciation of the    right-of-use-assets                                                         | 32     |     33 | 39         |\n| Amortization of intangible   assets                                                                | 171    |    222 | 238        |\n| Impairments of property,   plant and equipment, right-of-use  assets and intangible assets, net  2 | 56     |     25 | 36         |\n| EBITDA from discontinued   operations  3                                                           | 668    |      1 | 727 2      |\n| EBITDA                                                                                             | 18     |     16 | 714 378 17 |\n\n- 1 There were no impairments of right-of-use assets in 2021.\n- 2 There were no impairments of right-of-use assets.\n- 3 The EBITDA from discontinued operations for 2023 is for the period from January 1, 2023, to the October 3, 2023, Distribution date.\n\n## ENTERPRISE VALUE\n\nEnterprise value represents the total amount that shareholders and debt holders have invested in Novartis, less the Company's liquidity.\n\n107\n\n902\n\n295\n\n142\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                               | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Market capitalization                                                                        | 206 264        | 191  530       | 196            |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                    | 83             | 81             | 167            |\n| Non-current financial debts                                                                  | 18 436         | 20             | 244 22         |\n| Current financial debts and   derivative financial instruments                               | 6 175          | 5              | 931 6          |\n| Marketable securities,   commodities, time deposits   and derivative financial   instruments | -

There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case for items arising from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments related to income from associated companies are recorded net of any related tax e/ffect. Due to these factors and the di/ffering e/ffective tax rates in the various jurisdictions, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 6.8 billion to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 1.9 billion and the average tax rate on the adjustments was 28.4%.\n- 6 For details on discontinued operations reconciliation from IFRS  Accounting Standards net ncome to core net income refer to page 70.\n- 7 Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated on the amount of net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG.\n\n959\n\n372\n\n934\n\n446\n\n335",

This follows the September 15, 2023 shareholders' approval to spin o/ff the Sandoz business through a dividend in kind distribution to the Novartis AG shareholders (for further information see Item 18. Financial Statements - Note 1. Accounting policies; and - Note 2. Significant transactions).\n\nThe December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet includes the assets and liabilities of the Sandoz business. The December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet excludes the assets and liabilities of the Sandoz business in the individual lines, due to the derecognition of the Sandoz business at the date of the October 3, 2023 distribution (spin-o/ff).\n\nThe consolidated balance sheet discussion and analysis that follows excludes the impacts of the derecognition of the Sandoz business assets and liabilities at the date of the distribution (spin-o/ff). For information on the assets and liabilities of the Sandoz business derecognized at October 3, 2023, the distribution (spin-o/ff) date,\n\nsee Item 18. Financial Statements - Note 31 - Discontinued operations - Net assets derecognized.'\n\n## Assets\n\nTotal non-current assets of USD 69.5 billion increased by USD 0.5 billion compared with December 31, 2022, excluding the impact of the derecognition of the Sandoz business non-current assets related to discontinued operations.\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill decreased by USD 3.3 billion mainly due to amortization and impairments and the divestment of the 'front of eye' ophthalmology assets, partially o/ffset by the impact of acquisitions, including Chinook Therapeutics, Inc. and of DTx Pharma Inc., additions, and favorable currency translation adjustments.\n\nGoodwill increased by USD 1.5 billion mainly due to the acquisition of Chinook Therapeutics, Inc and DTx Pharma Inc.\n\nDeferred tax assets increased by USD 1.3 billion mainly due to higher deferred tax assets on intangible assets, inventory and tax loss carryforwards. Property, plant and equipment increased by USD 0.6 billion mainly",

        "page_content": "as additions and favorable currency translation adjustments exceeded depreciation charge and disposals. Right-of-use assets, investments in associated companies, financial assets, and other non-current assets were broadly in line with December 31, 2022.\n\nTotal current assets of USD 30.5 billion decreased by USD 1.7 billion, compared with December 31, 2022, excluding the impact of the derecognition of the Sandoz business non-current assets related to discontinued operations.\n\nCash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and derivative financial instruments decreased by USD 4.4 billion mainly due to the dividend payment, and net purchases of treasury shares and intangible assets, partially o/ffset by the cash generated through operating activities.\n\nInventories increased by USD 0.9 billion. Trade receivables increased by USD 1.3 billion, mainly due to the increase in net sales. Other current assets and income tax receivables were broadly in line with December 31, 2022.\n\nWe consider our provisions for doubtful trade receivables to be adequate. We particularly monitor the level of trade receivables in countries deemed to have an elevated credit risk. We consider macroeconomic environment, historical experience, country and political risk, in addition to other relevant information when assessing risk. These risk factors are monitored regularly to determine any adjustments in risk classification. The majority of the past due trade receivables from elevated credit risk countries are due from local governments or from government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions as well as other factors in these elevated credit risk countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these trade receivables and  may  require  the  Company  to  re-evaluate  the expected credit loss amount of these trade receivables in future periods. As at December 31, 2023, amounts past due for more than one year were not significant in elevated credit risk countries.\n\nFor a table showing an overview of the aging analysis of total trade receivables and the total amount of the provision for doubtful trade receivables as at December 31, 2023, and 2022, see 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 16. Trade receivables.'\n\nThere is also a risk that certain countries could devalue  their  currency.  Currency  exposures  are described in more detail in '-E/ffects of currency fluctuations.'\n\n## Liabilities\n\nTotal non-current liabilities of USD 26.8 billion decreased by USD 1.7 billion, compared with December 31, 2022, excluding the impact of the derecognition of the Sandoz business non-current liabilities related to discontinued operations.\n\nNon-current financial debts decreased by USD 1.8 billion mainly due to the reclassification of USD 2.1 billion\n\nfrom non-current to current financial debts of a USD denominated bond with notional amount of USD 2.2 billion maturing in 2024.\n\nNon-current lease liabilities, deferred tax liabilities and provisions and other non-current liabilities were broadly in line with December 31, 2022.\n\nTotal current liabilities of USD 26.4 billion increased by USD 1.5 billion, compared with December 31, 2022, excluding the impact of the derecognition of the Sandoz business non-current liabilities related to discontinued operations.\n\nCurrent financial debts and derivative financial instruments were broadly in line with December 31, 2022, as the repayment of a 0.5% coupon bond with a notional amount of EUR 750 million and a 0.125% coupon bond with a notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion was largely o/ffset by the reclassification of USD 2.1 billion from non-current to current financial debts of a USD denominated bond with notional amount of USD 2.2 billion maturing in 2024.\n\nProvisions and other current liabilities increased by USD 0.6 billion, mainly driven by an increase of the provisions for deductions from revenue. Trade payables increased by USD 0.9 billion. Current income tax liabilities and current lease liabilities were broadly in line with December 31, 2022.\n\nIn our key countries, Switzerland and the United States, assessments have been agreed by the tax authorities up to 2019 in Switzerland and up to 2016 in the United States, with the exception of one open United States position related to the 2007 tax filing. Uncertainties also exist on the application of a taxing right based on a German non-resident tax regulation for specific revenues derived from German registered intellectual property rights.\n\nNovartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent di/fficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Company's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.\n\n## Equity\n\nThe Company's equity decreased by USD 12.7 billion to USD 46.8 billion, compared with December 31, 2022.\n\nThis decrease was mainly due to the dividend in kind to e/ffect the distribution (spin-o/ff) of Sandoz Group AG to the Novartis AG shareholders' of USD 14.0 billion (for further information see 'Item 18. Financial Statements Note 2. Significant transactions, and Note 31 - Discontinued operations'), the cash-dividend payment of USD 7.3 billion and the purchase of treasury shares of USD 8.5 billion. This was partially o/ffset by the net income of USD 14.9 billion,  and equity-based compensation of USD 0.9 billion.",

As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant e/ffect on both the Company's results of operations as well as the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This in turn may significantly a/ffect reported earnings (both positively and negatively) and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\n\nFor purposes of our consolidated balance sheets, we translate assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into US dollars at the prevailing market exchange rates as of the relevant balance sheet date. For purposes of the Company's consolidated income and cash flow statements, revenue, expense and cash flow items in local currencies are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the relevant period. As a result, even if the amounts or values of these items remain unchanged in the respective local currency, changes in exchange rates have an impact on the amounts or values of these items in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause our expenditure in Swiss francs is significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, volatility\n\nin the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nThe Company manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate, after taking into account the natural hedging a/fforded by our global business activity. In 2023 and 2022, we entered into various contracts that change in value with movements in foreign exchange rates, to preserve the value of assets, commitments and expected transactions. We use forward contracts and foreign currency options to hedge. For more information on how these transactions a/ffect our consolidated financial statements and on how foreign exchange rate exposure is managed, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting policies,' 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 6. Interest expense and other financial income and expense,' 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 16. Trade receivables,' 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 29. Commitments and contingent liabilities' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 30. Financial instruments additional disclosures.'",

The performance of our product portfolio (including Entresto , Kesimpta , Kisqali and Scemblix ) together with the optimization  of  our  commercial  and  supporting  functions contributed to sales growth of 10% (constant currencies 'cc') and core operating income growth of 18% (cc), compared  with  the  previous  year.  Innovation  highlights included positive results from several Phase III clinical trials for investigational medicines with significant sales potential, including Pluvicto , remibrutinib and iptacopan, as well as additional approval indications for Entresto (for pediatric heart failure) in the EU and Cosentyx (for hidradenitis suppurativa) in the EU and US.  Regulatory submissions were completed for Kisqali (for early breast cancer) in the EU and US. Transactions provided further substance to the pipeline, notably with the acquisition of Chinook Therapeutics to strengthen our renal portfolio. The one-year 2023 TSR performance of 26% was in the top 3 of our global healthcare peers.\n\nOn October 4, 2023, we successfully spun o/ff our Sandoz generics and biosimilars business, through a dividend-in-kind distribution to holders of Novartis shares and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Each holder received one Sandoz share for every five Novartis shares or one Sandoz ADR for every five Novartis ADRs. While shareholders received the aforementioned dividend in kind,  Performance Share Unit (PSU) and Restricted Share Unit (RSU) holders, including active and former members  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  Novartis (ECN), received instead 'keep whole awards' with the same vesting and performance conditions as the underlying award. This ensured award holders were treated on an economically consistent basis to Novartis shareholders. For more information, see '-Sandoz equity restoration plan.'\n\n## 2023 realized compensation\n\nThe company's performance in 2023 resulted in an Annual Incentive payout of 185% for the CEO, and in a Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) 2021-2023 payout of 122%. These factors, together with an increase of 16% in the vesting price of the 2021-2023 LTPP (when adjusted for the Sandoz spin-o/ff) resulted in the total realized CEO compensation of CHF 16 248 178 in 2023. These three outcomes contributed to the vast majority of the year-on-year increase in realized pay for the CEO. They also impacted the compensation outcome for the other members of the ECN, whose total aggregated compensation was CHF 47 205 005. For details on the realized compensation, see '-CEO and Executive Committee 2023 realized compensation.'\n\n## Changes to the executive compensation system in 2024\n\nAs part of our annual review, we identified that our existing CEO compensation practices placed us in the lowest quartile versus global healthcare peers. We engaged extensively with our largest shareholders and proxy advisors to collect feedback about our executive compensation framework, in particular the challenges that European companies face in  the competition  for  talent. Following this engagement and the overall positive nature of the feedback received, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors agreed that it is necessary to take a global perspective to attract and retain the best talent at the top of the organization, and that the company could be more competitive in this regard. As a result, and while still mindful of the expectations of European-based investors and proxy advisors, we made the following changes to our compensation system, e/ffective January 1, 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 CEO target compensation: We aspire to continue growing our global business, with a particular focus on the US market.  Aligned with this aspiration and our compensation philosophy, the Board of Directors decided to adjust the CEO target pay in a way that preserves alignment with shareholders. Specifically, we increased the LTPP target, which is fully performance driven based on three-year forward-looking targets, from 325% to 400% as a percentage of annual base salary. The additional two-year holding period for the CEO remains unchanged, thereby restricting the equities from sale for five years. The Compensation Committee will continue to set stretch targets, with a robust assessment at the end of the cycle. No changes were made to the CEO base salary (beyond ordinary salary increases received by other Swiss employees) or the Annual Incentive target. This is the first significant increase in CEO target pay since 2019 and places his target compensation just above the lowest quartile of global healthcare peers, based on the last disclosed proxy information.\n- \u00b7  Annual Incentive metrics: The Compensation Committee agreed to replace operating income with core operating income in our ECN Annual Incentive. The Compensation  Committee  agreed  that  core  operating income, which excludes certain one-time or non-recurring items, represents a better measure of the Company's underlying performance. Additionally, core-adjusted metrics are more commonly used by our global healthcare peers, which would enable easier peer performance comparisons.\n- \u00b7  Share ownership and Annual Incentive deferral: The Compensation Committee strongly a/ffirms a commitment to the principle of aligning the interests of executives with shareholders. To that end, we will continue to enforce an obligation that all ECN members become meaningful shareholders with a requirement to hold a multiple of their salary in Novartis shares. Currently, the Annual Incentive has a 50% mandatory deferral into equity, which is blocked for three years.  The Compensation Committee decided that this aspect of the Annual Incentive should be more in line with relevant",

        "page_content": "market practice. For this reason, once an ECN member has met their shareholding requirement, the portion of the Annual Incentive that is mandatorily deferred will be reduced to 30%. To reinforce strong shareholder alignment, the CEO's shareholding requirement will simultaneously be increased from 5x to 6x annual base salary.\n\nFor more information about these changes, see '-2024 Executive Committee compensation system changes and increases.'\n\n## 2023 compensation report structure and disclosure\n\nThe Compensation Committee decided to make the following changes to the 2023 Novartis Compensation Report:\n\n- \u00b7  The Compensation Report has been reorganized to enhance its readability. For this reason, a detailed presentation of executive compensation outcomes can be found in the first part, and an explanation of our underlying compensation philosophy, system and governance in the second part. The Board compensation and governance information is in the final section. We trust that you will find this new structure more accessible.\n- \u00b7 In response to shareholder feedback, we provide more disclosure  and  transparency  in  the  CEO  balanced scorecard, with an increased focus on the link between pay and performance.\n\nCommittee believes that this approach is more commercially appropriate while also maintaining our disclosure at the upper end of Swiss practice. Notwithstanding this change, we continue to disclose the CEO and ECN realized pay, as well as any significant individual pay increases, buyouts and exit packages.\n\n## 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nOn behalf of the Compensation Committee, I would like to thank shareholders for their input and engagement during the consultation process. This has helped us shape the improvements to our compensation system presented here, as well as the changes in the format of the Compensation Report.\n\nAt the 2024 AGM, as with prior years, shareholders will be asked to vote on:\n\n- \u00b7  The maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Board of Directors from the 2024 AGM to the 2025 AGM\n- \u00b7  The maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the ECN for the financial year 2025\n- \u00b7  This 2023 Compensation Report\n\nWe trust that this Report and our 2024 Say-on-Pay brochure provides you with the information required for you to vote in favor of the above. We continue to welcome your feedback, which is invaluable in driving improvements in our compensation system and practices.\n\n- \u00b7  Aligned with our evolution from an organization with separate divisions each with a separate leader into a focused medicines company, we disclose target pay for the CEO (as the highest paid), the CFO and the Presidents of our International and US organizations individually, while all other ECN target pay is aggregated, see '-Compensation at grant value for the CEO and  Executive  Committee'.

Financial results exceeded target due to a strong performance on sales and significant savings from our organizational restructuring. Our TSR performance for the year 2023 was in the top quartile of the industry. Strategic objectives were also well executed: the spin-o/ff of Sandoz was completed in Q4 2023 and our organic pipeline made good progress with several positive clinical trial results and important regulatory filings. We maintained strong positions in our priority ESG ratings, underscoring our progress in delivering on our ESG commitments. In view of these achievements, the Board of Directors decided on an Annual Incentive payout of 185% (within the range of 0-200%), leading to a total amount of CHF 5 075 255 .",

These targets were introduced in early 2021 during the Covid pandemic and were set at ambitious levels relative to prevailing market and internal expectations at that time. The Board reviewed these targets again at the end of the cycle and decided they are still appropriate.\n\nAs with the Annual Incentive, the financial LTPP targets were recalibrated to take the Sandoz spin-o/ff into account. Given that these metrics measure the compound annual growth rate, Sandoz targets were removed for the financial year 2023. For the relative TSR measure, the dividend in kind distribution was treated as a one-time dividend that is not reinvested. A similar approach was taken for the targets in other ongoing cycles.\n\n## 3 RD PARTY SALES CAGR\n\n## (25% weighting)\n\n## Vesting range 0-200% of target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNotes:\n\nA minimum achievement of 3.2% CAGR was required to receive a payout under this performance measure\n\nNovartis achieved 3 rd party sales CAGR of 5.9% (in constant currencies - cc) against the 5.8% target set at the beginning of the performance cycle, in large part due to Entresto, Kesimpta and Promacta , partly o/ffset by Beovu, Kymriah and Cosentyx .\n\nFollowing the application of the payout curve, the 3 rd party sales CAGR (cc) achievement generates a payout factor of 102% for this metric.\n\n## INNOVATION\n\n## (25% weighting)\n\nThe following outcomes were considered in our 2021-2023 LTPP cycle innovation performance:\n\n- \u00b7 Cosentyx approved in the EU for childhood arthritic conditions; approved in the EU and US for HS; IV formulation approved in US\n- \u00b7 Entresto approved in the EU for pediatric heart failure; extending regulatory data protection to November 2026\n- \u00b7 Kymriah approved in the EU and US for adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma\n- \u00b7 Pluvicto approved in the US for the treatment of progressive PSMA positive mCRPC\n- \u00b7 Kisqali submissions in EU and US (for early breast cancer)\n- \u00b7 Iptacopan submission in EU and approval in US for patients with PNH\n- \u00b7  Submissions for Pluvicto treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, ligelizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria and canakinumab as adjuvant treatment in non-small cell lung cancer were delayed or not submitted\n- \u00b7 In Biomedical Research, 19 pivotal trial enabling First Patient First Visits were achieved. Two Oncology targeted therapies and two radio-ligand NMEs were progressed to clinical investigation\n\nBased on input from the Science & Technology Committee (STC), the Board of Directors approved a payout of 108% for this metric.\n\n## 2021-2023 LTPP CYCLE PAYOUT\n\nOverall, the Board of Directors approved a 2021-2023 LTPP cycle payout at 122% of target, within the range of 0-200%. This resulted in an LTPP payout of CHF 8 921 546 for the CEO, including  dividend equivalents of CHF 759 557 and Keep Whole Awards of CHF 523 862.

The table also includes the total 2022 realized compensation for all Executive Committee members for comparative purposes.\n\nTo determine the appropriateness of 2023 CEO and executive compensation payouts under the Annual Incentive and LTPP, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reviewed management's performance against targets set at the beginning of the cycles as described in '-2023 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard' and '-2021-2023 LTPP cycle performance outcomes.'\n\nThe incentive performance outcomes, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, keep whole awards and dividend equivalents, resulted in 2023 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 16 248 178 .\n\n## Realized compensation for the CEO and Executive Committee (2023 compared with 2022)\n\n909\n\n292\n\n814\n\n480\n\n553\n\n966\n\n260\n\n514\n\n332\n\n469\n\n215\n\n739\n\n12\n\n152\n\n792\n\n424\n\n771\n\n|                                          | 2023      | 2023                | 2023              | 2022      | 2022       | 2022      | 2022       | 2022         |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| In CHF (gross)  1                        | CEO       | Other ECN    2      | Total             |           | CEO        | Other ECN | 3          | Total        |\n| Annual Base Salary                       | 1 822 334 | 8  551              | 936 10            | 374       | 269 1  786 | 500 9     | 122        | 792 10       |\n| Annual Incentive  (performance achieved) | 5 075 255 | 15  449             | 571 20            | 524       | 826 2  684 | 321 10    | 130        | 159 12       |\n| Thereof cash                             | 2 537 599 | 6  149              | 179 8             | 686       | 778 1  342 | 125 4     | 211        | 841 5        |\n| Thereof equity                           | 2 537 656 | 9  300              | 392 11            | 838     4 | 048 1  342 | 196 5     | 918        | 318 7     5  |\n| LTPP                                     | 8         | 921  15  100        | 546 093 24  021   | 6         | 639 3  307 | 422 10    | 025        | 047 13     7 |\n| Other payments  8                        | 258       | 918 6  475          | 697 6             | 734     9 | 615 499    | 445 9     | 716        | 294 10       |\n| Pension benefits  10                     | 170       | 125 1  627          | 708 1  797     11 |           | 833 174    | 488 1     | 978        | 304 2        |\n| Total                                    | 16        | 248  47  205     13 | 005 63  453       | 178       | 183 8  452 | 176 40    | 972     14 | 595 49       |\n\n- 7 Based on the closing share price of January 25, 2023 of CHF 85.30 per Novartis share and USD 92.81 per ADR for all members.\n- 8 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization).

PSUs and RSUs held by Novartis employees are not entitled to dividends. To ensure equal treatment of PSU and RSU holders relative to Novartis shareholders, Novartis granted keep whole awards to its employees, including the CEO and members and former members of the Executive Committee. This was done in accordance with the Sandoz spin-o/ff equity restoration plan as described in the 2022 Compensation Report:\n\n- \u00b7  The keep whole awards had a value similar to that of the dividend in kind that the beneficiary would have received had they been holding Novartis shares\n- \u00b7  The keep whole awards were granted in the same equity instrument (i.e., PSUs or RSUs) with the same vesting terms and performance conditions (if applicable) as the underlying award\n\nThe total value of keep whole awards granted to the active members of the Executive Committee was CHF 4 704 902. This is equivalent to the estimated reduction in the value of the Novartis share price due to the dividend in kind distribution, and as such is not considered additional compensation. The amounts realized from the vesting of keep whole awards will however be reported in the ECN realized pay for each respective year.",

Of this, CHF 8 725 507 relates to the vesting of LTI awards. In addition, contractual amounts totaling CHF 5 028 812 were made (comprising the base salary, the Annual Incentive and other benefits), and tax equalization on variable compensation granted  during  international  assignments/commuter arrangements amounted to a total of CHF 221 718. The highest paid former Executive Committee member was John Tsai, who received CHF 3 537 225 (comprising the\n\nbase salary, the Annual Incentive, realized LTI and other benefits). No other payments (or waivers of claims) were made to former Executive Committee members or to 'persons closely linked' to them during 2023.\n\n## Persons closely linked\n\n'Persons closely linked', a definition used throughout the Annual Report, are (i) their spouse or equivalent, (ii) their children (under 18 years of age), (iii) any legal entities that they own or otherwise control, and (iv) any legal or natural person who is acting as their fiduciary.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nConsistent with our '-CEO and Executive Committee compensation philosophy and system,' in 2023 there was no legal or factual basis on which to exercise malus or clawback for current or former Executive Committee members.\n\n## Award and delivery of equity to Novartis employees\n\nDuring 2023, 11.8 million unvested restricted shares (or ADRs), RSUs and target PSUs were granted, and 10.7 million Novartis vested shares (or ADRs) were delivered to Novartis employees under various equity-based participation plans. Current unvested equity instruments (restricted shares, RSUs and target PSUs) held by employees represent 0.92% of issued shares. Novartis delivers treasury shares to employees to fulfill these obligations and aims to o/ffset the dilutive impact from its equity-based participation plans.\n\n## Note 28 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements\n\nThe total expense for the year for compensation awarded to Executive Committee, using IFRS Accounting Standards measurement rules, is presented in Note 28 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements.\n\n145\n\n016\n\n749\n\n563\n\n473\n\n653\n\n653\n\n126",

The main elements of our compensation philosophy are set out in the table below.\n\n| Pay for   performance      | \u00b7  Variable compensation is tied directly to the  achievement of strategic Company targets                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholder  alignment     | \u00b7  Our incentives are significantly weighted  toward long-term equity-based plans \u00b7  Measures under the Long-Term Incentive  plans are calibrated to promote the creation  of shareholder value \u00b7  Executive Committee members are |\n| Balanced   rewards         | \u00b7  Balanced set of measures to create  sustainable value \u00b7  Mix of targets based on financial metrics,                                                                                                                             |\n| Business   ethics          | \u00b7  The Novartis Values and Behaviors are an  integral part of our compensation system \u00b7  They underpin the assessment of overall                                                                                                   |\n| Competitive   compensation | \u00b7  Total compensation must be sufficient to  attract and retain key global talent \u00b7  Overarching emphasis on pay for  performance                                                                                                  |\n\n## Alignment with Company strategy\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  focus  on  high-value,  innovative medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in R&D and novel access approaches.\n\nWe made some strategic updates to our compensation framework to ensure it remains aligned to our Company strategy and compensation philosophy, while being market competitive. Details of these changes are provided in '-2024 Executive Committee compensation system changes and increases.'\n\n## Approach to market benchmarking\n\nSignificant competition continues to exist for top executive talent with deep expertise and the requisite competencies and proven performance within the pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  industries.  For  this  reason, external peer compensation data is one of a number of key reference points considered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee when making decisions on executive pay, so as to help ensure that the compensation system and levels at Novartis remain competitive. Novartis is committed to confirming benchmarking practices, including the healthcare peer group, to shareholders on an annual basis.\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes in a rigorous approach to peer group construction and maintenance. Furthermore, it believes that using a consistent set of global peers that is similar in size and scope of the operations of Novartis enables shareholders to evaluate the compensation year on year and make pay-for-performance comparisons.\n\nAlthough Novartis is headquartered in Switzerland, more than a third of its sales come from the US market, and the US therefore represents a significant talent pool for the recruitment of executives by the Company. The Compensation Committee uses a pay comparator group of global healthcare companies to ensure that Novartis is able to attract and retain key talent globally. To ensure European and local practices are fully taken into account, the Compensation Committee also uses a cross-industry peer group of Europe-headquartered multinational companies of a similar size and scope.\n\n## GLOBAL HEALTHCARE PEER COMPANIES\n\n| AbbVie          | Amgen                | AstraZeneca       |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Biogen          | Bristol-Myers Squibb | Eli Lilly & Co.   |\n| GlaxoSmithKline | Gilead Sciences      | Johnson & Johnson |\n| Novo Nordisk    | Merck & Co.          | Pfizer            |\n| Roche           | Sanofi               |                   |\n\n## EUROPEAN PEER COMPANIES\n\n| Anheuser-Busch InBev   | L' O r \u00e9 a l      | Roche    |\n|------------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| AstraZeneca            | Merck KGaA        | Siemens  |\n| Bayer                  | Nestl\u00e9            | Sanofi   |\n| BMW                    | Novo Nordisk      | Unilever |\n| GlaxoSmithKline        | Reckitt Benckiser |          |",

This applies in cases where the payout has resulted from a violation of laws or conflicts with internal management standards, including Company and accounting policies.\n\nThis principle applies to both the short-term Annual Incentive and all long-term incentive plans.\n\nIn October 2023, the Compensation Committee adopted a no-fault compensation clawback policy ' for the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation ' to all members of the Executive Committee and certain executive o/fficers, in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, in full compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule.",

        "page_content": "## CEO and Executive Committee performance management\n\nTo foster a high-performance culture, the Company applies a performance management process based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. The CEO and the other Executive Committee members are subject to a formal threestep process, which consists of objective setting, performance evaluation and compensation determination. This process is explained in the chart below.\n\nPerformance targets are generally set before the start of the relevant performance cycle. A rigorous framework is in place for establishing targets to ensure they are suitably robust, challenging and align with the strategic priorities of the Company.\n\nThe key factors taken into account when setting targets include:\n\n- \u00b7  Internal and external market expectations\n- \u00b7  The strategic priorities of Novartis\n- \u00b7  Regulatory factors (e.g., new launches, patent expiries)\n- \u00b7  Investment in capital expenditure\n- \u00b7  Novartis Values and Behaviors\n\nThe targets are challenged at multiple stages before they are ultimately approved by the Board of Directors. In line with good governance practices, the Compensation Committee works to set targets that are ambitious and challenging but do not encourage undue risk-taking.\n\nFollowing the end of the performance cycle, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee consider performance against the targets originally set. The CEO and Executive Committee members are not present while the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee discuss their individual performance evaluations and determine their individual compensation. Prior to determining the final outcome, related factors such as performance relative to peers, wider market conditions, general industry trends and best practice are used to inform the overall performance assessment.\n\n## Objective setting\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO proposes his targets to the Board Chair; they are then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, based on input from the Compensation Committee.\n- \u00b7 For other Executive Committee members, targets for their business units or functions are initially discussed with the CEO and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO's performance against the individual balanced scorecard is assessed by the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 For Executive Committee members, the CEO discusses each member's performance (assessed against his or her individual balanced scorecard) with the Board Chair before making recommendations to the Board of Directors for final determination.\n- \u00b7 Periodic assessments, including at the mid-year stage, ensure progress is suitably tracked.\n\n## Compensation determination\n\n- \u00b7 A recommendation for the CEO's variable pay is made by the Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors for final determination.\n- \u00b7 For the LTPP financial measures' payout schedules, a formulaic approach applies, and the Compensation Committee can also exercise judgment to ensure there is appropriate alignment between payout levels and overall performance achieved. The same principle of discretion applies to the relative TSR and innovation performance measures.\n- \u00b7 The CEO's recommendations for other Executive Committee members are considered and approved by the Compensation Committee, after which the Board of Directors is notified of the outcomes.",

        "page_content": "## 2024 Executive Committee compensation system changes and increases\n\nNovartis is today a pure-play innovative medicines company with a focused strategy. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee therefore decided to make certain changes to the compensation system, in particular to reflect the ambition of Novartis to build its US business organically and become a top player in the US.\n\nIn this context, the following changes align with our compensation philosophy, and will enable Novartis to compete for talent globally (see '-Compensation philosophy'):\n\n## Annual Incentive metrics\n\nAs of the 2024 performance year, core operating income (which  includes  adjustments  for  certain  one-time/ non-recurring items such as restructuring and M&A write-downs) replaces operating income in the financial objectives of the Annual Incentive. The weighting remains at 30% of the financial objectives. The Compensation Committee decided to make this change as core operating income:\n\n- \u00b7  Is consistent with how investors and analysts measure underlying performance\n- \u00b7  Encourages executives to make bold investments with high return potential\n- \u00b7 Aligns with our global healthcare peers and the broader market, enabling more e/ffective performance comparisons\n\nA reconciliation between our core operating income and operating income will continue to be provided in '-Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects -NonIFRS measures as defined by Novartis -Reconciliation from IFRS Accounting Standards results to non-IFRS measures core results.'\n\nTo maintain strong alignment between performance and pay outcomes, the Board of Directors will retain its discretion to consider any adjustment to the Annual Incentive payout of the CEO and other Executive Committee members. Any such decisions will be disclosed in the Compensation Report.\n\n## Share ownership and Annual Incentive deferral\n\nThe CEO shareholding requirement increased from 5x to 6x the CEO's annual base salary. Increasing the CEO shareholding requirement better aligns with shareholder interests and brings Novartis in line with its global healthcare peers.\n\nThe Compensation Committee also decided to amend the portion of the Annual Incentive that is mandatorily deferred into equity to make the compensation system more competitive, particularly in markets where bonus deferrals are uncommon (such as Switzerland and US, where much of our executive talent is sourced). As of the 2024 performance year, the portion of the Annual Incentive that is mandatorily deferred into equity is reduced from 50% to 30% for all Executive Committee members, provided that their shareholding requirement is met. Compliance with their shareholding requirement must then be maintained.\n\n## CEO target compensation\n\nSince 2019, the Board of Directors has made no material increases to the CEO compensation. As a result, the CEO's target pay has fallen below the 25th percentile of global healthcare peers.\n\nGiven the competitive landscape of the industry, the Board of Directors decided to increase the CEO LTPP target from 325% to 400% of his annual base salary as from the cycle 2024-26. This represents a 15.8% increase in total target compensation and moves him out of the bottom quartile to just above the 25 th percentile of global healthcare peers, as shown in the figure below. The maximum payout for the LTPP remains at 200% of target, and there will be no change to the metrics. For this review, we used the same global healthcare companies specified in '-Approach to market benchmarking.'\n\n## Last disclosed global healthcare peer CEO target compensation (CHF millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Bottom quartile to median\n- Median to upper quartile\n\nIn making its decision, the Board of Directors was mindful of investor perspectives toward executive compensation of European companies. It therefore chose to make an increase to the LTPP target only (rather than to the base salary or Annual Incentive), which is fully performance-based (i.e. no use of restricted shares or stock options as used by many peers), to align with the Company's long term strategy. Targets will continue to be stretched as demonstrated in '-Historic CEO incentive payouts since appointment.'\n\nThe Board of Directors considered it appropriate to act now so as to:\n\n- \u00b7  Align with the Company's ambition to become a top player in the US. This requires a leader with significant knowledge and experience of the US market, and executive compensation in US peer companies is more competitive than in Europe\n- \u00b7  Proactively avoid a further decline of the pay positioning of our CEO, while providing a fair compensation system that rewards performance\n- \u00b7  Demonstrate its commitment to establishing a competitive system that promotes the retention and attraction of executive talent capable of delivering value to shareholders",

        "page_content": "## Board compensation philosophy and fee structure\n\n## Philosophy and benchmarking\n\nAligned with market practice in Switzerland, the Board of Directors sets compensation for its members at a level that allows for the attraction of high-caliber individuals, including both Swiss and international members, who have global experience.\n\nGiven their focus on corporate strategy, supervision and governance, Board members do not receive variable compensation. Each year at the AGM, shareholders are requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total compensation of the Board of Directors until the following AGM.\n\nThe Board of Directors sets the level of compensation for its Chair and the other members to be in line with relevant benchmark companies, including other large Switzerland-based multinational companies. Following the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS in 2023, the Board of Directors revised its peer benchmarking group to a larger set of companies comprising ABB, Holcim, Nestle, Richemont, Roche, SwissRe, UBS and Zurich Insurance. This peer group was chosen for Board compensation due to the comparability of Swiss legal requirements, including broad personal and individual liabilities under Swiss law (and criminal liability under Swiss rules regarding board and executive committee compensation related to the Swiss Code of Obligations), and under US law, where applicable (due to the Company's secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange). Each year, the Board of Directors reviews the compensation of its members, including the Board Chair, based on a proposal by the Compensation Committee and advice from its independent advisor, including relevant benchmarking information. To ensure independence of decision-making, the peer group used for the Board of Directors is different to that used for the Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board Chair's contract and the Board of Directors compensation policy do not provide for any termination-related payments.\n\n## Share ownership requirements for Board members\n\nTo ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders the Board Chair is required to own a minimum of 30 000 Novartis shares, and other members of the Board of Directors are required to own at least 5 000 Novartis shares within five years of having joined the Board of Directors.\n\nthat are part of their guideline share ownership requirement and are required to hold these shares for 12 months after having retired from the Board of Directors. As at December 31, 2023, all current and former members of the Board of Directors who were required to meet the minimum share ownership requirements did so.\n\n## Board fee structure\n\nThe annual fee rates for Board membership and additional functions are included in the table below. These were approved by the Board of Directors and remain unchanged from the prior term. Aggregate Board compensation is aligned with other large Swiss companies.\n\n| CHF 000s                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2023-2024 AGM  annual fee   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Board Chair                                                                                                                                                                                    | 3 800                       |\n| Board membership                                                                                                                                                                               | 280                         |\n| Vice-Chair                                                                                                                                                                                     | 50                          |\n| Lead Independent Director                                                                                                                                                                      | 20                          |\n| Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee                                                                                                                                                    | 130                         |\n| Chair of the Compensation Committee                                                                                                                                                            | 90                          |\n| Chair of the following committees:  \u00b7  Governance, Nomination and   Corporate Responsibilities Committee  \u00b7  Science & Technology Committee  \u00b7  Risk Committee                                 | 70                          |\n| Membership of the Audit   and Compliance Committee                                                                                                                                             | 70                          |\n| Membership of the following committees:  \u00b7  Compensation Committee  \u00b7  Governance, Nomination and   Corporate Responsibilities Committee  \u00b7  Science & Technology Committee  \u00b7  Risk Committee | 40                          |\n\nIn addition, the following policies apply regarding Board compensation:\n\n- \u00b7  50% of compensation is delivered in cash, paid on a quarterly basis in arrears.

This Annual Report fulfills that requirement in addition to being in line with the principles of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse). For more information, see '-Corporate Governance' in Section 6C of this Report.\n\n## Compensation decision-making authorities\n\nAuthority for decisions related to compensation is governed by the Articles of Incorporation, Board Regulations and the Compensation Committee Charter, which are all published on the Company website: www.novartis.com/ investors/company-overview/corporate-governance. The Compensation Committee serves as the supervisory and governing body for compensation policies and plans within Novartis, and has overall responsibility for determining, reviewing and proposing compensation policies and plans for approval by the Board of Directors in line with the Compensation Committee Charter. The discussions and conclusions of each committee meeting are delivered to the full Board of Directors. A summary of the compensation decision-making authorities is set out below.\n\n## Approval process for key compensation decisions\n\n|                                                                                 | CEO   | Compensation   Committee   | Board   Chair   | Board of   Directors   | AGM               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Executive Compensation                                                          |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| CEO                                                                             |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| Performance target setting and assessment                                       |       |                            | O               | T                      |                   |\n| Individual compensation                                                         |       | O                          |                 | T                      |                   |\n| Other EC members                                                                |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| Performance target setting and assessment                                       | O     |                            | T               |                        |                   |\n| Individual compensation                                                         | O     | T                          |                 |                        |                   |\n| All  Executive Committee                                                        |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| Maximum aggregate amount of fixed and     variable long-term compensation       |       | O                          |                 | T                      | Binding Vote      |\n| Board Compensation                                                              |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| Board of Directors                                                              |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| Fee structure for individual roles on the Board of Directors                    |       | O                          |                 | T                      |                   |\n| Maximum aggregate amount of compensation     for the next term of o/ffice       |       | O                          |                 | T                      | Binding Vote      |\n| Other                                                                           |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| Board members, Executive Committee and other employees                          |       |                            |                 |                        |                   |\n| Compensation report                                                             |       | O                          |                 | T                      | Consultative Vote |\n| Compensation policy and principles                                              |       | O                          |                 | T                      |                   |\n| Variable short-term and long-term compensation     payout factors for the Group |       | O                          |                 | T                      |                   |\n\n- O Propose T Endorse T Approve",

From the 2023 AGM, the Compensation Committee consisted of the following four members: Simon Moroney (as Chair), Patrice Bula, Bridgette Heller, and William Winters.\n\n## Role of the Compensation Committee's independent advisor\n\nThe independent external compensation advisor supports the Compensation Committee in determining the design and implementation of compensation and benefits.\n\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee retained Mitul Shah of Deloitte LLP, who was appointed in July 2022, as its independent compensation advisor. The independent advisor from Deloitte LLP and his respective team that advised and supported the Compensation Committee are not responsible or rewarded for work on senior compensation beyond support provided to the Compensation Committee and the People & Organization function.\n\n## Meetings held in 2023 and self-evaluation\n\n## Risk management principles\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with support from its independent advisor, reviews market trends in compensation, and changes in corporate governance rules and best practices. Together with the Risk Committee, it also reviews the Novartis compensation systems to ensure that they do not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, and instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation. A summary of the risk management principles is outlined below.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n\n- \u00b7  Rigorous performance management process, with approval of targets and evaluation of performance of the CEO by the Board of Directors\n- \u00b7  Balanced mix of short-term and long-term variable compensation elements\n- \u00b7  Novartis Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture\n- \u00b7  Clawback and malus principles apply to all elements of the variable compensation\n- \u00b7  Performance-vesting LongTerm Incentives only, with three-year cycles\n- \u00b7  All variable compensation is capped at 200% of target\n- \u00b7  Contractual notice period of 12 months\n\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee held six formal meetings. For the approval of the Board of Directors, in line with prior years, it collaborated with the Science & Technology Committee to review and endorse the innovation targets and achievements of the Annual Incentive and LTPP. The Compensation Committee will conduct a self-evaluation in 2024.\n\n- \u00b7  Post-contractual non-compete period is limited to a maximum of 12 months from the end of employment. Resulting compensation, if applicable, will not exceed the average annual compensation (annual base salary plus Annual Incentive) of the previous three financial years\n- \u00b7  Good and bad leaver provisions apply to variable  compensation of leavers\n- \u00b7  No severance payments or change-of-control clauses\n- \u00b7  Share ownership requirements; no hedging or pledging of Novartis share ownership\n- \u00b7  No loans granted to current or former members of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors or to 'Persons closely linked' to them",

The audit was limited to the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) namely the tables 'Realized compensation for the CEO and Executive Committee (2023 compared with 2022)' on page 97, 'Compensation at grant value for the CEO and Executive Committee (2023 compared with 2022)' on page 99, 'Number of equity instruments granted to the CEO and Executive Committee (2023 compared with 2022)' on page 100 and sections 'Additional disclosures and other statutory information' (CEO and ECN) on pages 100-101, as well as the 'Board compensation' on page 110-111 and 'Additional disclosures and other statutory information' (BoD) on page 111 of the Compensation Report of Novartis AG for the year ended December 31, 2023, hereinafter referred to as 'disclosures made on the pages defined as subject to audit'.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  information  pursuant  to  Art. 734a-734f CO in the accompanying Compensation Report complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables and disclosures in the Compensation Report mentioned in the 'Opinion' paragraph of this report, the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Compensation Report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Compensation Report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the audited financial information in the Compensation Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Compensation Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a Compensation Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the compensation system and defining individual compensation packages.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Compensation Report.",

While the Board Chair, CEO and CFO, together with Investor Relations, are accountable for ensuring e/ffective shareholder engagement, other senior managers from within and outside the Executive Committee also participate in the meetings. We conduct regular outreach to investors throughout the year.\n\n## TYPES OF ENGAGEMENTS (SELECT EXAMPLES):\n\n- \u00b7 AGM and quarterly results teleconferences (TCs)\n- \u00b7  Bank conferences and management roadshows\n- \u00b7  'Meet Novartis Management' and 'R&D day' capital markets event\n- \u00b7  Governance roadshow and TCs\n- \u00b7  Board Chair's meetings with Swiss, US and UK investors\n- \u00b7  Annual ESG investor event, captioned 'Impact and Health Equity'\n- \u00b7  Sandoz spin-o/ff EGM\n\n## TOPICS DISCUSSED WITH SHAREHOLDERS DURING 2023:\n\n## GROWTH:\n\n- \u00b7  Replacement power\n- \u00b7  Growth drivers (including Cosentyx, Entresto, Kisqali, Kesimpta and Pluvicto)\n- \u00b7  Policy and pricing environment\n- \u00b7  Life cycle management\n\n## INNOVATION:\n\n- \u00b7  Progress and milestones\n- \u00b7  Data of pipeline projects\n- \u00b7  Return on R&D investments\n\n## PRODUCTIVITY:\n\n- \u00b7  Progress on financial, strategic and operational performance\n- \u00b7  Long-term sustainability of financial performance\n- \u00b7  Capital allocation strategy\n- \u00b7  New organization model\n- \u00b7  Sandoz spin-o/ff\n\n## BUILDING TRUST WITH SOCIETY AND CULTURE:\n\n- \u00b7  Board accountability on ESG, and integration of ESG and compensation\n- \u00b7  Strong governance, enhanced process and focus on material ESG factors, leading to improved rating agency scores\n- \u00b7  Patient access to innovative medicines\n- \u00b7  Learning from Novartis Access programs implemented over the decades, including integrated sustainable business models and access principles to help address access and health inequity\n- \u00b7  ESG targets: full carbon neutrality, patient access targets for strategic innovative therapies, and global health flagship programs\n- \u00b7  Progress on culture and other human capital metrics\n\n## COMPENSATION AND GOVERNANCE:\n\n- \u00b7  Diversity of the Board, the Executive Committee, and the Company\n- \u00b7  Board renewal, succession planning and evaluation\n- \u00b7  The linking of the compensation system to key strategic priorities\n- \u00b7  Risk oversight\n- \u00b7  Stakeholder expectations from the Board on ESG matters\n\n## Voting rights, restrictions and representation\n\n## REGISTRATION\n\nShareholders have the right to vote and to execute all other rights as granted under Swiss law and the Articles of Incorporation (see, in particular, articles 17 and 18 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nEach share registered with the right to vote by the third business day before the General Meeting entitles the holder to one vote at General Meetings. Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that to be registered with voting rights, shareholders must declare that they acquired the shares in their own name and for their own account. According to article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board may register nominees with the right to vote. The Share Register is a non-public register subject to statutory confidentiality and data privacy.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance.\n\n## REGISTRATION RESTRICTIONS\n\nArticle 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 2% of the share capital. Given that shareholder representation at General Meetings has traditionally been comparatively low in Switzerland, Novartis AG considers registration restrictions necessary to prevent a minority shareholder from dominating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption. Considerations include if the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions are in force for the registered shareholders listed in '-Item 6.C Board practices-Group structure and shareholdersShareholders-Significant shareholders.' Exemptions also apply to the Novartis Foundation for Employee Participation, Basel, which as of December 31, 2023, was registered in the Share Register with less than 2% of the share capital, and to Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, which as of December 31, 2023, was not registered but held 2.4% according to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG. No further exemptions were requested in 2023. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.\n\nArticle 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the registered share capital. Exemptions are in force for the nominees listed in '-Item 6.C Board practices-Group structure and shareholders-Shareholders-Significant shareholders,' and for the nominee Citibank, London, which in 2015 requested an exemption, but as of December 31, 2023, was not registered in the Share Register. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.\n\nAccording to article 5, paragraph 4 of the Articles of Incorporation, shareholders, ADR holders, or nominees who are linked to each other or who act in concert to circumvent",

        "page_content": "registration restrictions are treated as one person or nominee for the purposes of the restrictions on registration.\n\nThe registration restrictions may be changed by resolution of the General Meeting, with approval of at least two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance.\n\n## ATTENDANCE, REPRESENTATION AND WEB PORTAL\n\nRegistered shareholders will receive personal invitations to the General Meetings along with a registration/ proxy form as well as a personal access code and a QR code to log in to our web portal. By  returning the registration/proxy form or using the web portal, shareholders can order an admission ticket for the General Meeting or appoint a representative of their choice by means of a written proxy or the Independent Proxy to vote their shares on their behalf.\n\nIf the Independent Proxy is appointed, shareholders can also give voting instructions on agenda items or on alternative or additional motions related to the agenda items either (i) following the recommendations of the Board for such alternative or additional motions; or (ii) opposing such alternative or additional motions. They can also abstain from voting.\n\nShareholders choosing not to receive the comprehensive invitation materials will be informed of upcoming General Meetings through a letter containing the login credentials to access the web portal as well as a reference to www.novartis.com/investors/shareholder-information/general-meetings, where all relevant information is available.\n\n## ADR HOLDERS\n\nADR holders have the rights enumerated in the deposit agreement (such as the right to give voting instructions and to receive dividends). The ADS depositary of Novartis AG - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York holds the shares underlying the ADRs and is registered as a shareholder in the Share Register. An ADR is not a share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder. Each ADR represents one share. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing the depositary to exercise their voting rights. The ADS depositary exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder.\n\n## Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\n## CONVENING\n\nThe AGM must be held within six months of the end of our financial year (December 31), and normally takes place in late February or early March. According to article 12a of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/ company-overview/corporate-governance), the Board may foresee that shareholders who cannot be present at the venue of the AGM may exercise their rights through electronic means. The Board may at any time until June 30, 2028 1 also order that the AGM be held electronically without a venue. Extraordinary General Meetings may be requested by the Board, the external auditor, or shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital.\n\n## AGENDA\n\nShareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1 million may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. Such requests must be made in writing at least 45 days before the meeting, specifying the requested item and proposal. If an explanatory statement is to be included in the notice of meeting, it must be submitted within the same period, and formulated in a short, clear and concise manner.\n\n## POWERS\n\nAccording to article 17 of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance), the following powers are vested exclusively in the General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption and amendment of the Articles of Incorporation\n- \u00b7  Election and removal of the Board Chair, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor\n- \u00b7  Approval of the management report, the consolidated financial statements and the report on non-financial matters\n- \u00b7  Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and the decision on the appropriation of available earnings shown on the balance sheet, in particular with regard to dividends (including any repayment of the statutory capital reserves and the approval of interim dividends and the interim financial statements required for such purpose)\n- \u00b7  Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM). If the maximum aggregate amount of compensation already approved by the AGM is not su/fficient to cover the compensation of newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members, Novartis may use up to 40% of the amount last approved for the newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members\n- \u00b7  Discharge of Board and Executive Committee members\n- \u00b7  Delisting of the shares of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles of Incorporation (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting\n- 1  In accordance with the statement by the Board issued on February 10, 2023, Novartis commits to submitting the corresponding authorization again to a shareholder vote at the 2025 Annual General Meeting, regardless of the time limitation stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation.",

Andreas von Planta, who had been a Board member since 2006, did not stand for re-election at the 2023 AGM. The biography of Mr. von Planta can be found in the 2022 Annual Report (page 136), which is available at www.novartis.com/news/media-library/novartis-annual-report-2022.\n\n## Election and term of o/ffice\n\nBoard members (including the Board Chair) and Compensation Committee members are elected individually by shareholders at the General Meeting for a one-year term of o/ffice. The term of o/ffice expires at the end of the next AGM.\n\nAccording to article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, a member shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. Under special circumstances and if deemed to be in the best interest of the Company, the Board may recommend exceptions to the shareholders (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance).\n\nSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE\n\n- J. Reinhardt (Chair)\n- N. Andrews\n- F. van Houten\n- S. Moroney\n- C. Sawyers\n- J. Young\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe GSNC prepares and reviews succession plans for the Board on an annual basis. These plans are discussed by the Board in private meetings. A search for a new Board member is launched - normally with the support of a professional executive search company - with individual selection criteria defined based on the evolving needs of the Company and a continuing focus on diversity, skills and experience. The set of competencies (further explained in '-Item 6.C Board practices-Board of Directors-Board skills') and a balance between continuity of experience and fresh perspectives are also important criteria for the GSNC when evaluating new candidates. Candidates are interviewed by the Board Chair, members of the GSNC, other Board members, and members of the Executive Committee. The GSNC then makes a recommendation to the full Board, and the Board ultimately decides who should be proposed for election at the upcoming AGM.\n\nThe term limit supports our commitment to renew the Board on an ongoing basis and follows international best practice. We believe age is still a  relevant factor in Board composition, and the GSNC will consider this and other factors - including gender, nationality and ethnicity when evaluating candidates and exploring ways to increase Board diversity.\n\n- D.

In particular, no Board member is or was a member of the management of Novartis AG or of any other Novartis Group company in the last three financial years up to December 31, 2023, or has or had, a significant business relationship with Novartis AG or with any other Novartis Group company. No separate meetings of independent Board  members were held in 2023.\n\nThe independence of Board members is assessed annually. Each Board member completes an independence questionnaire that is reviewed by the GSNC. The GSNC then submits a proposal to the full Board, and the Board determines the independence status of each Board member.\n\nEXECUTIVE/NON-EXECUTIVE GENDER EXECUTIVE/NON-EXECUTIVE Novartis is dedicated to fostering an inclusive board where individuals from all genders and ethnic backgrounds can thrive and contribute their unique insights. We pledge to continuously advance our e/fforts to promote gender parity in the composition of our Board of Directors within a range of +/- 10 %.  A diverse Board ensures that the appropriate balance of skills, expertise, experience and cultural background is represented to discharge its responsibilities and to support long-term value creation for shareholders, patients, employees and other stakeholders. Diversity remains a critical focus area for the Board, and the GSNC continuously examines opportunities to further increase the Board's diversity when identifying new Board member candidates. We firmly believe that by valuing and respecting these di/fferences, we can drive innovation and make more informed decisions and better serve our stakeholders.\n\n## Diversity profile\n\nNATIONALITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNATIONALITY\n\n- 1 Please note that six Board members have dual nationalities.

Within this set of competencies, the Board members were asked to identify their most relevant skills based on their educational background, professional experience and personal achievements.\n\nThe GSNC assesses the set of competencies as well as the individual skills annually to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills, expertise, experience and diversity is represented on the Board.\n\nTENURE\n\nTENURE\n\n## Board skill distribution\n\n| Medicine/healthcare/R&D                      | 54%  7/13   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Environmental, social   and governance (ESG) | 61%  8/13   |\n| Data/digital                                 | 38%  5/13   |\n| Leadership/management                        | 85%  11/13  |\n| Finance/accounting                           | 61%  8/13   |\n| Law/regulatory/risk management               | 77%  10/13  |\n\nTo learn more about our Board members and their individual skills, see '-Item 6.C Board practices-Board of Directors-Members of the Board of Directors.'\n\nINDEPEN\n\nINDEPENDEN",

        "page_content": "## Self-assessment\n\nThe Board and its committees conduct a self-assessment once a year, covering topics including Board composition, purpose, scope and responsibilities; succession planning; Board processes and governance; interaction between the Board and the Executive Committee; Board meetings and pre-reading material; team e/ffectiveness; and Board Chair\n\nand peer evaluation. Every third year, this process is conducted by an independent external consultant. The 2023 review is currently being undertaken by the consulting firm Egon Zehnder. Its results will be discussed during the second quarter of 2024.\n\n## Questionnaire and Interviews\n\n- \u00b7  Each Board member fills out a questionnaire prepared by Egon Zehnder.\n- \u00b7  Individual interviews are scheduled, during which Board members have the opportunity to share their perspectives on their strengths and areas for development, best practices, and interaction between Board members, and between the Board and the Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7  The Executive Committee members are also interviewed individually to capture their perspectives on the Board's functioning and its interactions with the Executive Committee, including focusing on ways to improve efficiency.\n\n## Review\n\n- \u00b7  The preliminary results of the questionnaires and interviews are then presented to the Board Chair. This qualitative review covers topics including Board composition; purpose, scope and responsibilities; processes and governance of the Board and its committees; meetings and pre-reading material; team effectiveness; and leadership and culture.\n\n## Outcome\n\n- \u00b7  The results of the in-depth 2023 assessment will be discussed during a Board Meeting in the first half of 2024.\n- \u00b7  Conclusions and results will be shared in the Annual Report 2024.\n- \u00b7  Thereafter, Egon Zehnder also undertakes a qualitative review with the full Board, sharing its key observations and recommendations, and holds additional individual feedback sessions with each Board member.\n\n## Trainings\n\n## Role of the Board and its committees\n\nThe Board receives regular briefings and trainings on ethics, risks and compliance, ESG and other relevant topics. In 2023, each Board member completed trainings on the following:\n\n- \u00b7  ESG, tailored for Board members\n- \u00b7  Doing business ethically\n- \u00b7  'Fit to Commit', which focused on anti-bribery, insider trading and procurement\n- \u00b7  Information Management\n\nOur Chief Legal O/fficer also provides regular updates to the Board members on developments related to insider trading laws and regulations and briefs the members of the Board and the Executive Committee on an annual basis on their respective duties. In addition, the Company o/ffers a broad range of external trainings to its Board members.\n\nThe Board is responsible for the overall direction and oversight of management, and holds the ultimate decision-making authority, with the exception of decisions reserved for shareholders. Board members are expected to commit the time and e/ffort required to fulfil all their Board and committee responsibilities.\n\nThe Board has delegated certain duties and responsibilities to its five committees led by a Board-elected committee chair, as set out in the Board Regulations (www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance). In some cases, these responsibilities are of an advisory or preparatory nature. In other cases, the committee has decision-making power that is subject to final Board approval, or the responsibilities have been fully delegated to the committee. All committees have the authority to retain external consultants.\n\nAny Board member may request a Board or committee meeting and the inclusion of an agenda item. Before meetings, Board members receive materials to help them prepare for the discussions and to inform decision-making.",

Controls and Procedures').\n\n## Information from senior management\n\nThe Board ensures that it receives su/fficient information from the Executive Committee through:\n\n- \u00b7  Monthly CEO reporting (encompassing progress against company targets, including financial results) and frequent communications from the CEO on current developments\n- \u00b7  Executive Committee meeting minutes\n- \u00b7  Regular meetings and teleconferences by the Board and/or Board committees with the CEO and/or other members of the Executive Committee (e.g., the CFO, the Chief Legal O/fficer, the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer), and regular meetings and teleconferences with senior management (e.g., the Chief Audit O/fficer)\n- \u00b7  Information from Executive Committee members or other Novartis employees, and visits to Novartis sites To obtain an outside view, the Board and/or Board committees occasionally invite external advisors (e.g., the independent advisor of the Compensation Committee, the external auditor) to attend a meeting and/or share their observations about a specific topic.\n\n## Monthly financial reports\n\nNovartis produces comprehensive, consolidated (unaudited) financial statements on a monthly basis for the Company. These are typically available within 10 days after the end of the month, and include the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Consolidated income statement of the month and year to date, in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, as well as adjustments to arrive at non-IFRS measures core results, as defined by Novartis (see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.A Operating results-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis'). The IFRS Accounting Standards and nonIFRS measures core figures are compared with the prior-year period and targets in both USD and on a constant currency basis.\n- \u00b7  Supplementary data on a monthly and year-to-date basis, such as free cash flow and earnings per share on a USD basis\n\nManagement information related to the consolidated income statements and free cash flow is made available to Board members through the monthly CEO Report, which includes an analysis of key deviations from the prior year or target.\n\nPrior to the release of each quarter's results, the Board receives the actual consolidated financial statement information and an outlook of the full-year results in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and non-IFRS measures core results (as defined by Novartis), together with related commentary.\n\nAnnually, during the third quarter, the Board approves the Company's strategic plan for the next three years. In the fourth quarter of the year, the Board approves the operating targets for the following year as well as the financial targets for the following three-year period, including a projected consolidated income statement in USD prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis (core results).\n\nThe Board does not have direct access to the Novartis financial and management reporting systems but can, at any time, request more detailed information.",

Our Board has ultimate oversight of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system and regularly reviews the most significant risks and how these risks are managed. As explained further below, the Board is supported by its committees. Furthermore, our Internal Audit function provides an independent evaluation of risk management (see '-Item 6.C Board practices-Information and control systems-Internal Audit').\n\n## BOARD COMMITTEES\n\n## RISK COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Oversees the risk management system and processes\n- \u00b7  Reviews, together with management, the prioritization and handling of risks, the risk portfolio, and actions implemented by management\n- \u00b7  Performs deep dives into key risk areas and fosters a culture of smart risk-taking\n- \u00b7  Receives updates on cyber security on an annual basis\n- \u00b7  Receives regular updates from designated risk owners as well as the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer and/or the Head of Risk & Resilience\n\n## AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Ensures that Internal Audit plans are aligned with key risks, and that the function provides independent assurance and insights around these risks\n- \u00b7  Works closely with the Risk Committee to minimize gaps in risk coverage\n- \u00b7  Receives a semiannual presentation from the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer\n- \u00b7  Receives a quarterly presentation from the Chief Audit O/fficer on progress achieved in implementing the risk-based audit plan, and key insights about audit and advisory activities\n- \u00b7  Pays particular attention to financial risk\n- \u00b7  Has closed sessions with the Chief Audit O/fficer and, upon request, with the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer\n\n## COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Works closely with the Risk Committee to ensure that the compensation system does not lead to excessive risk-taking (see '-Item 6.B Compensation-Compensation governanceRisk management principles')\n\n## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF NOVARTIS\n\n- \u00b7  Regularly assesses risks and fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line with the Novartis Values and Behaviors and the Novartis Code of Ethics\n\n## ETHICS, RISK & COMPLIANCE\n\n- \u00b7  Governs the Novartis Code of Ethics\n- \u00b7  Provides an integrated ERM framework (which is further described in the following section)\n- \u00b7  Governs the global compliance program within Novartis\n- \u00b7  Administers the Enterprise Policy Management and global Internal Controls framework\n\n## SENIOR LEADERS OF ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS AND GLOBAL FUNCTIONS, AT ALL LEVELS\n\n- \u00b7  Provide appropriate risk management within their area of responsibility\n- \u00b7  Establish adequate risk prevention and mitigation strategies when risk exposure is identified, including tracking progress and providing resources for possible actions\n- \u00b7  Assess emerging risks, trends and overall exposure as part of the ERM process\n\nThe Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) function provides an integrated ERM framework to obtain a holistic view of Company risks and drive a culture of smart risk-taking. Under the leadership of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer, the Risk & Resilience team is responsible for the overall ERM process. This process covers, but is not limited to, risks associated with:\n\n- \u00b7  The research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of products\n- \u00b7  Finance, taxes, intellectual property, compliance with law and regulations, security, product safety, technology, human resources, and health, safety and environmental protection\n- \u00b7  Business objectives and strategies, including mergers and acquisitions\n- \u00b7  External factors such as the social, political and economic environment\n\nThe ERM process continued to evolve in 2023. The Risk & Resilience team conducted risk workshops and collaborated with all risk assurance and monitoring functions to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis unit organized a focused risk workshop including leadership team members. In parallel, risk workshops were held in top countries by revenue and in certain focus markets. Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to address them in an e/ffective way. The findings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Compass, which enables senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corporate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.\n\nIn 2023, we further matured our ERM framework within the Novartis Risk & Resilience organization and developed additional risk management trainings and our risk intelligence forum, an event that brought together internal and external speakers to address emerging trends and threats. We also integrated a critical scope of activities (Health, Safety and Environment environmental remediation) into the Risk & Resilience department. Furthermore, the Enterprise Policy & Internal Control team is progressing as planned to create a holistic framework by linking process governance with policies and controls and the Central Monitoring Coordination team is expanding its scope to ensure a harmonized and coordinated monitoring process across the Company.\n\n## SpeakUp O/ffice\n\nOur SpeakUp O/ffice provides a safe place for employees to report potential misconduct, including the option to do so anonymously.\n\n## Global Security\n\nGlobal Security proactively collects and shares threat intelligence to protect Novartis from situations that may compromise the safety of people, products and assets, and/or the reputation of our organization. Global Security protects patients from counterfeit products and, as part of the SpeakUp process, performs fair and timely investigations into high-risk cases of alleged internal misconduct. It also provides personal security advice and support for Novartis executives and other employees with the utmost discretion.",

The Chief Audit O/fficer meets with the ACC at least once a quarter and confirms the organizational independence of the Internal Audit function to the ACC on an annual basis.\n\nIn 2023, our Internal Audit function executed a riskbased audit plan and reported the results to the audited units, the Executive Committee and the ACC. Audit findings and action plans are stored and monitored in a single location to enable e/fficient and e/ffective follow-up. The following outlines the number of audits and advisories performed in 2023, and key methodology steps when managing the Internal Audit cycle.\n\n## 2023 INTERNAL AUDIT ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAUDITS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADVISORIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal Audit cycle methodology includes:\n\n- 3 Planning: Monitoring and information gathering via continuous risk assessment based on data analytics, business interviews and quarterly calibration of the audit plan.

Due to methodology redesign and tool development, the internal audit function's engagement volume was impacted as associates were actively involved in those projects.",

KPMG commenced its auditing mandate for Novartis in 2022. Richard Broadbelt, Auditor in charge, and Heidi BroomHirst, Global Audit Partner, began serving in their roles in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The ACC together with KPMG will ensure that these partners are rotated at least every five years.\n\n## Auditing fees and additional fees\n\nThe ACC monitors and preapproves the fees paid to the external auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It has developed and approved a policy with clear guidelines on the engagement of the independent auditor firm. This policy is designed to help ensure that the independence of the external auditor is maintained. It limits the scope of services that the external auditor may provide to the Company, stipulating certain permissible types of audit-related and non-audit services, including tax services and other services that have been preapproved by the ACC. The ACC preapproves all other services on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe external auditor is required to report periodically to the ACC about the scope of the services it has provided to the Company and the fees for the services it has performed to date. KPMG fees for professional services related to the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, are as follows:\n\n|                        |   2023 USD million |   2022 USD million |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Audit services         |               26.8 |               22.5 |\n| Audit-related services |                2.5 |                0.7 |\n| Tax services           |                0.3 |                1.2 |\n| Other services         |                0   |                0   |\n| Total                  |               29.6 |               24.4 |\n\nAudit services include work performed to issue opinions on consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of Novartis AG, to issue opinions related to the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and to issue reports on local statutory financial statements. Also included are audit services that can generally only be provided by the statutory auditor, such as the audits of the Compensation Report, special purpose financial statement in connection with divestment transactions, information systems and the related control environment; and reviews of quarterly financial results.\n\nAudit-related services include other assurance services provided by the independent auditor but not restricted to those that can only be provided by the statutory auditor. They include services such as: the limited assurance over the Novartis in Society Integrated Report, audits of pension and other employee benefit plans; audits in connection with non-recurring transactions; contract audits of third-party arrangements; corporate responsibility assurance; and other audit-related services.\n\nTax services include tax compliance, assistance with historical tax matters, and other tax-related services.\n\nOther services in 2023 included procedures related to company specific training on emerging topics, benchmarking studies, and license fees for use of accounting and other reporting guidance databases.\n\n## Information to the Board and the ACC\n\nThe ACC, acting on behalf of the Board, is responsible for overseeing the activities of the external auditor. In 2023, this committee held seven meetings. KPMG was invited to all of these meetings to attend the discussions on auditing matters and any other matters relevant to its audit.\n\nThe ACC recommended to the Board to approve the audited consolidated financial statements and the separate parent company financial statements of Novartis AG for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Board proposed the acceptance of these financial statements for approval by the shareholders at the next AGM.\n\nThe ACC regularly evaluates the performance of the external auditor and, based on this, once a year determines whether the external auditor should be proposed to the shareholders for re-election. To assess the performance of the external auditor, the ACC requests input from management and holds private meetings with the CFO and the Chief Audit O/fficer and, if necessary, obtains an independent external assessment. Criteria applied for the performance assessment of the external auditor include an evaluation of: its technical and operational competence; its independence and objectivity; the sufficiency of the resources it has employed; its focus on areas of significant risk to Novartis; its willingness to probe and challenge; its ability to provide e/ffective, practical recommendations; and the openness and e/ffectiveness of its communications and coordination with the ACC, the Internal Audit function and management.\n\nOnce a year, the Auditor in charge and the Global Audit Partner report to the Board on the external auditor's activities during the current year, and on the audit plan for the coming year.\n\nOn an annual basis, the external auditor provides the ACC with written disclosures required by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the committee and the external auditor discuss the external auditor's independence from Novartis.",

As of December 31, 2023, Novartis had approximately 183 000 shareholders listed in the Share Register of Novartis, representing approximately 56.8% of issued shares. Based on the Novartis Share Register and excluding treasury shares, approximately 54.6% of the shares registered by name were held in Switzerland, and approximately 24.7% were held in the US. Approximately 20.0% of the shares registered in the Share Register were held by individual investors, while approximately 41.7% were held by legal entities, excluding 10.2% of our share capital held as treasury shares by Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries (including Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis AG), and 38.3% were held by nominees, fiduciaries and the ADS depositary. Due to a change in Swiss corporate law, as of January 1, 2023, Novartis ordinary shares held by Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis AG (Foundation Shares) no longer carry the right to vote. As a result, these Foundation Shares are excluded from the\n\ncalculation of the shares registered in the Share Register in the same way, as described above, that our treasury shares are excluded.\n\nBased on the Share Register, we believe that we are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or government, or by any other natural or legal persons. There are no arrangements that may result in a change of control.\n\nThe tables below set forth information with respect to our major shareholders according to the Share Register as of December 31, 2023, excluding 10.2% of our share capital held as treasury shares by Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries (including Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis AG). The following registered shareholders (including nominees and the ADS depositary) held more than 2% of the total share capital of Novartis with the right to vote all their Novartis shares based on an exemption granted by the Board of Directors:\n\n|                                                          |                                                        | % of respective share capital

If approved by our shareholders at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting, the dividends will be payable shortly following such approval. Any shareholder who purchases our shares before the ex-dividend date and holds the shares until that date shall be deemed to be entitled to receive the dividends approved at that meeting. Dividends are reflected in our financial statements in the year in which they are approved by our shareholders.\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay a growing annual dividend in Swiss francs per share. This policy is subject to our financial conditions and outlook at the time, the results of our operations, and other factors.\n\nThe Board will propose a dividend of CHF 3.30 per share to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on March 5, 2024.

To help us fulfill this mission, we have for many years maintained two representative o/ffices located in Iran.\n\nAs of October 18, 2010, a non-US Novartis a/ffiliate entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pursuant to the MoU, the Iranian Ministry of Health acknowledges certain benefits that may apply to sales of certain of our medicines by third-party distributors in Iran. These include fast-track registration, market exclusivity, end-user subsidies, and exemptions from customs tari/ffs. Novartis receives no\n\n## 8.B Significant changes\n\nNone.\n\npayments from the Iranian Ministry of Health under the MoU, and the MoU creates no obligations on the part of either Novartis or the Iranian Ministry of Health.\n\nFrom time to time, including in 2023, certain Novartis non-US a/ffiliates made payments to government entities in Iran related to patents, trademarks, exit fees and other transactions ordinarily incident to travel by doctors and other medical professionals resident in Iran to attend conferences or other events outside Iran.\n\nFrom time to time, including in 2023, certain Novartis non-US a/ffiliates enter into agreements with hospitals, research institutes, medical associations and universities in Iran to provide grants and sponsor congresses, seminars and symposia, and with doctors and other healthcare professionals for consulting services, including participation in advisory boards and investigator services  for  observational  (non-interventional)  studies. Some hospitals and research institutes are owned or controlled by the government of Iran, and some doctors and healthcare professionals are employed by hospitals that may be public or government-owned.\n\nBecause we have operations in Iran, including employees, we obtain services and have other dealings incidental to our activities in that country, including paying taxes and salaries either directly or indirectly through a service provider, and obtaining o/ffice rentals, insurance, electricity,  water  and  telecommunications  services, o/ffice and similar supplies, and customs-related services from Iranian companies that may be owned or controlled by the government of Iran. In addition, from time to time, representatives of our non-US a/ffiliates participate in meetings with Iranian o/fficials to discuss issues relevant to our business and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nCertain  Novartis  non-US  a/ffiliates  maintain  local accounts at banks that are, as of November 5, 2018, on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). These non-US a/ffiliates make local transactions for employee payroll and local vendor payment purposes. These transactions are conducted for the purpose of facilitating the provision of medicine to Iran, in line with the humanitarian exceptions contained in Section 11 of Executive Order 13902 and other applicable sanctions legal authorities. No transactions are made with an Iranian financial institution designated on the SDN List in connection with Iran's support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",

Additional Information\n\n## 10.A Share capital\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## 10.B Memorandum and articles of association\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation ('Articles'); our Regulations of the Board, the Board Committees and the Executive Committee ('Board Regulations'); and Swiss law, particularly the Swiss Code of Obligations ('Swiss CO'), and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and the Board Regulations, which are an exhibit to this Form 20-F, and to Swiss law.\n\n## 10.B.1 Company purpose\n\nNovartis AG is registered in the commercial register of the canton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland, under number CHE-103.867.266. Our business purpose, as stated in Article 2 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises in the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold interests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemistry, physics, information technology or related areas. We may acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and intellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In pursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sustainable value.\n\n## 10.B.2 Directors\n\nAccording  to  our  Articles,  the  Board  of  Directors ('Board') consists of a minimum of eight and a maximum of 16 members. The members of the Board (including the Board Chair) are elected individually by the General Meeting of Shareholders ('General Meeting') for a oneyear term of o/ffice lasting until the completion of the next Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ('AGM').\n\n- (a)  A Board resolution requires the a/ffirmative majority of the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations, a member of our Board ('Director') may not participate in decisions and resolutions on matters that a/ffect, or reasonably might a/ffect, the Director's interests or the interests of a person close to the Director (but the Director may participate in the discussion).\n- (b) Compensation of the Directors is subject to the approval of the aggregate amounts of such compensation by a shareholders' resolution under the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Public Companies of the Swiss Federal Council.\n- (c) The Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits to Directors.\n- (d)  The Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. The Board may, under certain circumstances and if deemed in the best interests of the Company, recommend exceptions to this rule to the General Meeting.\n- (e) Our Directors are not required to be shareholders at the time of the election by the General Meeting. However, according to our share ownership guidelines, to ensure their interests are aligned with those of our shareholders, the Board Chair is required to own a minimum of 30 000 Novartis AG shares, and other Directors are required to own at least 5 000 Novartis AG shares within five years of having joined the Board.\n\n## 10.B.3 Shareholder rights\n\nBecause Novartis AG has only one class of registered shares, the following information applies to all shareholders.\n\n- (a) Under the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out of  balance  sheet  profits  or  out  of  distributable reserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the Board may propose that a dividend be paid, we may only pay dividends upon shareholders' approval at a General Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires us to accrue general legal reserves under certain circumstances so long as these reserves amount to less than 20% of our registered share capital, and Swiss law and the Articles permit us to accrue additional reserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors must confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board conforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our Board expects to recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of each financial year. See 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item 6.C Board Practices-Capital Structure-Limitation on  transferability-Per-share  information'  and 'Item  8.  Financial Information-Item  8.A. Consolidated statements and other financial informationDividend policy.'\n\nDividends are usually due and payable shortly after the shareholders have passed a resolution approving the payment. Dividends that have not been claimed within five years after the due date revert to us and are allocated to our general reserves. For information about deduction of the withholding tax or other duties from dividend payments, see '-Item 10.E Taxation.'",

        "page_content": "- (b) Each share is entitled to one vote at a General Meeting. Voting rights may only be exercised for shares registered with the right to vote on the record date for the applicable General Meeting. To do so, the shareholder must file a share registration form with us, setting forth the shareholder's name, address and citizenship (or, in the case of a legal entity, its registered o/ffice). If the shareholder has not timely registered its shares, then the shareholder may not vote at, or participate in, a General Meeting.\n\nTo vote its shares, the shareholder must also explicitly declare that it has acquired the shares in its own name and for its own account. If the shareholder refuses to make such a declaration, the shares may not be voted unless the Board recognizes such shareholder as a nominee.\n\nThe Articles provide that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 2% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Furthermore, the Articles provide that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses, and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the registered share capital. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders. We have in the past granted exemptions from the 2% rule for shareholders and the 0.5% rule for nominees.\n\nFor purposes of the 2% rule for shareholders and the 0.5% rule for nominees, groups of companies and groups of shareholders acting in concert are considered to be one shareholder. These rules also apply to shares acquired or subscribed by the exercise of subscription, option or conversion rights.\n\nAfter hearing the registered shareholder or nominee, the Board may cancel, with retroactive e/ffect as of the date of registration, the registration of the shareholders if the registration was e/ffected based on false information.\n\nRegistration restrictions in the Articles may only be removed upon a resolution carrying a two-thirds majority of the votes represented at a General Meeting.\n\nExcept as noted below, shareholders' resolutions require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes present at a General Meeting. As a result, abstentions have the e/ffect of votes against such resolutions. Some examples of shareholders' resolutions requiring a vote by such 'absolute majority of the votes' are:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption and amendment of the Articles\n- \u00b7  Election and removal of the Board Chair, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor\n\n- \u00b7  Approval of the management report, the consolidated financial statements and the report on non-financial matters\n- \u00b7 Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and the decision on the appropriation of available earnings shown on the balance sheet, in particular with regard to dividends (including any repayment of the statutory capital reserves and the approval of interim dividends and the interim financial statements required for such purpose), if any\n- \u00b7 Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM)\n- \u00b7  Discharge  of  Board  and  Executive  Committee members from liability for matters disclosed to the General Meeting\n- \u00b7  Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting\n\nAccording to the Articles and Swiss law, the following matters require the approval of a 'supermajority' of at least two-thirds of the votes present at a General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7  Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  The consolidation of shares, unless the approval of all a/ffected shareholders is required\n- \u00b7  Increase of the share capital out of equity, by contributions in kind or by way of set-o/ff against receivable, or the grant of special rights\n- \u00b7  Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights\n- \u00b7  Introduction of a conditional capital or capital band\n- \u00b7  Creation of shares with increased voting powers\n- \u00b7  Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of registered shares, and the removal of such restrictions\n- \u00b7  Change of the currency of the share capital\n- \u00b7  Introduction of the deciding vote for the presiding o/fficer at the General Meeting\n- \u00b7  A provision in the Articles allowing the General Meeting to be held abroad\n- \u00b7  Delisting of the shares of the Company\n- \u00b7  Change of the registered o/ffice of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Introduction of an arbitration clause in the Articles",

The Articles do not provide for cumulative voting of shares.\n\nAt a General Meeting, shareholders can be represented by a legal representative or, by means of a written proxy, by a representative of choice. Furthermore, a shareholder may be represented by the Independent Proxy. Votes are taken either by a show of hands or by electronic voting, unless the General Meeting resolves to have a ballot or where a ballot is ordered by the chair of the meeting. ADSs, each representing one Novartis AG share and evidenced by ADRs, are issued by our depositary JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York, and not by us. The ADR is vested with rights defined and enumerated in the Deposit Agreement (such as the rights to vote, to receive a dividend and to receive a share of Novartis AG in exchange for a certain number of ADRs). The enumeration of rights, including any limitations on those rights in the Deposit Agreement, is final. There are no other rights given to the ADR holders. Only the ADS depositary, holding our shares underlying the ADRs, is registered as shareholder in our share register. An ADR is not a Novartis AG share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder.\n\nThe Deposit Agreement between our depositary, the ADR holder and us has granted certain indirect rights to vote to the ADR holders. ADR holders may not attend a General Meeting in person. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., our depositary, to exercise the voting rights attached to the registered shares underlying the ADRs. Each ADR represents one Novartis AG share. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder of Novartis AG. The same voting restrictions apply to ADR holders as to those holding Novartis AG shares (i.e., the right to vote up to 2% of the Novartis AG  registered  share  capital  -  unless  otherwise granted an exemption by the Board - and the disclosure requirement for nominees).\n\n- (c) Shareholders have the right to allocate the profit shown on our balance sheet and to distribute dividends by vote taken at the General Meeting, subject to the legal requirements described above.\n- (d) Under the Swiss CO, any surplus arising out of a liquidation of Novartis AG (i.e., after the settlement of all claims of all creditors) would be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to the paid-in nominal value of their shares.\n- (e) The Swiss CO limits a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if we have su/fficient\n\nfreely disposable equity in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. The aggregate nominal value of all Novartis AG shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. However, it is accepted that a Swiss corporation may repurchase its own shares beyond the statutory limit of 10% if the repurchased shares are clearly earmarked for cancellation. In addition, we are required to recognize a negative position, or if our subsidiaries acquire our shares, to create a special reserve on our balance sheet in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. Repurchased shares held by us or our subsidiaries do not carry any rights to vote at a General Meeting but are entitled to the economic benefits generally connected with the shares.\n\nUnder the Swiss CO, we may not cancel treasury shares without the approval of a capital reduction by our shareholders given that shareholders have not approved the introduction of a capital band.\n\n- (f)  Not applicable.\n- (g) Since all of our issued and outstanding shares have been fully paid in, our shareholders are not obliged to make  further  contributions  with  respect  to  their shares.\n- (h) See '-Item  10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights' and 'Item 10.B.7 Change in control.'\n\n## 10.B.4 Changes to shareholder rights\n\nUnder the Swiss CO, we may not issue new shares without the prior approval of a capital increase by our shareholders. If a capital increase is approved, then our shareholders would generally have certain pre-emptive rights to obtain newly issued shares in an amount proportional to the nominal value of the shares they already hold. These pre-emptive rights could be excluded in certain limited circumstances with the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes. In addition, we may not create shares with increased voting powers or place restrictions on the transfer of registered shares without the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of votes. In addition, see '-Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights' with regard to the Board's ability to cancel the registration of shares under limited circumstances.\n\n## 10.B.5 Shareholder meetings\n\nUnder the Swiss CO and the Articles, we must hold an AGM within six months after the end of our financial year. A General Meeting may be convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor. The Board is further required to convene an extraordinary General Meeting if so resolved by a General Meeting, or if so requested by shareholders by signed petition representing at least 5% of the share capital, specifying the items for the agenda and their proposals. Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1 000 000 may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. A General Meeting is convened by publishing a notice in the Swiss O/fficial Gazette",

This also applies to anyone who has discretionary power to exercise voting rights associated with our shares. Following receipt of such notification, we are required to inform the public by publishing the information via the electronic publication platform operated by the SIX.\n\nAn additional disclosure obligation exists under the Swiss CO that requires us to disclose once a year in the notes to the financial statements published in our Annual Report, the identity of all of our shareholders (or related groups of shareholders) who have been granted exemption entitling them to vote more than 2% of our registered share capital, as described in '-Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights.'\n\n## 10.B.9 Di/fferences in the law\n\nSee the references to Swiss law throughout this 'Item 10.B Memorandum and articles of association.'\n\n## 10.B.10 Changes in capital\n\nThe requirements of the Articles regarding changes in capital are not more stringent than the requirements of Swiss law.\n\nof the internal transactions e/ffected prior to the distribution and provides for when and how such transfers, assumptions and assignments should occur.

The statements of US and Swiss tax laws set forth below are based on the laws and regulations in force as of the date of this 20-F-including the current Convention Between the US and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, entered into force on December 19, 1997 (the Treaty); the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code); Treasury regulations; rulings; judicial decisions; and administrative pronouncements-and may be subject to any changes in US and Swiss law, and in any double taxation convention or treaty between the US and Switzerland occurring after that date, which changes may have retroactive e/ffect.\n\n## Swiss taxation\n\n## Swiss residents\n\nWithholding Tax on dividends and distributions. Dividends that we pay and similar cash or in-kind distributions that we may make to a holder of shares or ADRs (including distributions of liquidation proceeds in excess of the nominal value, stock dividends and, under certain circumstances, proceeds from repurchases of shares by us in excess of the nominal value) are generally subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax (the Withholding Tax) at a current rate of 35%. Under certain circumstances, distributions out of capital contribution reserves made by shareholders after December 31, 1996, are exempt from the Withholding Tax. We are required to withhold Withholding Tax due from the gross distribution and to pay the Withholding Tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. The Withholding Tax is refundable in full to Swiss tax residents who are the beneficial owners of the taxable distribution at the time it is resolved and duly report the gross distribution received on their personal tax return or in their financial statements for tax purposes, as the case may be.\n\nIncome tax on dividends. A Swiss tax resident who receives dividends and similar distributions (including stock dividends and liquidation surplus) on shares or ADRs is required to include such amounts in the shareholder's personal income tax return. However, distributions out of qualified capital contribution reserves are not subject to income tax. A corporate shareholder may claim substantial relief from taxation of dividends and similar distributions received if the shares held represent a fair market value of at least CHF 1 million.\n\nCapital gains tax upon disposal of shares. Under current Swiss tax law, the gain realized on shares held by a Swiss resident who holds shares or ADRs as part of his private property is generally not subject to any federal, cantonal or municipal income taxation on gains realized on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADRs. However, gains realized upon a repurchase of shares by us may be characterized as taxable dividend income if certain conditions are met. Book gains realized on shares or ADRs held by a Swiss corporate entity or by a Swiss resident individual as part of the shareholder's business property are, in general, included in the taxable income of such person. However, the Federal Law on the Direct Federal Tax of December 14, 1990, and several cantonal laws on direct cantonal taxes provide for exceptions for Swiss corporate entities holding more than 10% of our voting stock for more than one year.\n\n## Residents of other countries\n\nRecipients of dividends and similar distributions on our shares who are neither residents of Switzerland for tax purposes nor hold shares as part of a business conducted through a permanent establishment situated in Switzerland (Non-Resident Holders) are not subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of such distributions. Moreover, gains realized by such recipients upon the disposal of shares are not subject to Swiss income taxes.\n\nNon-Resident Holders of shares are, however, subject to the Withholding Tax on dividends and similar distributions mentioned above and, under certain circumstances, to the Stamp Duty described below. Such Non-Resident Holders may be entitled to a partial refund\n\ndevelopment and collaboration agreement, a transitional services agreement, an authorized generics agreement, and certain intellectual property agreements, each of which is not material to Novartis.",

A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 15% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i) qualifies for benefits under the Treaty; (ii) is not a company (or, if it is a company, such company directly holds less than 10% of our voting stock); and (iii) does not conduct business\n\nthrough a permanent establishment or fixed base in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 15% Treaty rate. A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 5% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i) is a company; (ii) qualifies for benefits under the Treaty; (iii) holds directly at least 10% of our voting stock, and (iv) does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 5% Treaty rate. Claims for refunds must be filed on Swiss Tax Form 82 (82C for corporations; 82I for individuals; 82E for other entities), which may be obtained from any Swiss Consulate General in the US or from the Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland at the address below, together with an instruction form.

The form must be accompanied by suitable evidence of deduction of Swiss tax withheld at source, such as certificates of deduction, signed bank vouchers or credit slips. The form may be filed on or after July 1 or January 1 following the date the dividend was payable, but no later than December 31 of the third year following the calendar year in which the dividend became payable. For US resident holders of ADRs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as depositary, will comply with these Swiss procedures on behalf of the holders, and will remit the net amount to the holders.\n\nStamp Duty upon transfer of securities. The sale of shares, whether by Swiss residents or Non-Resident Holders, may be subject to federal securities transfer Stamp Duty of 0.15%, calculated on the sale proceeds, if the sale occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Duty Act. The Stamp Duty has to be paid by the securities dealer and may be charged to the parties in a taxable transaction who are not securities dealers. Stamp Duty may also be due if a sale of shares occurs with or through a non-Swiss bank or securities dealer, provided that (i) such bank or dealer is a member of the SIX, and (ii) the sale takes place on the SIX. In addition to this Stamp Duty, the sale of shares by or through a member of the SIX may be subject to a minor stock exchange levy.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nThe following is a general discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant to you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because this discussion does not consider any specific circumstances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs, persons who are subject to US taxation are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall US federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as to the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences, of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs. In particular, additional or di/fferent rules may apply to US expatriates; banks and other financial institutions; regulated investment companies; traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting; dealers in securities or currencies; tax-exempt entities; insurance companies; broker-dealers; investors liable for alternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or ADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion transaction; holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of our outstanding shares. This discussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold the shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for investment purposes), and whose functional currency is the US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own\n\ntax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for benefits under the Treaty.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal income tax purposes; (ii) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the US or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust (i) subject to the primary supervision of a US court and the control of one or more US persons; or (ii) that has a valid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of the owning and disposing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner of our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see the discussion below under '-Dividends' regarding certain statements made by the US Treasury concerning depositary arrangements.\n\nThis discussion assumes that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nDividends. US Holders will be required to include in gross income, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount (without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the dividend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time that such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs. For this purpose, a 'dividend' will include any distribution paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other than certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock) paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under US federal income tax principles. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a US Holder's tax basis in the shares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such tax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain, which will be long-term capital gain if the US Holder held our shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the Code, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs are not eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders.\n\nDividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs will constitute income from sources outside the US for US foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations and conditions provided in the Code, US Holders generally may claim as a credit against their US federal income tax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received",

        "page_content": "from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the Withholding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign tax credits, but may be subject to other limitations, and each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor.\n\nThe US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADRs are released may be taking actions inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US Holders of ADRs. Accordingly, the summary above of the creditability of the Withholding Tax could be a/ffected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.\n\nIn general, a US Holder will be required to determine the amount of any dividend paid in Swiss francs, including the amount of any Withholding Tax imposed thereon, by translating the Swiss francs into US dollars at the spot rate on the date the dividend is actually or constructively received by a US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs, regardless of whether the Swiss francs are in fact converted into US dollars. If a US Holder converts the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder generally should not recognize foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If a US Holder does not convert the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder will have a tax basis in the Swiss francs equal to the US dollar value on such date. Any foreign currency gain or loss that a US Holder recognizes on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the Swiss francs generally will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.\n\nFor a non-corporate US Holder, the US dollar amount of any dividends paid that constitute qualified dividend income generally will be taxable at a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds), provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. In addition, the dividends could be subject to a 3.8% net investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. We currently believe that dividends paid with respect to our shares and ADRs will constitute qualified dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. US Holders of shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability to them of the reduced dividend rate in light of their own particular situation and the computations of their foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualified dividends paid to them, as applicable.\n\nSale or other taxable disposition. Upon a sale or other taxable disposition of shares or ADRs, US Holders generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the di/fference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US Holder's tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the shares or ADRs. This capital gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss and will be treated as long-term\n\ncapital gain or loss if the holding period in the shares or ADRs exceeds one year. In the case of a non-corporate US Holder, any long-term capital gain generally will be subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates, with a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds). In addition, the gains could be subject to a 3.8% investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount  by  which  modified  adjusted  gross  income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations under the Code. Deposits or withdrawals of our shares by US Holders in exchanges for ADRs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes.\n\nUS information reporting and backup withholding. Dividend payments with respect to shares or ADRs and proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares or ADRs received in the United States or through US-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and possible US backup withholding. Certain exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting and backup withholding requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a US Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any US Holders required to establish their exempt status generally must provide a properly executed IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a US Holder's US federal income tax liability, and a US Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.\n\n## Tax consequences of the Sandoz spin-o/ff\n\nTo implement the Sandoz spin-o/ff, we distributed all of the Sandoz Group AG shares held by Novartis to Novartis AG shareholders, pro rata to their respective holdings. Each Novartis AG shareholder received one Sandoz Group AG share for every five Novartis AG shares or five Novartis AG ADRs they held or had acquired prior to the close of business on October 3, 2023.\n\nThe following statements are based on the requirement of the continuing e/ffectiveness and validity of the written confirmations (the Swiss Tax Rulings) from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and from the tax administration of the Canton of Basel-Stadt, a private letter ruling from the IRS (the IRS Ruling) and a written opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel to Novartis (the Tax Opinion), each to the e/ffect that the Sandoz spin-o/ff qualifies as a tax-neutral transaction.",

        "page_content": "## Material tax consequences to Novartis\n\nThe following is a summary of the material tax consequences to Novartis in connection with the Sandoz spino/ff that may be relevant to holders of Novartis AG shares.\n\nThe Sandoz spin-o/ff was preceded by several internal restructuring steps to separate the Sandoz business from Novartis. Novartis has received the Swiss Tax Rulings, the IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinion, providing that the spino/ff should qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes or preserve the tax-neutral nature for Swiss tax purposes, as applicable. In addition, the Swiss Tax Rulings provide that no Swiss withholding tax or stamp duty should apply to the distribution of Sandoz Group AG shares in the spin-o/ff. The Tax Opinion and IRS Ruling are subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth below under '-Consequences to US Holders of Novartis AG Shares.' Additionally, Novartis has entered into a tax matters agreement with Sandoz, which restricts Sandoz from taking certain actions that could a/ffect the qualification of the spin-o/ff as tax-neutral.\n\n## Consequences to Swiss Holders of Novartis AG shares General\n\nSubject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein (including the discussion below relating to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares), for Swiss tax purposes no gain or loss should be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a Swiss Holder as a result of the tax-neutral spin-o/ff, provided that Swiss Holders who hold Novartis AG shares as business assets accurately maintain the tax and book values of their Novartis AG and Sandoz Group AG shares. This means that for Swiss Holders who hold Novartis AG shares as business assets, the aggregate tax basis of the Novartis AG shares and Sandoz Group AG shares immediately after the distribution should be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Novartis AG shares held immediately before the distribution, allocated between the Novartis AG shares and Sandoz Group AG shares.\n\nIf a Swiss Holder that holds Novartis AG shares as business assets is classified as a 'professional securities dealer' or is a legal entity and receives cash in lieu of a fractional share, such Swiss Holder will generally recognize a capital gain or loss measured by the di/fference between the cash received for such fractional Share and the Swiss Holder's tax basis in that fractional Share. The same Swiss income tax treatment applies to Swiss Holders of Novartis physical share certificates ( Heimverwahrer ) held as business assets who receive cash due to non-response by September 19, 2023.\n\nIf a Swiss Holder who holds Novartis AG shares as private assets receives cash in lieu of fractional Shares, the receipt of such cash will be tax-free to the holder. The same Swiss income tax treatment applies to Swiss Holders of Novartis physical share certificates ( Heimverwahrer ) held as private assets who receive cash due to non-response by September 19, 2023.\n\nNovartis has received the Swiss Tax Rulings which cover the relevant Swiss tax aspects of the separation and spin-o/ff. The Swiss Tax Rulings rely upon certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Sandoz and Novartis regarding the past and future conduct of the businesses of Sandoz and Novartis and\n\nother matters. If any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings described therein are incorrect or incomplete or not otherwise satisfied, Novartis may not be able to rely upon the Swiss Tax Rulings. Accordingly, notwithstanding the Swiss Tax Rulings, no assurance can be given that the relevant Swiss tax authorities will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to one or more of the conclusions set forth above.\n\n## Consequences to US Holders of Novartis AG shares\n\nThe following is a summary of the material US federal income tax consequences to holders of Novartis AG shares or ADRs in connection with the Sandoz distribution. For purposes of the following discussion, any reference to Novartis AG shares includes Novartis ADRs. This summary does not address any US state or local or foreign tax consequences or any estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences.\n\n## General\n\nThe IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinion, described below, rely upon certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Novartis and Sandoz regarding the past and future conduct of Novartis and Sandoz businesses and other matters. If any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings described therein are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Novartis may not be able to rely upon the IRS Ruling or the Tax Opinion. Accordingly, notwithstanding the Tax Opinion and the IRS Ruling, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to one or more of the conclusions set forth below.\n\nNovartis has received the IRS Ruling and  the Tax Opinion providing, in each case, that the distribution should qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under Section 355 of the Code. As a result:\n\n- \u00b7  no gain or loss should be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a US Holder as a result of the distribution;\n- \u00b7  the aggregate tax basis of the Novartis AG shares and the Sandoz Group AG shares held by each US Holder immediately after the distribution should be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Novartis AG shares held by the US Holder immediately before the distribution, allocated between the Novartis AG shares and the Sandoz Group AG shares in proportion to their relative fair market values on the date of the distribution; and\n- \u00b7  the holding period of the Sandoz Group AG shares received by each US Holder should include the holding period of its Novartis AG shares.\n\nGenerally, if a Novartis AG shareholder holds di/fferent blocks of Novartis AG shares (generally Novartis AG shares purchased or acquired on di/fferent dates or at di/fferent prices), a US Holder must perform the tax basis allocation described above with respect to each block and will have a holding period in the Sandoz Group AG shares determined with respect to the holding period of such block.\n\nA US Holder that receives cash in lieu of a fractional Share as part of the distribution will be treated as though it first received a distribution of the fractional Share in the distribution and then sold it for the amount of cash",

The US Holder will generally recognize a capital gain or loss measured by the di/fference between the cash received for such fractional Share and the US Holder's tax basis in that fractional Share, as determined above. Such capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the US Holder's holding period for the Novartis AG shares is more than one year from the date of the distribution. Certain US Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation on their long-term capital gains.\n\nA US Holder of Novartis physical share certificates ( Heimverwahrer ) who receives cash due to non-response by September 19, 2023 will be treated as if the US Holder received the Sandoz Group AG shares with respect to its physical share certificates in the distribution and then sold such Shares for the cash actually received. The deemed receipt and sale of the Sandoz Group AG shares for cash will be subject to the same treatment as the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional Share for US federal income tax purposes as described above.\n\n## Backup Withholding\n\nPayments of cash in lieu of a fractional Share and cash payments to a US Holder of Novartis physical share\n\ncertificates ( Heimverwahrer ) who receives cash due to non-response by September 19, 2023 may, under certain circumstances, be subject to 'backup withholding', unless the US Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with the requirements of the backup withholding rules. Corporations will generally be exempt from backup withholding, but may be required to provide a certification to establish their entitlement to the exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and it may be refunded or credited against a US Holder's US federal income tax liability if the required information is timely supplied to the IRS.\n\n## Information Reporting\n\nTreasury Regulations require each Novartis AG shareholder that, immediately before the distribution, owned 5% or more (by vote or value) of the total outstanding stock of Novartis, to attach to such shareholder's US federal income tax return for the year in which the distribution occurs a statement setting forth certain information related to the distribution.\n\n## 10.F Dividends and paying agents\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## 10.G Statement by experts\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## 10.H Documents on display\n\nAny statement in this Form 20-F about any of our contracts or other documents is not necessarily complete.

Beginning in the sixth Contract Year, this annual contribution payment will equal: (a)(1) the applicable fixed contribution amount reflected\n\nin the table below, based on the average daily balance during such Contract Year of outstanding ADSs backed by ordinary shares less (a)(2) the custody costs, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, any central securities  depository  fees,  charges  and  expenses) incurred during the applicable Contract Year (the items in (a)(2) collectively are the 'Custody Costs') plus (b) 70% of the gross issuance and cancellation fees collected by JPMorgan under the Deposit Agreement during such Contract Year minus (c) that portion (if any) of JPMorgan's legal fees, charges and out-of-pocket expenses in excess of USD 50 000 for such Contract Year.\n\n| Average Daily Balance Range Start   | Average Daily Balance Range End   | Fixed contribution   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|\n| At least 30 000 000                 | Up to 66 999 999                  | USD 340 000          |\n| At least 67 000 000                 | Up to 133 999 999                 | USD 680 000          |\n| At least 134 000 000                | Up to 200 999 999                 | USD 1 020 000        |\n| At least 201 000 000                | Up to 267 999 999                 | USD 1 360 000        |\n| At least 268 000 000                |                                   | USD 1 700 000        |\n\nThe fixed contribution amount payable under (a)(1) in respect of a given Contract Year shall be zero if the average daily balance of outstanding ADSs backed by ordinary shares is less than 30 000 000 during such Contract Year. If the Custody Costs for a Contract Year exceed the fixed contribution amount for such Contract Year, JPMorgan will reduce the contribution payable to us by an amount equal to such deficit.\n\nJPMorgan has further agreed to waive the USD 0.05 per ADS issuance fees that would normally be owed by Novartis in connection with our deposits of shares as part of our employee stock ownership and employee participation plans.

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Report of Novartis Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nNovartis AG's Chief Executive O/fficer and Chief Financial O/fficer, after evaluating the e/ffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were e/ffective.\n\nThe Board of Directors and management of the Company are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be e/ffective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Company's management assessed the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is e/ffective based on those criteria.\n\nKPMG AG, Switzerland, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in the Form 20-F under 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Report of independent registered public accounting firm.'\n\nSee the report of KPMG, an independent registered public accounting firm, included in the Form 20-F under 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Report of independent registered public accounting firm.'\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that have materially a/ffected, or are reasonably likely to materially a/ffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVas Narasimhan Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nHarry Kirsch Chief Financial O/fficer\n\nBasel, January 30, 2024",

Cybersecurity\n\nProtecting the security and integrity of the IT systems under our control and safeguarding the privacy of our customers, patients and employees is a top priority for us at all levels. Cybersecurity and data privacy risks are among the core enterprise risks evaluated through our annual enterprise risk management assessment.\n\nThe Chief Security O/fficer oversees our cybersecurity risk management program in partnership with our Chief Information O/fficer and other business leaders. The program was developed to respond to the threat of security breaches and cyberattacks, and to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of information owned by, or in the care of Novartis.  Our Chief Security O/fficer reports to our Chief Information O/fficer, and is a subject matter expert on information security, privacy, information technology strategy and management with over 20 years of relevant experience across a number of industries, including pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, financial services and consulting. Our Chief Information O/fficer has nearly 25 years of experience as an IT professional, including 14 years with Novartis, and is responsible for our technology strategy, delivery and operations globally.\n\nTo address cybersecurity threats and prevent IT system interruptions, the Information Security & Compliance (ISC) team, which is headed by our Chief Security O/fficer, has implemented enterprise-wide policies, processes and practices. We follow industry best practices, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001 to manage information security. Novartis has riskbased services continuity and systems recovery plans in place for key business processes, which are tested\n\nperiodically. We also conduct ongoing internal vulnerability analyses (including simulated hacking) as well as external testing via a third-party to ensure the e/ffectiveness of our cybersecurity controls. We require employees to report IT security incidents to a Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC) that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. CSOC is a function within ISC that is responsible for investigating all security incidents and alerts including determining the threat type, incident scope and incident severity. Where appropriate, major incidents are escalated to our Chief Executive O/fficer, who may then inform our Board of the incident pursuant to our internal procedures. Novartis has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents in the three years through 2023.\n\nAs part of its enterprise risk management oversight, the Risk Committee of our Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company has implemented an appropriate and e/ffective risk management system and process, including annually reviewing updates on cybersecurity.  The  Risk  Committee  receives  updates  on cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of topics, including recent developments, security incidents, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, thirdparty and independent reviews, the threat environment, technological trends and information security considerations arising with respect to the peers and vendors of Novartis. At least once each year, the Risk Committee discusses the Company's approach to cybersecurity risk management with the Chief Security O/fficer.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Novartis consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1. Accounting policies\n\nNovartis is a multinational group of companies (Novartis or Company) specializing in the research, development, manufacturing  and  marketing  of  a  broad  range  of innovative pharmaceutical medicines. The Company is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. They are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value.\n\nThe Company's financial year-end is December 31, which is also the annual closing date of the individual entities' financial statements incorporated into the Company's consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which a/ffect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, including the distribution liability and the non-cash, non-taxable gain recognized in connection with the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, and contingent amounts.\n\nEstimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the given circumstances and are regularly monitored. Actual outcomes and results could di/ffer from those estimates and assumptions. Revisions to estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised.\n\nAt the Novartis AG Extraordinary General Meeting, held on September 15, 2023, our shareholders approved the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business. Following the shareholder approval, IFRS Accounting Standards require the Sandoz Division and selected portions of corporate activities attributable to Sandoz's business, as well as certain expenses related to the spin-o/ff (the 'Sandoz business') to be reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Sandoz business has been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. This requires the year ended December 31, 2023 consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows to present separately continuing operations from discontinued operations, with comparative amounts in the prior years restated on a consistent basis. There is no requirement for the restatement of the December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet related to the assets and liabilities of the Sandoz business that were derecognized in 2023 as at the October 3, 2023 Distribution date. For further information and disclosures refer to the section Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders in this Note 1, Note 2 and Note 31.\n\nListed below are the material accounting policies of significance to Novartis or, in cases where IFRS Accounting Standards provide alternatives, the option adopted by Novartis.\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include all entities, including structured entities, over which Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland, directly or indirectly has control (generally as a result of owning more than 50% of the entity's voting interest). Consolidated entities are also referred to as 'subsidiaries.'\n\nIn cases where Novartis does not fully own a subsidiary, it has elected to value any remaining outstanding non-controlling interest at the time of acquiring control of the subsidiary at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net identified assets.\n\nInvestments  in  associated  companies  (generally defined as investments in entities in which Novartis holds between 20% and 50% of voting shares or over which it otherwise has significant influence) and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, except for selected venture fund investments for which the Company has elected to apply the method of fair value through the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Novartis are presented in US dollars (USD). The functional currency of a subsidiary is generally the local currency of that entity. The functional currency used for the reporting of certain Swiss and foreign finance entities is USD instead of their respective local currencies. This reflects the fact that the cash flows and transactions of these entities are primarily denominated in this currency.\n\nFor subsidiaries using a functional currency other than USD the subsidiary's results, financial position and cash flows are translated into USD using the following exchange rates:\n\n- \u00b7  Income, expense and cash flows for each month using the average exchange rate, with the US dollar values for each month being aggregated during the year\n- \u00b7  Balance sheet using year-end exchange rates\n- \u00b7  Resulting exchange rate di/fferences are recognized in other comprehensive income",

        "page_content": "## Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders\n\nAt the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of Novartis AG shareholders, held on September 15, 2023, the Novartis AG shareholders approved a special distribution by way of a dividend in kind to e/ffect the spin-o/ff of Sandoz Group AG.\n\nThe September 15, 2023, shareholder approval for the spin-o/ff required the Sandoz Division and selected portions of corporate activities attributable to Sandoz's business, as well as certain expenses related to the spino/ff (the 'Sandoz business') to be reported as discontinued operations.\n\nThe shareholder approval on September 15, 2023, for the spin-o/ff the Sandoz business, required the recognition of a distribution liability at the fair value of the Sandoz business. Novartis policy is to measure the distribution liability at the fair value of the Sandoz business net assets taken as a whole. The distribution liability was recognized through a reduction in retained earnings. It was required to be adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in its estimated fair value, up to the date of the distribution to shareholders through retained earnings. Any resulting impairment of the business assets to be distributed would have been recognized in the consolidated income statements in 'Other expense' of discontinued operations, at the date of initial recognition of the distribution liability or at subsequent dates resulting from changes of the distribution liability valuation.\n\nAt the October 4, 2023, distribution settlement date, the resulting gain, which is measured as the excess amount of the distribution liability over the then-carrying value of the net assets of the business distributed, was recognized on the line 'Gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders' within the income statement of discontinued operations.\n\nThe recognition of the distribution liability required the use of valuation techniques for the purposes of impairment testing of the Sandoz business' assets to be distributed and for the measurement of the fair value of the distribution liability. These valuations required the use of management assumptions and estimates related to the Sandoz business' future cash flows, market multiples, opening share price of Sandoz Group AG on the first day of trading its shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange, to estimate day one market value, and control premiums to apply in estimating the Sandoz business fair value. These fair value measurements are classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy. The section '-Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill' in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques.\n\nTransaction costs that are directly attributable to the Distribution (spin-o/ff) of the Sandoz business to Novartis AG shareholders by way of a dividend in kind, and that would otherwise have been avoided, were accounted for as a deduction from equity (within retained earnings). Prior to the recognition of the distribution liability, these costs were recorded as prepaid expenses in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFor additional disclosures, refer to 'Note 2. Significant transactions-Significant transactions in\n\n2023-Completion of the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business through a dividend in kind distribution to Novartis AG shareholders,' and 'Note 31. Discontinued operations.'\n\n## Acquisition of assets and businesses\n\nAssets separately acquired are recorded at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable costs for bringing the asset into the condition to operate as intended. Expected costs for obligations to dismantle and remove property, plant and equipment and restore the site when it is no longer used are included in their cost.\n\nAcquired businesses are accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless the optional concentration test is applied. The optional concentration test allows for an election on a transaction-by-transaction basis to account for the acquired business as an asset separately acquired when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nThe acquisition method requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date the Company obtains control. The excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recognized as goodwill. The valuations are based on information available at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the use of valuation techniques. These valuations require the use of management assumptions and estimates, including the value of comparable assets in the market, amount and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of research  and  development  activities,  probability  of obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal growth rates. The section '-Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets' in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on applying the acquisition method on the acquisition of a business and is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, which are usually represented by the operating segment. Goodwill is",

        "page_content": "tested for impairment annually at the level of this group of CGUs, and any impairment charges are recorded under 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\nPurchased intangible assets other than goodwill are initially recorded at cost. Intangible assets that have been acquired through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value using the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nIntangible assets available for use with a definitive useful life (which includes the categories Currently marketed products and Other intangible assets) are amortized on a straight-line basis and evaluated for potential impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nAcquired  research  and  development  intangible assets that have not yet obtained marketing approval are recognized as in-process research and development (IPR&D).  IPR&D is not amortized as it is not yet available for use.  It is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances warrant. Once a project included in IPR&D has received marketing approval from a regulatory authority, it is transferred to the 'Currently marketed products' category of intangible assets.\n\nAn asset, a CGU or a grouping of CGUs is considered impaired  when  its  balance  sheet  carrying  amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impairment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. An estimate is therefore derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the limited cases where the value-in-use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or CGU, and for this purpose, management considers the range of economic conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset. These valuations are classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Company's activities with regard to:\n\n- \u00b7  Amount and timing of projected future cash flows\n- \u00b7  Sales forecasts\n- \u00b7 Actions of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.)\n- \u00b7  Sales erosion rates after the end of patent or other intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the entry of generic competition\n- \u00b7 Outcome of research and development activities (compound e/fficacy, results of  clinical trials, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR&D into  commercially viable products\n- \u00b7  Profit margins\n- \u00b7  Probability of obtaining regulatory approval\n- \u00b7  Future tax rate\n- \u00b7  Appropriate terminal growth rate\n- \u00b7  Appropriate discount rate\n\nGenerally, for intangible assets with a definite useful life, Novartis uses cash flow projections for the whole useful life of these assets. For goodwill, Novartis generally utilizes cash flow projections for a three-year period based on management forecasts, with a terminal value based on cash flow projections usually in line with inflation rates for later periods.\n\nProbability-weighted scenarios are  typically used. Discount rates used consider the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific asset, country and currency risks associated with cash flow projections, to approximate the discount rate that market participants would use to value the asset.\n\nDue to the above factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting techniques.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts are presented within current financial debts on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Marketable securities and noncurrent financial assets\n\nMarketable securities are financial assets held for shortterm purposes that are principally traded in liquid markets and are classified within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in 'Other financial income and expense' in the consolidated income statement. Non-current financial assets held for long-term strategic purposes are classified within non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in 'Other income' and 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\nMarketable  securities  and  non-current  financial assets are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is di/fferent from the settlement date when the transaction is ultimately e/ffected. Quoted securities are remeasured at each reporting date to fair value based on current market prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active or no market is available, fair values are established using valuation techniques. The majority of non-quoted investments are initially valued at fair value through the purchase price established between a willing buyer and seller. Non-quoted investments are subsequently adjusted based on values derived from discounted cash flow analysis or other pricing models. These investment values are classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe Company classifies and accounts for its marketable securities and non-current financial assets in the following categories:",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7  Debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with subsequent recycling into the consolidated income statement, as they meet both the 'solely payment of principal and interest' and the business model criteria. Unrealized gains and losses, except exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are recognized in the consolidated income statement when the debt instrument is sold, at which time the gain is transferred to 'Other financial income and expense.' Exchange gains and losses related to debt instruments are immediately recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n- \u00b7  Fund investments and equity securities of the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL). Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Other income' for gains and 'Other expense' for losses.\n- \u00b7  Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside of the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are reclassified to retained earnings when the equity security is sold. If these equity securities are not designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, they are valued at FVPL, as described above.\n- \u00b7  Other non-current financial assets, such as loans and long-term receivables from customers, advances and other deposits, are valued at amortized cost, which reflects the time value of money less any allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nThe Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt securities valued at fair value through other comprehensive income. Impairments on debt securities are recorded in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nFor other financial assets valued at amortized cost, impairments, which are based on their expected credit losses, and exchange rate losses are included in 'Other expense'  in  the  consolidated  income  statement. Exchange rate gains and interest income, using the e/ffective interest rate method, are included in 'Other income' or 'Other financial income' in the consolidated income statement, depending on the nature of the item.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair value and are remeasured to their current fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period. The valuation of a forward exchange rate contract is based on the discounted cash flow model, using interest rate curves and forward rates at the reporting date as observable inputs.\n\nOptions are valued based on a modified BlackScholes model using volatility and exercise prices as major observable inputs.\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging to reduce the volatility in the Company's performance due to the exposure to various business-related risks. The risk mitigation is obtained because the derivative's value or cash flows are expected, wholly or partly, to o/ffset changes in the value or cash flows of the recognized assets or liabilities. The overall strategy is aiming to mitigate the currency and interest rate risk of positions that are contractually agreed, and to partially mitigate the exposure risk of selected anticipated transactions.\n\nCertain derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. A prerequisite for obtaining this accounting-hedge relationship is extensive documentation on inception and proving on a regular basis that the economic hedge is e/ffective for accounting purposes. Other derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated in a hedge relationship. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized  immediately  in  'Other  financial  income  and expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\nIn addition, the Company has designated certain long-term debt components as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations. On consolidation, foreign currency di/fferences arising on long-term debt designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation e/ffects, to the extent that the hedge is e/ffective. The foreign currency di/fferences arising from hedge ine/ffectiveness are recognized in the income statement in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nWhen a hedged net investment is disposed of, the proportionate portion of the cumulative amount recognized in equity in relation to the hedged net investment is transferred to the consolidated income statement as an adjustment to the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory is valued at the lower of acquisition or production cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value. This value is used for the 'Cost of goods sold' in the consolidated income statement. Unsaleable inventory is fully written o/ff in the consolidated income statement under 'Cost of goods sold.'\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced amounts, including any related sales taxes less adjustments for estimated revenue deductions such as rebates, chargebacks and cash discounts.\n\nProvisions for doubtful trade receivables are established using a forward-looking expected credit loss model (ECL). Charges for doubtful trade receivables are recorded as marketing and selling costs recognized in",

A provision is recorded when there is a probable outflow of resources for which a reliable estimate can be made of the outcome of the legal or other disputes against the subsidiary.\n\n## Contingent consideration\n\nIn the acquisition or divestment of a business, it is necessary to recognize contingent future amounts due to previous owners, representing contractually defined potential amounts as a liability or an asset. Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty payments related to certain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or  market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment, and are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time.\n\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in subsequent periods are recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Cost of goods sold' for currently marketed products and in 'Research and development' for IPR&D. Changes in contingent consideration assets are recognized in 'Other income' or 'Other expense,' depending on their nature.\n\nThe e/ffect of unwinding the discount over time is recognized for contingent consideration liabilities in 'Interest expense' and for contingent consideration assets as interest income recognized in the consolidated income statement within 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits\n\nThe liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is the defined benefit obligation calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  The current service cost for defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which employees are employed, and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized as 'Other expense' or 'Other income.'\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue on the sale of Novartis products and services, which is recorded as 'Net sales to third parties' in the consolidated income statement, is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring control over the promised goods and services to the customer, substantially all of which is at the point in time of shipment to or receipt of the products by the customer or when the services are performed. If contracts contain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the acceptance criteria. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the consideration is allocated based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The amount of revenue recognized  is  based  on  the  consideration  Novartis expects to receive in exchange for its goods and services, when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\n\nThe consideration Novartis receives in exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The most common elements of variable consideration are listed below.\n\n- \u00b7  Rebates and discounts granted to wholesalers, retailers, government agencies (including US Medicaid and US Federal Medicare programs), government supported healthcare systems, private health systems, pharmacy  benefit  managers,  managed  healthcare organizations, purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers, as well as chargebacks are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related revenues are recorded, or when the incentives are o/ffered. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these revenue deductions. These rebates and discounts, applied using provision rates, are estimated based on the terms and conditions in the individual government agencies, states, plans and customer agreements (which may be subject to challenge or change in interpretative guidance by government authorities and customers), historical experience, product sales and growth rate, population  growth,  product  pricing  including  inflation impacts, the mix of contracts and products, the level of inventory in the distribution channel, regulations, contracts, channels and payers, as appropriate to the individual rebate and discount arrangements. These rebate provisions are adjusted based on established processes and experiences, for example from filing data with individual government agencies, states, and plans. There is often a time lag between recording of revenue deductions and the final accounting for them.\n- \u00b7  Refunds  granted  to  healthcare  providers  under innovative pay-for-performance agreements (i.e. outcome  based  arrangements)  are  provisioned  and recorded as a revenue deduction at the time the related sales are recorded. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these revenue deductions. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience and clinical data available for the product, as well as specific terms of the individual agreements.",

The provisions for revenue deductions under the innovative pay-for-performance agreements are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual experience,  including  the  products  actual  outcomes achieved compared with the anticipated predefined targets.\n\n- \u00b7 Cash discounts are o/ffered to customers to encourage prompt payment and are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related sales are recorded.\n- \u00b7  Sales returns provisions are recognized and recorded as revenue deductions when there is historical experience of Novartis agreeing to customer returns and Novartis can reasonably estimate expected future returns. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these revenue deductions. In doing so, the estimated rate of return is applied, determined on the basis of historical experience of customer returns and considering any other relevant factors. This is applied to the amounts invoiced, also considering the amount of returned products to be destroyed versus products that can be placed back in inventory for resale. Where shipments are made on a resale or return basis, without su/fficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is only recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired. The provisions for sales returns are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual experience,\n\nNet sales to third parties and provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted periodically to reflect experience and to reflect actual amounts as rebates, refunds, discounts and returns are processed. There is often a time lag between recording of revenue deductions and the final accounting for them. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these revenue deductions.\n\n'Other revenue' includes income from profit-sharing arrangements with our collaboration partners, and royalty and milestone income from the out-licensing of intellectual property when Novartis retains an interest in the intellectual property through a license. Royalty income earned from a license is recognized when the underlying sales have occurred. Milestone income is recognized at the point in time when it is highly probable that the relevant milestone event criteria are met, and the risk of reversal of revenue recognition is remote. 'Other revenue' also includes revenue from activities such as manufacturing or other services rendered, to the extent such revenue is not recorded under net sales, and is recognized when control transfers to the third party and our performance obligations are satisfied.\n\n## Research and development\n\nInternal research and development (R&D) costs are fully charged to 'Research and development' in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude the capitalization of internal development expenses as an intangible asset until marketing approval from a regulatory authority is obtained in a major market such as the United States, the European Union, Switzerland or Japan.\n\nPayments made to third parties, such as contract research and development organizations in compensation for subcontracted R&D, that are deemed not to transfer intellectual property to Novartis are expensed as internal R&D expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Such payments are only capitalized if they meet the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset, usually when marketing approval has been received from a regulatory authority in a major market.\n\nPayments made to third parties to in-license or acquire intellectual property rights, compounds and products, including initial upfront and subsequent milestone payments, are capitalized, as are payments for other assets, such as technologies to be used in R&D activities. If additional payments are made to the originator company to continue performing R&D activities, an evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such additional payments will be expensed if they are deemed to be compensation for subcontracted R&D services not resulting in an additional transfer of intellectual property rights to Novartis. Such additional payments will be capitalized if they are deemed to be compensation for the transfer to Novartis of additional intellectual property developed at the risk of the originator company. Subsequent internal R&D costs in relation to IPR&D and other assets are expensed, since the technical feasibility of the internal R&D activity can only be demonstrated by the receipt of marketing approval for a related product from a regulatory authority in a major market.\n\nCosts for post-approval studies performed to support the continued registration of a marketed product are recognized as marketing expenses. Costs for activities that are required by regulatory authorities as a condition for obtaining marketing approval in a major market are capitalized and recognized as currently marketed products.\n\nInventory produced ahead of regulatory approval is fully provisioned, and the charge is included in 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement, as its ultimate use  cannot be assured. If this inventory can subsequently be sold, the provision is released to 'Other income' in the consolidated income statement, either on approval by the appropriate regulatory authority or, exceptionally in Europe, on recommendation by the Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use (CHMP), if approval is virtually certain.",

The expense recorded  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which the employees are employed.\n\nUnvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs and RSUs are only conditional on the provision of services by the plan participant during the vesting period. They are valued at fair value on the grant date. As RSUs do not entitle the holder to dividends, the fair value is based on the Novartis share price at the grant date adjusted for the net present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the holding period. The fair value of these grants, after making adjustments for assumptions related to forfeiture during the vesting period, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.\n\nPSUs are subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics and variables that can be observed in the market, which for Novartis plans is the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period and require plan participants to provide services during this period The expense is recognized in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on a bifurcation into the components based on the performance criteria related to Novartis internal performance metrics and TSR. The number of equity instruments that finally vest is determined at the vesting date. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the accounting policies for the determination of the components of the PSU share-based compensation plan expense.\n\nThe portion of the PSUs expense that is subject to performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics over the vesting period is determined based on assumptions concerning the expected performance against the internal performance metrics throughout the vesting period. The assumptions are based on the Company's targets for those performance metrics, and the expected forfeitures due to plan participants not meeting their service conditions. The assumptions are periodically adjusted over the vesting period. For this portion of the PSUs expense, any change in estimates for past services is recorded immediately as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement, and amounts for the remaining vesting period are expensed on a straight-line basis. As a result, at the end of the vesting period, the expense during the entire vesting period represents the amount that will finally vest.\n\nThe portion of the PSUs expense that is subject to performance criteria based on Novartis TSR relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period is determined based on the total fair value of the\n\ngrant over the vesting period. IFRS Accounting Standards require that these variables that can be observed in the market are taken into account in determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Novartis determined the fair value of these PSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For this portion of the PSU expense, adjustments to expense recognized in the consolidated income statement are only made if a plan participant does not fulfill the service conditions.\n\nMeasuring the fair values of PSUs granted that include TSR performance criteria requires the use of estimates. The Monte Carlo simulation used to determine the fair value of the PSUs TSR performance criteria requires the probability of factors related to uncertain future events; the term of the award; the grant price of underlying shares or ADRs; expected volatilities; the expected correlation matrix of the underlying equity instruments with those of the peer group of companies; and the risk-free interest rate as input parameters.\n\nIf a plan participant leaves Novartis for reasons other than  retirement,  disability  or  death,  then  unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs, RSUs and PSUs are forfeited, unless determined otherwise by the provision of the plan rules or by the Compensation Committee of the Novartis Board of Directors, for example, in connection with a reorganization or divestment.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  comprise  current  income  taxes  and deferred income taxes and are recognized in the same periods as the revenues and expenses to which they relate.  Income  taxes  include  interest  and  penalties incurred during the period, insofar as they are considered an income tax. Income taxes related to items recognized directly to other comprehensive income or to equity are recognized together with the corresponding item, to which the income tax is attributable, directly in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\nDeferred income taxes are determined using the comprehensive liability method and are calculated on the temporary di/fferences that arise between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying value for financial reporting purposes, except for those temporary di/fferences related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies, where the timing of their reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the di/fference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Since the retained earnings are reinvested, withholding or other taxes on eventual distribution of a subsidiary's retained earnings are only recognized when a dividend is declared or has been planned. Furthermore, deferred income taxes are recognized for the net tax e/ffects of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. The Company applies the IFRS Accounting Standards exception to not recognize or disclose information about deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities related to countries that have enacted tax legislation that comply with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  deferred  tax  assets  is reduced to the extent that it is not probable that su/fficient taxable profits will be available to enable all or part",

Significant transactions\n\nThe Company applied the acquisition method of accounting for businesses acquired, and did not elect to apply the optional concentration test to account for acquired business as an asset separately acquired.\n\n## Significant transactions in 2023\n\n## Completion of the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business through a dividend in kind distribution to Novartis AG shareholders\n\nOn July 18, 2023, Novartis announced that its Board of Directors had unanimously endorsed the proposed separation of the Sandoz business to create an independent company by way of a spin-o/ff and to seek shareholder approval for the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz  business into a separately traded standalone company, following the complete structural separation of the Sandoz business into a standalone company (the Sandoz business or Sandoz Group AG) and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and Novartis AG shareholders' approval.\n\nAt the EGM held on September 15, 2023, Novartis AG shareholders approved a special distribution by way of a dividend in kind to e/ffect the spin-o/ff of Sandoz Group AG, subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent to the distribution. Upon shareholder approval, the Sandoz business was reported as discontinued operations and the distribution liability was recognized at its fair value, which exceeded the carrying value of the Sandoz business net assets.\n\nThe conditions precedent to the spin-o/ff were met and on October 3, 2023 the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business was e/ffected by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG shareholders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders (the Distribution). Through the Distribution, each Novartis AG shareholder received 1 Sandoz Group AG share for every 5 Novartis AG shares and each Novartis ADR holder received 1 Sandoz ADR for every 5 Novartis ADR that they held at the close of business on October 3, 2023. As of October 4, 2023, the shares of Sandoz Group AG have been listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) under the stock symbol 'SDZ'.\n\nOn September 18, 2023, the Sandoz business entered into financing arrangements with a group of banks under which on September 28, 2023, it borrowed a total amount of USD 3.3 billion. These borrowings consisted of a bridge loan in EUR (EUR 2.4 billion) and term loans in EUR (EUR 0.2 billion) and USD (USD 0.5 billion). In addition, the Sandoz business borrowed approximately USD 0.4 billion under a number of local bilateral facilities in di/fferent countries. This resulted in a total gross debt of USD 3.7 billion. These outstanding borrowings of the Sandoz business legal entities were recognized in the September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet within Liabilities related to discontinued operations and within financing activities cash flows from discontinued operations. Prior to the Distribution on October 3, 2023, Sandoz business legal entities paid approximately USD 3.3 billion in cash to Novartis and its a/ffiliates through a series of intercompany transactions.\n\nAt the Distribution date on October 3, 2023, the dividend in kind distribution liability to e/ffect the Distribution (spin-o/ff) of the Sandoz business amounted to USD 14.0 billion, measured by reference to the October 4, 2023 opening Sandoz Group AG share price and applying a control premium. The dividend in kind distribution liability was recorded as a reduction to equity (retained earnings) and remained in excess of the then carrying value of the Sandoz business net assets, which amounted to USD 8.6 billion (see Note 31).\n\nCertain consolidated foundations own Novartis AG dividend-bearing shares that restricts their availability for use by Novartis. These Novartis AG shares are accounted for as treasury shares. Through the Distribution, these foundations received Sandoz Group AG shares representing an approximate 4.31% equity interest in Sandoz Group AG. Upon the loss of control of Sandoz Group AG through the Distribution on October 3, 2023, the financial investment in Sandoz Group AG was recognized at its initial fair value based on the opening traded share price of Sandoz Group AG on October 4, 2023 (a Level 1 hierarchy valuation). At initial recognition, on October 4, 2023, the Sandoz Group AG financial investment had a fair value of USD 0.5 billion, and was reported in the fourth quarter of 2023 on the consolidated balance sheet as a financial asset. Management has designated this investment at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe total non-taxable, non-cash gain recognized at the Distribution date of the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business amounted to USD 5.9 billion, which consists of:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                      | Oct 3, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Net assets derecognized  1                                                          | - 8 647       |\n| Derecognition of distribution liability                                             | 13 962        |\n| Di/fference between net assets and distribution liability                           | 5 315         |\n| Recognition of Sandoz Group AG shares  obtained through consolidated foundations    | 492           |\n| Currency translation gains recycled into  the consolidated income statement         | 357           |\n| Transaction costs and other items recognized in the   consolidated income statement | - 304         |\n| Gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to   Novartis AG shareholders               | 5 860         |\n\nFor additional disclosures on discontinued operations, refer to Note 31.\n\n## Acquisition of DTx Pharma Inc.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, Novartis entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of DTx Pharma Inc.

No Novartis share of other comprehensive income recognized by associated companies was recycled to the consolidated income statement in 2023 and 2022.\n\nNovartis has certain non-significant investments and had a significant investment in Roche Holding AG, Basel (Roche), which was divested to Roche on December 6, 2021, that are accounted for as associated companies.\n\n## Roche Holding AG\n\nOn November 3, 2021, Novartis entered into an agreement with Roche Holding AG to divest its 33.3% of Roche Holding AG (Roche) voting shares, representing approximately 6.2% of Roche's total outstanding voting and non-voting equity instruments, to Roche for USD 20.7 billion in cash. As a result, Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021.\n\nThe divestment transaction closed on December 6, 2021, and Novartis realized a gain of USD 14.6 billion, recorded in income from associated companies. For more information, see Note 2.\n\nSince full-year financial data for Roche is not available when Novartis produces its consolidated financial results, a survey of analyst estimates is used to estimate the Company's share of Roche's net income. Any di/fferences between these estimates and actual results were\n\nadjusted in the Company's consolidated financial statements when available. As Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021, and the divestment closed on December 6, 2021, no such adjustment has been made to the 2023 and 2022 Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated income statement e/ffects from applying Novartis accounting principles for this investment in 2021 are as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                             | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Novartis share of Roche's   estimated current-year   consolidated net income                               | 815    |\n| Prior-year adjustment                                                                                      | 40     |\n| Amortization of fair value   adjustments relating to   intangible assets, net of taxes   of USD 10 million | - 70   |\n| Gain on divestment of the   investment in Roche  1                                                         | 14 556 |\n| Net income e/ffect                                                                                         | 15 341 |\n\n- 1 The gain on divestment of the investment in Roche includes the recycling of currency translation e/ffects (see Note 9.1) and other comprehensive income e/ffects totaling USD 3.2 billion.",

As a result, there is a di/fference between our applicable tax rate and e/ffective tax rate.\n\nThe applicable tax rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Company's pre-tax income and changes in statutory tax rates since it is calculated as the weighted average tax rate based on the pre-tax income of each subsidiary.\n\nThe main elements contributing to the di/fference between the Company's overall applicable tax rate and the e/ffective tax rate are shown in the following table:\n\n| (As a percentage)                                                                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Applicable tax rate                                                               | 15.0   | 15.3   | 14.2   |\n| E/ffect of disallowed expenditures                                                | 1.4    | 2.6    | 1.0    |\n| E/ffect of income taxed at reduced rates                                          | - 0.6  | - 0.4  | - 0.1  |\n| E/ffect of income not subject to tax  1                                           | - 2.5  | - 0.1  | - 7.9  |\n| E/ffect of tax credits and allowances                                             | - 3.9  | - 4.1  | - 1.5  |\n| E/ffect of release of   contingent consideration liability                        | - 0.3  | - 0.5  | - 0.1  |\n| E/ffect of tax rate change   on current and deferred   tax assets and liabilities | - 1.6  | 0.0    | 0.0    |\n| E/ffect of derecognition and  reversals of derecognition   of deferred tax assets | 0.9    | 1.3    | 0.0    |\n| E/ffect of write-down of investments  in subsidiaries                             | - 3.0  | 0.0    | 0.0    |\n| E/ffect of prior-year items                                                       | 0.0    | - 0.3  | 0.1    |\n| E/ffect of changes in uncertain tax positions                                     | 0.1    | 1.7    | 1.0    |\n| E/ffect of other items                                                            | 0.5    | 0.2    | - 0.1  |\n| E/ffective tax rate from  continuing operations                                   | 6.0    | 15.7   | 6.6    |\n\nThe e/ffective tax rate of Novartis fluctuates primarily as a result of, among other factors, changes in pre-tax",

The table above provides the details of the significant items that impact the comparability of the e/ffective tax rate between years.\n\nIn December 2021, the OECD issued model rules for a  new  global  minimum  tax  framework  (Pillar  Two). Novartis is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. A number of governments in countries in which Novartis operates are in the process of enacting or have enacted tax legislation to comply with Pillar Two. Of the major countries in which we operate, only the enactment of Pillar Two tax legislation in Switzerland is expected to have an impact to our income tax provision as from 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, Switzerland decided to partially implement Pillar Two, whereby e/ffective from January 1, 2024, a 15% minimum taxation will be assessed on Pillar Two qualifying profits earned by companies domiciled in Switzerland  (Qualified  Domestic  Minimum  Top-Up Tax).  This Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax will not be applied to the Pillar Two qualifying profits earned by a company's a/ffiliates domiciled in tax jurisdictions outside of Switzerland. The timing of implementation and the specific provisions of any further Pillar Two tax regulations in Switzerland remains subject to further assessments at both the Federal and Cantonal levels. The Company estimates that the impact of these changes to tax legislation in the respective countries that have (substantively) enacted Pillar Two tax legislation in 2023 would not be material to our consolidated financial position, income statement and cash flows.\n\n## 8.

This calculation excludes the average number of issued shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\n\nFor diluted EPS, the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted to assume the vesting of\n\nall restricted shares, restricted share units, and in 2022 and 2021 the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares arising from options on Novartis shares that have been issued. At December 31, 2023, there were no options on Novartis shares issued or outstanding.\n\nNo options were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in 2022 or 2021, as all options were dilutive in both years.",

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company allocates the consideration in the lease contract to the lease and non-lease components on the basis of the relative standalone price of each component.\n\nThe portion of the lease payments attributable to the repayment of lease liabilities is recognized in cash flows\n\nused in financing activities, and the portion attributable to the payment of interest is included in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease over the shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.\n\nRight-of-use assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life.\n\nThe following table summarizes the movements of the right-of-use assets:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Right-of-use assets at January 1                                                                | 1 431  | 1 561  |\n| Costs and accumulated depreciation/impairments  on assets related to discontinued operations  1 | - 117  |        |\n| Impact of acquisitions of businesses                                                            | 16     | 12     |\n| Additions  2                                                                                    | 421    | 247    |\n| Depreciation charge                                                                             | - 259  | - 300  |\n| Impairment charge  3                                                                            | - 4    | - 3    |\n| Lease contract terminations  4                                                                  | - 93   | - 34   |\n| Currency translation e/ffects                                                                   | 15     | - 52   |\n| Total right-of-use assets at December 31                                                        | 1 410  | 1 431  |\n\nThe following table shows the right-of-use assets carrying value at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the continuing operations depreciation charge for years 2023, 2022 and 2021, by underlying class of asset 1 :\n\n| (USD millions)                              | December 31, 2023 carrying value   | December 31, 2022   carrying value   |   Depreciation  charge 2023 |   Depreciation  charge 2022 |   Depreciation  charge 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Land                                        | 483                                | 505                                  |                          12 |                          16 |                          11 |\n| Buildings                                   | 749                                | 745                                  |                         156 |                         162 |                         174 |\n| Vehicles                                    | 112                                | 117                                  |                          80 |                          82 |                          89 |\n| Machinery and  equipment, and  other assets | 66                                 | 64                                   |                          11 |                           7 |                           5 |\n| Total right-of-use  assets                  | 1 410                              | 1 431                                |                         259 |                         267 |                         279 |",

The Company's most material lease with a lease term extension, representing a lease liability value of USD 0.7 billion (2022: USD 0.7 billion), has a determined lease term end date of 2071 (2022: 2071). Non-enforceable extension options of up to 10 years have not been included within the measurement of this lease liability, and do not have a material impact to the carrying value of the lease for both 2023 and 2022. Should the landlord agree to a lease extension, rent will be referenced to the market rates as at the commencement of the extension period.\n\nIn 2023, the Company completed two sale and leaseback transactions for certain property, plant and equipment as part of the Company's strategy. The transactions resulted in net cash inflows of USD 273 million (2022: USD 49 million) and the recognition of USD 146 million of lease liabilities(2022: USD 23 million), and USD 109 million of right-of-use assets (2022: USD 13 million). The right-of-use assets value reflects the proportion of the property, plant and equipment retained. Extension options have been included where management believe that such options will be exercised. The liabilities reflect the net present value of future lease payments. The net gain on the sale and leaseback transactions amounted to USD 18 million (2022: USD 17 million).

The valuation method of the recoverable amount of the operating segment to which goodwill is allocated is based on the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment charges are recorded under 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe following assumptions were used in the goodwill impairment testing calculation:\n\nThe discount rates consider the Company's weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to approximate the weighted average cost of capital of a comparable market participant.\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal, for all cash-generating units containing goodwill, is reviewed for the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. In particular, we considered an increase in the discount rate, a decrease in the terminal growth rate, and certain negative impacts on the forecasted cash flows. These reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not indicate an impairment.\n\n'Note 1.

In particular, we monitor the level of trade receivables in countries deemed to have an elevated credit risk. We consider macroeconomic  environment,  historical  experience, country and political risk, in addition to other relevant information when assessing risk. These risk factors are\n\nmonitored regularly to determine any adjustments in risk classification. The majority of the past due trade receivables from elevated credit risk countries are due from local governments or from government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions as well as other factors in these elevated credit risk countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these trade receivables, and may require the Company to re-evaluate the expected credit loss amount of these trade receivables in future periods. At December 31, 2023, amounts past due for more than one year are not significant in elevated credit risk countries.\n\nTotal trade receivables include amounts denominated in the  following major currencies:\n\n| (USD millions)          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| US dollar (USD)         | 3 520  | 3 709  |\n| Euro (EUR)              | 1 138  | 1 426  |\n| Japanese yen (JPY)      | 288    | 177    |\n| Russian ruble (RUB)     | 240    | 430    |\n| Chinese yuan (CNY)      | 231    | 155    |\n| British pound (GBP)     | 146    | 176    |\n| Brazilian real (BRL)    | 130    | 145    |\n| Australian dollar (AUD) | 96     | 137    |\n| Swiss franc (CHF)       | 84     | 108    |\n| Canadian dollar (CAD)   | 75     | 151    |\n| Other currencies        | 1 159  | 1 452  |\n| Total trade receivables | 7 107  | 8 066  |",

        "page_content": "19.3) In 2023, in connection with the Distribution (spino/ff) of Sandoz business, Novartis AG shareholders approved at the EGM held on September 15, 2023, a decrease in Novartis AG share capital in the amount of CHF 22.8 million (USD 17.1 million). The capital decrease resulted in a reduction of the nominal value of the Novartis AG shares by CHF 0.01 from CHF 0.50 per share to CHF 0.49 per share.\n\n19.4) In December 2021, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. The arrangement was updated in July 2022, December 2022, and May 2023, and concluded in June 2023. Novartis was able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. As of December 31, 2022, these waiting period conditions were not applicable and as a result, there was no requirement to record a liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 2022. The liability under this arrangement amounted to USD 2.8 billion as at December 31, 2021.\n\nIn June 2023, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase 11.7 million Novartis shares on the second trading line, which concluded in July 2023.\n\nIn July 2023, Novartis entered into a new irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its new up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. Novartis is able to cancel this arrangement but may be subject to a 90-day waiting period under certain conditions. As of December 31, 2023, these waiting period conditions were not applicable and as a result, there was no requirement to record a liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn June 2021, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of employees. Novartis would have been able to cancel this arrangement at any time but would have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. This trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired in June 2021, and as a consequence, there was no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line\n\nunder its up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback. Novartis would have been able to cancel this arrangement at any time, but would have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. This trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired in March 2021, and as a consequence, there was no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2021.\n\n19.5) The impact of change in ownership of consolidated entities represents the excess of the amount paid to non-controlling interest over their carrying value and equity  allocation  to  non-controlling  interest  due  to change in ownership percentage.\n\n19.6) Changes in non-controlling interests represent the impact on the non-controlling interest of transactions with minority shareholders, such as change in ownership percentage, dividend payments and other equity transactions.\n\n19.7) Other movements include, for subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies, the impact of the application of IAS 29 'Financial reporting in Hyperinflation Economies'. See Note 30 for additional disclosures.\n\n19.8) Transaction costs in 2023 of USD 214 million, net of tax of USD 29 million, that are directly attributable to the Distribution (spin-o/ff) of Sandoz business to Novartis AG shareholders and that would otherwise have been avoided,  are  recorded  as  a  deduction  from  equity (retained earnings). See Note 1.\n\nIn 2021, transaction costs that were directly attributable to the distribution (spin-o/ff) of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders and that would otherwise have been avoided, were recorded to equity.\n\n19.9) At December 31, 2022, the market maker held 3 million (2021: 3 million) written call options, originally issued as part of the share-based compensation for employees,  that  have  not  yet  been  exercised.  The weighted average exercise price of these options at December 31, 2022, was USD 66.07 (2021: USD 61.45), and they had contractual lives of 10 years, with remaining lives less than one year (2021: two years). In the first quarter of 2023, the market maker exercised 3 million written call options and as a result there are no written call options outstanding at December 31, 2023.",

The provisions are reassessed on an annual basis and adjusted as necessary.\n\nIn the United States, Novartis has been named under federal legislation (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in respect of certain sites. Novartis actively participates in, or monitors, the cleanup activities at the sites in which it is a PRP. The provision takes into consideration the number of other PRPs at each site as well as the identity and financial position of such parties in light of the joint and several nature of the liability.\n\nThe expected timing of the related cash outflows as of December 31, 2023, is currently projected as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                                  |   Expected  cash outflows |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Due within two years                            |                        82 |\n| Due later than two years, but within five years |                       158 |\n| Due later than five years, but within 10 years  |                       217 |\n| Due after 10 years                              |                        81 |\n| Total environmental remediation provisions      |                       538 |\n\n## Provisions for product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters\n\nNovartis has established provisions for certain product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters where a potential cash outflow is probable, and Novartis can make a reliable estimate of the amount of the outflow. These provisions represent the Company's current best estimate of the total financial e/ffect for the matters described below and for other less significant matters. Potential cash outflows reflected in a provision might be fully or partially o/ffset by insurance in certain circumstances.\n\nNovartis has not established provisions for potential damage awards for certain additional legal claims against its subsidiaries if Novartis currently believes that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated. These not-provisioned-for matters include individual product liability cases and certain other legal matters. Plainti/ffs have alleged claims in these matters and the Company does not believe that information about the amount sought by plainti/ffs, if that is known, would\n\nbe meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of proceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law. It is therefore, not practicable to provide information about the potential financial impact of these matters. In addition, in some of these matters there are claims for punitive or multiple (treble) damages, civil penalties and disgorgement of profits that in the view of Novartis are either wholly or partially unspecified, or wholly or partially unquantifiable at present; the Company believes that information about these amounts claimed by plainti/ffs generally is not meaningful for purposes of determining a reliable estimate of a loss that is probable or more than remote.\n\nA number of other legal matters are in such early stages or the issues presented are such that the Company has not made any provisions since it cannot currently estimate either a potential outcome or the amount of any potential losses. For these reasons, among others, the Company generally is unable to make a reliable estimate of possible loss with respect to such cases. It is therefore not practicable to provide information about the potential financial impact of those cases.\n\nThere might also be cases for which the Company was able to make a reliable estimate of the possible loss or the range of possible loss, but the Company believes that publication of such information on a case-by-case basis would seriously prejudice the Company's position in ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement discussions. Accordingly, in such cases, information has been disclosed with respect to the nature of the contingency, but no disclosure is provided as to an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss.\n\nNote 29 contains additional information on contingent liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of significant legal proceedings\n\nThe following is a summary of significant legal proceedings to which Novartis or its subsidiaries are currently a party, or were a party and that concluded in 2023.\n\n## Investigations and related litigations Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) Gilenya marketing practices investigation and litigation\n\nIn 2013, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NPC) received a civil investigative demand from the United States Attorney's O/ffice (USAO) for the S.D.N.Y. requesting the production of documents and information relating to marketing practices for Gilenya , including the remuneration of healthcare providers in connection therewith. In 2017, the S.D.N.Y. and New York State declined to intervene in claims raised by an individual relator in a qui tam complaint. In 2022, NPC's motion to dismiss this complaint was granted, which was appealed. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Lucentis/Avastin \u00ae matters\n\nIn 2019, the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a Statement of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging anti-competitive practices on the French market for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to 2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the Novartis entities had infringed competition law by abusing a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine, again subject to recoupment, and appealed the FCA's decision. In February 2023, the Paris Court of Appeal (Court) overturned the FCA's decision which triggered the reimbursement of the originally paid fine (recorded as 'Other income' in the Company's consolidated income statement), and, in March 2023, the FCA appealed the Court's decision.\n\nNovartis is the subject of similar investigations and proceedings  involving  the  competition  authority  in Greece and is currently in an appeal process in Turkey. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all claims in both countries. Novartis is also challenging policies and regulations allowing o/ff-label/unlicensed use and reimbursement for economic reasons in Turkey.\n\n## Greece investigation\n\nThe Greek authorities are investigating legacy allegations of potentially inappropriate economic benefits to healthcare providers (HCPs), government o/fficials and others in Greece. These authorities include the Greek Coordinating Body for Inspection and Control, and the Greek Body of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), from which the Company received a summons in 2018 and 2020. Novartis has cooperated in these investigations. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine equivalent to approximately USD 1.2 million; Novartis Hellas appealed the fine and, in September 2023, the Court overturned the decision and fine. The Greek State filed an appeal.  In 2022, the Greek State served a civil lawsuit on Novartis Hellas, seeking approximately USD 225 million for moral damages allegedly arising from the conduct that was the subject of the Company's 2020\n\nsettlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding allegations of inappropriate economic benefits in Greece that was disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report and the 2020 Form 20-F. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## 340B Drug Pricing Program investigations\n\nIn 2021, NPC received a notification from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) which stated that HRSA believes NPC's contract pharmacy policy violates the 340B statute, and threatened potential enforcement action. NPC subsequently sued HRSA in the U.S. District Court (USDC) for the District of Columbia to challenge HRSA's determination and to enjoin HRSA from taking action with respect to NPC's contract pharmacy policy. HRSA then referred the matter regarding NPC's contract pharmacy policy to the O/ffice of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which could result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties on NPC. The USDC issued a decision rejecting HRSA's interpretation of the 340B statute, vacating the violation notification and remanding the matter to HRSA. HRSA appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit heard argument on the case in 2022. In addition, in 2021 and 2023, two medical centers filed Administrative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceedings against NPC, seeking the return of alleged overcharges resulting from NPC's contract pharmacy policy. NPC has moved to dismiss these proceedings pending resolution of the HRSA litigation. Also in 2021, NPC received a civil investigative subpoena from the O/ffice of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont (Vermont AG) requesting the production of documents and information concerning NPC's participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program in Vermont. NPC responded by providing documents and information to the Vermont AG.\n\n## Swiss and EU investigation\n\nIn September 2022, the Swiss Competition Commission (COMCO) initiated an investigation of the acquisition of certain patents by Novartis from Genentech in April 2020 and their subsequent enforcement against Eli Lilly and other parties, allegedly in an attempt to protect Cosentyx from  competing  products.  COMCO  is  investigating whether enforcement of the patents violates the Swiss Cartel Act. The European Commission also requested information from Novartis regarding this matter. Novartis is cooperating with the authorities and will vigorously contest any allegations.\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) litigation\n\nIn 2023, following the U.S. government's selection of Entresto for the first round of the IRA's 'Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program,' NPC filed a complaint in the USDC for the District of New Jersey on the grounds that those drug price-setting provisions are unconstitutional under the First, Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n## Product liability litigation\n\n## Tasigna\n\nNPC is a defendant in more than 400 US product liability actions involving Tasigna , alleging that the product",

State court actions are pending in a multicounty litigation in Bergen County, New Jersey, and federal cases are pending in a multidistrict litigation in the Middle District of Florida. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Other matters\n\n## Shareholder derivative lawsuit\n\nIn 2021, NPC, Sandoz Inc., Novartis Capital Corporation and certain present and former directors and o/fficers of Novartis were named as defendants, and Novartis was named as a nominal defendant, in a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in New York State Court. The plainti/ffs, derivatively as purported Novartis shareholders on behalf of Novartis, seek damages and other remedies based on alleged conduct by the corporate and individual defendants. In 2022, the court granted Novartis motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which the plainti/ffs have appealed.\n\n## Concluded legal matters Exforge - Concluded matter\n\nSince 2018, Novartis companies as well as other pharmaceutical companies were sued by various direct and indirect purchasers of Exforge in multiple US individual and putative class action complaints. They claimed that Novartis made a reverse payment in the form of an agreement not to launch an authorized generic, alleging violations of federal antitrust law and state antitrust, consumer protection and common laws, and sought damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases were consolidated in the S.D.N.Y. In 2022, Novartis agreed to pay USD 245 million to resolve these cases, and this resolution was completed in 2023.\n\n## Lucentis/Avastin \u00ae (Italian and Belgian Competition Authorities) - Concluded matter\n\nIn connection with an investigation into whether Novartis entities, F. Ho/ffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech Inc. and Roche S.p.A. colluded to artificially preserve the market positions of Avastin \u00ae and Lucentis , in 2014 the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) imposed a fine equivalent to USD 125 million on the Novartis entities. Novartis paid the fine, subject to the right to later claim recoupment, and appealed the decision.  In 2023, the final appeal by Novartis was denied, and the ICA decision is now final. In 2014 and 2015, following the ICA's fine, the Italian Ministry of Health and the Lombardia region sent letters with payment requests for a total equivalent of approximately USD 1.3 billion in damages from Novartis and Roche entities based on these allegations, and several additional Italian regions and hospitals subsequently sent letters in 2019 claiming damages for an aggregate amount of approximately USD 330 million. None of these claims have been asserted in legal proceedings. A similar matter involving the competition authority in Belgium is concluded.\n\n## South Korea investigation - Concluded matter\n\nIn 2016, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation into, among other things, allegations that Novartis Korea utilized medical journals to\n\nprovide inappropriate economic benefits to HCPs. This resulted in a non-material fine, which the prosecutor appealed. In 2021, the appellate court upheld the fine, and the prosecutor appealed that decision. In 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## U.S. Government Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations - Concluded matter\n\nAs previously disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report, Novartis reached settlements with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that resolved all FCPA investigations into historical conduct by Novartis and its subsidiaries. To resolve the DOJ investigation, Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I. entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ. To resolve the SEC investigation, Novartis AG reached an agreement that resulted in an Order issued by the SEC. The DPA and the Order each contained certain reporting and compliance obligations for a threeyear term, which ended on June 26, 2023. On December 21, 2023 the court formally dismissed the Information filed against Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I at the request of the DOJ. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## Summary of product liability, governmental investigations and other legal matters provision movements\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                                         | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| January 1                                                                                                              | 702    | 397    | 487    |\n| Provisions related to   discontinued operations  1                                                                     | - 97   |        |        |\n| Impact of acquisitions of businesses                                                                                   |        | 4      |        |\n| Cash payments  2                                                                                                       | - 448  | - 105  | - 292  |\n| Releases of provisions  3                                                                                              | - 219  | - 52   | - 44   |\n| Additions to provisions  4                                                                                             | 170    | 466    | 251    |\n| Currency translation e/ffects                                                                                          | 16     | - 8    | - 5    |\n| December 31                                                                                                            | 124    | 702    | 397    |\n| Less current portion                                                                                                   | - 42   | - 548  | - 56   |\n| Non-current product   liabilities, governmental   investigations and other   legal matters provisions   at December 31 | 82     | 154    | 341    |\n\n- 4 Additions to provisions charged to the consolidated income statement from continuing operations were USD 435 million in 2022, and USD 190 million in 2021.\n\nNovartis believes that its total provisions for investigations, product liability, arbitration and other legal matters are adequate based upon currently available information.

In 2021, net assets recognized as a result of acquisitions of businesses from continuing operations were USD 320 million.\n\nNote 2 details significant acquisitions of businesses by continuing operations, specifically the acquisition of DTx Pharma and Chinook Therapeutics in 2023, and of Gyroscope in 2022. Note 31 details significant acquisitions by discontinued operations, specifically the cephalosporin antibiotics business from GSK by Sandoz in 2021. The\n\ngoodwill arising out of these acquisitions is attributable to the synergies, the accounting for deferred tax liabilities on the acquired assets and the assembled workforce. In 2023, no goodwill (2022: nil; 2021: USD 107 million) is tax deductible.\n\n## 26. Post-employment benefits for employees\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nIn addition to the legally required social security schemes, the Company has numerous independent pension and other post-employment benefit plans. In most cases, these plans are externally funded in entities that are legally separate from the Company. For certain Company entities, however, no independent plan assets exist for the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations  of  employees.  In  these  cases,  the  related unfunded liability is included in the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations (DBOs) of all major pension and other post-employment benefit plans are reappraised annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are recognized at fair value.\n\nThe major plans are based in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, which represent 96% of the Company's total DBO for pension\n\nplans. Details of the plans in the two most significant countries, Switzerland and the United States, which represent 84% of the Company's total DBO for post-employment benefit plans, are provided below.\n\nSwiss-based pension plans represent the most significant portion of the Company's total DBO and plan assets. For the active insured members the benefits are linked to contributions paid into the plan, interest credits granted and conversion rates applied.\n\nAll benefits granted under Swiss-based pension plans are vested, and Swiss legislation prescribes that the employer has to contribute a fixed percentage of an employee's pay to an external pension fund. Additional employer contributions may be required whenever the plan's statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. The employee also contributes to the plan. The pension plans are run by separate legal entities, each governed by a board of trustees that - for the principal plans - consists of representatives nominated by Novartis and the",

        "page_content": "active insured employees. The boards of trustees are responsible for the plan design and asset investment strategy.\n\nThe United States pension plans represent the second-largest component of the Company's total DBO and plan assets. The principal plans (Qualified Plans) are funded, whereas plans providing additional benefits for executives (Restoration Plans) are unfunded. Employer contributions are required for Qualified Plans whenever the statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level.\n\nFurthermore, in certain countries, employees are covered under other post-employment benefit plans and post-retirement medical plans.\n\nIn the US, other post-employment benefit plans consist primarily of post-employment healthcare benefits, which have been closed to new members since 2015. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Company is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax e/fficient.\n\nThe following tables are a summary of the funded and unfunded defined benefit obligation for pension and other post-employment benefit plans of employees at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n|                                                                                              | Pension plans   | Pension plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (USD millions)                                                                               | 2023            | 2022            | 2023                                  | 2022                                  |\n| Benefit obligation at January 1                                                              | 17 533          | 23 583          | 422                                   | 560                                   |\n| Benefit obligations related to discontinued operations  1                                    | -

This can result in substantial changes in the Company's other comprehensive income, long-term liabilities and prepaid  pension assets.\n\nThe DBO is significantly impacted by assumptions regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuarially determined post-employment benefit liability. This rate is based on yields of high-quality  corporate bonds in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond yields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO increases and the funded status decreases.\n\nIn Switzerland, an increase in the DBO due to lower discount rates is slightly o/ffset by lower future benefits expected to be paid on the employee's savings account where the assumption on interest accrued often changes broadly in line with the  discount rate.\n\nThe impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan's assets is more di/fficult to predict. A significant part of the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore partially compensate for the decrease in the funded status. Furthermore, pension assets also include significant holdings of equity instruments. Share prices usually tend to rise when interest rates decrease and therefore often counteract the negative impact of the rising defined benefit  obligation  on  the  funded  status  (although  the\n\ncorrelation of interest rates with equities is not as strong as with bonds, especially in the short term).\n\nThe expected rate for pension increases significantly a/ffects the DBO of most plans in Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom. Such pension increases also decrease the funded status, although there is no strong correlation between the value of the plan assets and pension/inflation increases.\n\nAssumptions regarding life expectancy significantly impact the DBO. An increase in longevity increases the DBO. There is no o/ffsetting impact from the plan assets, as no longevity bonds or swaps are held by the pension funds. The Company's actuaries use mortality tables that take  into  account  historic  patterns  and  expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.\n\nIn 2023 the mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2020 tables with future improvements based on the Continuous Mortality Investigation ('CMI') model (2022: based on the BVG generational model). For the pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the US, the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality tables with generational improvements based on Scale MP-2021 are used.\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of the defined  benefit pension obligation to the principal actuarial assumptions for the major plans in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on an aggregated basis:\n\n| (USD millions)                                         | Change in 2023  year-end defined  benefit pension  obligation   | Change in 2022  year-end defined  benefit pension  obligation   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 25 basis point increase in discount rate               | - 528                                                           | - 466                                                           |\n| 25 basis point decrease in discount rate               | 557                                                             | 491                                                             |\n| One-year increase in life expectancy                   | 644                                                             | 535                                                             |\n| 25 basis point increase in rate of pension increase    | 366                                                             | 316                                                             |\n| 25 basis point decrease in rate of pension increase    | - 61                                                            | - 63                                                            |\n| 25 basis point increase of interest on savings account | 43                                                              | 38                                                              |\n| 25 basis point decrease of interest on savings account | - 42                                                            | - 37                                                            |\n| 25 basis point increase in rate of salary increase     | 41                                                              | 37                                                              |\n| 25 basis point decrease in rate of salary increase     | - 42                                                            | - 37                                                            |",

Real estate and alternative investments, which include hedge fund, private equity, infrastructure and commodity investments, usually have a quoted market price or a regularly updated net asset value.\n\nThe strategic allocation of assets of the di/fferent pension plans is determined with the objective of achieving an investment return that, together with the contributions paid by the Company and its employees, is su/fficient to maintain reasonable control over the various funding risks of the plans. Based upon local requirement, the market and economic environments, actual asset allocations may be permitted to deviate from policy targets. The asset allocation currently includes investments in shares of Novartis AG as per the below table:\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension obligation is 12.3 years (2022: 11.8 years).\n\nThe Company's ordinary contribution to the various pension plans is based on the rules of each plan. Additional contributions are made whenever this is required by statute or law (i.e., usually when statutory funding levels fall below predetermined thresholds). The only significant plan that requires additional funding is in Germany.\n\nThe expected future cash flows over the upcoming 10 years in respect of pension and other post-employment benefit plans at December 31, 2023, were as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                   | Pension plans   | Other post- employment benefit plans   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Company contributions            |                 |                                        |\n| 2024 (estimated)                 | 388             | 39                                     |\n| Expected future benefit payments |                 |                                        |\n| 2024                             | 1 434           | 40                                     |\n| 2025                             | 1 317           | 40                                     |\n| 2026                             | 1 186           | 40                                     |\n| 2027                             | 1 159           | 39                                     |\n| 2028                             | 1 132           | 38                                     |\n| 2029-2033                        | 5 316           | 175                                    |\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nIn many subsidiaries, employees are covered by defined contribution plans.

Equity-based participation plans for employees\n\nThe equity-based compensation expense from continuing operations related to all equity-based participation plans and the liabilities arising from equity-based payment transactions were as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                                               | 2023   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expense related to equity-based   participation plans        | 1 142  |    982 |    910 |\n| Liabilities arising from equity-based   payment transactions | 322    |    235 |    253 |\n\nEquity-based participation plans can be separated into the following plans:\n\n## Annual Incentive\n\nThe Annual Incentive for the Novartis Company CEO and other Executive Committee members (ECN) is paid 50% in cash and 50% in Novartis restricted shares (RSs) or restricted share units (RSUs). For a select portion of Novartis  management  leadership  team,  the  Annual Incentive is paid 70% in cash and 30% in RSs or RSUs. Both the ECN and a select portion of Novartis management leadership team can opt to invest up to the maximum cash portion of their Annual Incentive to receive further RSs or RSUs. Any cash is paid out during March in the year following the end of the performance period, and the shares are granted during January in the year following the end of the performance period.\n\n## Employee share savings plan\n\nNovartis operates employee share savings and purchase plans  in  certain  countries.  The  most  significant  is described below.\n\nThe Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) in Switzerland o/ffers participants to choose to receive their Annual Incentive (i) 100% in shares, (ii) 50% in shares and 50% in cash, or (iii) 100% in cash. After the expiration of a three-year holding period for Novartis shares invested  under  the  ESOP,  participants  receive  one matching share for every two invested shares. Employees eligible for the equity plan 'Select' are not eligible to receive ESOP matching shares. The Novartis Company CEO, the other Executive Committee members and a select portion of Novartis management leadership team are not eligible to participate in this plan.\n\n## Novartis Employee share purchase plan\n\nIn 2022 Novartis started to grant shares under the Employee  Share  Purchase  Plan  (ESPP).  The  ESPP enables employees to voluntarily purchase Novartis AG shares through payroll deductions at a discounted price. While the ESPP is global in scope, the first phase covers employees in North America (the US, Puerto Rico and Canada).  Other  countries  employees  will  become\n\neligible to participate in the ESPP commencing in 2024, according to a multi-year phased implementation plan. The shares are not subject to a vesting period.\n\n## Novartis equity plan 'Select'\n\nThe equity plan 'Select' is a global equity incentive plan under which eligible employees may annually be awarded a grant subject to a three-year, and for eligible employees of selected Company units a four-year, staggered vesting period. No awards are granted for performance ratings below a certain threshold. Executive Committee members and a select portion of Novartis management leadership team are not eligible to participate in the equity plan 'Select.'\n\nThe equity plan 'Select' currently allows participants employed and living in Switzerland to choose the form of their equity compensation in RSs or RSUs. In all other jurisdictions, RSs or RSUs are granted unilaterally. Until 2013, participants could also choose to receive part or the entire grant in the form of tradable share options.\n\nAll tradable share options expired on their 10 th anniversary from the grant date, which was in January 2023. Each tradable share option entitled the holder to purchase after vesting (and before the 10 th anniversary from the grant date) one Novartis share at a stated exercise price that equals the closing market price of the underlying share at the grant date. As the exercise price did not reflect the decrease in the Novartis share due to the Alcon spin, one-fifth of an Alcon share was also awarded to the option holder upon exercise.\n\n## Options under Novartis equity plan 'Select' outside North America\n\nThe following table shows the activity associated with the share options during the period. The weighted average prices in the table below are translated from Swiss francs into USD at historical rates.\n\n|                                    | 2023               | 2023                                    | 2022                 | 2022                                    |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                    | Options (millions) | Weighted average  exercise  price (USD) | Options   (millions) | Weighted average  exercise  price (USD) |\n| Options outstanding   at January 1 | 0.5                | 66.0                                    | 1.7                  | 63.6                                    |\n| Sold or exercised                  | - 0.5              | 66.0                                    | - 1.2                | 62.6                                    |\n| Outstanding at December 31         | 0.0                |                                         | 0.5                  | 66.0                                    |\n| Exercisable at December 31         | 0.0                |                                         | 0.5                  | 66.0                                    |\n\nAll share options were granted at an exercise price that was equal to the closing market price of the Company's shares at the grant date.

The weighted average share price at the dates of sale or exercise was USD 91.68.\n\n## Long-Term Performance Plan\n\nThe Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) is an equity plan for the ECN, a select portion of Novartis management leadership team and employees of Company units with specific targets.\n\nParticipants are granted a target number of performance share units (PSUs) at the beginning of every performance period, which are converted into unrestricted Novartis shares after the performance period. The actual payout depends on the achievement of the performance measures and ranges between 0% and 200% of the granted amount. PSUs granted under the LTPP do not carry voting rights, but do carry dividend equivalents that are paid in unrestricted Novartis shares at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe LTPP awards are subject to a three-year performance and vesting period. The performance criteria for the ECN are based on both Novartis internal performance metrics and variables that can be observed in the market,  which  is  the  ranking  of  the  Novartis  total\n\nshareholder return (TSR) relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year performance periods. Only ECN members, as from performance cycle 2023, are subject to the TSR performance metric under the LTPP.\n\nTSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calculated as the change in the company share price, which is translated to USD at the relevant exchange rate, including the reinvestment return of dividends, over the threeyear performance period. The calculation is based on Bloomberg standard published TSR data, which is publicly available. The position of Novartis in the peer group determines the payout range based on a payout matrix.\n\n## Other share awards\n\nSelected employees may exceptionally receive Special Share Awards of RSs or RSUs. These Special Share Awards provide an opportunity to reward outstanding achievements or exceptional performance, and aim to retain key contributors. They are based on a formal internal selection process, through which the individual performance of each candidate is thoroughly assessed at several management levels. Special Share Awards had a minimum three-year vesting period before 2021 and mainly three years thereafter. In exceptional circumstances, Special Share Awards may be awarded to attract  special  expertise  and  new  talents  to  the organization. Externally recruited ECN members are eligible only for special awards that are 'buyouts' in the case that it is to replace equity forfeited with their former employer. The equity is provided on a like-for-like basis as the forfeited equity, at the same value with the same vesting period, and with or without a performance condition.\n\nWorldwide, employees at di/fferent levels in the organization were awarded RSs and RSUs in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nIn addition, in 2023, 2022 and 2021, Board members received  unrestricted shares as part of their regular compensation.",

At the Sandoz Distribution date, all RSU and PSU holders, who were not entitled to the dividend in kind in the form of Sandoz Group AG shares received keep whole awards in Novartis AG shares to compensate for the loss of the Sandoz value from their Novartis AG shares. These keep whole awards were accounted for as a modification, which did not significantly change the fair value of the original grant. The change in fair value was measured by comparing the fair value of the grant before the spin against the fair value of the grant plus keep whole award right after spin.\n\n|                                       | 2023                         | 2023                                              | 2022                         | 2022                                              |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                       | Number of shares in millions | Weighted  average fair value at grant date in USD | Number of shares in millions | Weighted  average fair value at grant date in USD |\n| Annual Incentive                      |                              |                                                   |                              |                                                   |\n| - RSU                                 | 0.3                          | 74.2                                              | 0.2                          | 74.7                                              |\n| - Restricted shares                   | 0.1                          | 92.3                                              | 0.1                          | 85.0                                              |\n| Share savings plans                   |                              |                                                   |                              |                                                   |\n| - RSU                                 | 0.4                          | 71.3                                              | 0.4                          | 75.0                                              |\n| - Shares                              | 1.0                          | 92.3                                              | 1.2                          | 85.0                                              |\n| Novartis Employee Share Purchase Plan | 0.9                          | 96.2                                              | 0.8                          | 82.8                                              |\n| Select North America (RSU)            | 4.5                          | 73.9                                              | 4.9                          | 74.5                                              |\n| Select outside North America          |                              |                                                   |                              |                                                   |\n| - RSU                                 | 1.9                          | 73.3                                              | 2.0                          | 75.1                                              |\n| - Restricted shares                   | 0.6                          | 92.3                                              | 0.7                          | 85.0                                              |\n| Long-Term Performance Plan (PSU)      | 1.8                          | 80.6                                              | 1.7                          | 82.0                                              |\n| Other share awards                    |                              |                                                   |                              |                                                   |\n| - RSU                                 | 0.6                          | 75.9                                              | 0.5                          | 76.3                                              |\n| - Restricted shares                   |                              |                                                   | 0.1                          | 86.9                                              |\n| - Shares                              |                              |                                                   | 0.1                          | 86.1                                              |",

Transactions with related parties\n\n## Roche Holding AG\n\nNovartis has two agreements with Genentech, Inc., United States (Genentech), and one agreement with Spark Therapeutics, Inc., United States (Spark). Both companies  are   subsidiaries  of  Roche  Holding  AG (Roche), which were indirectly included in the consolidated financial statements using equity accounting until November 3, 2021, when Novartis entered into an agreement with Roche to divest its 33.3% of Roche voting shares. On December 6, 2021, Novartis divested its investment in Roche, on which date Roche ceased to be a related party (see Notes 2 and 5).\n\n## Lucentis\n\nNovartis has licensed from Genentech/Roche the exclusive rights to develop and  market Lucentis outside the United States for indications related to diseases of the eye. Novartis pays royalties on the net sales to third parties of Lucentis products outside the United States. From January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021, Lucentis sales of USD 2.0 billion were recognized by Novartis.\n\n## Xolair\n\nNovartis and Genentech/Roche are co-promoting Xolair in the United States, where Genentech/Roche records\n\n## Novartis Pension Fund\n\nIn 2018, a Company subsidiary provided an uncommitted overnight credit facility to the Novartis Pension Fund, Switzerland, for up to USD 500 million with interest at\n\nall sales. Novartis records sales  outside the United States.\n\nNovartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs outside the United States as well as co-promotion costs in the US. Genentech/Roche and Novartis share the resulting profits from sales in the United States, Europe and other countries, according to agreed profit-sharing  percentages.  From  January  1,  2021  until December 6, 2021, Novartis recognized total sales of Xolair of USD 1.3 billion, including sales to Genentech/ Roche for the United States market.\n\n## Luxturna\n\nIn 2018, Novartis entered into an exclusive licensing and commercialization agreement and a supply agreement with Spark for Luxturna outside the United States. The agreements include regulatory and sales milestones as well as royalties payable to Spark on ex-US sales. On December 17, 2019, Roche acquired Spark.\n\nThe net income for royalties, cost sharing and profit sharing arising out of the Lucentis , Xolair and Luxturna agreements with Roche totaled USD 188 million from January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021.\n\nFurthermore, Novartis has several patent license, supply and distribution agreements with Roche.\n\nthe US Federal Funds Rate. This credit facility was not utilized during the current and past years.\n\n## Executive O/fficers and Non-Executive Directors compensation\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, there were 11 Executive Committee  members ('Executive O/fficers'). During 2023, 1 Executive O/fficer stepped down.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, there were 12 Executive O/fficers. During 2021, 3 Executive O/fficers stepped down.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, there were 11 Executive O/fficers. During 2022, 5 Executive O/fficers stepped down.\n\nThe total compensation for Executive Committee members and the 14 Non-Executive Directors (15 in 2022 and 14 in 2021) using the Company's accounting policies for equity-based compensation and pension benefits was as follows:\n\n|                             |   Executive O/fficers |   Executive O/fficers |   Executive O/fficers | Non-Executive Directors   | Non-Executive Directors   | Non-Executive Directors   |   Total |   Total |   Total |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| (USD millions)              |                2023   |                2022   |                2021   | 2023                      | 2022                      | 2021                      |  2023   |  2022   |  2021   |\n| Cash and other compensation |                  18   |                  25   |                  20.3 | 4.9                       | 4.6                       | 4.7                       |    22.9 |    29.6 |    25   |\n| Post-employment benefits    |                   2.1 |                   2.8 |                   2.5 |                           |                           |                           |     2.1 |     2.8 |     2.5 |\n| Equity-based compensation   |                  62.2 |                  42.6 |                  37.3 | 5.0                       | 4.8                       | 5.2                       |    67.2 |    47.4 |    42.5 |\n| Total                       |                  82.3 |                  70.4 |                  60.1 | 9.9                       | 9.4                       | 9.9                       |    92.2 |    79.8 |    70   |\n\nDuring 2023, there was an increase in the IFRS Accounting Standards compensation expense for Executive O/fficers compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher\n\nequity-based compensation, mainly due to higher realized and expected payouts on the achievement of the defined performance criteria, partly o/ffset by lower cash",

This amount was fixed in 1998 upon his departure from the Board in 1999. The last payment under this arrangement was in 2021.\n\n## 29. Commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Research and development commitments\n\nThe Company has entered into long-term research and development agreements with various institutions related to intangible assets. These agreements provide for potential milestone payments by Novartis, which are dependent on successful clinical development, or meeting specified sales targets, or other conditions that are specified in the agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the amount and estimated timing of the Company's commitments to make payments under those agreements, which are shown without risk adjustment and on an undiscounted basis, were as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)   | 2023   |\n|------------------|--------|\n| 2024             | 202    |\n| 2025             | 269    |\n| 2026             | 493    |\n| 2027             | 316    |\n| 2028             | 597    |\n| Thereafter       | 4 206  |\n| Total            | 6 083  |\n\n## Commitments for capital calls\n\nThe Company holds investments in funds in which it has committed to invest further upon future capital calls. As at December 31, 2023, the total uncalled capital commitments  for  the  Company's  investments  in  funds amounts to USD 80 million. Note 30 contains further information on the Company's investments in funds.\n\n## Other commitments\n\nThe Company has entered into various purchase commitments for services and materials as well as for equipment in the ordinary course of business. These commitments are  generally entered into at  current market prices and reflect  normal business operations. For the disclosure of property, plant and equipment purchase commitments, see Note 10. The Company routinely acquires businesses and interests in intellectual property focused on key disease areas and indications that the Company expects to be growth drivers in the future. The Company has commitments through to the date the consolidated financial statements were approved for publication (see Note 32), totaling USD 3.8 billion (of which USD 3.4 billion may become payable in 2024) related to the acquisition of businesses and interests in intellectual property, the majority of which is subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent in the arrangements.\n\n## Guarantees issued\n\nThe Company has issued guarantees to third parties in the ordinary course of business, mostly for tax, customs or other governmental agencies.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nNovartis companies have to observe the laws, government orders and regulations of the country in which they operate.\n\nA number of Novartis companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time, including",

        "page_content": "proceedings pertaining to: pricing; bribery and corruption; trade regulation and embargo legislation; product liability; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful discharge; antitrust and competition; securities; government benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; healthcare fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider trading;  occupational  health  and  safety;  environmental regulations; tax; cyber and data security; use of technologies, including AI; data privacy; regulatory interactions; disclosure compliance; and intellectual property. As a result, the Company may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and that could a/ffect our business, financial position and reputation. While Novartis does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse e/ffect on its financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments sometimes occur. Consequently, we may in the future incur judgments that could involve large payments, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly, and other penalties, including treble damages, any of which could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations or cash flow.\n\nGovernments and regulatory authorities around the world have been stepping up their compliance and law enforcement activities in recent years in key areas, including marketing practices, pricing, corruption, trade restrictions, embargo legislation, insider trading, antitrust, cyber security and data privacy. Furthermore, when a government or regulatory authority undertakes an investigation, it is not uncommon for other governments or regulators to undertake investigations regarding the same or similar matters. Responding to such investigations is costly and requires an increasing amount of management's time and attention. In addition, such investigations  may  a/ffect  our  reputation,  create  a  risk  of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the United States and other countries, and lead to (or arise from) litigation. These factors have contributed to decisions by Novartis and other  co mpanies in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest, to enter into settlement agreements with governmental authorities around the world prior to any formal decision by the authorities or a court. These government settlements have involved and may in the future involve large\n\ncash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, settlements of government healthcare fraud cases and antitrust cases often require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for a period of years. Our a/ffiliate Novartis Corporation is party to such an agreement, which will expire in 2025. In addition, matters underlying governmental investigations and settlements may be the subject of separate private litigation.\n\nWhile provisions have been made for probable outflows of economic resources, which management deems to be  reasonable or appropriate, there are uncertainties connected with these  estimates.\n\nNote 21 contains additional information on these matters.\n\nA number of Novartis companies are involved in legal proceedings concerning intellectual property rights. The inherent unpredictability of such proceedings means that there can be no assurances as to their ultimate outcome. A negative result in any such proceeding could potentially adversely a/ffect the ability of certain Novartis companies to sell their products, or require the payment of substantial damages or royalties. The timing and the outcome of legal proceedings and their potential financial e/ffect are not predictable.\n\nIn the opinion of management, however, the outcome of these actions will not materially a/ffect the Company's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flow in a given period.\n\nThe Company's potential environmental remediation liability is assessed based on a risk assessment and investigation of the various sites identified by the Company as at risk for environmental remediation exposure. The Company's future remediation expenses are a/ffected by  a  number  of  uncertainties.  These  uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of material attributable to the Company at the remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.\n\nNote 21 contains additional information on environmental liabilities.",

There are three hierarchical levels, based on increasing  subjectivity associated with the inputs to derive fair valuation for these assets and liabilities, which are as follows:\n\nThe assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equity and debt securities as well as fund investments listed in active markets.\n\nThe assets generally included in Level 2 fair value hierarchy are derivatives, and certain debt securities. The liabilities generally included in this fair value hierarchy consist of derivatives. These are valued using corroborated market data.\n\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. The assets generally included in Level 3 fair value hierarchy are various investments in funds and unquoted equity security investments. Contingent consideration and other financial liabilities carried at fair value are included in this category.\n\n|                                                                                | 2023    | 2023    | 2023    | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| (USD millions)                                                                 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  |\n| Financial assets                                                               |         |         |         |        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                      |         |         |         |        |\n| Debt securities  1                                                             | 50      |         |         | 50     |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents at fair value                                  | 50      |         |         | 50     |\n| Marketable securities                                                          |         |         |         |        |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                               |         | 355     |         | 355    |\n| Total marketable securities and derivative financial instruments at fair value |         | 355     |         | 355    |\n| Fund investments and equity securities current                                 | 94      |         | 31      | 125    |\n| Current contingent consideration receivables                                   |         |         | 65      | 65     |\n| Long-term financial investments                                                |         |         |         |        |\n| Debt and equity securities                                                     | 796     | 20      | 616     | 1 432  |\n| Fund investments                                                               | 7       |         | 183     | 190    |\n| Non-current contingent consideration receivables                               |         |         | 553     | 553    |\n| Total long-term financial investments at fair value                            | 803     | 20      | 1 352   | 2 175  |\n| Associated companies at fair value through profit and loss                     |         |         | 101     | 101    |\n| Financial liabilities                                                          |         |         |         |        |\n| Current contingent consideration liabilities                                   |         |         | - 14    | - 14   |\n| Other financial liabilities current                                            |         |         | - 88    | - 88   |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                               |         | - 91    |         | - 91   |\n| Total current financial liabilities at fair values                             |         | - 91    | - 102   | - 193  |\n| Non-current contingent consideration liabilities                               |         |         | - 389   | - 389  |\n| Total non-current financial liabilities at fair value                          |         |         | - 389   | - 389  |\n\n- 1 Includes short-term highly rated government-backed debt securities, with an original maturity of three months or less",

Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled through the consolidated income statement but are instead reclassified to retained earnings.\n\nDuring the year, the net loss and net gain recorded on associated companies, fund investments and longterm financial investments at fair value through profit and loss were USD 145 million and USD 39 million, respectively.\n\nTo  determine  the  fair  value  of  a  contingent consideration, various unobservable inputs are used. A change in these inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The inputs used are, among others, the probability of success, sales forecast and assumptions regarding the discount rate and timing and di/fferent scenarios of triggering events. The inputs are  interrelated. The significance and usage of these inputs to each contingent consideration may vary due to di/fferences in the timing and triggering events for payments or in the nature of the asset related to the contingent consideration.\n\nIf the most significant parameters for the Level 3 input were to change by 10% positively or negatively, or where the probability of success (POS) is the most significant input parameter 10% were added or deducted from the applied  probability  of  success,  for  contingent\n\nconsideration payables and contingent consideration receivables, this would change the amounts recorded in the 2023 consolidated income statement by USD 57 million and USD 53 million, respectively.\n\n## Equity securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nEquity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. Except for the investment in Sandoz Group AG with a fair value of USD 595 million as at December 31, 2023, these are made up of individually non-significant investments. As at December 31, 2023, the Company holds 61 non-listed equity securities (December 31, 2022: 65) and 28 listed equity securities (December 31, 2022: 46) in this category with the following fair values:\n\n| (USD millions)               | 2023   |   2022 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Listed equity securities     | 861    |    438 |\n| Non-listed equity securities | 349    |    390 |\n| Total equity securities      | 1 210  |    828 |\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, dividends received from these equity securities were insignificant. In 2023, equity securities that were no longer considered strategic, with a fair value of USD 279 million (2022: USD 4 million), were sold, and the USD 1 million gain on disposal (2022: USD 4 million loss) was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings (see Note 9).",

        "page_content": "## Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk in general comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, such as commodity and equity prices. Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of the investments. The Company actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures. It is the Company's policy and practice to enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the volatility of these exposures. It does not enter into any financial transactions containing a risk that cannot be quantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In addition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or does not know it will have, in the future. The Company only sells existing assets or enters into transactions and future transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges) that it confidently expects it will have in the future, based on past experience.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n\nThe Company uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant e/ffect on both the Company's results of operations, including reported sales and earnings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly a/ffect the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\n\nBecause our expenditures in Swiss francs are significantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, volatility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nThere is also a risk that certain countries could experience a devaluation of their currency. If this occurs, it could impact the e/ffective prices we would be able to charge for our products and also have an adverse impact on both our consolidated income statement and balance sheet.\n\nSubsidiaries whose functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the past three years apply the principles of IAS 29 'Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.' The hyperinflationary economies in which Novartis operates are Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey. Venezuela and Argentina were hyperinflationary for all periods presented, and Turkey became hyperinflationary e/ffective May 1, 2022, requiring retroactive implementation of hyperinflation accounting as of January 1, 2022. The impacts of applying IAS 29 are recorded in 'Other financial income and expense' and are presented in Note 6.\n\nThe Company manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various contracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign currency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets,\n\ncommitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also uses forward contracts and may enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge.\n\nNet investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries are long-term investments. Their fair value changes through movements of foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has designated a certain portion of its long-term euro-denominated straight bonds, maturing in 2028, as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain of these net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. As of December 31, 2023, long-term financial debt with a carrying amount of EUR 1.8 billion (USD 2.0 billion; December 31, 2022: USD 2.0 billion), has been designated as a hedge instrument. During 2023, USD 50 million of net of taxes unrealized losses (2022: USD 91 million income) was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation e/ffects in relation with this net investment hedge. The hedge remained e/ffective since inception, and no amount was recognized in the consolidated income statement in 2022 and 2021. In 2023, USD 8 million of accumulated net investment hedge reserve was recognized in the consolidated income statement at the time of the Sandoz spin o/ff.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Company has only a very limited exposure to price risk related to anticipated purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Company's businesses. A change in those prices may alter the gross margin of a specific business, but generally by not more than 10% of the margin and thus below the Company's risk management tolerance levels. Accordingly, the Company does not enter into significant commodity futures, forward or option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company addresses its net exposure to interest rate risk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial debt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges  periodic   payments  based  on  a  notional amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nThe Company may purchase equities as investments of its liquid funds. As a policy, it limits its holdings in an unrelated company to less than 5% of its liquid funds. Potential investments are thoroughly analyzed. Call options are written on equities that the Company owns, and put options are written on equities that the Company wants to buy and for which cash is available.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk, the Company periodically assesses country and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit limits, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where appropriate (for example payment guarantees, credit insurance and factoring).",

        "page_content": "The provisions for expected credit losses for customers are based on a forward-looking expected credit loss, which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivables.\n\nIn measuring the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics (such as private versus public receivables) and days past due. In determining the expected credit loss rates, the Company considers current and forward-looking macroeconomic factors that may a/ffect the ability of customers to settle the receivables, and historical loss rates for each category of customers.\n\nThe Company's largest customer accounted for approximately 15% of net sales to third parties, and the second largest and third largest customers accounted for 13% and 8% of net sales to third parties, respectively (2022: 16%, 12% and 8%, respectively; 2021: 14%, 13% and 7%, respectively).\n\nThe highest amounts of trade receivables outstanding were for these same three customers and amounted to 17%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of the Company's trade receivables as at December 31, 2023 (2022: 16%, 14% and 7%, respectively). There is no other significant concentration of customer credit risk.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities and money market instruments; credit risk on cash, time deposits and derivatives; as well as settlement risk for di/fferent instruments. Issuer risk is reduced by only buying securities that are at least A- rated. Counterparty credit risk and settlement risk are reduced by a policy of entering into transactions with counterparties (banks or financial institutions) that feature a strong credit rating. Exposure to these risks is closely monitored and kept within predetermined parameters. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis, including financial statement and capital adequacy ratio reviews. In addition, reverse repurchasing agreements are contracted, and Novartis has entered into credit support agreements with various banks for derivative transactions. To further reduce the settlement risk, the Company has implemented a multi-currency payment system, Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), which provides multilateral\n\nnetting (payment-versus-payment settlement) of cash flows from foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions, the three largest of which hold approximately 8.3%, 7.5% and 7.4%, respectively (2022: 13.2%, 9.2% and 6.8%, respectively).\n\nThe Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties and does not have any significant grouping of exposures to financial sector or country risk.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company could not be able to settle or meet its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Treasury is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management. In addition, liquidity and funding risks, and related processes and policies, are overseen by management. Novartis manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis according to business needs and tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, through numerous sources of financing in order to maintain flexibility.\n\nCertain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.\n\nManagement monitors the Company's net debt or liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.\n\nNovartis has two US commercial paper programs under which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate  of  unsecured  commercial  paper  notes. Novartis also has one Japanese commercial paper program under which it can issue up to JPY 150 billion (approximately USD 1.1 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes. Commercial paper notes totaling USD 3.3 billion under these three programs were outstanding as per December 31, 2023 (2022: USD 2.8 billion). Novartis further has a committed credit facility of USD 6.0 billion. This credit facility is provided by a syndicate of banks and is intended to be used as a backstop for the US commercial paper programs. The facility matures in September 2025 and was undrawn as at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.",

In managing its capital, Novartis focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet. As at December 31, 2023, Moody's Investors Service rated the Company A1 for long-term maturities and P-1 for short-term maturities, and S&P Global Ratings rated the Company AA- for long-term maturities and A-1+ for short-term maturities.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Company uses sensitivity analysis disclosures to provide quantitative information about market risks to which it is exposed.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis disclosures are in line with the Company's financial risk management policy, and are based on a one-parameter risk model that considers a one-factor linear relationship between risk factors and exposures. They consider aggregated risk exposures arising from the most significant risk factors (currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk) and include",

The range of variables chosen reflects management's view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity\n\nThe Company uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies, as well as in the Swiss franc. A strengthening (weakening) of the US dollar against these currencies as at December 31, 2023 and 2022 would have a/ffected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in these foreign currencies. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  foreign  currency exchange  rates  against  the  US  dollar  would  have impacted the Company's consolidated income statement as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 5% increase in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | 3      | - 6    |\n| 5% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | - 3    | 7      |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company designated EUR 1.8 billion (December 31, 2022: EUR 1.8 billion) of its longterm euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase, or decrease, in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar, without considering the translation e/ffect of these net investments, would have impacted the Company's consolidated equity as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 5% increase in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | 97     | 93     |\n| 5% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | - 102  | - 98   |\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nOur portfolio of fixed-income instruments as at December 31, 2023, was mainly composed of time deposits and debt securities.\n\nNovartis uses duration models to approximate the possible change in the value of fixed-income instruments. Based on these models, management believes that a 100-basis point change in interest is deemed a reasonable possible change over a one-year period.\n\nBased on exposures in 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical 100-basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would  not  have  resulted  in  a  significant  increase (decrease) in the fair values of the fixed-income instruments nor in a significant increase (decrease) of cash flows attributable to such instruments.\n\nThe vast majority of our outstanding financial debts are straight bonds with fixed interest rates and are therefore not a/ffected by movements in interest rates.\n\n## Equity price sensitivity\n\nFund investments and equity securities held by the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss. Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss.\n\nThe fair value of these fund investments and equity securities was USD 1.8 billion as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: USD 1.6 billion). The fair values of these investments are impacted by the volatility of the stock market, valuation parameters applied (for nonlisted equities) and changes in general economic factors. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Company's consolidated income statement as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 15% increase in equity prices | 91     | 109    |\n| 15% decrease in equity prices | - 91   | - 109  |\n\nA hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Company's consolidated equity as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 15% increase in equity prices | 182    | 124    |\n| 15% decrease in equity prices | - 182  | - 124  |",

The amount consisted of a payment of USD 351 million, including purchase price adjustments, and the fair value of contingent consideration of USD 64 million, which GSK is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 308 million, consisting of USD 292 million intangible assets and USD 16 million deferred tax assets.

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as those of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n- \u00b7  Assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio intangible asset\n- \u00b7 Provisions for deductions from revenue related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs\n- \u00b7  Valuation of the dividend in kind distribution liability to e/ffect the spin-o/ff of Sandoz Group AG\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the\n\nconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio intangible asset\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company determined the recoverable amount of the intangible assets other than goodwill based on the fair value less costs of disposal method for which no directly observable market inputs were available. As discussed in Note 12, the Company has intangible assets other than goodwill totaling USD 26 879 million as of December 31, 2023, of which USD 6.8 billion related to the currently marketed product Leqvio .\n\nWe identified the assessment of the recoverable amount, specifically the sales forecasts, of the Leqvio intangible asset, as a key audit matter. Significant auditor judgment and specialist skills and knowledge were required to assess the sales forecasts assumptions due to the high degree of subjectivity and estimation uncertainty involved. These sales forecasts assumptions were a significant input in the determination of the recoverable amount of the Leqvio intangible asset.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the design and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of a certain internal control related to the Company's intangible asset impairment process for Leqvio , including the development of the sales forecasts;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the reasonableness of management's sales forecasts for Leqvio by (1) comparing the sales forecasts assumptions to company-specific operational information and management's communications to the Board of Directors, (2) comparing the most recent sales performance to previous drug launches, and (3) comparing the sales forecasts assumptions to available external market and industry data;\n- \u00b7  We involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of certain inputs to the sales forecasts (in particular, the epidemiological inputs); and\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's ability to accurately forecast sales by comparing historical sales forecasts for Leqvio to actual results.\n\nFor further information on the assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio intangible asset refer to the following:\n\nPage F-6 (Note 1 Accounting policies), Page F-16 (Note 4 Revenues and geographic information) and Page F-29 (Note 12 Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill).",

        "page_content": "## Provisions for deductions from revenue related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records provisions for estimated rebates as a deduction from revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Rebates involve the use of assumptions and judgements in the determination of the provision rates at the time revenues are recorded. Provision rates are influenced by the terms and conditions in the individual agreements, historical experience, product sales and growth rate, population growth, product pricing, the mix of contracts and products, the level of inventory in the distribution channel, regulations, contracts, and channels and payers. As discussed in Note 23, provisions for deductions from revenue totaled USD 6 315 million as of December 31, 2023, a significant portion of which related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs (hereafter 'US rebates'). We identified the evaluation of the US rebates provisions as a key audit matter. The evaluation of the rebate provision rates required a high degree of subjective auditor judgment as it involved estimating the portion of the Company's consolidated revenue which will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe following are the primary audit procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the design and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's US rebates process related to the development of the rebate provision rates;\n- \u00b7  We developed our own independent expectation of the US rebates provisions, by using internal and external information, including historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid, and comparing it to management's actual recorded balances; and\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's ability to accurately estimate the  US  rebates  provisions  by  comparing  historically recorded provisions to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.\n\nFor further information on provisions for deductions from revenue related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs refer to the following:\n\nPage F-6 (Note 1 Accounting policies), Page F-16 (Note 4 Revenue and geographic information), Page F-34 (Note 16 Trade receivables) and Page F-43 (Note 23 Provisions and other current liabilities).\n\n## Valuation of the dividend in kind distribution liability to e/ffect the spin-o/ff of Sandoz Group AG\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the dividend-in-kind to e/ffect the spin-o/ff of Sandoz Group AG (the Sandoz business) required the Company to recognize a distribution liability representing the fair value of the Sandoz business distributed of USD 13 962 million. The Company measured the distribution liability at the fair value of the Sandoz business net assets as a whole. Fair value was measured using the opening share price of\n\nSandoz Group AG on the first day of trading its shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange and an estimated control premium.\n\nWe identified the valuation of the dividend-in-kind distribution liability, specifically the determination of a reasonable control premium, as a key audit matter. Significant auditor judgment and specialist skills and knowledge were required to assess the control premium, which was sensitive to variation, such that minor changes in the assumption can cause significant changes in the valuation of the dividend-in-kind distribution liability and therefore on the resulting gain on distribution.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the design and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's valuation of the dividend-in-kind distribution liability, including controls relating to selecting the control premium estimate; and\n- \u00b7 We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in developing an independent control premium range by utilizing the premiums paid in historic transactions to acquire controlling interests in comparable companies.\n\nFor further information on the assessment of the valuation of the dividend in kind distribution liability refer to the following: Page F-6 (Note 1 Accounting policies) and Page F-14 (Note 2 Significant transactions).\n\n## Other Information in the Annual Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the Annual Report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the standalone financial statements of the company, the compensation report and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the Annual Report and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the Annual Report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors, primarily through the Audit and Compliance Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors and the Audit and Compliance Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn accordance with Art. 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.\n\nKPMG AG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRichard Broadbelt Licensed Audit Expert Auditor in charge\n\nBasel, January 30, 2024\n\nHeidi Broom-Hirst",

Introduction\n\nThe financial statements of Novartis AG, with its registered o/ffice in Basel, comply with the requirements of the Swiss accounting legislation of the Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO).\n\nNovartis AG is presenting consolidated financial statements according to IFRS Accounting Standards. Novartis  AG  has  therefore  applied  the  exemption included in article 961d, paragraph 1 SCO, and has not prepared additional disclosures, a separate cash flow statement and a management report for SCO purposes.\n\n## Declaration of full time equivalents (FTE) employees\n\nNovartis AG does not have employees.\n\n## Significant transactions in 2023\n\nThe Novartis AG shareholders approved the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held on September 15, 2023, subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent to the Distribution.\n\n## 2. Accounting policies\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nCurrent assets and current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted at year-end exchange rates. Realized exchange gains and losses, and all unreali zed exchange losses arising from these as well as those from business transactions, are recorded net as financial income or financial expenses.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. These instruments are valued at fair value. When di/fferent accounting policies apply for the hedged item and the derivative financial instrument, hedge  accounting is applied through measuring the hedged item together with the derivative financial instrument.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are valued at acquisition cost less adjustments for foreign currency losses and any other impairment of value.\n\nThe conditions precedent to the spin-o/ff were met, and on October 3, 2023, the spin-o/ff of the Sandoz business was e/ffected by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG shareholders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders ('the Distribution').\n\nThrough the Distribution each Novartis AG shareholder received 1 Sandoz Group AG share for every 5 Novartis AG shares and each Novartis ADR holder received 1 Sandoz ADR for every 5 Novartis ADR that they held on October 3, 2023, close of business.\n\nAs of October 4, 2023, the shares of Sandoz Group AG have been listed on the Swiss Exchange (SIX) under the stock symbol 'SDZ'.\n\nAt the date of the Distribution, the book value of Sandoz Group AG was CHF 4 769 million and consisted of investments in direct and indirect Sandoz subsidiaries (CHF 2 781 million) and cash (CHF 1 988 million). The Distribution was made at the book value of Sandoz Group AG and was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings (CHF 4 769 million).\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are initially recognized at cost. Investments in  Novartis  AG  direct  and  indirect  subsidiaries  are assessed annually and, in case of an impairment, adjusted to their recoverable amount within their category.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is capitalized and amortized over a period of 20 years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. If necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\n## Bonds\n\nBonds are valued at nominal value. Any bond premium is accrued over the duration of the bond so that at maturity, the balance sheet amount will equal the amount that is due to be paid.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are made to cover general business risks of Novartis AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Other income\n\nThe French Competition Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into Lucentis against several Novartis subsidiaries. In 2020, Novartis AG was jointly held liable for a fine of EUR 308 million. As Lucentis is commercialized by Novartis subsidiaries, rather than by Novartis AG itself, Novartis AG was fully reimbursed by the operational subsidiary. In 2023, this decision was reformed and the fine of EUR 308 million (CHF 308 million) was reimbursed to Novartis AG. As a result, Novartis AG reimbursed the full amount to the operational subsidiary. These amounts are shown net in the income statement.\n\n## 4.

Investments in direct and indirect subsidiaries\n\nThe principal direct and indirect subsidiaries and other  holdings of Novartis AG are shown in Note 33 to Novartis AG consolidated financial statements prepared according to IFRS Accounting Standards.\n\nIn 2023, various participations in Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Sandoz-related participations, were distributed by subsidiaries to Novartis AG, which in turn contributed these subsidiaries to Sandoz Group AG. The participation in Sandoz Group AG was distributed as a dividend in kind to the Novartis AG shareholders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders on October 3, 2023.

Treasury share purchases during 2023 totaled 89.1 million (2022: 127.7 million), with an average purchase price of CHF 86 (2022: CHF 82). No treasury shares were sold during 2023 and 2022. Share-based compensation transactions totaled 11.1 million shares (2022: 9.7 million shares).\n\nThe number of treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries meet the definitions and requirements of article 659b SCO. As at December 31, 2023, treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its direct and indirect fully-owned subsidiaries totaled 231 704 523. It should be noted that within the Novartis AG consolidated financial statements prepared according to IFRS Accounting Standards, some Novartis entities are included in the consolidation scope. These Novartis entities are mainly foundations, which as at December 31, 2022 did not qualify as subsidiaries in the sense of article 659b SCO.\n\nWith e/ffective date of January 1, 2023, article 659b SCO was amended to change the definition of subsidiaries to include foundations of Novartis. This change was implemented as at January 1, 2023, and increased the Novartis AG reported number of treasury shares held by subsidiaries by 96 969 226 shares, to reflect the Novartis AG shares held by Novartis foundations.\n\nAs of the entry into force of the revised Swiss corporate law on January 1, 2023, Novartis ordinary shares held by Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis no longer carry the right to vote and are therefore included as treasury shares for determining compliance with the legal requirements for legal reserves under articles 659 et. seq. for the treasury shares.\n\nFor more information related to the amendment to SCO article 659b (see Note 12).\n\n## 12.

        "page_content": "## Statutory Auditor's Report\n\nto the General Meeting of Novartis AG, Basel\n\n## Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Novartis AG (the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as at December 31, 2023, and the income statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements (A-1 to A-10) comply with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.\n\n## Other Information in the Annual Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the Annual Report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements of the Company, the  compensation  report  and  our  auditor's  reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Financial\n\nStatements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates, the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",

        "page_content": "As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings and reserves of Novartis AG complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.\n\nKPMG AG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRichard Broadbelt Licensed Audit expert Auditor in Charge\n\nBasel, January 30, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorman Dittes\n\nLicensed Audit Expert",
